Waters now appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erred in rejecting his request for a two-level reduction of his offense level for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) because he chose to stand trial rather than plead guilty. He also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. Waters asserts that the district court erred by finding that he was not entitled to the reduction as a matter of law because he did not plead guilty and chose to go to trial. Further, he submits that the district court erroneously determined that his trial testimony was unbelievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines <em>de novo </em>and the court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Jordi, </em>418 F.3d 1212, 1214 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cIf [a] defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\u201d the court may reduce his offense level by two. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a). \u201cThe sentencing judge is in a unique position to evaluate a defendant\u2019s acceptance of responsibility,\u201d and thus \u201cthe determination of the sentencing judge is entitled to great deference on review.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.5). \u201cBecause demonstration of whether or not the defendant has personally accepted responsibility for his criminal conduct requires a consideration of both objective factors and subjective considerations of the defendant\u2019s demeanor and sincerity, the district court\u2019s determination will not be overturned unless it is without foundation.\u201d <em>United States v. Castillo-Valencia, </em>917 F.2d 494, 500 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b577-11\">In determining whether a defendant qualifies for an offense level reduction under \u00a7 3El.l(a), the district court may consider whether the defendant \u201ctruthfully admitt[ed] the conduct comprising the offense(s) of conviction, and truthfully admitted] or not falsely denying any additional relevant conduct for which the defendant is accountable under [U.S.S.G.] \u00a7 IB 1.3 (Relevant Conduct).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment, (n.l(a)). \u201c[A] defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The reduction \u201cis not intended to apply to a defendant who puts the government to its burden of proof at trial by denying the essential factual elements of guilt.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, comment. (n.2). Nevertheless, \u201cconviction by trial ... does not automatically preclude a defendant from consideration for ... such a reduction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A reduction may still be warranted such as \u201cwhere a defendant goes to trial to assert and preserve issues that do not relate to factual guilt (e.g., to make a constitutional challenge to a statute or a challenge to the applicability of a statute to his conduct).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cIn each such instance, however, a determination that a defendant has accepted responsibility will be based primarily upon pre-trial statements and conduct.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>In this case, the district court found Waters\u2019 trial testimony incredible. \u201cCredibility determinations are typically the province of the fact finder because the fact finder personally observes the testimony and is thus in a better position than a reviewing court to assess the credibility of witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. RamirezChilel, </em>289 F.3d 744, 749 (11th Cir.2002). Credibility findings by district courts are typically \u201cconclusive on the appellate court unless the judge credits <em>exceedingly </em>improbable testimony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis in original). \u201c[W]e must accept the evidence unless it is contrary to the laws of nature, or is so inconsistent or improbable on its face that no reasonable factfinder could accept it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">Waters contends that the court committed clear error in finding his trial testimony incredible. We disagree; what he said at trial was open to rejection by the court at sentencing. Based on the finding that Waters\u2019s trial testimony was not credible, Waters\u2019s pretrial conduct, and his decision to stand trial, we find no error in the court\u2019s determination that Waters failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to an offense level reduction for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b578-5\">Waters also argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was an upward variance from the Guideline sentence range that was not justified by the sentencing factors set out in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). He asserts that the district court erroneously relied on the public-safety factor by ignoring his cooperation with police officers, his legal possession of a firearm at the time he committed the offense of conviction, and the lack of any evidence showing his intent to harm the public. He maintains that the upward variance was unnecessary because his sentence range was increased based on U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) and that the district court ignored his personal history and characteristics.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">When reviewing a sentence for reasonableness, we apply the deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 40-41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We must first determine that the \u201cdistrict court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines sentence range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, [or] failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If we conclude that the district court made no procedural errors, we \u201cshould then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Review for substantive reasonableness under the abuse-of-discretion standard involves inquiring whether the factors in \u00a7 3553(a) support the sentence in question. <em>Id. </em>at 48-50, 128 S.Ct. at 596.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, (C) to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant, and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (3) the kinds of sentences available; (4) the Guidelines sentence range; (5) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (6) the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (7) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553(a)(1) \u2014 (7). \u201cThe district court must evaluate all of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors when arriving at a sentence, but is permitted to attach great weight to one factor over others.\u201d <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number><em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d 1230, 1237 (11th Cir.) (citation and quotation omitted), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2847, 174 L.Ed.2d 566 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\u201cIn reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, [we] may ... take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 47, 128 S.Ct. at 595-96. \u201cWhen the district court decides after serious consideration that a variance is in order, it should explain why that variance is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>560 F.3d at 1238 (quotation omitted). \u201cThe justifications must be compelling enough to support the degree of the variance and complete enough to allow meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). However, the district court need not provide an extraordinary justification for a sentence outside the guideline range. <em>Id. </em>The district court has \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in deciding whether and the extent to which a variance is appropriate under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and we accord its decision \u201cdue deference.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We will vacate a sentence due to a variance only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">Waters\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable because the record does not show that the district court made a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and determining that an upward variance was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
