Casey argues that the district court plainly erred in imposing a sentence above the range recommended by the applicable policy statement in the Sentencing Guidelines without explanation. He also argues that the sentence is in violation of the law and plainly unreasonable because the district court violated 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) by not providing any reason for the sentence imposed and that the sentence is not supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-18\">Because Casey did not object to the error at the revocation hearing, the plain error standard of review applies.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To show plain error, Casey must show a forfeited error that is clear or obvious and that affects his substantial rights.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If the appellant makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-19\">Although Casey\u2019s 50-month sentence exceeded the advisory guideline range of 37 to 46 months of imprisonment, the sentence did not exceed the five-year statutory maximum sentence that could have been imposed upon revocation of Casey\u2019s supervised release.'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We have routinely affirmed revocation sentences exceeding the advisory range, even where the sentence equals the statutory maximum.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Further, we have affirmed sentences representing greater deviations from the advi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sory range than the sentence here.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Consequently, Casey\u2019s sentence is acceptable under both the former \u201cplainly unreasonable\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and the <em>United States v. Booker </em>\u201cunreasonableness\u201d standards.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">Casey has not shown that the district court failed to give adequate reasons for the sentence. In unpublished opinions, this court has indicated that the scope of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2)\u2019s applicability to revocation sentences is unsettled and, thus, the failure by a district court to state specific reasons for selecting a revocation sentence does not constitute error that is plain.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Before imposing the sentence, the district court heard arguments of the parties and Casey\u2019s allocution. The district court stated that if it were satisfied that Casey had continued to be involved in drug activity, this would affect its sentencing decision. The district court also stated that it had considered U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, as well as the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 3553 and 3583.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Even if the district court plainly erred in not providing adequate reasons for the sentence, Casey has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The 50-month sentence was supported by the record and the sentencing factors of \u00a7 3553(a). Casey repeatedly violated the conditions of his supervised release as he was arrested twice for drug-related offenses; he did not provide truthful and complete written monthly supervision reports; he failed to work regularly at a lawful occupation; and he falsified pay stubs or employment records in an attempt to show that he was employed. The district court stated that it had considered \u00a7 7B1.4, as well as the factors in \u00a7\u00a7 3553 and 3583. Because the sentence is supported by the record, Casey has not shown that any error by the district court affected his substantial rights.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b222-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
