Upon a partition made between them, shortly after the death of their father, the premises in question became the property of Catharine, Rebecca, Teunis, and' John, and by them (the husbands of the daughters uniting) were conveyed in fee in September, 1793, in part to William Sloo, and1 the residue to Anthony Smith, and from those grantees the defendant, by sundry mesne conveyances, derives his title. The-actual possession from the year 1793 has been in conformity to the successive conveyances.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b363-10\">Peter Grim, the husband of Catharine, died in 1798.

Catharine Corbett, upon the decease of Rebecca Yreelandt, her sister, who died married, leaving no lawful issue, became seized, as tenant in common, of one equal tenth part of the premises in question, under the fifth clause of the will \u00f3f her .father. 1. The limitation over is made to take effect upon the contingency of either of the children dying under ag\u00e9, leaving no lawful issue, or dying married, leaving no lawful issue. 2. This construction gives effect to all the words used, and is rational in itself, and consistent with every other part of the will, and with the situation of the testator\u2019s family. \u2019 (5 Barn. &amp; Ald. 917.) 3. This is the natural and proper sense of the words used, and there is nothing in the clause, nor in any other part of the will, to require or authorize the rejection of the disjunctive sense of the word <em>\u201c </em>or.\u201d <em>(Woodward </em>v. <em>Glassbrooke, </em>2 Vern. 388 ; <em>Roosevelt </em>v. <em>Thurman, </em>1 Johns. C. R. 219, 228.) 4. The rule of construction by which the courts have in some cases changed \u201c or\u201d into \u201c and,\u201d has no application to the present will, <em>(a) </em>The rule is-confined to cases where an estate of inheritance is devised to a person with a limitation over, depending on his age or issue; and is adopted to effectuate the general intent of the testator, and because otherwise if the first taker should die under age, though leaving issue, such issue would be disinherited; and to cases of the like nature. <em>(Fairfield </em>v. Morgan, 2 Boss. &amp; Pull. 38 N. R.; <em>Jackson </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number><em>Blan, </em>6 Johns. 54; <em>Haunus, </em>lessee, v. Shuts, 2 Binn. 532; 1 Powell on Devises, by Jarman, 375, 5th Law Lib.) <em>(i) </em>In the present case the limitation depends on the failure of issue, with the additional circumstance of dying under age or married. The failure of issue being the leading contingency, the case is not within the reason of the rule, <em>(c) </em>If \u201c or\u201d in this case is changed into \u201c and,\u201d the word \u201c married\u201d will be rendered nugatory, and the intent of the testator to preserve to his family the share of a son or daughter who might be married and die without issue, be defeated, <em>(d) </em>It would also defeat his intent, if any of his children died under age and unmarried, <em>(e) </em>The rule in question is not to be extended to any new class of cases, unless absolutely necessary to effect the intent of the testator. <em>(Douglas </em>v. <em>Eyre, </em>Gilpin, 148 ; Bos. &amp; Pul. 51.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b365-5\">., II. The deed executed by Mrs. Corbett with her husband, passed no greater estate than she then possessed, and cannot operate against her by way of estoppel, to prevent her taking the, estate which descended to her upon the death of her sister. <em>(Jackson </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>17 Johns.

Rebecca, daughter of John Dyckman, having attained the age.of twenty-one years, had a fee simple estate in the property in question, which was not divested by her dying without issue, and she lawfully, after she came of age, conveyed the lots in question to William Sloo and Anthony Smith, in 1793, as before stated. The fee was contingent only upon her dying under age, and if under age, without issue. The settled construction of the words contained in John Dyckman\u2019s will, \u201c under age, or married leaving no lawful issue,\u201d is that the contingency ceases on the happening of either event, to wit, attaining twenty-one years, or leaving issue. <em>(Jackson </em>ex dem. <em>Burhans and wife </em>v. <em>Blanshaw, </em>6 Johns. R.; 54 Jarman on Wills, vol. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>i. 416, &amp;c.

In sup port of this position many other cases may be cited, of which the following are a <em>part:\u2014Barker </em>v. Surtees, 2 Stra. 1175; <em>Walsh </em>v. <em>Peterson, </em>3 Atkin. 193; <em>Framlingham </em>v. <em>Brand, </em>Cruise Digest, vol. vi. 131, and cases there cited (Am. ed.).</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b366-4\">H. The plaintiffs are barred also by the statute of limita-' tions. 1. The defendant and those from whom he claims have been in possession under conveyances since 1793. (See R. S. vol. ii. 293, \u00a7\u00a7 5, 8, 9, and 10.) 2. The plaintiffs are not within any of the exceptions of the statute. Rebecca Yreelandt died September 11, 1830; Catharine Corbett, her sister, could then have brought suit, if she could not have done so before; she1 was under no disabilities. But suit was not brought till the year 1853, nearly 23 years thereafter.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b366-5\">By the Court. Oakley, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AF0\">We think that we should be fully justified, by a long series of decisions, in holding that, in order to carry into effect the apparent intent of the testator, the word \u201c or,\u201d in the fifth clause of the will, must be construed \u201c and,\u201d so as to make the limitation over depend upon the contingency of the death of one or more of the children under age, without issue then living. The construction of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, in effect, expunges the words \u201c under age\u201d from the will, for supposing the testator to mean that the limitation over should take effect upon the death of any of the children without issue, whatever might be the age of the person so dying, the words \u201c under age\u201d are plainly senseless. Had such been his meaning we cannot think that they would have been used. It is true that the word <em>\u201c </em>married\u201d creates some perplexity. It embarrasses a construction that otherwise we could not hesitate to adopt, yet we cannot believe that the testator meant that marriage should have the effect of making an estate defeasible that otherwise would be absolute. Such, however, would be the necessary consequence of holding that the word \u201c married\u201d was used to denote an alternative contingency. Oh the other hand, it is just as difficult to believe that he meant that the share of a child dying under age, and without issue, \u25a0should, go over, if he were then married, and not otherwise. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Upon either construction, retaining the word \u201c or,\u201d or' substituting \u201c and,\u201d marriage, if any effect is to be given to the word \u201cmarried,\u201d is made a necessary condition of the limitation over. It is hardly possible that this could have been the intention of the testator, and hence, in order to give any reasonable interpretation to the clause of limitation, it seems that the word \u201c married\u201d must be stricken out entirely. We think that the share of the child dying without issue should go to the survivors, whether the child should be married or unmarried at the time of his or her death, and that he probably meant that the limitation over should only take effect, in the event of such a death, during the minority of the person dying. And were it necessary it is this last construction that we should be inclined to adopt.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">It is not necessary, however, nor do we mean to place our decision upon this ground, since we are all of opinion, that, adopting the plaintiffs\u2019 construction of the clause of limitation, their claims, as the heirs-at-law of Mrs. Corbett, are effectually barred by the adverse possession, which is shown to have continued without interruption for more than twenty years prior to the commencement of this action. In 1830, when her sister Rebecca died, without issue, Mrs. Corbett was under no disability. She had then, if at all, an immediate right of entry, that she might then have enforced by suit. The statute, therefore, then commenced to run against her, and as nothing has since occurred to suspend its operation, the statutory period was more than completed when this action was brought. Hence it has perfected the title of the defendant, and raised a full bar to a recovery by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">It is true, as a general rule, that the possession of a tenant in common is not considered to be adverse, since in judgment of l$w the possession of one such tenant is the possession of all, but the rule is not applicable when there is sufficient evidence of an ouster of the co-tenants; and in the case before us we think that the evidence of an ouster, setting the statute in motion, is not merely sufficient but conclusive. During the whole statutory period there has been an exclusive possession, an exclusive reception of rents and profits, and an exclusive claim of title. The defendant, and all those from and through whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>he derives his title, from the year 1793, have held the possession under deeds which, in terms, gave to them in succession an absolute fee, and nothing has been shown to shake the legal presumption that they have all claimed the title which their deeds purported to convey. There are other difficulties in the way of a recovery by the plaintiffs in this case, to which,- as they seem .to have been overlooked by the counsel of the parties, we deem it unnecessary to advert; we mention the iact merely to repel an inference that might otherwise b\u00e9; drawn from our silence. It. is sufficient now to say that the defence of an adverse possession, which, by force of the statute, bars a recovery, has, in our opinion, been fully established.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Judgment, upon the verdict, must be entered for the defendant with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
