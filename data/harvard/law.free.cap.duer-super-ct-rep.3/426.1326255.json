The defendant denies each and' every allegation contained therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">2. The defendant farther answers and says, that the facts set forth therein do not constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-9\">3. The defendant further answering, alleges that it has paid to the plaintiff the interest on the several amounts, alleged in the complaint to have been paid in by him on his said subscriptions to the stock of the said defendant, to which the plaintiff was entitled, or the defendant bound to pay the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-10\">4. That the defendant is a corporation, duly organized under and by virtue of the laws of the State of New York, and that all its affairs are, and were at the several times mentioned in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, managed and governed by a board of directors, duly chosen and elected; and the stockholders thereof, and subscribers for stock, are and were at the time aforesaid bound and concluded by the action of said Board of Directors, in all things rel\u00e1ting to the business and affairs of said corporation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-11\">5.

The defendant further alleges that the act of the defendant, determining to pay the interest on its stock in the stock of the company, was a valid act, and binding on the plaintiff, being a stockholder, and concludes him from demanding the interest which may have fallen due on the stock held by him in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-6\">The defendant demurs to that part of the plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint in the above action, which sets forth the first cause of action mentioned therein, and specifies the following causes of demurrer:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-7\">1. That it does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-8\">2.

It does not appear that the interest claimed therein has not been paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-11\">5. It appears affirmatively therein that said interest is payable in the stock of the company, and not in cash.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b441-12\">6.

That such interest should be at the rate of seven per cent., and be allowed on all payments from the day they were made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-4\">The first payment was to begin on the 15th November, 1847, and be made semi-annually thereafter.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">If no such -law should be procured, then the interest was to be paid from the first clear earnings of the road, and no dividend was to be made until all such interest was fully paid.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">The act contemplated was passed on the 20th of March, 1847, and empowered the Company to issue as many shares of stock of $100 each, and not exceeding ten per cent, of the capital, as might be necessary to enable the Company to provide for and pay interest on the instalments paid in for the construction of the road, until it should be completed and put in operation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">' The plaintiff subscribed $7,500, and paid his last instalment prior to November 15,1848. The last payment of interest to him was on the 20th of November, 1849.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-8\">The Company issued stock to the amount of four per cent, on the capital to meet this interest, and continued for some time to sell the same at a loss, and pay such interest subsequently ; but, on the 20th of March, 1850, the directors resolved not to pay the interest any longer in cash, but iii stock of the Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-9\">This raised the main question in the cause, viz. whether the interest should be payable in cash or stock. I think that the act of the Legislature may be used to assist the interpretation of the agreement between the stockholders and the Company; and these, together with the terms of the contract, in the event of failure to obtain an act, satisfy me that the construction rendered it obligatory on the defendants to pay the interest in cash. The Legislature permitted the issue of stock to enable them to effect it; but it is not a just conclusion from any of the proceedings, that the subscribers were compellable to accept stock in payment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-10\">It is not stated whether the stock was to be transferred at par, or at its current value. But even if the latter was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>case, I consider that the contract obliged the Company to bear the expense and trouble of turning it into money.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">The terms of the act were, that such interest should continue to be paid until the road should be completed and put in operation, and this is stated to have been on the 29th of October, 1851. The claim of the plaintiff is for interest down to, and including that falling due, the 15th of May, 1852.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">For the interest down to the 15th November, 1851, the Company would be responsible, on the view taken, disregarding the seventeen days from October 29th.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">But I apprehend, that when the road was in operation, the common or partnership rights arose, and the subscribers had to look to profits, whatsoever they might be, in lieu of interest. But as the complaint rests upon the agreement for a claim beyond this period, and avers that no income has been received, within the conditions and terms, so as to stop interest, it will not be proper to decide that point now.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-8\">There are a few other points to be disposed of.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-9\">The third clause of the answer is nothing but the defendants\u2019 assumption of what they are bound to pay, and is properly demurred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-10\">The fourth clause raises the question, whether the plaintiff, being a stockholder, can sue the Company.

Larocque, </em>for the plaintiff, respondent, claimed an affirmance of the judgment upon the following points and authorities.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">I. The objection that the plaintiff, being a corporator, cannot sue the corporation for the interest demanded, is untenable <em>(Scott </em>v. <em>Eagle Fire Ins. Co., 1 </em>Paige, 198 ; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>The Portland Bank, </em>3 Mass. R. 364 ; <em>Stockdale </em>v. <em>The South Sea Co., 2 </em>Atk. 141; <em>Titcomb </em>v. <em>Union Marine Fire Ins. Co., </em>8 Mass. R. 326).</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">H. The objection that it does not appear that the interest has not been paid, is untenable. If it has been paid, that is a fact for the defendant, and not for the plaintiff, to establish.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">IH. The Company , is bound to pay the interest in money, and has no right to require the plaintiff to accept stock in lieu of money. 1. The language of the subscription contract manifestly contemplates payment in money. 2. The language of the act passed by the Legislature on the application of the defendants, pursuant to the subscription contract, is to the same effect. 3.\" The practice of the Company, under the subscription contract and act of the Legislature, is shown by the complaint to have been to pay in money, and not in stock, thus recognising their obligation to do so. 4. A resolution of the board of directors was considered necessary to change this practice. 5. The complaint shows that the Company has converted stock issued for the purpose of paying the interest into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>money, and has received from its proceeds a balance of twenty thousand dollars more than has been applied to the purpose.</p>\n<p data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-5\">IY. The objection that it does not appear from the complaint that the contingency upon the happening of which the payment of the interest claimed was to cease, did not happen previous to the accruing of the plaintiff\u2019s demand, is also untenable. 1. The interest claimed is that accruing from November 15th, 1849. 2. The contingency referred to in the articles of subscription, for the cessation of interest, is that \u201c income should be realized from the road.\u201d 3. The first count in the complaint expressly negatives the occurrence of that contingency. 4. The contingency provided for in the act of the Legislature, authorizing the issue of stock, to raise money to pay the interest, is, that the road should be completed and put in operation. 5. Both counts in the complaint show, that this was accomplished only on the 29th October, 1851. 6. The \u201cincome\u201d contemplated by the subscription articles, to stop the running of interest, was income from the entire road, not from a mere portion of it. The intention was, that interest should cease when the Company came into the possession of other means to pay interest or dividends; and if income from a part of the road were to have the effect of stopping interest, it would have stopped as soon as cars were running to Manhattanville, which would be absurd. 7. The act of the Legislature, which expressly provides for the payment of the interest until the road should be completed, was passed on the application of the Company, gives their interpretation of the meaning of the subscription articles, and binds them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-6\">Y. The allegation of payment, in the defendant\u2019s answer, is entirely insufficient to bar the action. 1. The answer does not allege or pretend payment of the instalments of interest claimed in the complaint. 2. Answering payment of that <em>\u201c </em>to which the plaintiff was entitled, or the defendant bound to pay the plaintiff,\u201d is no allegation of fact, but a mere legal dogma.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-7\">YI. The other facts stated in the defendant\u2019s answer constitute no defence. 1. The plaintiff\u2019s claim rests upon an express contract with the corporation. 2. This contract is valid and binding, and beyond the power of the directors to abrogate or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>vary without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. 3. Ho facts are stated in the answer, by virtue of which this power, forbidden to the Legislature of the State by the constitution of the Union, is claimed for the directors of a railroad corporation. '4. The contract, therefore, remains binding, as originally made, notwithstanding the resolution of the directors (cases above cited, and also, Angell &amp; Ames on Corporations, 281 ; <em>Revere </em>v. <em>Boston Copper Co., </em>15 Pick. 363 ; <em>First Presb. Cong. </em>v. <em>Quackenbush, </em>10 Johns. 217; <em>Middlesex Turnp.

The judgment should be affirmed, with, costs.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b448-6\">By the Court. Duer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQS\">The pleadings in this case are singularly constructed, and we should be unwilling to say that any of them, complaint, answer, or demurrers, are framed in entire conformity to the provisions of the Code. That, in some respects, they are at variance with its spirit and meaning, we do not doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">But the points, upon which alone the case has been argued, imply a waiver of all special exceptions, and we understand it to be agreed that the question, whether the judgment appealed from shall be affirmed or reversed, depends wholly upon the construction that we shall give to the agreement between the original subscribers to the stock, and the Company, and upon the operation of the act of the Legislature, which, in order to carry the agreement into effect, was subsequently passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">If the controversy turned upon no other hinge than the terms of the original agreement, we should be compelled to say, that, in their fair and reasonable interpretation, they establish the right of the plaintiff to recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-9\">We cannot believe that it was the intention \u00f3f the parties that the additional shares of stock to \"be issued should be applied to the payment of interest to the subscribers by a direct transfer, for the plain reason, that it must have been foreseen by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>the parties, that, in a vast majority of cases, a payment, by a mere transfer, would be impracticable. It could only be practicable in the cases of an exact correspondence between the amount of the interest to be paid, and the nominal value of the shares to be transferred. Hor can we believe that it was intended that the payments of interest should be made partly in cash and partly in shares, or to some of the subscribers wholly in cash, and to others wholly in shares. The subscribers, under the agreement, had equal rights, and were meant to be placed on the same footing, and, we think, could never have contemplated a mode of payment which would necessarily produce great inequality, and from the discretion it would imply, be liable to great abuse. We are, therefore, satisfied that it was the intention of all that the stipulated payments of interest should be made in money out of the proceeds of the shares to be issued, and not by their immediate transfer. The stockholders might indeed elect to take shares and set off the interest due to them against the price, but the corporation had no election to pay them in cash, or force shares upon their acceptance. The term \u201cpayment,\u201d in its legal import, means the full satisfaction of a debt by money, not by an exchange or compromise, or an accord and satisfaction, and it is only where the words used in connexion with it plainly manifest a different intention that the legal import of the term can be rejected. The words of the agreement in this case are, perhaps, ambiguous, but that they are inconsistent with the usual and legal meaning of \u201c payment \u201d cannot be pretended.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">The stockholders, under the agreement, were to receive interest on the instalments paid by them \u201c until income should be realized from the road,\u201d and the construction of these words is next to be determined. It is insisted, for the defendants, that the event happened, to which they refer, as soon as any part of the line of the road, however trifling in extent, was completed and used\u2014that is, as soon as upon any portion of the road cars were run, and fare received, and consequently that from this time the right of the stockholders to demand the payment of interest ceased.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">That the words in question, literally construed, may bear this meaning, it is unnecessary to deny, but we are satisfied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>that it is not in this sense that we, in order to carry into effect the real intention of the parties, are bound to understand them. We think the manifest intention of the parties was that interest should be continued to be paid to the stockholders until an income should be realized from the road, that, if exceeding its expenses, would be applicable to the payment of dividends\u2014not until an income should be realized in which they would have no possible right to share. The subscribers could never have meant that it should be in the power of the directors of the Company to stop the payment of the interest, for which they had stipulated, by running cars on a mile or two of railroad in the city of Eew York; n\u00far, unless a decep ' tion was intended, could this have been the meaning of those who acted for the Company in making the arrangement. The word \u201c road\u201d in the clause, \u201c until an income shall be realized from the road,\u201d means the road as an entirety, and the realization of an income from it as such, is the event to which the clause refers. . \"</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">We have, perhaps, dwelt longer than was necessary upon the construction of the agreement, since no more can be said on behalf of the defendants than that its terms are ambiguous, and are fairly susceptible of the interpretation for which they contend; but to every argument that has been urged in support of that interpretation it seems to us a conclusive reply, that whatever ambiguity may exist in the terms of the agreement, there is none whatever in those of the act of the Legislature, which was passed for the sole purpose of enabling the Company to carry the agreement into execution. The terms of the law are explicit; they declare that so many shares of stock shall be issued, \u201c as shall enable the Company to provide for, and pay interest, on the instalments paid in for the construction of the road until it shall be completed and put in operation,\u201d thus plainly settling in favor of the plaintiff, the only question that, upon the face of the agreement, could be regarded as doubtful.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">It is said, however, that it is upon the original agreement alone that this action is founded, or can be maintained, and that a subsequent act of the Legislature cannot be permitted to vary its legal construction; and there would, perhaps, be some force in this observation, if the terms of the agreement and of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>the law were plainly inconsistent, but that there is no such inconsistency we have already shown, and we, therefore, do not doubt that the act of the Legislature truly declares and carries out the intentions which the parties, in the agreement, designed to express. But we go further. Upon the averments in the complaint, not denied in the answer, we must regard it as certain, that the act of the Legislature is the very act for which the parties agreed that application should be made, and as it has been accepted by the Company, and both the Company and its stockholders have acted under it, both, we conceive, are bound by its provisions. Keither, it seems to us, can now be permitted to allege that there is any discrepancy between its provisions and their agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">We must, therefore, hold that, until the road was completed and put in operation, the plaintiff was entitled to demand from the Company the payment in money of interest, semi-annually, upon the instalments paid in upon the shares of stock which he holds, and it is scarcely necessary to add that his rights, in this respect, have not been, and could not be, varied by the subsequent resolution of the board of directors, nor by the arrangement which the Company has fortunately been able to make with its other stockholders. Without his individual consent the Company, in respect to his claims, could not be released from the obligations which the agreement and the act of the Legislature created.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">The allegation that it does not appear from the pleadings that the Company has issued and sold any shares of stock, from the proceeds of which the demands of the plaintiff may be satisfied, is certainly groundless.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The complaint distinctly avers that the Company has issued and sold a number of shares of stock, under the authority given by the Legislature, and that the proceeds, after the payment of various sums of interest to the plaintiff and other stockholders, left a balance applicable to future payments of interest of about twenty thousand dollars ; and we think that the answer, in admitting that interest for a time was paid to the subscribers in cash, admits, by implication, the truth of these averments.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">This balance of $20,000 is the fund out of which the claims of the plaintiff ought to be satisfied, and as the claims of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>the other stockholders have been put at rest by an accord and satisfaction, it is far more than sufficient for the purpose. It cannot be pretended that the subsequent misapplication of the fund by the Company has created a bar to his recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">The conduct of the plaintiff, in refusing to accede to the mode of settlement which has been deemed satisfactory by all the other shareholders, may be thought unreasonable, but he chooses to stand upon his legal rights, and it is those alone that we, in passing upon his claims, as a court of justice, are at liberty to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">We must, therefore, affirm the judgment that he has obtained, but not for the whole amount for which it has been rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">The complaint avers that the road was completed and put in operation on the 29th of October, 1851. On that day, therefore, the right of the plaintiff to demand the. payment of interest from the Company wholly ceased. In the judgment as given, however, he has been allowed an excess of interest from the 29th of October to the 15th of November, 1851; and the sum of $262.50 as the semi-annual interest due on the 1st of May, 1852. These sums with interest, as erroneously included, must be deducted from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">(The plaintiff\u2019s counsel consenting to the deduction, the judgment, so modified, was affirmed with costs.)</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
