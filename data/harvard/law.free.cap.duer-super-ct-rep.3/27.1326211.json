The court thereupon proceeded to charge the jury. The counsel for the defendants requested the court to charge the jury that, under the evidence in this case, the defendants were not liable to respond to the plaintiff in damages. The court refused so to charge. To which decision, the couns\u00e9l for the defendants thereupon then and there duly excepted. The jury thereupon retired, and soon afterwards came into court and rendered a verdict for the plaintiff for $400. Upon which a judgment in his favor was duly entered.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-7\"><em>H. L. Clinton, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcU\">in moving for a reversal of the judgment, and a new trial, insisted that\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-8\">The court erred in not dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s complaint. <em>(Blake </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>1 Selden, 48.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-9\">It appeared from the evidence of Howell (plaintiff\u2019s witness), that he subcontracted with defendants to do the iron-work or grating.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-10\">The erection of grating to protect the area was entirely under the control of Howell.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-11\">The accident to plaintiff occurred in consequence of his leaving the area unprotected by grating.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-12\">The principle adjudicated in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Ferris, </em>and running through all the adjudged cases now recognised as authority, is that the party who has the selection of the men performing the work, through whose negligence damage is sustained, is alone responsible. <em>(Pack </em>v. <em>Mayor, &amp;c., of New York, </em>recently decided in Court of Appeals.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b41-13\"><em>E. Sandford, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQq\">contended' that no error <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>had been committed by the judge upon the trial,, and that the judgment ought to be affirmed with costs, and insisted that\u2014\u2022</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-5\">The defendants were in the exclusive possession of the premises, under a contract to deliver the buildings finished and complete in every particular, when the injury was sustained by plaintiff. The building was delivered finished in October, and the injury happened on 17th September.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-6\">Howell, the blacksmith, was employed by defendants to put down the grating. There is no evidence that he had any charge or possession of the premises ; on the contrary, on the day of the accident defendant Kent was at the building, and his attention was called to the hole. He did not claim that he was not responsible for the condition of the premises.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-7\">If the accident was occasioned by the negligence of the blacksmith, he was the agent and servant of defendants, and they are responsible. <em>(Blake </em>v. Ferris, 1 Selden, 49, and cases there cited.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b42-8\">By the Court. Slosson, J.</author>\n<p id=\"APJ\">It is a mistake to suppose that this case is at all governed by the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>jBlaJee </em>v. <em>Ferris. </em>Had the action been brought against Mrs. Lozier, the owner, instead of the defendants, the objection that has been relied on, would have applied, and would have been fatal; but the defendants had contracted to finish the whole building, and while engaged in the performance of their contract, had the exclusive possession and control; and that their contract embraced the front area, and the work there necessary to be done, is not denied. Although they employed a blacksmith at a stipulated price to make and finish the grating, it does not appear that it was not their duty to guard against accidents during his absence and that of his workmen, by covering or fencing the opening to the area, until it was properly grated. Their contract with the owner imposed upon them this duty, and it does not appear that they were released from it by their contract with the blacksmith. On the contrary, the case shows that it was considered by themselves to be their duty, and that they attempted to prove its performance. Hence, it is to- the negligence of the defendants themselves and of the servants whom they employed, that the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>dent from which the plaintiff has suffered must be imputed, and there is consequently nothing to take the case from the general rule of <em>respondeat superior.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Even had it been proved that the blacksmith, as a sub-contractor, was bound to guard and protect the opening in the area until the completion of his stipulated work, we are by no means prepared to say that the defendants would not still be responsible for his negligence, as' that of their own agent or servant. We are not aware that it has yet been decided that he who has contracted to erect and complete an entire building may relieve himself from all liability for the negligent acts or omissions of those by whom the labor may be performed, by parcelling out the work to sub-contractors in distinct jobs, instead of performing it by laborers under his own direction and in his immediate employ. As at present advised, we do not think that the principle of the decision in <em>Blake </em>v. <em>Ferris </em>would require us to go to this extent, and, unless under the pressure of a paramount authority, it is not a decision that we should be willing to make. It is not necessary, however, that the question should now be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">All the exceptions taken on the trial are overruled, and the judgment upon the verdict is affirmed with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
