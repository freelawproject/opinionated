The word endorsement, in common acceptation importing a delivery, the averment of an actual endorsement and possession by the holder before maturity, is equivalent to an allegation that it was endorsed to the plaintiff. The two averments are together sufficient, <em>primd facie, </em>to establish that the holder has a good title to the note.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b699-5\">(Before Oakley, O.
