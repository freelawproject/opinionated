The district court granted Horizon\u2019s motion for directed verdict on Farpella-Crosby\u2019s intentional infliction of emotional distress claim. Farpella-Crosby\u2019s Title VII claim was tried to a jury, which returned a verdict in her favor and awarded compensatory and punitive damages. Horizon moved for judgment <em>non obstante vere-dicto </em>as to liability, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. The district court granted judgment n.o.v. as to the punitive damage award, but upheld the $7,500 compensatory damage award.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-4\">On appeal, Horizon challenges the district court\u2019s refusal to render a judgment n.o.v. on liability and on mental anguish damages. The determination of Horizon\u2019s appeal requires a detailed analysis of whether the specific facts and circumstances reflected by the evidence presented to the jury are sufficient to support the jury\u2019s findings and award. We are governed by the standard of review set out in <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc). By cross-appeal, Farpella-Crosby in turn complains of the judgment n.o.v. on punitive damages. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">Farpella-Crosby was employed by Horizon at a nursing home known as Mountain View Place beginning in June of 1993. Farpella-Crosby worked as a treatment nurse and was charged with treating and monitoring the residents\u2019 decubitus ulcers and other skin-related afflictions. Beginning in February of 1994, Jose Blanco, director of nursing at the facility, engaged in the conduct that gave rise to this lawsuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Many of Farpella-Crosby\u2019s complaints stem from Blanco\u2019s frequent comments attributing Farpella-Crosby\u2019s large number of children to a proclivity to engage in sexual activity. Blanco repeatedly commented that he \u201cknew what she liked to do\u201d because she had seven children and that she \u201cmust not have a television.\u201d At a baby shower held at the facility for another employee, Blanco joked to the group that Farpella-Crosby \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to use condoms.\u201d Blanco also frequently inquired about Farpella-Crosby\u2019s sexual activity. He would often question her and Denise Vujevie, her coworker, about where they had been the night before (while off duty), whether they had taken men home, and whether they \u201cgot any.\u201d Farpella-Crosby and Vujevie both testified that Blanco made similar comments two or three times a week. Farpella-Crosby testified that the comments were so frequent that she could not possibly remember each instance. Blanco threatened Farpella-Cros-by with her job on numerous occasions when she asked him to stop making these comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-11\">On one occasion, after Farpella-Crosby had eaten lunch in her office with a boyfriend, Blanco said that \u201cwhen you open the door [to the office], the smell of fish just hits you in the face. You shouldn\u2019t be doing that kind of thing at work.\u201d Robert Martinez, a social worker at Mountain View Place, testified that he remembered Blanco making this comment and told him that he should stop. Blanco did not deny making the comment, but testified that he did not recall it. Blanco essentially admitted that he did question Farpella-Crosby about her personal life, but claimed that he did so because he believed the lack of sleep resulting from sexual activity could affect her work performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-12\">Farpella-Crosby also complained of hostile treatment by Blanco that was not overtly related to her gender. Blanco often asked her to perform menial tasks outside of her job description, such as refilling his coffee cup, washing his dirty dishes, and making copies for him. Blanco and Humberto Arrio-la, assistant director of nursing, would also make fun of her by blowing into her ear and pretending that they could feel wind come out the other side of her head.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-14\">The resolution of this appeal, as indicated above, turns on the application of the <em>Boeing </em>standard for reviewing the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict in connection with a judgment <em>non obstante veredicto. Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365, 374-75 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc); <em>Maxey v. Freightliner Corp., </em>665 F.2d 1367, 1371 (5th Cir.1982). A judgment n.o.v. should be granted only when the facts and inferences point so strongly and overwhelm<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"806\">*806</page-number>ingly in favor of the moving party that reasonable persons could not arrive at a contrary verdict. <em>Boeing, </em>411 F.2d at 374; <em>Maxey, </em>665 F.2d at 1371. The court considers all the evidence \u2014 not just the evidence that supports the 'nonmovant\u2019s case \u2014 in the light most favorable to the nonmovant and indulges all reasonable inferences in favor of the nonmovant. If there is substantial evidence opposed to the motion, the motion should be denied. <em>Maxey, </em>665 F.2d at 1371. Substantial evidence means evidence of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded persons in the exercise of impartial judgment might reach different conclusions. <em>Id. </em>A mere scintilla of evidence is insufficient to present a question for the jury. <em>Boeing, </em>411 F.2d at 374. With these standards in mind, we turn to the substantive law governing hostile work environment Title VII claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">In support of a hostile work environment sexual harassment claim, an employee is required to show that (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she was subject to unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) the harassment complained of was based upon sex; (4) the harassment complained of affected a term, condition, or privilege of employment (is., that the sexual harassment was so pervasive or severe as to alter her conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment); and (5) the employer knew or should have known of the harassment and failed to take prompt remedial action. <em>Jones v. Flagship Int\u2019l, </em>793 F.2d 714, 719-20 (5th Cir.1986), <em>cert. denied, </em>479 U.S. 1065, 107 S.Ct. 952, 93 L.Ed.2d 1001 (1987). To be actionable, the challenged conduct must create an environment that a rea sonable person would find hostile or abusive. <em>Weller v. Citation Oil &amp; Gas Corp., </em>84 F.3d 191, 194 (5th Cir.1996) (citation omitted). Whether an environment is hostile or abusive depends on \u201cthe totality of circumstances.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, -, 114 S.Ct. 367, 371, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993); <em>DeAngelis v. El Paso Municipal Police Officers Ass\u2019n, </em>51 F.3d 591, 594 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 116 S.Ct. 473, 133 L.Ed.2d 403 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-11\">To be actionable under Title VII, sexual harassment must be sufficiently pervasive or severe to alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment. Sexually discriminatory verbal intimidation, ridicule, and insults may be sufficiently severe or pervasive as to alter the conditions of the victim\u2019s employment and create an abusive working environment that violates Title VII. <em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at -, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71 (citing <em>Meritor Sav. Bank FSB v. Vinson, </em>477 U.S. 57, 65, 67, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2405, 2405-06, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986)). But the \u201cmere utterance of an ... epithet which engenders offensive feelings in an employee\u201d is not alone sufficient to support Title VII liability. <em>Weller, </em>84 F.3d at 194 (citing <em>DeAngelis, </em>51 F.3d at 594 (quoting <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, </em>477 U.S. at 67, 106 S.Ct. at 2405)).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-12\">Horizon contends that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding that the harassment affected a term, condition, or privilege of Farpella-Crosby\u2019s employment. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Farpella-Crosby, there is substantial evidence from which the jury could have concluded that Blanco\u2019s comments and questions were sufficiently severe and pervasive as to alter the conditions of her employment and create an abusive working environment. Both Farpella-Crosby and her co-worker testified that Blanco inquired about Farpel-la-Crosby\u2019s sexual activity or made comments similarly offensive two or three times a week.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record reflects that Blanco made many egregious comments to Farpella-Crosby, some in front of co-workers, that in combination with his frequent inquisition about her sexual activity were sufficiently severe and pervasive to create a hostile work environment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>B.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\">An employer is liable for the discrimi-natoiy acts of an employee only if it knew or should have known of the employee\u2019s offensive conduct and failed to take steps to repudiate that conduct and eliminate the hostile environment. <em>Nash v. Electrospace Sys., Inc., </em>9 F.3d 401, 404 (5th Cir.1993) (citing <em>Jones, </em>793 F.2d at 720). As this court noted in <em>Wattman v. International Paper Co., </em>the type and extent of notiee necessary to impose liability on an employer under Title VII are the subject of some uncertainty. 875 F.2d 468, 478 (5th Cir.1989) (concluding that three separate complaints to higher management constituted sufficient notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">Whether Farpella-Crosby presented sufficient evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Horizon knew or should have known of the harassment is undoubtedly a close question. To show that Horizon knew or should have known that she was being subjected to a hostile work environment, Farpel-la-Crosby relies primarily on her conversations with human resource directors at the Mountain View Place facility. Both of the human resource directors testified that under the company\u2019s sexual harassment policy, a report of sexual harassment to a human resources director would constitute notice to Horizon.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">After testifying extensively about Blanco\u2019s comments and questions relating to her sexual activities, Farpella-Crosby was asked whether she \u201creported] these comments and these types of intrusions into [her] personal life.\u201d She responded affirmatively. She told Belinda Callejo, a human resource director at Mountain View Place, that Jose Blanco \u201cwas making comments into [her] personal life\u201d and that he made \u201cpersonal comments\u201d that she did not like. Farpella-Crosby testified that she talked to Callejo about her problems frequently. Although she testified that she did not give Callejo any specific examples, she did tell Callejo that she found Blanco\u2019s comments to be offensive. Callejo agreed that Farpella-Crosby had told her of job-related problems, but denied that Farpella-Crosby had ever mentioned sexual harassment. Callejo also testified, however, that an employee need not say explicitly \u201cI am being sexually harassed\u201d before Callejo would take action as human resources director. Callejo said that she would consider it sufficient notice if Farpella-Crosby had said that \u201cthings are being said to me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b881-10\">Gigi Hopper replaced Callejo as human resource director on May 1, 1994. Farpella-Crosby also complained to Hopper. She told Hopper that Blanco was \u201cmaking comments into [her] personal life\u201d and that she considered the comments to be \u201coffensive or unwelcome.\u201d Farpella-Crosby testified that she intentionally failed to report specific instances of sexual harassment in a statement she gave to Hopper because she \u201chad told Belinda [Callejo]\u201d and thought \u201csomebody would do something about what I had told Belinda.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b881-11\">After reviewing all the evidence consistent with the standard announced in <em>Boeing, </em>we are unable to declare that reasonable jurors could not have concluded that Horizon knew or should have known of Blanco\u2019s harassing behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-12\">Substantial evidence also supports a finding that Horizon failed to take prompt remedial action. Callejo\u2019s uniform response to Farpella-Crosby\u2019s complaints was \u201cHang in there. Something\u2019s got to be done.\u201d Nothing, however, was done. Viewing the evidence in the fight most favorable to Farpel-la-Crosby, she endured nearly six months of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"808\">*808</page-number>Blanco\u2019s abusive behavior before Horizon took any action. There is no evidence that Callejo performed any investigation of Far-pella-Crosby\u2019s complaints or that she took any steps to remedy the situation. This was not prompt remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Horizon next attacks the jury\u2019s award of compensatory damages in the amount of $7,500. Horizon argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the jury\u2019s award of mental anguish damages, citing <em>Parkway Co. v. Woodruff, </em>901 S.W.2d 484 (Tex.1995). Horizon\u2019s reliance on state law is misplaced. Compensatory damages in a hostile work environment Title VII case are governed by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">The Supreme Court in <em>Harris v. Forklift Systems, Inc. </em>made clear that psychological injury is not a prerequisite to bringing a Title VII hostile work environment claim. 510 U.S. 17, 20-24, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370-71, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993). As the Court explained, a working environment can be so abusive as to violate Title VII, irrespective of whether the claimant suffers psychological injury:<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFg\">... Title VII comes into play before the harassing conduct leads to a nervous breakdown. A discriminatorily abusive work environment, even one that does not seriously affect employees\u2019 psychological well-being, can and often will detract from employees\u2019 job performance, discourage employees from remaining on the job, or keep them from advancing in their careers. Moreover, even without regard to these tangible effects, the very fact that the discriminatory conduct was so severe or pervasive that it created a work environment abusive to employees because of their race, gender, religion, or national origin offends Title VU\u2019s broad rule of workplace equality-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b882-12\"><em>Harris, </em>510 U.S. at 20-24, 114 S.Ct. at 370-71. It is against this backdrop that we turn to the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s award of mental anguish damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-13\">This circuit has recently spoken on the specificity of proof required to support an award of mental anguish damages in the context of constructive discharge in violation of \u00a7 1981 and retaliatory discharge in violation of Title VII. <em>See Patterson v. P.H.P. Healthcare Corp., </em>90 F.3d 927, 937-41 (5th Cir.1996). The court set the bar high. The court held that to recover mental anguish damages, the claimant must satisfy the specificity requirement set out in <em>Carey v. Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 255-56, 98 S.Ct. 1042, 1048, 55 L.Ed.2d 252 (1978). <em>Patterson, </em>90 F.3d at 938, 939-40. To meet this requirement, the claimant must show that the harassment \u201cmanifests some specific diseemable injury to the claimant\u2019s emotional state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-14\">Although <em>Patterson </em>did not involve the award of mental anguish damages in the context of a hostile work environment claim, we find its discussion of mental anguish damages to be instructive. In <em>Patterson, </em>the court looked to a discussion of the \u201cmanifestation\u201d of emotional harm found in an EEOC policy statement. <em>Id. </em>at 939 (citing EEOC Policy Guidance No. 915.002 \u00a7 II(A)(2) (July 14, 1992)). The Commission lists numerous ways in which emotional harm may manifest itself, including physical manifestations as well as other types of manifestations, such as stress and humiliation. EEOC Policy Guidance No. 915.002, at 10-12 (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b882-15\">The <em>Patterson </em>court reviewed the award of mental anguish damages to Donna Patterson, who was the head nurse at the facility where Nicholas Brown, Patterson\u2019s co-plaintiff, worked. Patterson brought suit under Title VII, alleging that she was discharged in re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"809\">*809</page-number>taliation for her opposition to discriminatory practices at the facility where she and Brown were employed. The district court awarded Patterson $150,000 for mental anguish flowing from her discharge and a subsequent period of unemployment. This court vacated the mental anguish award and enunciated the defects in Patterson\u2019s proof, including a lack of evidence that she was humiliated or subjected to a hostile working environment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b883-4\">No corroborating testimony was offered to support Patterson\u2019s testimony. <em>No evidence suggests that Patterson was humiliated or subjected to any kind of hostile work environment. </em>Further, no expert medical or psychological evidence exists to support a claim for emotional harm.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b883-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 941 (emphasis added). Unlike Patterson, who presented no evidence that she \u201cwas humiliated or subjected to any kind of hostile work environment,\u201d Farpella-Crosby presented both evidence that she was subjected to a hostile work environment and evidence from which the jury could have inferred that she experienced stress and humiliation as a result of Blanco\u2019s abuse. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b883-6\">Farpella-Crosby\u2019s testimony also goes beyond that of Nicholas Brown. Brown brought both a constructive discharge claim under \u00a7 1981<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and a hostile work environment claim. After a bench trial, the district court awarded Brown $40,000 in mental anguish damages in connection with his constructive discharge claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Holding that the trial court had abused its discretion in awarding mental anguish damages, this court vacated that award. <em>Patterson, </em>90 F.3d at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-7\">Brown testified that he felt \u201cfrustrated\u201d and \u201creal bad\u201d because his supervisor judged him by the color of his skin. He described his work environment as \u201cunbearable\u201d and said that it was \u201ctearing [his] self-esteem down.\u201d Brown also stated that it \u201churt\u201d and made him \u201cangry\u201d and \u201cparanoid\u201d to know that his supervisor referred to him as a \u201cporch monkey\u201d or a \u201cnigger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 939. Brown\u2019s testimony would support a finding that he was hurt, angry, and frustrated, but the court in <em>Patterson </em>explained, hurt, anger, and frustration are simply \u201cpart of life.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 940. None of these are listed in the EEOC policy statement. Farpella-Crosby\u2019s testimony reflected that her emotional harm went far beyond hurt, anger, and frustration to manifest itself in the form of humiliation and stress.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-12\">Farpella-Crosby testified that she felt \u201cvery embarrassed, very belittled,\u201d \u201cvery disgusted,\u201d \u201chopeless,\u201d \u201cabout two inches high,\u201d and \u201cstarted to feel pretty stupid\u201d as a result of Blanco\u2019s harassment. She also felt that she must \u201chave done something wrong to deserve somebody to talk to me like that.\u201d Significantly, Farpella-Crosby testified that her work environment was \u201cvery stressful\u201d and that she was \u201cembarrassed every time [she] went in there.\u201d Farpella-Crosby\u2019s testimony is corroborated by her friend and coworker Denise Vujevic, who testified that she and Farpella-Crosby began to go everywhere together at work because they believed that there was \u201csafety in numbers.\u201d This reflected Faipella-Crosby\u2019s sense of distress and vulnerability if left alone to deal with the work environment at Mountain View Place. Farpella-Crosby also testified that she attempted to gain employment elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-13\">Thus, the jury could conclude based on this record that Farpella-Crosby suffered emotional harm that manifested itself as humiliation and stress. Farpella-Crosby\u2019s own testimony combined with the testimony of Denise Vujevic is sufficient to support the jury\u2019s award of mental anguish damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-14\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b883-15\">By cross-appeal, Farpella-Crosby challenges the judgment n.o.v., which denied her punitive damages awarded by the jury. To recover punitive damages under Title VII, the plaintiff must show that the defendant acted with \u201cmalice or with reckless indiffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"810\">*810</page-number>ence....\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(b)(1). Viewing the entire record in the light most favorable to Farpella-Crosby, we conclude that no reasonable juror could conclude that Horizon itself acted with malice or with reckless indifference. Further, under the particular facts of this case, no applicable tool of agency law would justify imposing punitive damages on Horizon based on Blanco\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"Aph8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"Aao\">For these reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s refusal to grant a judgment n.o.v. on liability and compensatory damages and we AFFIRM the judgment n.o.v. on punitive damages.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b879-8\">. Faipella-Crosby also testified as to one act of sexual harassment by the assistant director of nursing, Humberto Arriola.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b880-6\">. Sex-neutral hostile conduct cannot be used to support a hostile environment claim. Title VII does not protect employees from hostile conduct that is not based on their protected status. <em>See Mayberry v. Vought Aircraft Co., </em>55 F.3d 1086, 1091 (5th Cir.1995). Because the harassment that was unquestionably based on gender provides a sufficient basis for finding that the harassment created an abusive working environment, we need not reach whether Blanco's demands that Farpella-Crosby perform menial tasks were sex-neutral or sex-based hostile conduct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b880-14\">. This case is distinguishable from <em>Long v. Eastfield College, </em>88 F.3d 300, 304 (5th Cir.1996), in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"807\">*807</page-number>which this Court held that a single joke told by a supervisor involving condoms was insufficient to create an hostile work environment. Blanco\u2019s joke about Farpella-Crosby\u2019s knowledge of condoms was directed specifically toward Faipella-Crosby and her seven children and was not an isolated incident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b881-8\">. The first time that Horizon received written notice of Faipella-Crosby\u2019s claims was on July 27, 1994. But Horizon's sexual harassment policy did not require a written notification to management of sexual harassment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b881-14\">. Another factor relevant to whether Horizon knew or should have known of Blanco\u2019s conduct is whether the conduct \"took place in public, under the eye of co-workers or supervisors.\u201d <em>See Nash, </em>9 F.3d at 404. On several occasions, Blan-co made offensive comments in the presence of Faipella-Crosby's co-worker Robert Martinez and Humberto Arriola, assistant director of nursing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b882-8\">.
