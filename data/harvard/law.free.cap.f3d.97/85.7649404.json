Moller filed an ERISA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> action in federal district court against her former employer and plan administrator, El Campo Aluminum Company (El Campo), and the El Campo Aluminum Company Hourly Pension Plan (Plan), asserting that the plan administrator wrongfully denied her retirement disability benefits under the Plan. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants. Because relevant evidence was available but not provided to the doctor who \u25a0ultimately decided that Moller was ineligible for benefits, we reverse and remand with instructions for the case to be remanded to the plan administrator for reconsideration with all of the relevant evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">In October of 1988, Moller developed vertigo and ceased working at El Campo, where she had worked for about seventeen years. Moller applied for disability benefits from the Social Security Administration in 1989.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">In February, 1990, Dr. Ronald E. Goelzer, M.D. determined that Moller\u2019s vertigo rendered her permanently disabled. Goelzer\u2019s opinion conflicted with the opinion of two doctors from the Department of Otolaryngol-ogy at Baylor College of Medicine, who believed that Moller could work in certain jobs without being a danger to herself or others.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">In March, 1990, Moller applied for disability retirement benefits from the Plan. The Social Security Administration denied Moller disability benefits in April, 1990, and the administrative law judge upheld the decision after reviewing the medical records provided by Dr. Goelzer, the two doctors from the Department of Otolaryngology at the Baylor College of Medicine, and testimony from a vocational rehabilitation expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-21\">The plan administrator reviewed Dr. Goel-zer\u2019s opinion and forwarded Moller\u2019s records to Dr. Warren, an employee of El Campo\u2019s parent company. In a memorandum dated June 12, 1990, Dr. Warren advised the Plan Administrator that the Social Security Administration had denied Moller\u2019s application and opined that Moller was ineligible for benefits under the Plan. The Plan then denied Moller disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-22\">On July 3,1991, Moller appealed the denial of her disability retirement claim under the Plan. According to the Plan, appeals were to be resolved by a \u201cMedical Board of Physicians, one appointed by the Company and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>one appointed by the Employee.\u201d If those two disagreed, they were to select a third physician to be appointed to the medical board, and a majority of the board would decide the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">Moller designated Dr. Goelzer as her physician on the medical board, and El Campo designated Dr. Warren. These physicians could not agree about Moller\u2019s eligibility for retirement benefits under the Plan, and they selected Dr. Bobby Alford of the Baylor College of Medicine as the third physician on the medical board. Dr. Alford\u2019s opinion would, in effect, determine Moller\u2019s eligibility for retirement benefits under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">In February 1992, Dr. Alford examined Moller. At that time, a series of tests were performed by Dr. Jenkins and other physicians at Baylor. Dr. Jenkins subsequently assumed Dr. Alford\u2019s role as the third physician on the medical board.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">On May 4,1993, Moller\u2019s attorney provided El Campo with a copy of the January 1993 decision by the Social Security Administration awarding Moller disability benefits. The Social Security Administration\u2019s reversal of its prior denial of benefits was based, in part, upon the testimony of Richard Ruppert, a vocational rehabilitation expert. The record reveals that neither El Campo nor Moller provided a copy of the 1993 Social Security Administration determination or a transcript of Ruppert\u2019s testimony to either Dr. Alford or Dr. Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">In response to the Social Security Administration\u2019s decision to award benefits to Mol-ler, Richard Webb, an El Campo administrator, returned Moller\u2019s file to Dr. Warren for further review based on El Campo\u2019s general policy \u201cto basically follow the Social Security determination unless there was strong reason to disagree with the decision.\u201d Webb noted that Tom Anderson, the El Campo personnel manager, disagreed with the Social Security Administration. Webb did not send notice of the award or the opinion supporting it to Dr. Jenkins.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">On July 12, 1993, Dr. Jenkins issued his final report, concluding that Moller \u201cis able to work at a stationary job in which she is not required to climb or do a lot of walking or operate heavy equipment without much difficulty_ I would not deem her as being totally incapacitated at this time.\u201d Dr. Warren concurred with this assessment on July 7, 1993. Because the majority of the medical board agreed that Moller was not permanently incapacitated, El Campo denied her claim in a letter dated October 18, 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">Moller then filed this suit, primarily claiming that El Campo breached its fiduciary duty when it failed to consider the 1993 Social Security Administration decision and the evidence underlying it, especially Rup-pert\u2019s opinion, in the appeal process. Although Moller advanced a number of theories upon which relief could be based, the only relief she prayed for was a remand to the plan administrator for reconsideration of eligibility based on a record that includes both the 1993 Social Security benefit award and a March 1995 report by Ruppert. Because we agree that remand to the plan administrator is appropriate, we need not address Moller\u2019s theories individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. </em>The relevant portion of ERISA states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-16\">In accordance with regulations of the Secretary, every employee benefit plan shall\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-17\">(1) provide adequate notice in writing to any participant or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the plan has been denied, setting forth the specific reasons for such denial, written in a manner calculated to be understood by the participant, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b165-18\">(2) afford a reasonable opportunity to any participant whose claim for benefits has been denied for a full and fair review by the appropriate named fiduciary of the decision denying the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b165-19\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1133. We believe that Moller was denied a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d when Dr. Jenkins reached his decision without readily available, relevant evidence before him.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-20\">It is clear that the Social Security Administration\u2019s disability decisions are relevant to El Campo\u2019s decisions regarding eligibility for retirement benefits under the Plan. This is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>true despite the fact that the Plan\u2019s eligibility requirements are more restrictive than those of the Social Security Administration.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> There is undisputed evidence that El Cam-po\u2019s general policy is to follow the decision of the Social Security Administration when determining eligibility for retirement benefits under the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-4\">Moreover, when El Campo denied Moller retirement benefits in 1990, it relied in part on the Social Security Administration\u2019s initial denial of disability benefits. When Dr. Warren wrote a memorandum advising El Campo to deny Moller retirement benefits in 1990, he noted that Moller \u201cwas denied Social Security disability benefits. This was sustained by the administrative law judge on April 30, 1990. It was his feeling that Melba was able to do many different kinds of work which would not endanger herself or others.\u201d Then, after quoting the definition of \u201cpermanently incapacitated\u201d under the Plan, Warren stated: \u201cConsequently, recognizing that Melba is capable of engaging in many occupations or employments, she, in my opinion, should be denied disability benefits [under the Plan] at this time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Finally, in the denial letter sent from Tom Anderson, the personnel manager at El Cam-po, to Moller on June 20, 1990, Anderson stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-6\">You applied for and have been denied Social Security Disability retirement benefits. The Administrative Law Judge, Forrest E. Stewart, denied. your appeal on 4/30/90. He stated, \u201cAlthough the claimant\u2019s additional nonexertional limitations do not allow her to perform the full range of light work, using the above-cited rule as a framework for decisionmaking, there are a significant number of jobs in the national economy which she could perform.\u201d Examples of such jobs are: catalog order clerk, desk clerk, dispatcher or alarm investigator.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-12\">The evidence in your case indicates that you are able to engage in a number of occupations or employments for remuneration or profit. The Company, therefore, has concluded that your application for disability retirement must be denied.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">In Anderson\u2019s denial letter, the excerpt from the Social Security Administration provides the only evidence that Moller is able to engage in a number of occupations. This is significant because in order to provide legally sufficient notice under ERISA, denial letters must state specifically the evidence upon which the denial is based.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> El Campo\u2019s notice is legally sufficient, then, only if El Cam-po has accepted the Social Security Administration\u2019s factual findings and conclusions as its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Given El Campo\u2019s past reliance on the Social Security Administration\u2019s decisions, we cannot state with confidence that the Administration\u2019s reversal of its denial of benefits was irrelevant to the doctors on Moller\u2019s medical board. Nor can we say that this evidence is so weak as to render remand a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>futile exercise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In particular, Ruppert\u2019s experience in the employment field may be of some value to the doctors on the medical board. In short, a \u201cfull and fair review\u201d of El Campo\u2019s initial denial of benefits required the medical board to consider the Social Security Administration\u2019s reversal of its own decision to deny benefits. Remand is therefore appropriate for the medical board to consider this new evidence. Of course, we express no opinion about the weight, if any, the doctors on the medical board should give this new evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Another question is a bother: what is this ease doing here? It should never have made its way into district court, much less into the Fifth Circuit. Both sides should have seen to it that the doctors on the medical board had all of the available evidence before them. And once it was known that relevant evidence had not been given to the doctors, the evidence should have been supplied to them for redetermination and the lawsuit dropped. The judiciary\u2019s scarce resources should not be wasted on problems the parties could have, and should have, taken care of themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is REVERSED and the case is REMANDED to the district court with instructions to REMAND the case to the plan administrator for reconsideration of Moller\u2019s eligibility for retirement benefits with the Social Security Administration\u2019s 1993 decision and Ruppert\u2019s 1995 report before them.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b164-15\">.
