The commissioner refused to find that either of these facts was proven. Even if the plaintiff is entitled to have the finding corrected so as to state that such a blow as that claimed was received by the decedent, whether it proximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>caused the pneumonia from which he died was an issue upon which the medical testimony was in decided conflict. The question was, therefore, one of fact for the commissioner to decide and the trial court was correct in dismissing the appeal. <em>Tippman </em>v. <em>State, </em>119 Conn. 1, 4, 174 Atl. 296.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
