Fitial (collectively, \u201cthe Commonwealth\u201d) appeal from the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Emerenciana Peter-Palican in Peter-Palican\u2019s suit against the Commonwealth alleging that then-Acting Governor Timothy Villagomez terminated her from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>her position as Special Assistant to the Governor for Women\u2019s Affairs in violation of Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution. The United States District Court for the District of the Northern Mariana Islands held that Article III, section 22 guarantees that once a governor appoints a Special Assistant to the Governor for Women\u2019s Affairs, that Special Assistant may never be terminated without cause \u2014 even beyond the term of the appointing governor. Relying on the Restatement (Second) of Torts, the district court held also that under Commonwealth law, there exists an implied private right of action for money damages against the Commonwealth for a violation of section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">We defer our consideration of this case and certify to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands Supreme Court the legal questions dispositive of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">All further proceedings in this case are stayed pending receipt of the answer to the certified questions or, if the Commonwealth Supreme Court decides not to accept certification, pending that decision. The parties shall notify the clerk of this court within seven days after the Supreme Court accepts or rejects certification, and again within seven days if the Supreme Court renders an opinion. The panel retains jurisdiction over further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-7\">QUESTIONS CERTIFIED</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-8\">Because resolution of this appeal depends on Commonwealth law and because we find no controlling precedent in the decisions of the Commonwealth Supreme Court, we respectfully request, pursuant to Rule 13 of the Northern Mariana Islands Supreme Court Rules, that the Commonwealth Supreme Court exercise its discretion to accept certification of the following legal questions, the answers to which may be determinative of this appeal:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-10\">1. Does Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which states that \u201c[t]he Special Assistant may be removed only for cause,\u201d mean that the Special Assistant may <em>never </em>be removed from that position without cause \u2014 even beyond the term of the appointing governor \u2014 or does it mean that the Special Assistant is protected against termination without cause <em>only </em>during the term of the appointing governor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1030-11\">2. If the answer to the above question is that Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution means the Special Assistant may never be removed for cause even beyond the term of the appointing governor, does Commonwealth law imply a private right of action for monetary damages against the Commonwealth or its officials for violation of that section?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1030-12\">We understand that the Commonwealth Supreme Court may reformulate our questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-13\">A determination of Commonwealth law with regard to the certified questions will resolve the issues pending before this court. If the Supreme Court declines certification, we will resolve the issues according to our understanding of Commonwealth law. To aid the Supreme Court in deciding whether to accept certification, we provide the following background.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-14\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-15\">STATEMENT OF FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-16\">The Commonwealth Constitution was amended in 1985 following the Second Constitutional Convention. The amendment included a provision establishing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1015\">*1015</page-number>Office of Special Assistant to the Governor for Women\u2019s Affairs. Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-4\">a) There is hereby established an Office of Special Assistant to the Governor for Women\u2019s Affairs. The governor shall appoint a person, who is qualified by virtue of education and experience, to be the special assistant. <em>The special assistant may be removed only for cause.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-5\">b) It is the responsibility and duty of the special assistant to formulate and implement a policy of affirmative action in the government and private sector to assist women achieve social, political and economic parity. The special assistant shall promote the interests of women, assist agencies of government and private organizations to plan and implement programs and services for women, monitor compliance of laws and regulations by government agencies and private organizations, organize community education strategies regarding the roles of women, and recommend to the governor and the legislature for consideration legislation of benefit to women.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-6\">c) The special assistant may be authorized to hire staff and shall promulgate rules and regulations in carrying out the responsibilities and duties of the office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1031-7\">d) The governor shall include in the budget of the executive branch the funding necessary to fully implement the provisions of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">N. Mar. I. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 22 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">In April 2002, then-Governor Juan Babauta appointed Peter-Palican as Special Assistant. Until Peter-Palican was appointed, each Special Assistant had resigned at or before the end of the term of the governor who appointed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">During the 2005 gubernatorial race, Peter-Palican campaigned for Governor Babauta\u2019s reelection, but Babauta was defeated by Benigno Fitial. In February 2006, Lieutenant Governor Timothy Villagomez, as Acting Governor in Governor Fitial\u2019s absence, informed Peter-Palican that her term as Special Assistant had ended when the new administration took office. The letter stated that Peter-Palican\u2019s actions in \u201ccontinuing to occupy the office of Special Assistant for Women\u2019s Affairs is contrary to Commonwealth law and custom\u201d and that Peter-Palican would need to vacate her office by April 8, 2006. Although Peter-Palican\u2019s internal Notice of Personnel Action established a four-year term of employment, Villagomez wrote that \u201cthe ministerial actions of those responsible for completing the paperwork necessary to effectuate your appointment cannot and do not change the legal character of your appointment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">Peter-Palican responded to the Lieutenant Governor by letter, stating that her appointment was protected by Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution, that she could be removed only \u201cfor cause,\u201d and that the administration had \u201cnot set forth any legal cause to terminate [her] appointment.\u201d She stated that she was \u201cprepared to discuss ... [an] amicable resolution of this matter,\u201d but there was no such resolution. Peter-Palican vacated her office on April 15, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-15\">Peter-Palican filed this action against the Commonwealth and Villagomez under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She asserted that she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>was removed without cause in violation of the Commonwealth Constitution and, therefore, without due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. She requested monetary damages and a mandatory injunction reinstating her to the Special Assistant position. She also brought claims for retaliation, breach of contract, and detrimental reliance. Peter-Palican did not plead an independent cause of action for violation of the Commonwealth Constitution, nor did she request that the court imply a private right of action into Article III, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">On Peter-Palican\u2019s motion for partial summary judgment, the district court, Judge Alex R. Munson, held that the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision in Article III, section 22 protected Peter-Palican from ever being removed without cause, even after the governor who appointed her left office. The court rejected the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the constitutional language was ambiguous and that the correct interpretation was that the \u201cfor cause\u201d protection lasted only through the term of the appointing governor. The court recognized that Peter-Palican\u2019s interpretation would allow a Special Assistant, who is responsible for implementing the policies of the governor with respect to women\u2019s issues, to serve under a governor who did not share her political or policy views. The district court concluded, however, that this \u201cunfortunate\u201d situation was not absurd or impracticable. The court thus held that Peter-Palican had a property interest in continued employment protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">The district court next concluded that Peter-Palican was not removed for cause. Concluding that Villagomez \u201cwas in possession of the plain language of the [Commonwealth] Constitution,\u201d the court held that he was not entitled to qualified immunity in his individual capacity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">On interlocutory appeal, we reversed the district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment to Villagomez on the basis of qualified immunity. We reasoned,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1032-10\">There is no case law interpreting the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands\u2019 constitutional provision creating the Special Assistant for Women\u2019s Affairs, and no special assistant before Emerenciana Peter-Palican asserted that the position\u2019s tenure extended past the term of the appointing governor. Any right Peter-Palican had to continued employment as special assistant past that term was therefore not clearly established. Even assuming that Acting Governor Timothy Villagomez took affirmative steps to terminate Peter-Palican\u2019s employment, ... he is entitled to qualified immunity in the absence of controlling authority interpreting the provision.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1032-11\"><em>Peter-Palican v. N. Mar. I., </em>332 Fed.Appx. 377, 378 (9th Cir.2009) (unpublished). Thus, Peter-Palican could not recover damages under \u00a7 1983 from the governor in his individual capacity. Governor Fitial was later substituted for Villagomez with respect to Peter-Palican\u2019s official capacity claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1017\">*1017</page-number>The case was assigned to district judge John C. Coughenour for a bench trial on Peter-Palican\u2019s remaining claims. Following a one-day trial, the district court relied on the law of the case doctrine and the previous summary judgment order in concluding that Peter-Palican had a \u201clegitimate claim of entitlement to her constitutionally created position and was entitled to some sort of procedure to contest her removal.\u201d Therefore, the court found that Peter-Palican\u2019s removal violated the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-4\">The district court ordered that PeterPalican be reinstated \u201cto a Commonwealth government position at a salary equal to or greater than that she had as Special Assistant for Women\u2019s Affairs.\u201d The court recognized, however, that a violation of Peter-Palican\u2019s right to due process could not be the basis of a damages award under \u00a7 1983 because the Commonwealth and its officials acting in their official capacity, when sued for monetary relief, are not \u201cpersons\u201d within the meaning of the statute. <em>DeNieva v. Reyes, </em>966 F.2d 480, 483 (9th Cir.1992); <em>but see Doe v. Lawrence Livermore Nat\u2019l Lab., </em>131 F.3d 836, 839 (9th Cir.1997) (\u2018When sued for <em>prospective injunctive relief, </em>a state official in his official capacity is considered a \u2018person\u2019 for \u00a7 1983 purposes.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">Finding that reinstating Peter-Palican would not fully compensate her for \u201cthe past wrong done to her by defendants for violating her Commonwealth due process rights under ... the Commonwealth Constitution,\u201d the court went on to conclude, sua sponte, that \u201cas a matter of law ... there is an implied cause of action against the Commonwealth government and its officials acting in their official capacities when the Commonwealth Constitution is violated and there is no express constitutional or statutory cause of action or remedy.\u201d The district court relied on the Restatement (Second) of Torts in awarding Plaintiff approximately $216,000 in damages under this implied constitutional tort theory. The court analogized its decision to <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Federal Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971), in which the United States Supreme Court recognized a damages remedy for a private citizen injured by a federal official\u2019s violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">There were no findings of fact on PeterPalican\u2019s other claims, and the district court denied the Commonwealth\u2019s post-judgment motion for a new trial, for amended or additional factual findings, or for an award of front pay in lieu of reinstatement. The district court did not address the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that Peter-Palican had never asserted an independent, implied right of action under Article III, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-8\">The Commonwealth appeals the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment to Peter-Palican, its findings and conclusions after the bench trial, and its denial of the Commonwealth\u2019s post-judgment motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-10\">EXPLANATION OF CERTIFICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">Rule 13 of the Northern Mariana Islands Supreme Court Rules allows a federal court to certify questions of Commonwealth law to that court. Certification may be requested if the certifying court believes that \u201c[t]he question may be determinative in the proceedings before it\u201d and \u201c[tjhere is no controlling precedent in the decisions of\u2019 the Commonwealth Supreme Court. N. Mar. I. Sup.Ct. Rule 13(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-12\">\u201cUse of certification rests in the sound discretion of this court.\u201d <em>In re Complaint of McLinn, </em>744 F.2d 677, 681 (9th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1018\">*1018</page-number>1984). The Commonwealth now asks for certification, even though it did not raise the certification issue before the district court. \u201c[Particularly compelling reasons must be shown when certification is requested for the first time on appeal by a movant who lost on the issue below.\u201d <em>Id. </em>As we explain below, because of the importance of territorial sovereignty in matters of territorial governance and the lack of clear answers in Commonwealth law, we conclude that such compelling reasons exist in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-5\">The Absence of Controlling Precedent</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-6\">There is no controlling precedent on the meaning of Article III, section 22, as no Commonwealth court has ever interpreted that provision. Further, we disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the provision is so clear that it can be interpreted in only one way.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-7\">Under the principles of statutory interpretation applicable in Commonwealth law, \u201clanguage must be given its plain meaning.\u201d <em>N. Mar. College v. Civil Serv. Comm\u2019n, </em>2007 MP 8, \u00b6 9, 2007 WL 949763 (N.Mar.I.2007). \u201cThe general principles which apply to statutory construction are equally applicable in cases of constitutional construction.\u201d <em>Camacho v. N. Mar. Retirement Fund, </em>1 N.M.I. 131, 134, 1990 WL 291962 (N.Mar.I.1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). Commonwealth courts \u201capply the plain, commonly understood meaning of constitutional language unless there is evidence that a contrary meaning was intended.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-8\">However, \u201clanguage must be read in the context of the entire\u201d provision, <em>Town House, Inc. v. Saburo, </em>2003 MP 2, \u00b6 11, 6 N.M.I. 529, 2003 WL 24270646 (N.Mar.I.2003), and \u201c[a] court should avoid interpretations of a statutory [or constitutional] provision which would defy common sense or lead to absurd results,\u201d <em>Commonwealth Ports Auth. v. Hakubotan Saipan Enters., Inc., </em>2 N.M.I. 212, 224, 1991 WL 258324 (N.Mar.I.1991) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted). If a provision is ambiguous, a court\u2019s objective \u201cis to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.\u201d <em>Aguon v. Marianas Pub. Land Corp., </em>2001 MP 4, \u00b6 30, 6 N.M.I. 233, 2001 WL 34876571 (N.Mar.I.2001) (per curiam). In determining the drafters\u2019 intent, the statute or constitutional provision \u201cmust be read as a whole, and not as isolated words contained therein,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201c[o]ne statutory [or constitutional] provision should not be construed to make another provision inconsistent or meaningless,\u201d <em>In re Estate of Rofag, </em>2 N.M.I. 18, 29, 1991 WL 70067 (N.Mar.I.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-10\">The constitutional language at issue here appears to us to be ambiguous because there are two reasonable interpretations of Article III, section 22. We begin with Peter-Palican\u2019s suggested interpretation. As counsel noted at oral argument, the final sentence of subsection (a), upon which Peter-Palican relies, contains only nine words: \u201cThe special assistant may be removed only for cause.\u201d There are no textual exceptions to the \u201cfor cause\u201d termination requirement, nor is there any express limitation on the term of the Special Assistant. Unless \u201ccause\u201d includes a change in the administration, which the Commonwealth does not argue, the \u201cfor cause\u201d sentence could be read to mean that the protection from termination extends indefinitely.</p>\n<p id=\"b1034-11\">In addition to the constitutional text, Peter-Palican points to the history of the Second Constitutional Convention to support her argument that a sitting governor cannot without cause remove a former governor\u2019s Special Assistant. The initial draft <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1019\">*1019</page-number>of the language of Article III, section 22 stated that the Special Assistant \u201cshall serve at the pleasure of the governor.\u201d Such a provision would have allowed the governor to remove the Special Assistant at any time and for any reason. <em>See DeLeon Guerrero v. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Lands, </em>2011 MP 3, \u00b6 10, 2011 WL 1316819 (N.Mar.I. March 31, 2011) (not yet certified for publication) (stating that the phrase \u201cat the pleasure of\u2019 in the context of employment is \u201ca synonym for \u2018at-will\u2019 \u201d). But the final draft, amended after a public hearing, used the \u201cfor cause\u201d language instead. The record does not disclose precisely what occurred at the public hearing, but from the textual change we assume that the hearing likely included at least some discussion of termination protections for the Special Assistant.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-4\">At oral argument, both parties hypothesized that the Second Constitutional Convention intended at least to some degree to depoliticize the position, to insulate it from the political games that might otherwise influence a governor\u2019s decision to replace a Special Assistant. Counsel for Peter-Palican stated that the Special Assistant was intended to be a kind of gadfly, whose purpose of advancing women\u2019s rights \u2014 and her actions in furtherance of that purpose \u2014 could trigger animosity among other government officials. Such a person would need some sort of protection against her removal in order for her to be nonpolitical and effective. Thus, it could be that the Convention intended section 22 to mean that the Special Assistant may <em>never </em>be removed without cause, even by a subsequent governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-5\">We do not believe this is the <em>only </em>rational construction of the provision, however. The Commonwealth argues that other language in section 22, when read in context with the \u201cfor cause\u201d sentence, supports such an alternate interpretation, as does the nature of the office itself. In addition to the \u201cfor cause\u201d provision, section 22 also states that <em>\u201c[t]he governor shall appoint </em>a person, who is qualified by virtue of education and experience, to be the special assistant.\u201d (emphasis added). For several reasons, it seems reasonable to construe the words \u201cthe governor\u201d to mean <em>\u201ceach </em>governor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-7\">First, just as there is no express limitation on the term of the Special Assistant once a governor appoints her, there is also no express limitation on any <em>subsequent </em>governor\u2019s power or responsibility to appoint a Special Assistant. Without any such limitation in the text or further explanation in case law, an incoming governor might indeed have the power to appoint a special assistant of that governor\u2019s choice. Reading the \u201cgovernor shall appoint\u201d language together with the \u201cfor cause\u201d language could suggest that the Special Assistant is protected from termination without cause by the governor who appointed her, but that such protection does not extend past the term of that appointing governor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1035-8\">Second, as the Commonwealth points out, the Special Assistant is a cabinet-level appointee. She is charged with formulating and implementing the policy of the governor with respect to affirmative action and women\u2019s issues, assisting administrative agencies with implementing such programs, recommending legislation to the governor and the legislature, and promulgating administrative regulations regarding women\u2019s rights. N. Mar. I. Const., art. Ill, \u00a7 22. The Special Assistant works closely with the governor and his administration, and if Peter-Palican\u2019s interpretation is correct, a governor might be forced to confer with a Special Assistant who does not share the governor\u2019s preferred policies on women\u2019s issues. Some political appointments, in order to accomplish their objectives, require that the appointees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1020\">*1020</page-number>agree with the administration on policy-making and on those policies themselves. <em>Cf. Branti v. Finkel, </em>445 U.S. 507, 515-16, 517-18, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980) (a public employee may be terminated on the basis of political belief without violating the First Amendment if \u201cthe government can demonstrate an overriding interest of vital importance,\u201d for example, if the employee\u2019s position requires \u201cthat a person\u2019s private beliefs conform to those of the hiring authority\u201d or involves policy-making or confidentiality (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-4\">The Commonwealth notes that, in some jurisdictions, \u201c[t]he general rule is that a governmental body may not, in the exercise of its powers, appoint an individual to a term extending beyond the term of office of the governmental body. The term of an appointed office ... expires with the expiration of the term of the appointing body.\u201d <em>Rawlins v. Levy Court of Kent County, </em>235 A.2d 840, 841 (Del.1967). Such a default rule can be justified by the nature of the political branches of government. Each administration generally has the same powers and duties as the next \u2014 or the former. <em>See Zerr v. Tilton, </em>224 Kan. 394, 581 P.2d 364, 372 (1978) (\u201cAnd the test generally applied is whether the contract at issue, extending beyond the term [of the contracting authority], is an attempt to bind successors in matters incident to their own administration and responsibilities ...[,] [i]n [which] case the contract is generally held invalid.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-5\">Under this reasoning, just as one governor has the power to appoint a Special Assistant, so might the next governor. This is not to say that the Commonwealth cannot alter this general rule, but it does give us reason to be wary of adopting Peter-Palican\u2019s interpretation without further guidance from the Commonwealth Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-7\">Finally, the Convention\u2019s substitution of the ultimate \u201cfor cause\u201d language for the initial \u201cat the pleasure of the governor\u201d language is not dispositive of the meaning of Article III, section 22. Although the change in the proposed amendment certainly evidences an intent to ensure that the Special Assistant\u2019s appointment would not be at-will, it does not necessarily follow that the Special Assistant'can remain in office even under a subsequent \u2014 and unwilling \u2014 administration. With no evidence in the record of the substance of the public hearing on the draft of the 1985 constitutional amendment, we cannot say with certainty that the Convention intended to grant the Special Assistant a lifetime appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-8\">Our concerns engendered by the lack of controlling precedent are equally applicable to the implied constitutional tort theory utilized by the district court under the Restatement (Second) of Torts. Article III, section 22 says nothing about a private right of action, unlike other provisions of the Commonwealth Constitution that expressly address the issue. <em>See, e.g., </em>N. Mar. I. Const, art. I, \u00a7 3(c) (\u201cA person adversely affected by an illegal search or seizure has a cause of action against the government within limits provided by law.\u201d); N. Mar. I. Const, art. X, \u00a7 9 (\u201cA taxpayer may bring an action against the government or one of its instrumentalities in order to enjoin the expenditure of public funds for other than public purposes or for a breach of fiduciary duty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1036-9\">The Commonwealth Code adopts the Restatements \u201cin the absence of written law or local customary law to the contrary.\u201d 7 N. Mar. I.Code \u00a7 3401. The Restatement (Second) of Torts permits, <em>but does not require, </em>a court to imply a right of action for a violation of a statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1021\">*1021</page-number>or constitutional right where there is no express remedy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-4\">When a legislative provision protects a class of persons by proscribing or requiring certain conduct but does not provide a civil remedy for the violation, <em>the court may, </em>if it determines that the remedy is appropriate in furtherance of the purpose of the legislation and needed to assure the effectiveness of the provision, accord to an injured member of the class a right of action, using a suitable existing tort action or a new cause of action analogous to an existing tort action.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1037-5\">[Comment a.] As used in this Section, the term \u201clegislative provision\u201d includes ... constitutional provisions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AKn\">Restatement (Second) Torts, \u00a7 874A <em>&amp; </em>cmt. a (emphasis added). Section 874A uses the word \u201cmay\u201d; therefore, implying a private right of action for damages for a violation of the Commonwealth Constitution is permissive rather than mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-6\">The Commonwealth Supreme Court has not yet considered whether Article III, section 22 gives rise to a private right of action. In fact, we have found only two cases in which \u00a7 874A of the Restatement was cited, and in both cases the court declined to address the issue. <em>Juan v. N. Mar. I., </em>2001 MP 18, \u00b6 27, 6 N.M.I. 322, 2001 WL 34883536 (N.Mar.I.2001) (\u201cAssuming, without deciding, that Article I, \u00a7 3(c) [of the Commonwealth Constitution] directly provides a private right of action, persons subjected to an illegal or wrongful search or seizure! ] have a right to institute a civil action against the government for damages.\u201d); <em>Charfauros v. Bd. of Elections, </em>1998 MP 16, \u00b6 42 n. 8, 5 N.M.I. 188, 1998 WL 34073646 (N.Mar.I.1998) (\u201cPlaintiffs asserted no cause of action in the complaint for damages arising from the violation of Article I, \u00a7 6 [of the Commonwealth Constitution]. We need not now, therefore, consider whether such an action is \u2018appropriate\u2019 or \u2018necessary\u2019 under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 874A.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-8\">The permissive nature of \u00a7 874A persuades us that the Supreme Court is better equipped to resolve the question. We have little specialized expertise in Commonwealth law and, therefore, little way of knowing whether, faced with the situation here, a Commonwealth court would exercise its discretion under \u00a7 874A to imply a private right of action. The important question of whether the territorial government may be sued, particularly for money damages, pursuant to a private right of action implied from that territory\u2019s constitution should not to be decided in the first instance by a federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-10\">The Answers to the Certified Questions Will Be Determinative</p>\n<p id=\"b1037-11\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision on the first certified question \u2014 the interpretation of Article III, section 22 \u2014 will definitively resolve the question of whether PeterPalican can pursue a \u00a7 1983 due process claim for violation of that provision. The threshold requirement of a due process claim is the existence of a liberty or property interest. The Due Process Clause prohibits the government from depriving an individual of such an interest without following the proper procedures for doing so. Property interests \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state [or territorial] law,\u201d <em>Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales, </em>545 U.S. 748, 756, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005) (internal quotation marks omitted), and \u201c[p]ublic employees who may be dismissed only for cause possess a property interest in their continued <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1022\">*1022</page-number>employment,\u201d <em>Walls v. Cent. Contra Costa Transit Auth., </em>653 F.3d 963, 968 (9th Cir.2011) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-4\">Thus, if the Commonwealth Constitution granted Peter-Palican a property interest in continued employment even beyond the term of former Governor Babauta, her due process rights could have been violated when the Commonwealth allowed her no opportunity to contest the constitutionality of her dismissal. If, however, Peter-Palican had no such property interest, then she has no colorable due process claim. Similarly, the Supreme Court\u2019s answer to the second certified question will conclusively determine whether Peter-Palican can assert an independent claim for damages under Article III, section 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-7\">There is no controlling precedent on the meaning of Article III, section 22 of the Commonwealth Constitution or on the existence of an implied private right of action for violation of that section. The Commonwealth Supreme Court\u2019s answers to the certified questions will be determinative of the issues in this appeal, and that court is in a much better position to interpret its own constitution. Because the Commonwealth Supreme Court should have the opportunity to define the meaning of the Commonwealth\u2019s foundational document, \u201cconsiderations of comity and federalism favor resolution of the certified question[s] by [the Commonwealth\u2019s] highest court.\u201d <em>Orange Cnty. Dep\u2019t of Educ. v. Cal. Dep\u2019t of Educ., </em>650 F.3d 1268, 1269 (9th Cir.2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we respectfully request that the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands accept certification of the two questions identified in Part I of this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-10\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-11\">ADMINISTRATIVE INFORMATION</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-12\">Counsel for the parties are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-13\">For Plaintiff-Appellee Emerenciana Peter-Palican:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1038-14\">Douglas F.
