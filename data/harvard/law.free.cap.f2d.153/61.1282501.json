Section 211(a) (1) (A)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 11expressly includes \u201cinterest\u201d and \u201crents\u201d but not royalties. Yet the following legislative history shows, we think, that Congress intended to include royalties. From 1918 to 1934, inclusive, the Revenue Acts successively contained a provision \u2014 substantially like the present \u00a7 143(b), 26 U.S. C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u2014 for a withholding tax on all \u201crent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, * * * or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income\u201d of a nonresident alien. Royalties were not mentioned. The provisions as to the extent of such an alien\u2019s liability for tax, however, explicitly included gross income derived, inter alia, from sales of personal property within the United States<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and from \u201crents or royalties from property located in the United States or from any interest in such property, including rentals or royalties for the use of of the privilege of using in the United States, patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trade-marks, trade brands,' franchises, and other like property.\u201d 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 119(a) (4), (e). Despite the differences in these provisions, the Treasury Regulations, under the successive Acts from 1924 to 1934, inclusive, provided that the withholding provisions excluded income derived from the sale of property but included \u201croyalties.\u201d By amendment of the Act in 1936, the provision as to liability for tax was restricted, as we find it now in \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A), so that its coverage became the same as that of the withholding provision. Congress, we think, must have intended the liability for tax provision, thus amended, to be interpreted as the Treasury Regulation had previously interpreted the withholding provision, i. e., to include royalties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> And the Regulation interpreting \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A) so provides.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">The taxpayers, however, contend that \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A) is inapplicable here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>because the transferee here (1) paid a lump sum for (2) the acquisition in toto of a specific part (although less than all) of the author\u2019s \u201cbundle of rights\u201d under his copyright; such a payment, say taxpayers, is not a payment of \u201croyalties\u201d but of the purchase price on a sale of personal property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We cannot agree. We think that this, at least, is true: Where a copyright owner transfers to any particular transferee substantially less than the entire \u201cbundle of rights\u201d conferred by the copyright, then payment therefor, whether in one sum or in several payments, constitutes royalties within the meaning of \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A). For such a transfer is the grant of a license.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Payment for the grant of such a license is measured by reference to the future use or expected use of the license by the licensee, and is often payable in installments; but it is no less a royalty paid for such use when disbursed in a single amount.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We think that Congress therefore meant to include such payments within the phrase \u201cother fixed or determinable * * * periodical gains, profits, and income\u201d even if, in some particular instance, or by a practice which has grown up as to some types of such licenses, payment is made in a single sum. It is like interest paid for several years in one sum or rent paid in advance for the use of a building for a period of years; as such a payment of interest or rent surely would come within the subsection,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> so, we hold, does the payment here.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The phrase, we hold, is descriptive of the nature or type of income, regardless of the actual manner of payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">In Sabatini v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 98 F.2d 753, we held that income, consisting of a lump sum payment, under a contract fnade in England for the transfer by a nonresident alien of the world-wide right to produce motion pictures for a limited period, was not derived from a sale of property in England but was taxable as royalties, paid in advance, for the use in the United States. The withholding provision was not involved. The tax on aliens at that time included a tax on the proceeds of a sale of personal property, but not if the property was produced without and sold without the United States; however, the tax, as noted above, also included a tax on \u201croyalties for the use of or for the privilege of using in the United States * * * copyrights, * * * and other like property.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In the Sabatini case, we assumed that, because the contract was made in England, if the transaction was a \u201csale,\u201d it was not taxable; holding that it was not a sale, we held that the proceeds were taxable as royalties. True, there the transfer was but for a limited time, while here the time is unlimited; that w;e think is a distinction without a difference, since here, as in Sabatini, the transfer was but of a limited part of the author\u2019s bundle of rights, for Rohmer transferred only his serial rights, reserving, inter alia, the book rights, motion picture rights and most of the dramatic rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">It is also true that the section as to the extent of tax liability before us in the Sabatini case did not contain the phrase, found in \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A), \u201cor other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and' income.\u201d It is therefore argued that, even if royalties are covered by \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A), they must be royalties which have the feature of being paid as \u201cannual or periodical\u201d income. In rejecting that argument we rely, again, on the legislative history: The 1936 amendment excluded the proceeds of sales, theretofore taxed, from the taxable in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>comes of nonresident aliens engaged in trade or business in this country and not having office or place of business here. At the time of enacting that amendment, the Congressional Committee Reports stated that the purpose was to tax \u201cgross income from interest, dividends, .rents, wages, and salaries and other \u25a0 fixed and determinable income,\u201d but said that, by the amendment, \u201cthe tax on capital gains\u201d of such aliens was to be excluded, <em>\u201cit having been found impossible to effectively collect this latter tax * </em>* * \u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Reports also said, \u201cIt is believed that the proposed revision' of our system of taxing non-resident aliens * * * will be <em>productive of substantial amounts of additional revenue, since it replaces a theoretical system impractical of administration in a great number of cases</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We think that these Reports show that Congress intended the words \u201cother fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits and income\u201d to be interpreted to mean \u201cother fixed and determinable income,\u201d and to include therein a lump sum paid for the use of a copyright in the United States. Such a payment for a license is both \u201cfixed\u201d and easily \u201cdeterminable,\u201d and it is not at all \u201cimpossible to effectively collect\u201d a tax thereon. Accordingly, we think that Congress did not intend to exclude such a tax; for Congress avowedly sought \u201csubstantial amounts * * * of revenue\u201d from taxation of nonresident aliens and aimed primarily to replace \u201ca theoretical system impractical of administration.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In thus stressing the legislative history, we are following many recent decisions of the Supreme Court.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We confess that the Congressional purpose is not crystal-clear and that the legislative history does not put beyond all conceivable doubt the purpose to impose a tax on such transactions as that before us here. But, after careful study, we believe we have arrived at the correct interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">It is argued, however, that General Aniline &amp; Film Corp. v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 759, which involved the withholding provision, \u00a7 143(b), compels reversal here. But there we held that the transfer was such that the transferee probably acquired title to the patents; at any rate, we considered that virtually all the patentee\u2019s rights passed to the transferee, so that there was a sale. It was that fact, and not the fact that (as to one of the contracts) a lump sum payment was made, which led to our conclusion that a sale had occurred and therefore no withholding was required. Cf. Commissioner v. Celanese Corporation, 78 U.S.App.D.C. 292, 140 F.2d 339. To be sure, in the General Aniline case [139 F.2d 760], we said that it was unimportant that the patentee, before making the assignment, \u201chad granted to others some rights\u201d under the patents; but, as the record shows that the extent of those previous grants was not disclosed' to us, we must be taken as having regarded them as relatively insubstantial;<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> consequently, as we regarded the case, the patentee had transferred to a single grantee substantially all the rights it had originally acquired as patentee under the patents.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">In Goldsmith v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 143 F.2d 466, a resident citizen of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the United .States transferred the exclusive motion picture rights in a copyrighted play to an American corporation receiving annual payments therefor, which he treated in his income tax return as capital gains realized from the sale of capital assets and consequently taxable at capital gain rates. This court held unanimously that the payments were taxable not as capital gains under \u00a7 117 of the 1938 Act, 26 U.S.C.A.Int.Rev.Acts, page 1061, but as ordinary income. But the members of the court differed as to the basis of the decision. Judge Chase said the grant of exclusive rights was not the \u201csale\u201d of capital assets but the grant of an exclusive license, with the consequence that the payments were royalties. Judges Learned Hand and Swan said that it was immaterial whether \u201ctitle\u201d passed and that the grant of an exclusive license was a \u201csale\u201d b11t not of \u201ccapital assets\u201d as defined in \u00a7 117(a) (1), because the licenses were \u201cheld by the taxpayer primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of his trade or business.\u201d As the legal result was the same in that case, whichever of the two rationales was accepted, the choice of rationale could there have no practical effect. And, because of the differing histories and purposes of \u00a7 117 and \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A), respectively, we think that the views expressed by the majority in the Goldsmith case have no bearing here. It is well to remember that the concepts employed in construing one section of a statute are not necessarily pertinent when construing another with a distinguishable background.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-4\">2. The publishing company acquired for $10,000 both the American and Canadian serial rights. If the taxpayers had shown that more was paid than would have been if the Canadian rights had not been acquired, then, to that extent, there would have been no tax since the additional amount paid would not have been a royalty for the use of the copyright in this country.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> But taxpayers, who had the burden, offered no direct proof on that <em>- </em>subject. An obvious and easy source of such proof, had the facts been as taxpayers contended, would have been the testimony of one of the editors of Liberty Magazine, but none of those editors was called as a witness. Instead, the taxpayers offered proof that the United States circulation of the magazine was 2,302,296 and the Canadian, 190,622, and testimony to the effect that from $1,000 to $1,500 each had been paid by some magazines for Canadian serial rights to the works of other lesser authors. The Tax Court decided that this evidence did not \u201cfurnish a sufficient basis upon which\u201d it could \u201cdetermine that any of the income was derived from sources outside the United States.\u201d Although, if we were called upon to decide that question of fact, we might regard the evidence as sufficient, we cannot say that the Tax Court unreasonably refused to do so.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> For, at best, such evidence would lead to conjectural inferences.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-15\">3. The amount retained by the agent represented his commission, a part of Rohmer\u2019s expense. Since the tax is on the gross income from United States sources, such an expense item could not properly be deducted.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b116-13\"> It reads: \u201cThere shall be levied, collected, and paid for each taxable year, in lieu of the tax imposed by sections 11 and 12, upon the amount received, by every nonresident alien individual not engaged in trade or business within the United States and not having an office or place of business therein, from sources within the United States as interest (except interest on deposits with persons carrying on the banking business), dividends, rents, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, and income, a tax of 15 per centum of such amount * * Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 211(a) (1) (A), as amended by Revenue Act 1940, \u00a7 4, 26 U.S.C.A.

But his \u201cmonopoly\u201d power is not markedly distinct from that of owners of other sorts of \u201cproperty.\u201d For it is of the essence of \u201cproperty,\u201d generally, that its owner lias the right, enforceable by court action, to exclude others from its use, absent his consent; and that power to exclude is what \u201cmonopoly\u201d ordinarily means. See Standard Brands, Inc. v. Smidler, 2 Cir., 151 F.2d 34, 38, 39, note 7.

We think that our decision that the \u2018 down payments were not royalties and were therefore outside the withholding provision would have been unquestionably correct, had it plainly appeared that they bore no relation to expected future profits from the patents\u2019 use. Since perhaps that fact in that case was not entirely clear, it is well to warn the bar that our decision that the down payments under those contracts were not within the statute should not be deemed an unshakable precedent. It is to be noted that we said that \u201cthe passing of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>title does not preclude the existence of royalties.\u201d Commissioner v.
