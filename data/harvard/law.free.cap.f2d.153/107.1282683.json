Taxpayer owned'148 shares of stock of the bank out of a total of 5\u00a1000 outstanding. His salary as the bank\u2019s president was $10,000 on September 28, 1931, when he signed the indemnity agreements, and was reduced to $5,500 about 2)4 years later, on January 1, 1934. The potential liability of' $100,000 which taxpayer contracted under those agreements had no reasonable business relation to the loss he would have suffered had the bank been closed. The trial judge found that the agreements provided that \u201cif the sale of bonds resulted in a profit, the profit was the bank\u2019s and not the subscribers\u2019 \u201d among whom was the taxpayer. We think that the trial judge made an unjustifiable inference when he said that taxpayer\u2019s participation in the agreements \u201cwas a normal business transaction made to protect his extensive interests and substantial salaries in the various corporations, particularly\u201d the bank. Accordingly, the transaction did not come within either (a) or (e) of Section 23. See Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212; Burnet v. Clark, 287 U.S. 410, 53 S.Ct. 207, 77 L.Ed. 397; In re Park\u2019s Estate, 2 Cir., 58 F.2d 965. On the' facts here, Dunn &amp; McCarthy v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 139 F.2d 242, is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-20\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
