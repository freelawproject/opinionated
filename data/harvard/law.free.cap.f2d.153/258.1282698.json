Had the motion been so treated, the question would then arise whether the allegations in the verified complaint were not so contradictory or ambiguous as to preclude relief in the form of a summary judgment. However, we do not feel that it is incumbent Upon us to decide that question at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-10\">Treating the motion to dismiss as one addressed simply to the sufficiency of the pleadings, it is apparent that the allegations of the Administrator\u2019s complaint were sufficient under Rule 8(a) (2) 'of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, 28 U.S.C.A. following section 723c. The rule requires merely a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d All that was necessary to show the Administrator\u2019s standing to sue was a statement that the trucks had been purchased for use in the course of trade or business and that, consequently, the buyer was not a person entitled to bring the action, Bowles v. Glick Bros. Lumber Co., 9 Cir., 146 F.2d 566. That the Administrator chose to draw his complaint in the words of the statute is not objectionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">The proper procedure would appear to be the consolidation of the two claims under Federal Rule 42(a), thereby avoiding any conflict between the alternative plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-13\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
