A hearing was had upon the issues thus raised. Such issues were decided adversely to petitioner, and on January 15, 1946, the court ordered the dismissal of the petition. From this order petitioner appeals. The court below refused petitioner\u2019s application for a certificate of probable cause. An examination of the record discloses, so we think, that there is no justification for an issuance by this court of such certificate. It follows that we are without jurisdiction to entertain the appeal. 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-23\">The appeal is, therefore, dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
