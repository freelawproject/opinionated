Admittedly petitioner has his remedy by appeal, and we see no reason why that remedy is not altogether adequate in the circumstances of this case. Cf. In re Chapman, 156 U..S. 211, 15 S.Ct. 331, 39 L.Ed. 401; United States ex rel. Deffer v. Kimball, 7 App.D.C. 499; and see Note (1942) 141 A.L.R. 1262 et seq. We accordingly express no opinion on the point involved.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
