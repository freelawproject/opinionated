Comm\u2019r., 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L. Ed. 248; that contrary findings are not when there is evidence contra, compelled by the fact that there was a speculative market in such securities at merely nominal value during the tax and preceding years, Brown v. Comm\u2019r., 6 Cir., 94 F.2d 101; Gowen v. Comm\u2019r., 6 Cir., 65 F.2d 923; Jeffery v. Comm\u2019r., 6 Cir., 62 F.2d 661, and that a decision as to worthlessness of property involved a question of fact rather than one of law, Brown v. Comm\u2019r, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-27\">Wherefore, The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
