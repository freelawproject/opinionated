It was begun by motion to reopen and rein<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>state Cause No. 1805 in Bankruptcy, Joseph <em>Benton </em>Wheat, Debtor, and to obtain Section 75, sub. s<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> relief therein. This was filed on September 20, 1943, more than six years after the bankruptcy court had in the debtor proceeding entered its order authorizing the mortgagee to proceed with its foreclosure and more than five years after the debtor proceeding had been dismissed. It was met with a denial of petitioner\u2019s claim that he had, as he alleged, filed in 1937 a Section 75, sub. s, proceeding, and also with pleas by way of estoppel and bar. These were: (1) The December 13, 1937 order of the bankruptcy court denying debtor\u2019s petition for an injunction and authorizing Texas Land &amp; Mortgage Company to proceed with its foreclosure; (2) the trustee\u2019s sale of January 4, 1938; (3) the final judgment dated February 3, 1938, entered in Cause No. 3231 in the District Court of Howard County, Texas, awarding Texas Land &amp; Mortgage Company title and possession of the premises, and not appealed from; (4) the order of March 30, 1938, dismissing the debtor proceeding; (5) the sale thereafter in 1938 by Texas Land &amp; Mortgage Company to one O\u2019Daniel, which sale plaintiff, receiving part of the commission, actively helped to bring about by assuring O\u2019Daniel that the Texas Land &amp; Mortgage Company had title; and (6) the judgment<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in Cause No. 4067 in the District Court of Howard County, Texas, brought by J. B. Wheat against Texas Land &amp; Mortgage Company and E. T. O\u2019Daniel, defendants, to recover title and possession to the land in controversy, and to set aside the judgment in Cause No. 3231.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-19\">On November 29, 1944, two unsecured creditors joined in the prayer of the debtor to reopen and reinstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-20\">The district judge, after a hearing on all the matters set up in the motion to reopen and in the answers in opposition, at which the only controverted issue was as to whether claimant had, as he claimed, filed with the conciliation commissioner a subsection s petition, found the facts and law to be substantially as alleged by defendant.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>This appeal is from the judgment refusing the motion to reopen and reinstate the debtor proceeding, but authorizing mov-ant, if so advised, to file proceedings in bankruptcy, without prejudice, however, to O\u2019DaniePs title to the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">From this judgment, Wheat, the debtor, alone appeals. Putting his trust in Kalb v. Feuerstein, 308 U.S. 433, <em>60 </em>S.Ct. 343, 84 L.Ed. 370, and the many cases which have held that Section 75 of the Bankruptcy Apt<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> subjects to exclusive federal jurisdiction the farmer debtor and his property, automatically<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> stops all foreclosure proceedings in state court suits after debtor petition is filed unless consent of the bankruptcy court is given in strict accordance with the requirements of the statute,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> he insists that the foreclosure was ineffective and the state court judgments were invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Appellees, relying on Union Joint Stock Land Bank v. Byerly, 310 U.S. 1, <em>60 </em>S.Ct. 773, 84 L.Ed. 1041, Bernards v. Johnson, 314 U.S. 19, 62 S.Ct. 30, 86 L.Ed. 11, and the many cases decided on their authority, insist: that the order of the bankruptcy court authorizing the mortgagee to proceed with the trustee\u2019s sale' was not void but merely erroneous; and that not appealed from but acquiesced in, it became final and furnished full support for the judgment in the first state court suit. They insist further: that the order of March, 1938, dismissing the debtor proceeding was likewise, if not correct, merely erroneous; that it became final when not appealed from so that the bankruptcy court lost jurisdiction of the debtor and his property; and that the property having thereafter been sold to O\u2019Daniel and judgment entered in his favor in the state court suit, it is too late now to attempt to reopen the debtor proceeding.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Finally, pointing out that plaintiff, after all these things had transpired, invoked the jurisdiction of the state court in a suit of trespass to try title, tendered for trial and decision there every point and issue which he now makes, and there suffered a final adverse judgment,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> they insist that he is now finally barred and estopped by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">We agree with appellees. Every matter in controversy in this present litigation, except whether appellant, after his debtor petition failed, filed in the proceeding and prosecuted a Section 75, sub. s petition, were raised and expressly decided in the state court case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> That question, though not expressly raised and decided, was within the compass of the tendered issues, and under the settled principles of res judicata it was settled and concluded by the judgment. To permit plaintiff to again litigate the questions already litigated and decided against him would be in complete violation of the principle that matters once determined may not be again litigated. If, therefore, we could agree with appellant that the issues had been wrongly decided in the state court, we should never<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>theless affirm the judgment here. But we do not agree with the appellant. We agree fully with the disposition made and the reasons given in the state court opinion, and, without burdening this opinion, therefore, with further statement of the facts or discussion of the legal questions raised, we content ourselves with saying that for the reasons set out in that opinion, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Ask3\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-8\"> See. 203 sub. s, Title 11, U.S.O.A., without exception, limitation or \u2022qualification provides: \u2018\u2018(s) Any farmer failing to obtain the acceptance of a majority in number and amount of all creditors whose claims are affected by a composition and/or extension proposal, or if he feels aggrieved by the com position and/or extension, may amend his petition or answer, asking to bo adjudged a bankrupt.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\"> Affirmed, Wheat v.
