Accordingly the court allowed penalties for fifteen violations as to each employee, and denied recovery on fifteen counts relating to each employee. From the judgment denying recovery on the thirty counts, the United States appealed. Here the appellant contends that the evidence does not warrant the finding of an emergency nor the exercise of diligence on the part of appellee to avoid the penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-25\">The facts giving rise to this action are set forth in the opinion of the trial judge. Briefly stated, the defendant employs three telegraphers on 8 hour shifts for continuous service at Robbins, S. C. This is a mere, junction of two railroads over which thirty trains pass daily. It is located in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>edge of a Savannah River swamp. There are no houses of any kind and the employees live in box cars. From December 1 to 30, the defendant worked two men twelve hours each day of twenty-four hours because of its inability to secure a third man.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The Government contends each day each employee worked more than nine hours in any twenty-four period constitutes a violation of the Act for which it is entitled to a penalty. The pertinent provisions of the Act are printed below.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">The defendant contended in the trial court that the conditions prevailing at Robbins during December, 1943, amounted to a \u201ccasualty\u201d which rendered the limitation of hours of service inapplicable. However, it did not appeal from the judgment allowing recovery on thirty counts. But it contends that the trial court should be sustained in its finding that an emergency existed throughout December, 1943, thus permitting an employee to work twelve hours per day of twenty-four hours on three days each week, without incurring a penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Section 62 limits the hours of service of railroad employees generally hut the proviso cited in the foot note specifically deals with telegraphers and dispatchers. The reason for the proviso seems to arise on account of limiting the hours of their employment to a shorter period than other employees. Telegraphers are limited to nine hours per day of twenty-four hours in places of continuous service, except in case of emergency, when such employees may be permitted to remain on duty four additional hours in a twenty-four hour period on not exceeding three days in any week. In this connection it is significant to note that other employees are limited to sixteen hours of continuous service with a rest period of ten hours or in cases of an aggregate of sixteen hours of service in a twenty-four hour period such employee must have a rest period of eight hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">The penalties for violating the provisions of the Act are stated in section 63 with this proviso: \u201cProvided, That the provisions of sections 61-64 of this title shall not apply in any case of casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">It is plain that the words \u201cemergency,\u201d \u201ccasualty,\u201d \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d and \u201cthe act of God\u201d are not synonymous. All prohibitions and consequent penalties are excused if due to casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God. An \u201cemergency,\u201d as used in this Act, affords some elasticity by permitting the employee to work four additional hours in a twenty- four hour period on not exceeding three days in any week. The other employees who have worked sixteen continuous hours in twenty-four hours after resting ten hours, may again work another sixteen continuous hours. Thus during this forty-two hour period from the beginning of his day an intervening rest period of ten hours applies. In like manner a telegrapher in any week during an emergency shall not be permitted to work more than twelve hours in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>of the hours limited during normal conditions. If we give force and effect to all of the provisions of the Act, which it is our duty to do, unless hopelessly irreconcilable, it is plain that an emergency as used in the Act is an emergency which should be recognized as a condition less excusable than either of its terms, \u201ccasualty\u201d or \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d or \u201cact of God.\u201d Undoubtedly an emergency could exist without falling under the definition of \u201ccasualty\u201d or \u201cunavoidable accident\u201d or \u201cthe act of God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">During the \u201cemergency\u201d the hours are limited to nine each twenty-four hours except on three days of the work week the employee is permitted to work thirteen hours per day. The additional working hours are permitted on account of the existence of an emergency. The penalties do not attach unless these limitations are exceeded and if these hours are exceeded on account of casualty or unavoidable accident or an act of God' the penalties do not attach.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\"> The primary purpose of the Act it to limit the hours an employee may be permitted to work. Compliance by the employer is required. Heavy penalties are exacted for non-compliance. They are excused altogether if caused by casualty or unavoidable accident or the act of God. They do not attach in cases of emergency if the employee does not work more than four additional hours in a twenty-four hour period on not exceeding three days in any week. In all situations the employer must use diligence to observe the hours of service prescribed by the Act. Atchison, T. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. United States, 244 U.S. 336, 343, 37 S.Ct. 635, 61 L.Ed. 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">An emergency, as used here, is an unusual or abnormal condition beyond the control of the employer and a condition beyond his reasonable power to remove or overcome. It may arise from causes other than casualty or unavoidable accident or act of God. The employer can not cause the emergency and claim protection under it. He must exercise diligence to comply with the Act even in emergencies. The law is intended to protect the employee, the employer and the public and to this end must be liberally construed. United States v. B. &amp; O. Ry. Co., 4 Cir., 133 F.2d 831.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">Telegraph operators or dispatchers such as had to be used here were specially trained men, they were not common or unskilled laborers. There was a severe shortage of such persons due to the enormous increase in rail traffic and the increased demand for men in the prosecution of the war. We do not hold that any war constitutes an emergency, nor that this war created an emergency in all situations. But one must blind his eyes to actual facts if he does not recognize that this war created an abnormal and unforeseeable labor situation. The Selective Service Act, 50 U.S. C.A. Appendix \u00a7 301 et seq., was the instrumentality by which our government supplied the personnel for its armed forces.. The steady 'flow of men from farms and' factories and all walks of life into armed' services and munitions plants created a scarcity of labor never before approached' in our country\u2019s history. Congress enacted legislation and clothed the President with unparalleled powers to marshal the man: and woman power of this country and to channel it where the exigencies of the war and its successful prosecution required. Priorities on commodities and prohibitions against changing occupations or employment prevailed. We are of the opinion, that under the facts disclosed in the record here, an emergency within the meaning of the Act existed during December, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">The learned judge found that appellee made diligent efforts to procure an additional operator at Robbins; it offered the-jo.b to a number of telegraphers who refused it, it advertised in various ways for operators and was unable to secure one for Robbins, S. C. Robbins is in the Columbia district and the Northern division of the appellee; during December, 1943, there was a shortage of seven telegraphers in the Columbia district and a shortage of twenty-nine in the division; a shortage of ten in the contiguous Charleston district; and a shortage of manpower on its entire system of 2,200; it takes nine months for one to learn the Morse Code essential in this job and additional time and experience to transmit messages intelligently. Appellee called District Chief Dispatchers at Rocky Mount, N. C., Charleston, S. C., Norfolk, Va., and Wilmington, N. C., the Chief Dispatcher of the Southern at Columbia; wrote the Southern Central of Georgia, Louisville and Nashville, and did everything in the power of Supt. Hare and Chief Dispatcher Taylor to remedy the situation, without success. These findings of fact are amply supported by the evidence. On these facts we hold with the trial judge that appellee was diligent and used reason- - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>able efforts to comply with the statute and was authorized to work its employees the maximum hours permitted in an emergency.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Judge Connor in United States v. Atlantic Coast Lines Co., 4 Cir., 224 F. 160, deals at length with the decisions and concludes that \u201cemergency\u201d is not synonymous with \u201cunavoidable accident,\u201d \u201ccasualty\u201d or \u201can act of God.\u201d Undoubtedly the term emergency is available under conditions which do not fall within the terms \u201cunavoidable accident,\u201d \u201ccasualty\u201d or \u201cact of God.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The contention that an emergency could never last longer than one week within the meaning of the Act seems unreasonable. Such a construction would substitute judicial interpretation of the word \u201cone\u201d week for the legislative word \u201cany\u201d week. If we are correct in holding with the district judge that an emergency existed during the first week of December, it follows that the emergency continued throughout the month of December. The same evidence supports and justifies the emergency in both instances. Obviously an emergency under ordinary circumstances is temporary but its duration is dependent upon the facts of each case. Here the emergency most assuredly continued throughout the month of December, 1943.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b299-8\"> \u201c1. Section 62. * * *.
