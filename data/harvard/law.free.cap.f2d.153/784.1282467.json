This assumption by the lower Court was contrary to the admitted facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-23\">Even if the retention of an over-riding royalty by Wadley under his contract with, and transfer to, the Barnsdall Oil Company and the Standard Oil Company is not sufficient to allow the joining of Wadley as a plaintiff in- this cause; and even if, throughout, he was only acting as an agent of said Plaintiff corporations; or even, if Wadley and these corporations were joint adventurers \u2014 which are matters which the lower Court may determine on a retrial\u2014 the duty of Willis would be unchanged in either event, if he obtained confidential information by virtue of his employment from Wadley as an agent for, or from Wadley as a partner of, or from Wadley as a joint adventurer with, the two corporate Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-24\">There is testimony by several witnesses, some of whom were disinterested, that Willis stated to them that he was acquiring leases for the Barnsdall Oil Company. If this evidence is true, Willis\u2019s duty would remain unchanged, but the question of whether Wadley was owner, or joint adventurer, or merely an agent would bear only on the question as to which Plaintiff, if any, should have judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-25\">In the event a recovery is decreed against the Defendant, the lower Court on a new trial can determine in whose favor such recovery should be had.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-26\">The petition for rehearing is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
