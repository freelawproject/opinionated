The grantor in -the 1902 deed conveyed all its interest in certain described lands in Tyler and San Augustine Counties, Texas, to the grantee with certain reservations and exceptions,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to wit: (1) The grantor reserved unto it<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>self, its successors and assigns, 95% of all oil in place. (2) The grantor reserved unto itself, its successors and assigns, the right to drill for oil and to take away 95% of the oil produced. (3) The grantor reserved unto itself, its successors and assigns, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>right to refine 95% of said oil on the lands. (4) The' grantor reserved unto itself, its successors and assigns, the right to transport said oil from the premises. (5) The grantor reserved unto itself, its successors and assigns, the right to construct on and remove from the land machinery and structures necessary and proper for the production and storage of said oil. (6) The grantor reserved unto itself, its successors and assigns, \u201cthe full and absolute right and power in good faith to sell and convey the whole of the oil\u201d; and any conveyance so made \u201cshall pass to the grantee or grantees therein the whole of the oil,\u201d but in such event said vendor shall pay to the grantee, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns 1/20 of the \u201cpurchase price obtained upon said sale.\u201d (7) In the event of any such sale the purchaser \u201cshall have all the same rights and powers as to the said five per cent. (5%) of said oil as are by this instrument reserved and conferred as to said ninety-five per cent. (95%).\u201d (8) The lessees, agents, and workmen of the grantor, as well as its successors and assigns, might exercise the aforesaid rights and powers hereby reserved to said grantor. (9) \u201cIt is distinctly understood and agreed that said grantor, its successors and assigns, shall deliver to the said John H. Kirby [grantee], his heirs, executors, administrators and assigns, at any well bored or sunk in said lands the one-twentieth part of all crude oil produced and saved from said well. * * * This obligation to deliver on.e-twentieth of said oil shall be one running with the ownership of the well, and when said grantor or any person or persons succeeding to its interest disposes of any interest in any well there shall no longer rest upon it or them any obligation to perform 'this covenant, but such obkgation shall thereupon attach to the person or persons succeeding to such interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b752-8\">A stipulation <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> between the parties to this suit provided, inter alia: (1) That the appellants have the power to execute an oil lease covering the full estate in the oil; (2) that the appellee is entitled to 5% of all royalty provided in such lease; (3) that the controversy is limited to the question whether the appellee is entitled, upon the execution of a lease, to 5% of all oil produced in addition to 5% of all royalty provided in such lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-13\">The court below held: (1) The deed of July 5, 1902, is not ambiguous; (2) paragraph nine of said deed entitles defendant to 5% of all oil produced from said lands by any grantee or lessee of appellants; (3) the term \u201csale\u201d as used in paragraph six includes \u201clease,\u201d and the purchase price received on sale by lease includes \u201cbonus, delay rentals and royalty\u201d; and (4) in addition to the 5% royalty on all oil produced from said lands, appellee is entitled to 5% of the \u201cpurchase price\u201d received by appellants on sale or lease of the \u201cwhole of\u201d the oil, and the \u201cpurchase price\u201d includes 5% of the bonus, delay rentals, and royalty. The court gave no consideration to any practical construction of the deed between the parties, but stated that if it were obliged to pass upon the question of practical construction it would find in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">In their appeal to this court the appellants urge that the district court erred in holding that the appellee was entitled to receive both 5% of all oil produced and 5% of \u201cthe purchase price,\u201d including therein any oil royalty received by appellants upon a sale or lease; that upon a sale or lease the appellee was entitled to receive only 5% of the \u201cpurchase price,\u201d and as part of such price 5% of any oil royalty received.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-16\">Since the grantor in the 1902 deed conveyed to the grantee all title and interest in the properties save and except 95% of the oil in place and expressly reserved the 95% to the grantor and its successors, under the Texas law the grantor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>and grantee became co-tenants with respect to the oil in place.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The grantor then owned and appellants, as its assignees, now own an undivided 95% interest in the oil in place; the grantee then owned and ap-pellee, as its assignee, now owns an undivided 5 % interest in the same oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">By virtue of paragraph six of the deed the appellants in addition to their interest in this co-tenancy have a power to sell \u201cthe whole of the oil\u201d (100%). The same paragraph entitles appellee to receive \u201cone-twentieth of the purchase price obtained upon said sale.\u201d In Texas the standard exploration development lease is tantamount to a sale,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the \u201cpurchase price\u201d for the execution of a lease includes, in addition to any bonus and delay rentals, the agreed royalty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> As heretofore stated, both parties agree that, if the property were leased by appellants, the appellee would be entitled to 5% of any royalty provided in that lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">In addition to its 5% share of any royalty provision in any lease of \u201cthe whole of the oil,\u201d the appellee construes paragraph nine to entitle it to 5% of all oil produced. Assuming that in a lease conveying \u201cthe whole of the oil\u201d the lessee promises to pay the usual <em>Ys </em>royalty, we find that under appellee\u2019s contention paragraph nine would entitle the appellee to 1/20 or 8/160 of all oil produced, and paragraph six would entitle appellee to 1/20 of the <em>Ys, </em>or 1/160, of the reserved royalty. In total the appellee would receive 9/160 of all oil produced. Under such a lease the appellants would receive 11/160 of the oil produced (the % royalty, or 20/160, minus the 9/160 claimed by appellee). As owner of 5% of the oil in place the ap-pellee would receive 9/160 of the oil produced under the lease, and as owner of 95% of the oil in place the appellee would receive only 11/160 of the oil produced under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-7\">The appellee\u2019s construction renders two conflicts in the deed: While paragraph six provides that <em>the purchaser, </em>under a lease executed by the appellants exercising their power of sale, <em>is to obtain the \u201cwhole of the oil\u201d </em>upon such conveyance, paragraph nine would give 5% of the \u201cwhole of the oil\u201d to the appellee by way of a running covenant. Likewise, paragraph seven\u2019s provision that gives the lessee the same rights and powers with respect to the 5% as he obtains with respect to the 95% conflicts with paragraph nine wherein the lessee would pay to the appellee 5% of all the oil produced after purchasing said 5% interest under paragraph six. Such a construction is wholly inconsistent and contrary to the Texas rule, to-wit:</p>\n<p id=\"b753-15\">\u201cEven where different parts of the instrument appear to be uncertain, ambiguous, or contradictory, yet, if possible, the court will harmonize the parts and construe the instrument in such a way that all parts may stand, and will never strike down any portion except there is an irreconcilable conflict wherein one part of the instrument destroys in effect another part.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b753-16\">Appellants\u2019 construction of the deed harmonizes its different parts and provides royalty to the parties in proportion to their undivided interests in the oil. To illustrate: If the appellants decide to lease 100% of the oil in place under the power given in paragraph six, paragraphs six and seven are operative, but paragraph nine by construction is inoperative. If appellants choose to develop the land themselves \u2014 as apparently was within the contemplation of the parties to the deed by virtue of paragraphs two to five, inclusive, thereof\u2014 paragraph nine entitles the appellee to a 5% share of any oil which may be produced. Obviously, paragraphs six and seven would have no application. Likewise, if the appellants choose to sell not the whole (100%) of the oil under paragraph six but only their undivided 95% interest in the oil in place, the person who succeeds to such share and stands in their shoes as co-tenant also is bound to pay to the appellee 5% of all production.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-17\">The wording of paragraph nine supports the appellants\u2019 construction of the deed. That paragraph places the burden of a running covenant on \u201cthe grantor, its successors and assigns.\u201d \u201cIts successors and assigns\u201d are those who succeed only to the grantor\u2019s 95% interest in the oil in place. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>Paragraph nine does not place this obligation upon one who succeeds, by virtue of the power of sale given appellants in paragraph six, to both the 95%. interest of the appellants and the 5% interest of the appellee. One who acquires the 5% undivided interest from appellee or from appellants acting for appellee under the power of sale given by paragraph six becomes as to said 5% interest the successor or assign of. appellee.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> To hold that a purchaser of the 100% undivided interest by way of the power of sale in paragraph six is obligated to pay 5% of the oil produced to the successor or assign of the 5% interest by way of the running covenant in paragraph nine is to hold that the purchaser of the whole interest is obligated to pay himself, as successor or assign of the 5% interest, 5% of the oil produced.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">The maxim of construction that in case of doubt the provisions of a deed are construed against the grantor and in favor of the grantee is subject to certain exceptions. The Texas rule is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">\u201cIf it be conceded that there is ambiguity in a deed, and that it is susceptible of two constructions, that one will be adopted that is most favorable to the grantee. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">\u201cHowever, the rule is properly to be regarded as a canon of construction; and it is subordinate to the rule, already noticed, that every part of the deed should be harmonized and given effect where 'this can be done.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-7\">Under appellee\u2019s construction of the 1902 deed a purchaser of the 100% interest from appellants under paragraph six would still be obligated under paragraph nine to deliver 1/20 of the oil produced to appellee. This construction ignores the power given appellants in paragraph six to sell and convey appellee\u2019s 5% interest along with appellants\u2019 95% interest; it ignores the fact that when appellee\u2019s 5% interest is sold (whether appellee made the sale or appellants made the sale for it) ownership of the 5% interest is passed, and thereafter it would have no interest in the oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-8\"> Upon appellants exercising their power to lease \u201cthe whole of the oil\u201d (100%) in place under paragraph six of the 1902 deed, the appellee is entitled to receive 5% of the \u201cpurchase price.\u201d Included in the purchase price are the royalties, bonuses, and delay rentals, provided in any such lease. Appellee is not entitled, as it contends, to a further royalty of 5% of all oil produced. The deed in question is not ambiguous and so we need not consider any practical construction given to such deed by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-10\">The judgment appealed from- is reversed, and the cause is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views herein expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-11\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b750-13\"> 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 400, Judicial Code, \u00a7 274d.
