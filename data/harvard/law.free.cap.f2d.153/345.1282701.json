The question in litigation is whether the taxpayer realized gain or loss on the shares he sold, and that depends upon what \u201cbasis\u201d is properly to be ascribed to them. Concededly his basis is the same as his mother\u2019s. Section 113(a) (2), Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. Int. Rev.Code, \u00a7 113(a) (2), declares with respect to property acquired by gift that the basis of the donee shall be that of the donor or of \u201cthe last preceding owner <em>by </em>whom it was not acquired by gift.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>The facts were stipulated. The taxpayer\u2019s father died testate on May 29, 1915, a resident of Vermont. His will gave the residue of his estate to his wife for life, with remainder in trust for his children. Included in the residuary estate were 250.8 shares of common stock of Standard Oil Company of California of which the fair market value at the date of death was $284 per share. Thereafter, by reason of stock dividends, a four for one split-up, and the sale of a fractional share by the excutors, the original 250.8 shares became 4,008 shares as shown in schedule A in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Pursuant to the testator\u2019s will and the Vermont law as to apportionment of stock dividends between life tenant and remainderman, the executors delivered to Mrs. McCullough, the taxpayer\u2019s mother, 66 dividend shares on April 16, 1917 and 1740 dividend shares on December 30, 1922.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The fair market value of the stock on the former date was $284 per share or $18,744 for the 66 shares, and on the latter date $60 per share or $104,400 for the 1740 shares. All of the dividend shares distributed to Mrs. McCullough by the executors of her husband\u2019s estate were declared and paid out of earnings of the corporation subsequent to her husband\u2019s death. In 1923 Mrs. McCullough subscribed for 283% shares, pursuant to rights issued by the corporation, at a cost of $7,087.50. This brought her total holdings up to 2551% shares as shown in schedule B.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Of these shares she gave her son 1551 on May 13, 1929, which he Sold in 1940, together with 504 other shares that had cost him $9,125 and whose basis is not in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The taxpayer contends that the basis for his mother\u2019s shares is to be determined by using the fair market value of the dividend shares distributed to her as life beneficiary of the residuary estate ($18,744 plus $104,400, a total of $123,144) and the cost of the shares she subscribed for, $7,087.50. This gives a basis of $130,231.50 for her total holdings or $51.041152 per share, and a basis of $79,164.83 for the 1,551 shares she gave the taxpayer. There is no dispute as to the accuracy of the mathematical computation, and it results in a loss of $52,934.78 on the sale of the 2,055 shares, if the taxpayer\u2019s theory is correct. The Tax Court, however, held, with two judges dissenting, that the basis to Mrs. McCullough of the shares received from her husband\u2019s estate was a proportionate part of the basis to the executors of the original 250.8 shares. This produced a basis of $28,778.81 for the 1,551 shares and resulted in a loss of only $2,548.76 on the sale of the 2,055 shares. On this appeal the Commissioner supports the Tax Court\u2019s decision. At the hearing however, he had taken the position that Mrs. McCullough\u2019s basis for the shares received from the estate was zero, and he still so argues as an alternative contention. The adoption o'f the latter contention would result in a gain of nearly $22,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-20\">In support of the Tax Court\u2019s decision the Commissioner argues that the dividend shares distributed to Mrs. McCullough by the executors were property acquired by her \u201cby bequest\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 113(a) (5) of the Internal Revenue Code, and therefore had the same basis in her hands as in the hands of, the executors; that is, their basis is a proportionate part of the basis of the original stock, since stock dividends are merely a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>proliferation of capital into additional fractions and a dilution of the fractional interests represented by the old shares. But we cannot accept the theory that Mrs. McCullough acquired her shares \u201cby bequest\u201d. Although they were only fractional parts of the original shares, nevertheless the executors did not, and could not, deliver them to her as a legacy. The will gave her no part of the testator\u2019s stock; it gave her only the right to the income of such stock. She received the shares as the income beneficiary for life, not as a legatee of the testator\u2019s stock. See Plunkett v. Commissioner, 1 Cir., 118 F.2d 644, 649; cf. Irwin v. Gavit, 268 U.S. 161, 167, 45 S.Ct. 475, 69 L.Ed. 897.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\"> The fact that the stock dividend shares were not taxable income to the executors under the rule of Eisner v. Macomber, 252 U.S. 189, 40 S.Ct. 189, 64 L.Ed. 521, 9 A.L.R. 1570, does not preclude them from being taxable income to Mrs. McCullough when delivered to her in satisfaction of her right to receive income. See Johnston v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 208, 210, cert. den. Johnston v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 323 U.S. 715, 65 S.Ct. 41; Plunkett v. Commissioner, supra. The reason she was entitled to the stock dividends was because they were issued as a quid pro quo for earnings \u201cploughed back\u201d into the company. It is true they did not represent those earnings alone; they represented an aliquot interest in all the corporate assets, capital and surplus, including the earnings subsequent to testator\u2019s death which were ploughed back. It is true also that the life tenant could not have compelled the company to declare the earnings in cash dividends. But the case for taxing the life tenant was even weaker in J ohnston v. Helvering, supra. Although there had been no usufruct from the land, we held that because under New York law a share in the proceeds from the sale of the land was to go to the life tenant \u2014 as a substitute for the income he would have presumably received if the land had been sold at once \u2014 the life tenant\u2019s share was income. So here Mrs. McCullough was taxable on the dividend shares as income, when received, because the Vermont law says that when the company (corresponding to the trustees in the Johnston case) impounded the earnings, the shares which it issued as a substitute belong to the life beneficiary. In short, the life tenant gets them because they have been issued in exchange for earnings \u2014 -a \u25a0forced exchange, it is true, but nevertheless an exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">Where income is received in the form of property other than money, the amount of the income is measured by the fair market value of the property at the time of its receipt. Since Mrs. McCullough could have been taxed upon the value of the shares as income when she got them we cannot doubt that such value constitutes her \u201cbasis\u201d for them in case of sale. The Commissioner\u2019s alternative contention is that because the taxpayer has not shown that his mother returned the shares as income in the years when the executors distributed them to her, her basis in case of sale would be zero. This court has already ruled to the contrary in similar situations. Bennet v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 537, 149 A.L.R. 1146; Salvage v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 76 F.2d 112, 114, aff\u2019d 297 U.S. 106, 56 S.Ct. 375, 80 L.Ed. 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">For the foregoing reasons we hold that the mother\u2019s basis, and consequently the taxpayer\u2019s was the fair market value of the dividend shares on the dates she received them. Accordingly the decision is reversed and the cause remanded for redetermination of the tax.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-5\"> Schedule A</p>\n<p id=\"AkS\">\n<em>Date Shares</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Abm\">May 29, 1915 Ree\u2019d by executors of J.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab3\">G.

Helvering, 2 Cir., 137 F.2d 537, 149 A.L.R. 1146, seems to me to be unquestionably sound. But I cannot say the same of Johnston v. Helvering, 2 Cir., 141 F.2d 208, and I concur only because I feel that in this Circuit we are bound by that decision as a precedent. Had I been sitting in the Johnston case, I would have dissented.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-11\">Suppose that, by a state statute, trustees of land were required to convey to the life tenant, as part of the life tenant\u2019s \u201cincome,\u201d one-tenth of the land in fees. I think the fiat of state law would not control, that the conveyance would not be taxable as income under the Sixteenth Amendment, or the federal income tax statute. Wherefore, I think the conclusion in the Johnston case was mistaken. See, e. g., United States v. Pelzer, 312 U.S. 399, 402-403, 61 S.Ct. 659, 85 L.Ed. 913; Morgan v.
