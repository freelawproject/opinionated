Int. Rev. Code, \u00a7 291 ?</p>\n<p id=\"b259-22\">Taxpayer was a corporation organized under the Florida laws on August 31, 1939. It was engaged in the business of discounting and rediscounting conditional sales contracts, and supporting installment notes, chattel mortgages and other evidences of debt. It made direct loans, with and without collateral, and charged interest thereon. It filed its tax return on the accrual basis. Its fiscal year ended August 31, and it did not file timely personal holding company return for either 1940 or 1941, but filed such returns for both years on December 31, 1941. The \u201creasonable cause\u201d shown by taxpayer was that it was first advised about the middle of December 1941 by its accountant that he believed taxpayer might be considered a personal holding company \u201cbecause of some question that our income was all interest\u201d and because of the manner in which the books were kept.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-24\">The Tax Court held that taxpayer was a personal holding company and that ruling is not contested here.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-25\">The Tax Court further held that taxpayer had not shown that its failure to file timely personal holding company returns was due to a reasonable cause and that taxpayer was liable for statutory penalties under Section 291 of the Internal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C.A. Int.Rev.Code, \u00a7 291.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-26\">Reasonable cause means nothing more than the exercise of ordinary business care and prudence. The issue presented is purely factual. Taxpayer\u2019s evidence showed that its president and general manager did not know that it was required to file the returns until taxpayer\u2019s accountant called this matter to his attention on December 13, 1941. This was its excuse before the Tax Court as to why the returns had not been made, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>Court held such showing insufficient as a reasonable cause. We may not overturn the decision of the Tax Court where it rests upon substantial evidence,' as here. Commissioner v. Lane-Wells Co., 321 U.S. 219, 225, 64 S.Ct. 511, 88 L.Ed. 684; West Side Tennis Club v. Commissioner, 2 Cir., 111 F.2d 6, 9, 130 A.L.R. 103; Girard Inv. Co. v. Commissioner, 3 Cir., 122 F.2d 843; Dobson v. Commissioner, 320 U.S. 489, 64 S.Ct. 239, 88 L.Ed. 248; Commissioner v. Scottish American Co., 323 U.S. 119, 123, 124, 65 S.Ct. 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">We find no reversible error in the record, and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
