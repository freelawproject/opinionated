The United Corporation, a Delaware corporation, is the - top unit of a holding-company system and a registered holding company under \u00a7 5 of the Act, 15 U. S.C.A. \u00a7 79e. On August 14, 1943, the Commission issued a simplification order under \u00a7 11(b) (2), requiring United to change its existing capitalization to a one-class, common-stock structure and to cease to exist as a holding company. United, in partial compliance with that order, submitted for the Commission\u2019s approval a plan by which it would offer its preferred shareholders an opportunity to exchange their stock for certain cash and common stock, of Philadelphia Electric Company, one of United\u2019s major subsidiaries. The Commission on November 24, 1944, issued an order approving the plan on condition that it be amended in certain aspects, and then, the amendments having been duly filed, granted final approval of the amended plan by order of November 29, 1944.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Phillips, a beneficial owner of 1,100 shares of United\u2019s common stock, has now petitioned for review of both these orders,.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b82-21\"> Chief among the petitioner\u2019s many contentions on this review is his assertion that the Commission exceeded its authority by issuing the effecting orders without first obtaining either a vote of the shareholders or an order of the proper district court. His demand of a vote is based on a pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>vision of the Delaware statutes so requiring in case of a corporate \u201creorganization,\u201d Del. Corporation Law, \u00a7 5, par. 9, Del. Rev.Code 1935, \u00a7 2037, subd. 9, though United argues with force that this is rather a redemption of stock under \u00a7 27 of that law (\u00a7 2059) where a vote is not specifically required. But whatever the situation under Delaware law, it is clear that the Public Utility Llolding Company Act is a specific overriding federal law which obviously must control or else its very reason for existence is frustrated; and, indeed, petitioner himself appears to admit that the. terms of the Act must be complied with, regardless of shareholder approval. Turning to the Act itself, we there find no requirement or suggestion of such a prerequisite.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hence petitioner strenuously urges that \u00a7 11 (d, e) requires the Commission to obtain a court order before directing United to effect the transfer; and this presents his substantial argument on this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Section 11, \u201cSimplification of holding company systems,\u201d is a long statutory provision imposing upon the Commission the duty of examining the corporate structure of public-utility holding-company systems and ordering simplification thereof. By subsec. (b) (2), the \u201cgreat-grandfather clause,\u201d the Commission is charged with the duty of causing a holding company to cease to be a holding company with respect to subsidiaries which themselves have holding companies as- subsidiaries; that is, of eliminating more than two tiers of holding companies in any holding-company system. By subsec. (c), Commission orders under (b) must be complied with within a year unless the Commission finds it in the public interest to extend the time for not more than another year,. Then follow the two subsections here crucial. Under (d), the Commission \u201cmay apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of section 18, to enforce compliance\u201d with an order under (b) ; and the court, to the extent it deems necessary to enforce the order, may \u201ctake exclusi,7\u00ab jurisdiction and possession of the company.\u201d Subsec. (e) deals with the situation where the company itself has submitted a plan for Commission approval if \u201cnecessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) and fair and equitable to the persons affected by such plan.\u201d It provides that after approval, \u201cthe Commission, at the request of the company, may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of section 18, to enforce and carry out the terms and provisions of such plan,\u201d whereupon the court has similar powers of enforcement as under (d). The cited provision of \u00a7 18, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79r, is one giving jurisdiction to \u201cthe proper district court of the United States\u201d (i.e., of a district \u201cwherein the defendant is an inhabitant or transacts business,\u201d \u00a7 25, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79y) to enjoin violation of the Act and to enforce compliance with it or with any rule, regulation, or order under it. A still later section, 24(a), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 79x(a), contains the provision, under which this petition to review is brought to us, granting any person aggrieved by a commission order the right of direct petition to the circuit court of appeals of the circuit where he resides.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">It seems now settled that conflicts in jurisdiction as between courts must be avoided, and hence that a circuit court of appeals will not pass upon a shareholder\u2019s petition for review while all equities may be adjusted by a district court in a pending proceeding brought by the Commission for enforcement of its order.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Like avoidance of unnecessary court action would suggest that litigation should not be forced upon the Commission and the company when neither finds it necessary, the general provision for review given a person aggrieved being adequate protection to dissenters. And in the face of the very clearly permissive wording of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>we are not disposed to strain for an interpretation of the statute which will force unneeded enforcement proceedings. We do not believe this choice of language can be considered inadvertent; in fact, the general provisions for enforcing compliance with the Act and regulations and orders thereunder, \u00a7 18(f), seem unusually explicit, stating that the Commission \u201cmay in its discretion\u201d bring an action in the proper district court. Here the Commission has not applied for enforcement under (d), nor has United asked for action under (e). Hence the terms of the statute do not apply, and the petitioner\u2019s rights are safeguarded by his present petition. The Commission has heretofore taken the position that it need not apply for enforcement under \u00a7 11(d) where such'action is not necessary.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> There is certainly nothing to the contrary, if indeed there is not support, in the general statements in Commonwealth &amp; Southern Corporation v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 3 Cir., 134 F.2d 747, 751, so much relied on by petitioner, where the point was not in issue<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">The next major point of petitioner is that, even if no court order was necessary, the findings of the Commission were insufficient to support its conclusion that the plan was fair and equitable as required by \u00a7 11(e). His contention is that the stock transfer actually grossly overpaid the preferred shareholders and wasted the assets of the corporation. We find no such inadequacy in the findings. . The plan as approved contemplated the offer to holders of United\u2019s \u201c$3 Cumulative Preference Stock\u201d of a package consisting of 1-8/10 shares of common stock of Philadelphia Electric Company, and $6 in cash for each share of United\u2019s outstanding preference stock up to 1,123,374 shares, or approximately 45% of the total outstanding of 2,488,712-1/6 shares. The Commission found that as of June 30, 1944, the date which it took for fixing values, the preference stock had a market price of $36.25 per share, as compared to a market price of $41.10 for the package. It also found that this stock was entitled on liquidation to a preference of $50 per share, or $124,-435,608, plus arrears of dividends of $5.25 per share, or $13,065,738, of which about .$56,168,700, plus dividend arrears of $5,-897,713, would be eliminated by consummation of the plan. And it found a prospective value for Philadelphia Electric\u2019s common stock by capitalizing its estimated earnings at either 6% per annum, yielding values of $28.33 to $30 per share, or 6-1/2%, yielding values of $26.15 to $27.69 per share, or values for the package ranging \u25a0 \u2014 on the basis of United\u2019s original offer of $5 additional in cash \u2014 from $59 down to $52.07. Moreover, and perhaps more important, it found the underlying net asset value of the preference stock, based on the market price of United\u2019s portfolio holdings and cash, to be much higher than the market quotation, namely, $48.89 per share, so that upon consummation of the plan the net asset value for the remaining preference stock would be increased to $56.12 per share, while the like value of the common stock would jump from minus $1.09 to plus $.08 per share. And meanwhile the corporation would effect the required divestment of Philadelphia Electric Common in a simple and inexpensive way.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Hence the Commission concluded that the proposed offer was within permissible limits of fairness as to all three groups <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>of United\u2019s investors: those accepting and those not accepting among the preferred shareholders, and the common shareholders. In fact, its views were so far contrary to the petitioner\u2019s contentions that its only concern was whether the offer was sufficiently fair to those who might accept, and it required as one of the conditions for its approval of the plan that United raise its cash payment from $5 to $6 per package. (Other conditions \u2014 all accepted by United \u2014mainly concerned the time periods for acceptance of the option or for keeping the option open in case it was undersub-scribed.) And it said as a justification for not requiring more: \u201cStockholders may fairly be offered the choice of taking somewhat less in return for receiving their compensation sooner than others of the same class; and the chance that the others may eventually receive more is a factor for each stockholder to consider in making his choice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\"> Petitioner points, however, to the difference between United\u2019s average corporate net income of $2.91 per share and the average package earnings of $3.56, as well as the difference in annual dividends actually paid upon the preference stock as compared to those received on the package assets, amounting to $1.05 per share over the years 1937 to 1944; and he stresses also the Commission\u2019s failure to find prospective values or earnings for the preference stock. But the Commission answers quite reasonably that it has never considered corporate earnings of a top holding company as an exclusive test of fairness, that here, indeed, United\u2019s interest in the actual earnings of its underlying companies, undistributed as well as distributed, amounted to $4.73 per preference share, and that petitioner was completely ignoring the dividend claim of the preference shareholders, while he emphasized the low return they had actually received. It further stated that, in view of the status of the reorganization of the subsidiary holding companies, it could not make a precise estimate of the prospective income of the preference stock. These conclusions appear justified under all the circumstances and well within the sphere of the Commission\u2019s peculiar competency. Of course, as it said, liquidation rights of shareholders alone should not be held controlling, Otis &amp; Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 323 U.S. 624, 65 S.Ct. 483; but here they were obviously deserving of careful consideration upon the issue of the fair limits of an offer to retire preferred stock. Moreover, the Commission clearly had in mind what petitioner has tended to overlook, namely, that the preferred shareholders were being asked to exchange a security with a prior accruing claim on a top holding company for common stock of a subsidiary.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">Petitioner further urges that the Commission should not have applied the test of \u201cfair and equitable\u201d stated in \u00a7 11 (d, e), since it had ruled that the plan was not a reorganization so as to require a vote of the shareholders, but should hold it only a sale of securities under \u00a7 12(c, d)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> where the test is rather the financial integrity of the company and where the laws of the market place must govern. And since the market price of the preference stock was some $4.85 a share lower than that of the proposed package on June 30, 1944, he claims that an unfair advantage has been given these shareholders. But the plan was actually filed under \u00a711, and we see no reason why it was not properly so filed. While not intended as a complete compliance with the Commission\u2019s simplication order, it was clearly a plan for \u201cthe divestment of control\u201d of a subsidiary for the purpose of enabling United to comply with that order. Were we to make the assumption that the Commission might have considered the plan to be a transfer within the meaning of the later section, still it would be justified in applying the fair and equitable test, as indeed it has held in In the Matter of Western Public Service Co., HCA Release No. 4114, and In the Matter of Natural Power &amp; Light Co., HCA Release No. 3211. This test has been consistently applied whenever the transaction was one designed to effect compliance in any form with \u00a7 11(b) <em>(2). </em>It should be noted that the issue which divided the Supreme Court in the Otis case and has since interested the commentators<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>is whether the Commission had not violated the rule of absolute priority at the expense of the preferred shareholders. And it would be anomalous if here the Commission should be held in error in allowing the corporation to offer its preferred investors somewhat nearer their full contract rights than is the current market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"> The petitioner\u2019s last major contention is that he was denied a fair hearing. He appeared at six hearings on the plan prior to the final hearing on November 6, 1944, which was held at his request and at which he filed briefs and made an extensive oral argument. The minutes of that hearing show that he there raised in substance all of the objections now urged. He contends further that the Commission made an ex parte adjudication on the question .of the necessity for a shareholders\u2019 vote. This is based upon conversations between United\u2019s president and members of. the Commission or its staff, developing the latter\u2019s view that such a vote was inappropriate under the circumstances. These conversations seem to us no more than legitimate prehearing conferences of the kind which the commissioners or their staff must have if all the intricate details involved in even a single holding-company simplification is to be carried to completion within the time of man.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Certainly a court would not be justified in interfering with such helpful preliminary conferences to expedite the settlement of details without a very definite showing of prejudice to an aggrieved party or eventual denial of a fair hearing. Here the Commission, as it showed at its hearings, did not hold itself bound by any of the preliminary steps, but gave the final judgment upon its view of the law \u2014 which coincides with our own, as we have shown \u2014 and in the exercise of a discretion which appears rational and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">In the course of the proceedings before the Commission, petitioner brought forth various conditions which he sought to engraft upon the plan if it were approved. His proposals related to cumulative voting, quorum requirements, and representations of minority groups at shareholders\u2019 meetings. They had no bearing on the approval of the present plan; and the Commission was justified in declining to consider them at this time. In fact, they appear designed to secure for petitioner that position in company affairs for which he waged a proxy battle only to lose it at the company\u2019s annual meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Orders affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b82-13\"> HCA Releases Nos. 5440, 5452. The simplification order, HOA Release No. 4478, is not challenged in this proceeding. Other orders of the Commission with respect to various aspects of this extensive holding-company system have been reviewed by the courts, e.g., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. v. Securities and Exchange Comm., 2 Cir., 126 F.2d 325; Public Service Corp. of New Jersey v. Securities and Exchange Comm., 3 Cir., 129 F.2d 899, certiorari denied 317 U.

The Commission must be free to determine this question with reference to the actual modification planned and the extent of the change of character of investment which this would mean to the shareholders; it cannot be held es-topped by action taken or suggested by it in the light of other circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b83-12\"> Okin v.

It has been argued that the Commission could not seek enforcement for a year because the company has that period for compliance under (c). Remarks of Commissioner Healy, \u201cSection 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act,\u201d 26 P. U. Fort. 616, 623, and argument of the preferred shareholder in In re Standard Power &amp; Light Corporation, D.C.Del., 48 F.Supp. 716. In the United Light &amp; Power case the Commission argued persuasively that it need not apply for enforcement even after a year, pointing out, as Chairman Eicher had said in a then recent address, that where a company was making reasonable progress under its particular circumstances to carry out a \u00a7 11(b) order, neither it nor its security holders would be assisted by a court order, and stressing also the difference in statutory wording as to its compulsory duties as under \u00a7 11(b), with discretionary acts under \u00a7 11(d) or (e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b84-9\"> The general language relied on as showing compulsion does not seem to us so intended. Thus the court says of \u00a7 11(e): \u201cIf the plan is one which can be carried out by the sole action of the parties thereto no further proceedings are needed.
