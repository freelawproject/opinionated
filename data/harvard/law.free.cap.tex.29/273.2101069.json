N. Vaughan et al. v. The State.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b289-8\">Article 412 of the Code of Criminal Procedure reads as follows: \u201c Sureties shall be entitled to notice by service of a citation, the length of time, and in the manner required in civil actions; and, if any surety fail to appear after such notice, and show sufficient cause for the non-attendance of the defendant, the judgment against him shall be made final, at any time after the expiration of the time allowed for answering in a civil suit.\u201d (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2883, Note 729.) The mode of executing all service, where not otherwise directed by law, is prescribed by the 14th section of the act to regulate proceedings in the district court; and it is by delivering the defendant a copy of the writ and the petition accompanying it. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1433, Note 545.)</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b289-9\">Where a <em>scire facias </em>alone was to be served upon two defendants, the return of the sheriff must show that a copy was delivered to \u201ceach\u201d defendant.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b289-10\">Service of a <em>scire facias </em>upon the principal in a forfeited recognizance is not necessary; but a final judgment should be rendered against him as well as his sureties. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 2881, Note 727.)</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b289-11\">Appeal from Jefferson. The case was tried before Hon. James M. Maxcv, one of the district judges,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b290-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>The question arose upon the insufficiency of service of the <em>scire facias. </em>The return read, * * * \u201c and executed by delivering to defendants, J. W. Patridge and A. M. Vaughan, a certified copy of this writ.\u201d The judgment was by default. The judgment <em>nisi </em>was against the defendant, William Cribbs, and his sureties. The final judgment was against Vaughan and Patridge, the sureties alone. Cribbs was not served with a <em>scire facias. </em>Vaughan and Patridge appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b290-4\">ISTo briefs have been furnished to the <em>Reporter.</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b290-5\">Donley, J.</author>\n<p id=\"ACB\">It is assigned for error, that there was no legal service on the defendants, Vaughan and Patridge, and that the court erred in rendering judgment in the absence of such notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">The objection to the service it is believed is well founded. Article 412, Code of Criminal Procedure, requires that \u201c Sureties (on a forfeited bond or recognizance) shall be entitled to notice by service of a citation, the length of time, and in the manner required in civil actions. And if any surety fail to appear after such notice, and show sufficient cause for the non-attendance of the defendant, the judgment against him shall be made final at any time after .the expiration of the time allowed for answering in a civil suit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">Article 411, O. &amp; W. Dig., provides, that \u201cthe sheriff or other officer receiving any process * * * shall execute the same, when not otherwise directed by the writ or citation, by delivering to the party or parties in person, upon whom he is required to serve it, a copy thereof,\u201d &amp;c. The service in this case was \u201cby delivering to defendants, J. W. Patridge and A. N. Vaughan, a certified copy of the writ.\u201d The service does not show that a copy was delivered to each defendant. There were two defendants. The record shows that but one copy was delivered. The service must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>appear by the return of the officer. And it must appear by the return of the officer that he delivered a copy of the writ to each defendant. The court cannot supply omissions in the return. The word \u201ceach,\u201d following the name of the appellant, Vaughan, in the return, it is believed, would have cured this defect in the return of the sheriff</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">The final judgment against appellants is not styled, as the judgment <em>nisi </em>was entered against William Cribbs and appellants..</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Service of the* <em>scire facias </em>was not necessary to authorize the rendering of final judgment against the principal. (Code Crim. Pro., Art. 409.) Yet judgments should be so certain as not to leave any doubt as against whom execution may issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">For the insufficiency of the service of the <em>scire facias </em>in this case judgment is reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
