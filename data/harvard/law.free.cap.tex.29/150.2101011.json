The case was tried before Hon. Peter W. Gray, one of the district judges.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b167-5\">Wyser sued Allen \u201cas a non-resident,\u201d on the 16th February, 1857, on sundry small notes and accounts, amounting to $767 25, and <em>only prayed for process </em>and <em>judgment, </em>but not for an attachment, or sequestration, or other matter <em>in rem. </em>The plaintiff annexed his affidavit, that \u201c the defendant in said petition is absent from the State of Texas, and that I believe he is not a resident of said State.\u201d The clerk issued his writ, which, after reciting the affidavit, ran thus : \u201c These are therefore to command you to summon the said Benjamin D. Allen, by publication of this citation in some newspaper published in the county of Walker, in said State, if there be one, but if there be none, then in a newspaper published in the nearest county to said Walker county, to be and appear before the honorable judge of the district court of Walker county, on the fourth Monday in October next, in the town Huntsville, Walker county, then and there to answer the said petition of said Wyser, wherein it is charged, that the said Allen is indebted to the said Wyser in the sum of $767 25, as follows: $94 25 due by note on the 24th July, 1855; $35 due to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>W. Calhoun on 6th September, 1855, by notes, and after-wards assigned and transferred to said Wyser; $60 due by account for money loaned to said.Allen on boat; $500 loaned to said Allen due by account; $13 for negro hire due by account; and $65 for wood, storage, &amp;c., due by account. Said petition concludes with a prayer for judgment against said Allen for the aforesaid sums of money, making in all the sum of $767 25, interest and costs, and that said Allen be summoned by publication, and a further prayer for general relief.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-6\">\u201c These are, therefore, to command you to summon the said Benjamin D. Allen, by publication of this citation in some newspaper published in the county of Walker,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c., \u201cto answer, \u201d [briefly reciting the several debfs.] \u201c Herein fail not,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-7\">The sheriff\u2019s return read: \u201cCome to hand September 16, 1857. In obedience to within command, I, A. East-ham, sheriff of Walker county, Texas, order this citation to be published in the Huntsville Item, a newspaper published in the town of Huntsville, Walker county, this 17th September, 1857. A. Eastham, <em>Sheriff.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-8\">\u201cExecuted by having this citation published in the Huntsville Item, on 16th day of September, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-9\">\u201cA. Eastham, <em>Sheriff.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-10\">The judgment recites: \u201c Came the plaintiff, by attorney, and thereupon came a jury of good and lawful men,\u201d who were sworn to assess damages, and returned a verdict for $784 50, for which there was judgment, \u201c for which execution may issue.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-11\">There was in the record a statement of facts, as required by the statute in <em>ex parte </em>cases. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 1488, Hote 580.)</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b168-12\">Allen, not being satisfied with this judgment, prosecuted error, and assigned as error the insufficiency of the writ and of the service.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>No briefs have been furnished to the <em>Reporter. </em>Of course the attention of the court was not called to the question of the nullity of the judgment, where the proceeding was not <em>in rem, </em>and there was no personal service. (Paschal\u2019s Dig., Note 101, p. 17; Paschal\u2019s Annot. Const., Notes 218, 219, pp. 213-222.) It will also be seen that, because of the insufficiency of the writ and service, the court reversed the judgment and remanded the cause, without defining what would be the effect, upon another trial, of Allen\u2019s appearance to prosecute error.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-7\">Coke, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnC\">This is a judgment by default. A proper predicate was laid by the affidavit of the plaintiff for service of process on the defendant by publication. The writ issued in the case is defective in this, that it does not require the sheriff to make publication for four successive weeks, as required by the statute. The return of the sheriff states that he executed the writ by having it published in the Huntsville Item, \u201con the 16th day of September, 1857,\u201d which is manifestly insufficient. Publication of the process should have been made for four successive weeks previous to the return day, in a newspaper published in Walker county, and if there was no newspaper published in that county, then in the nearest county where a newspaper was published. (O. &amp; W. Dig., Art. 418;) [Paschal\u2019s Dig., Art. 25, Note 233.] The return of the sheriff should have stated all the facts necessary to show that the writ had been executed in conformity to the requirements of the law. In <em>ex parte </em>proceedings of this character, when the defendant has not had actual notice of the suit, the plaintiff must be held to a strict compliance with every essential requirement of the law. (Goodlove v. Gray, 7 Tex., 484; Blossman v. Letchford, 17 Tex., 649.)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">The return of the sheriff is not in conformity to law. It does not appear from the record that the defendant has been duly served with process. The judgment must, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>fore, be reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Ordered accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
