Lott, for \u00a7224 09, being the amount of an account for cash furnished and merchandise, &amp;c., sold and delivered by plaintiffs to said Lott on the 15th and 31st of December, 1855, including in the above amount the usual interest and commissions charged by commission merchants. Among other matters plaintiffs alleged in their petition, \u201cthat said amount remains wholly unpaid; that during the months of March and April, in the year 1857, they (plaintiffs) received two several letters from the said Lott, the defendant, to wit, one dated the 20th March, the other dated 13th April, in the said year 1857, in both of which letters said Lott acknowledged his indebtedness to petitioners, and expressed a willingness and determination to pay the same; said letters, marked \u2018 B \u2019 and \u2018 0,\u2019 are hereto appended and made part of this petition.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-11\">The letters are as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-12\">\u201cTravis, <em>March </em>20, 1857.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-13\">\u201cMr. John Dickinson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b189-14\">\u201cDear Sir: Your letter has come to hand, and I hasten to reply.

I am trying to collect in order to settle with you when I come down; but, if I should fail to collect, I will take it as a great favor to hold on until I can make a crop. I hope you are not uneasy about the matter, as I have been tolerably punctual in settling with you. Bad crops last year made everybody slow in settling. Hothing more.

We had a snow-storm night before last, and some frost last night, which has injured my cotton so much that I am afraid I will have to plant over again. I am much better off than some of my neighbors, as I have plenty of seed, and will plant until I get a stand. I hope you will not get uneasy about our business, as I intend to get through with my debts this \u25a0 season, if I have to sell property to do it, though I am in great hopes of a good cotton crop yet.

Defendant excepted to plaintiffs\u2019 amendments, first, because not sufficient in law; second, because uncertain and indefinite; third, because the letters referred to show that they were written to John Dickinson individually;, fourth, because it is not stated where or how the written acknowledgment was made; which the court sustained, and dismissed the cause, and to all of which ruling of the court plaintiffs excepted and prosecuted error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-7\"><em>Ben. T. </em>Harris, for plaintiffs in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-H\">The court below <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>erred in sustaining the plea of the statute of limitation. The letters declared on, and made part of the original petition, possess all the \u201c ingredients \u201d required to take the case out of the operation of the statute. They bear the test of the strictest construction yet placed upon the statute by this court. I insist that they contain an unqualified admission of a subsisting mature indebtedness to the plaintiffs. The language is plain, positive: \u201cthe money I am owing you,\u201d without qualification, without condition. In the case of Smith v. Fly, 24 Tex., 353, which is the latest adjudication in point, it is said, \u201cthe acknowledgment, to have the effect to take the ease out of the operation of the statute, must contain an unqualified admission of a subsisting indebtedness.\u201d The rule stated in the case of Bell v. Morrison, 1 Pet., and which has long been the rule of this court, is, \u201cthat the acknowledgment must show positively that the debt is due, either wholly or in part, and must be unqualified.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">The letters amply show the \u201cjustice of the claim,\u201d as defined by this court in the case of Webber v. Cochrane, 4 Tex., 37.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-7\">The letters recognize the existence of the debt, and declare the writer\u2019s willingness and intention to pay it. (Coles v. Kelsey, 2 Tex., 558.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b192-8\"><em>Hunt &amp; Holland, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjQ\">We contend that the court did not err in its rulings, for the petition shows upon its face that the cause of action was clearly barred. The account bears date December, 1855; the suit was commenced February 3,1859; and as for the letters, a careful reading of them will conclusively show that they have not, and were never intended to have, any reference whatever to the account sued on; they contain no acknowledgment of or promise to pay this debt; hence the petition was demurrable. Both letters are directed to John Dickinson, and not to Dickinson &amp; Co. The first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>letter, called letter \u201cB,\u201d in answer to one from Dickinson, says: \u201cAs regards the money I am owing you, I prefer seeing you before I make a new note.\u201d Then how can that letter, by any reasonable construction of language, .be made to apply to the account sued on, for which no note was ever executed? For if any note was ever executed for this account, surely the note would have been sued on, and not the account.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-4\">The second letter, written twenty-three days afterwards, has reference to the same subject-matter as the first, and simply offers an excuse or reason why Mr. Lott did not go down to Houston at the time he expected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AnS\">John Dickinson carries on one business, Dickinson &amp; Sessums another. An ingenious effort is made to make the letters written to Dickinson about the making of a new note to him apply to the account of Dickinson &amp; Sessums.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQAK\">\u201c An acknowledgment may be indefinite in respect to the intended application of it to a particular debt, and it ought clearly to appear, in all cases, that it relates to the identical debt which is sought to be recovered upon the strength of it.\u201d (Sands v. Gelston, 15 Johns., 511; Ang. on Limit., 254-255, and following.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-7\">Without quoting the different authorities, the court is referred to the opinion of Judge Story, in the case of Bell v. Morrison, 1 Peters, or 7 Curtis\u2019 Supreme Court Deports, in which the authorities are collected and examined, and it is submitted that pages 620 and 622 of the Curtis edition are conclusive of this case. (See also Smith v. Fly, 24 Tex., 353.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b193-8\">Moore, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AvK\">The judgment in this case cannot be sustained, upon the ground, that the account upon which the suit is brought is not referred to or embraced within the terms of the letters upon which the plaintiff relies as an acknowledgment of the justice of his claim, and that the alleged cause of action therefore appears, from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>face of the petition, barred by the statute of limitation. For although limitation is pleaded in bar to the suit, it is not set up by way of exception or demurrer. It is expressly provided by statute, that \u201climitation shall not be made available in any suit, unless it is specially set forth in the answer as a defense.\u201d (Sec. 5, act of 16th February, 1852.) It must unquestionably, however, be presented in a manner pertinent to the issue to be decided. And since, in determining the issues of law, the court does not look to the pleas in bar, it cannot be considered, in passing upon the demurrer, as set forth as a defense in the matter upon which alone the court is acting. A hasty perusal of the case of Leavitt v. Gooch, 12 Tex., 95, might leave the impression that a different rule had been recognized by this court. But it will be seen, from an examination of the record in that case, that a jury was waived and the <em>ease </em>submitted to the court; and it was for this reason the judgment was sustained, there being at most a mere irregularity in the form of the judgment. But if this were not so, as this case was decided in the district court before the passage of the law to which we have referred, it cannot be regarded as an authority upon the point. If, therefore, the judgment of the court below in this case was given upon the supposition that the cause of action appeared from the petition to be barred by the statute of limitations, it must be pronounced erroneous. Ahd as this is the only ground presented to us in support of the judgment, we do not feel called upon to do more than express our opinion upon it. To obviate any misconstruction, however, we will add, that we are of opinion, that the fourth special exception to the amended petition should have been sustained; but this did not authorize the general judgment against the plaintiff, for this amendment is certainly not vital, if in fact at all material, to the plaintiff\u2019s case. If, as is probable, it were intended by the amendment to refer to the defendant\u2019s letters, which are set out in the original petition, and to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>charge an acknowledgment in writing by them of the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim, it is certainly unnecessary, for that had already been sufficiently done in the original petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\"Whether the letters relied upon refer to the account on which the suit is brought, is a question of fact for the determination of the jury, when all the evidence bearing upon the point shall be properly presented to them, upon which it would be improper for us now to express an opinion. If the letters refer to the account upon which the suit is founded, they are evidently a sufficient acknowledgment in writing of the justice of the plaintiff\u2019s claim to relieve him from the bar of the statute. This is as far as in the present attitude of the case we need inquire.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">The judgment is reversed, and the cause</p>\n<p id=\"b195-8\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
