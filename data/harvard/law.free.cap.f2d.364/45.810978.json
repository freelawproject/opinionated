The order was based upon a determination that the police had acquired the property by an unlawful search. Petitioner has exhausted his state remedies. State v. MacKenzie, 1965, 161 Me. 123, 210 A.2d 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">On a record which, pursuant to stipulation, consisted of transcripts of hearings in the state court along with the state court orders and opinions, the district court found the following facts. On the night of March 3, 1963 a store in Millinocket, Maine was entered, and a number of wristwatehes, some gold coins and some beer stolen therefrom. At 8 o\u2019clock on the morning of March 4 two police officers, having had a report that one Albert and another had been seen intoxicated on the street the night before, and knowing that Albert had been convicted of a similar break at the same store on an earlier occasion, sought Albert and learned that he had a room in a rooming house close to the store. They inquired of the landlady, and upon being shown which room was Albert\u2019s one stationed himself at the back door of the room, and the other, Officer Rideout, knocked on the front door. On obtaining a response that he recognized to be Albert\u2019s voice, Rideout identified himself and said that he wished to talk with him. Albert replied, \u201cJust a minute,\u201d unlocked and opened the door, and walked back into the room. Rideout entered, and summoned the second officer. Albert was in his undershirt. Rideout asked him to come to the station for interrogation, a request which the district court found was not an arrest, and Albert started dressing. Rideout then saw a new wristwatch on his arm, the make of which was the same as one of those reported stolen. Another man, the present petitioner, was lying, apparently asleep, on another bed. Petitioner, on being spoken to, sat on the bed to put on a pair of trousers. When he started to put on a second pair he was asked whether this was his custom. Petitioner threw the trousers on the floor, and a gold coin fell out. Ride-out then arrested both Albert and petitioner, searched the room, and made the seizure in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\"> It is conceded that the officers had sought no warrant for arrest or for a search, and had no probable cause. Basic to the state\u2019s case is the question whether Rideout\u2019s entry into the room was freely consented to by Albert. If it was, petitioner\u2019s case falls. He concedes, as he must, that if Rideout was rightfully in the room as to Albert, he was rightfully there with respect to himself. The action of the police thereafter in noticing the watch, and the first of the coins, was not a search. It is \u201cnot a search to see what is patent and obvious either in daylight or even in artificial light.\u201d Fagundes v. United States, 1 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 673, 676; Davis v. United States, 9 Cir., 1964, 327 F.2d 301. What reasonably appeared to be stolen property having been displayed for their attention, the officers, if lawfully in the room, were then authorized to make an arrest, cf. Chapman v. United States, 9 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 383, cert. den. 382 U.S. 909, 86 S.Ct. 249, 15 L.Ed.2d 161 and, in turn, a search of the exhibited clothing. Ker v. State of California, 1963, 374 U.S. 23, 34-43, 83 S.Ct. 1623, 10 L.Ed.2d 726, cf. United States v. Rabinowitz, 1950, 339 U.S. 56, 70 S.Ct. 430, 94 L.Ed. 653. This, too, petitioner properly does not contest.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-12\">The Maine Superior and Supreme Judicial Courts found the requisite con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>sent.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court, in its opinion, recited that petitioner not only had presented the same record, but had agreed that the Maine courts\u2019 findings should be accepted, so far as supported. Even had they not so agreed, it is apparent, from the tenor of its opinion, that this was the approach the district court wished to take. It was not inappropriate procedure, where the issues had been fully tried, so long as the state court had not \u201cmisconceived a federal constitutional right.\u201d Fay v. Noia, 1963, 372 U.S. 391, 422, 83 S.Ct. 822, 9 L.Ed.2d 837. By the same token, we will base our own decision on a determination whether the state court findings were reliably and fairly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">Two possible questions are presented. Did the evidence warrant a finding that Albert had expressed consent to enter the room ? Was a finding warranted that the consent had not been coerced?</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The district court did not indicate doubt as to the first of these questions. When a householder, knowing the identity and purpose of his caller, opens his door and turns back inside, he expresses by his actions as adequate a consent to entry as he would by a verbal invitation. To be distinguished are cases where the householder opens a door not knowing who is there and finds himself faced with armed authority. In such cases the act of opening the door may merely be to see who is there, and turning back may only be retreating. But a policeman who identifies himself and his purpose from the other side of a closed door has every reason to assume that the act of unlocking and opening the door, without more, is a consent to talk, and that the walking back into the room is an implied invitation to conduct the talking inside.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">The district court\u2019s disagreement with the state court was on the other aspect of its decision. It said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b96-9\">\u201cThis court recognizes that it should not lightly upset a state court conviction. However, it is persuaded that the Maine court\u2019s holdings * * * [cannot] be reconciled with Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, 92 L.Ed. 436 (1948) * * *\u201d 248 F.Supp. at 499, 500. \u201cJohnson and the above [lower court] cases compel the conclusion that Albert\u2019s permission to the officers\u2019 entry into his apartment was \u2018granted in submission to authority rather than as an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right\u2019 * * Id. at 501.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">In our opinion the district court read into <em>Johnson, </em>and the cases which followed it, more than is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-13\">In <em>Johnson, </em>police officers, confidentially informed that opium was being used at a hotel, traced the smell of burning opium to a particular room, knocked on the door, and announced their identity. When defendant opened the door, one of the officers stated, \u201cI want to talk with you a little bit.\u201d Defendant stepped back, and allowed the officers to enter. The officers arrested the defendant and searched the room, discovering opium and smoking apparatus. In holding the search invalid, the Court pointed out that since the smell of opium coming from the room would, in all probability, have supported an application for a search warrant, and since there was no evidence that any change in the premises was imminent, this was a classic case in which the police should have proceeded by warrant. The government\u2019s contention that this was a search incident to a lawful arrest failed because the final link in the chain of probable cause was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>not forged until the officers entered and found the defendant the sole occupant of the room. The Court characterized the entry as having been gained under color of authority, and not through an intentional waiver of a constitutional right.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">Here the police were not seeking to bypass the commissioner. They did not, as in <em>Johnson, </em>misstate their purpose in seeking entry. Rideout\u2019s object was to talk with Albert. This was a legitimate objective, which he had reason to seek. He announced it to Albert, who understood, unlocked and opened the door. Rideout told the truth; he exercised no ruse; he threatened no force. After entry he made no attempt to engage in a search. We do not think that after a householder, who has been fully and honestly informed of the objectives of the police, makes a responsive gesture of invitation, the courts must engage in a psychological or physiological inquiry into whether the invitation was really meant. An ordinary person who knocks on a door and receives assent may properly consider himself an invited guest, and would be so considered by the courts; the householder would not be permitted to base a claim of trespass upon the assertion that in his heart he did not wish to admit his caller. Similarly, the fourth amendment, while it requires that a policeman seeking admittance to a private residence must fully regard the rights of the householder, does not require him to be clairvoyant.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">Officer Rideout\u2019s conduct in this case was entirely respectful of Albert\u2019s rights. We would agree with the holding in <em>Johnson </em>that where the officer\u2019s real objective is search and seizure the householder\u2019s consent should not only be clearly voluntary, but also specifically directed toward search and not merely toward entry. Cf. Reed v. Rhay, 9 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 498, 500-501, cert. den. 377 U.S. 917, 84 S.Ct. 1184, 12 L.Ed.2d 187. We agree also with cases holding that courts should be skeptical of a purported consent to a search made after the officer had been admitted. Catalanotte v. United States, 6 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 264; United States v. Smith, 2 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 657, 663-664, cert. den. 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717, 9 L.Ed.2d 716. Acquiescence in such a case may well be mere \u201cbravado,\u201d Pekar v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 319, 324-325, or may be granted in the belief that by now there is no choice. But even as to searches we have never understood the law to be that there cannot be consent, or that, if the consent is the result of a police request, there has been as a matter of law a voiding duress. See, e. g., Burke v. United States, 1 Cir., 1964, 328 F.2d 399, cert. den. 379 U.S. 849, 85 S. Ct. 91, 13 L.Ed.2d 52; Rees v. Peyton, 4 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 859;. Simmons v. Bomar, 6 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 365; Burnside v. State of Nebraska, 8 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 88. At least pre-Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (6/13/66), we will not hold that as a matter of law a policeman must introduce a noncustody request to talk by an explanation that one need not respond if one wishes not to.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-11\">Finally, we believe that the district court misconstrued the Superior Court\u2019s findings, or inferences, as to Albert\u2019s motivation in opening the door. The Superior Court found that \u201cAlbert\u2019s will was [not] overcome by fear of authority * * It added that it believed that Albert \u201crealized that there was nothing to be gained by denying the officers entrance and that he might as well let them in to find the stolen goods, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the discovery of which now appeared inevitable anyway.\u201d The district court interpreted this latter finding as contradicting the court\u2019s initial conclusion, because, in the district court\u2019s opinion, it meant that \u201cAlbert was acceding to an entry which he believed he was powerless to prevent, rather than freely and intelligently waiving a known constitutional right.\u201d We believe the Superior Court was not contradicting itself in two contiguous sentences. Our interpretation of its second sentence is much simpler. It is that the court believed that Albert had concluded that events had caught up with him, and that if he refused entry he would merely be postponing the inevitable. Cf. Gatterdam v. United States, 6 Cir., 1925, 5 F.2d 673, 674 (\u201cYou might as well consent, because, if you do not, we will go and get a search warrant,\u201d held not coercion.) Bowing to events, even if one is not happy about them, is not the same thing as being coerced. If it were, every plea of guilty would be involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Judgment will be entered reversing the judgment of the District Court and ordering the writ discharged.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">. The district court correctly pointed out that intimations in the opinion of the Supreme Judicial Oourt that petitioner lacked standing to complain of any lack of consent by Albert were erroneous. If the police were unlawfully in the room as to Albert, they were equally so as to petitioner. Jones v. United States, 1960, 362 U.S. 257, 265-267, 80 S.Ct. 725, 4 L.Ed.2d 697. However, this statement was advanced by the Maine court simply as an alternative ground of decision; consent was found in any event. See 161 Me. at 135-136, 210 A.2d 24.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b97-6\">. The Court of Appeals opinion, 9 Cir., 1947, 162 F.2d 562, discussed only probable cause and the need for a warrant; it did not pass on the voluntariness of the entry. The authority of <em>Johnson </em>has been questioned, United States v. Rabinowitz, supra, 339 U.S., at 85, 70 S.Ct. 430 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting), but it now seems to be established precedent for the strong preference accorded police action under warrant. United States v. Ventresca, 1965, 380 U.S. 102, 106-107, 85 S.Ct. 741, 13 L.Ed.2d 684; Chapman v. United States, 1961, 365 U.S. 610, 614-616, 81 S.Ct. 776, 5 L.Ed.2d 828.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b98-5\">COFFIN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AZS\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">I am unable to concur in the court\u2019s opinion. In my view it does not measure the facts by the rigorous standard required; goes beyond precedent in construing consent from ambiguous conduct; and establishes a novel and unworkable double level of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">When entry into a person\u2019s premises by officers of the law not having a warrant is sought to be justified by that person\u2019s consent, the applicable standard is a rigorous one. A \u201c[c] onsent to a search, in order to be voluntary, must be unequivocal, specific and intelligently given, uncontaminated by any duress or coercion, and is not lightly to be inferred.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Simmons v. Bomar, 6 Cir., 1965, 349 F.2d 365, 366. There must be \u201cclear and positive\u201d evidence of such consent. United States v. Smith, 2 Cir., 1962, 308 F.2d 657, 663, cert. denied, 372 U.S. 906, 83 S.Ct. 717. There is a burden on the government to show \u201cclearly\u201d that consent was \u201cfreely and intelligently\u201d given. Kovach v. United States, 6 Cir., 1931, 53 F.2d 639.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">In assessing the voluntariness of consent, the coercive effect of an unexpected confrontation with an officer of the law must be carefully weighed. In United States v. Smith, supra, 308 F.2d at 663, the court said, \u201cWhen a law enforcement officer knocks at the door, identifies himself, and asks to be allowed to search the premises, the acquiescence thus obtained is generally not considered to be voluntary consent\u201d. In Judd v. United States, 1951, 89 U.S.App.D.C. 64, 190 F.2d 649, 651, the court said, \u201cNonresistance to the orders or suggestions of the police is not infrequent * * *; true consent, free of fear or pressure, is not so readily to be found\u201d. See also Lee v. United States, 1956, 98 U.S.App.D.C. 97, 232 F.2d 354, 355; Higgins v. United States, 1954, 93 U.S.App.D.C. 340, 209 F.2d 819, 820.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">In the case before us, the officers came to the rooming house shortly after 8 a. m. The night before, Albert had drunk six or seven large and small bottles of beer, had gone to bed after 2 a. m., and, when the officer knocked, did not think he was \u201cstill drunk\u201d but was \u201cjust sick from drinking\u201d. Officer Rideout testified at the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence as.follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AYu\">\u201cQ. Did he [Albert] ever invite you to come into the room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-12\">\u201cA. He opened the door and turned around and walked away * * *. When I knocked on the door I identified myself and told him I would like <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>to talk with him. If Mr. Albert had not wanted to invite me into his room or to talk with [sic] all he had to do was say so and keep the door locked. When unlocking the door I took that as an invitation that he would talk with me. The invitation extended to the room because he turned and walked back into it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Officer Rideout at another point stated that he was admitted by Albert and \u201cshown the courtesy of looking about the room. * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Albert called by the state as a witness, described his attitude at the moment of entry as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">\u201cQ. Did you want him to come in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">\u201cA. No (laughing).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">\u201cQ. Why didn\u2019t you object to his coming in ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-10\">\u201cA. It\u2019s pretty hard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-11\">\u201cQ. Was it because he was a police officer ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-12\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-13\">He was clad in shorts and T-shirt. A conference in the corridor might well not have seemed a reasonable alternative to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-14\">From this record (together with the facts reported in the opinion of the court) my brethren are satisfied that the government has sustained its burden of proving by clear and positive evidence that consent to entry was unequivocal, specific and intelligently given, free of fear or pressure. I think that such a conclusion is unwarranted by both the facts of this case and the sizeable number of relevant decided cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-15\">Putting aside for the moment Johnson v. United States, 1948, 333 U.S. 10, 68 S.Ct. 367, a survey of cases from lower federal courts indicates a lengthy tradition \u2014 before and after <em>Johnson </em>\u2014 of reluctance to infer consent, under even more positive evidence than that in the case at bar. The cases where entry has been made and consent claimed are of three kinds: those where the entry was \u201cto talk\u201d; those where search was desired without prior arrest; and those where search followed arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-18\">Of the \u201centry to talk\u201d cases, Pekar v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 315 F.2d 319, is perhaps closest to the facts of the present case. The defendant was suspected of stealing luggage from an air terminal. FBI agents, finding that a person meeting their description was in a certain hotel room, knocked on the door, said they wanted to talk about an FBI investigation, waited ten minutes, repeated their request, and showed their identification cards through the louvers of an outer door. Defendant finally opened the door, the agents entered, observed the purloined luggage, and asked if defendant minded their looking around. The court reversed the lower court, saying that defendant was \u201cimpliedly coerced\u201d and that \u201cthe agents\u2019 superior position to that of the \u2018confused\u2019 defendant was the motivating force behind defendant\u2019s opening of the door and allowing the agents to \u2018look around\u2019 once they were inside.\u201d 315 F.2d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-19\">In Higgins v. United States, supra, 209 F.2d at 820, a police officer identified himself to defendant and asked to talk with defendant in his room. The officer testified that defendant said \u201cthat that was all right and asked me to accompany him to his room. * * * I asked him then if I could look around. He stated that I could * * The court held that, despite this direct verbal evidence of acquiescence, there was no real voluntary consent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-22\">The acquiescence of a defendant to the suggestion of a narcotics agent, \u201cLet\u2019s go up to your room and talk\u201d was held to fall short of an understanding and intentional waiver of a constitutional right. United States v. Como, 2 Cir., 1965, 340 F.2d 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>In \u201centry to talk\u201d cases where consent was found to have been given, the findings rested on, apparently, direct and unambiguous verbal invitations. In Davis v. United States, 9 Cir., 1964, 327 F.2d 301, where entry was held lawful, the officer had sought admission \u201cat high noon\u201d and had been specifically invited in by an eight year old girl, whose authority to say \u201ccome in\u201d was found \u201cnot unusual, or unexpected or unauthorized\u201d. In Reed v. Rhay, 9 Cir., 1963, 323 F.2d 498, 500 n. 2, the officers asked defendant if they could go into his house and talk with him \u201cand he invited them in\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">In the cases involving request to search without pre-existing arrest, there is substantial authority declaring that requisite consent was lacking even though the defendant has said \u201cAll right\u201d, \u201cCome in\u201d, or words to that effect. Catalanotte v. United States, 6 Cir., 1953, 208 F.2d 264; United States v. Marra, W.D.N.Y., 1930, 40 F.2d 271; United States v. Evans, D.D.C., 1961, 194 F.Supp. 90; United States v. Slusser, S.D.Ohio, 1921, 270 F. 818; United States v. Marquette, N.D.Cal., 1920, 271 F. 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">Cases in this category (request to search without pre-existing arrest) where consent was held to have been given are those where it was clearly given, where the fact of consent was assumed, or where the holding today might be successfully challenged. In Rees v. Peyton, 4 Cir., 1965, 341 F.2d 859, one co-owner of the premises signed a written consent and the other orally approved entry by the police. In three cases the court assumed consent had been given without describing the factual situation. Carson v. United States, 5 Cir., 1964, 332 F.2d 784, cert. denied, 379 U.S. 835, 85 S.Ct. 69, 13 L.Ed.2d 43; Simmons v. Bomar, supra; Chapman v. United States, 9 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 383. And in Gatterdam v. United States, 6 Cir., 1925, 5 F.2d 673, cited by the majority, the court construed as consent the following language: \u201cIf I do not consent, you will go and get a search warrant, and you might as well search now.\u201d That such a holding would be followed in that circuit 41 years later is doubtful in view of Catalanotte v. United States, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">As for searches made after arrest, several cases bear witness to the caution exercised by courts in construing even words of positive permission as true consent. United States v. Smith, supra; Channell v. United States, 9 Cir., 1960, 285 F.2d 217; Judd v. United States, supra; United States v. Gregory, S.D. N.Y., 1962, 204 F.Supp. 884. In Burnside v. State of Nebraska, 8 Cir., 1965, 346 F.2d 88, consent was clearly proven by the urgent request of defendant that police visit his home because of his concern over his wife\u2019s suicidal tendencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In Lee v. United States, supra, officers visited defendant\u2019s apartment. There were differences in testimony about whether the door was open, but the officers did not use force. The court said, \u201cIn any event, although they did not use force, they carried with them such compulsion of authority that the subsequent search cannot be said to have been with the acquiescence of Lee.\u201d 232 F.2d 355. This is the only case (other than Johnson v. United States, supra) involving attempted proof of consent other than through words, oral or written, that has come to my attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">In short, I can only regard the holding of the court in this case \u2014 that, after an officer knocks, identifies himself, and announces his purpose, \u201cthe act of unlocking and opening the door, without more, is a consent to talk, and that the walking back into the room is an implied invitation to conduct the talking inside\u201d' \u2014 as going beyond all of the cases which have come to my attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-10\">Apart from the authorities, there are two other difficulties I find in the court\u2019s opinion. Both difficulties are presented by the court\u2019s efforts to distinguish Johnson v. United States, supra. The opinion seems to take two approaches. In its first discussion of <em>Johnson, </em>it characterizes the case as \u201ca classic case in which the police should have proceeded by warrant\u201d. If <em>Johnson </em>were to apply only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>when there is time and basis for obtaining a warrant, clearer manifestation of consent to entry would be required when officers had probable cause than when they did not have it. Under such guidelines, officers would be sorely tempted to suppress their independent evidence and claim entry only for the purpose of talking with a suspect.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">The court\u2019s opinion also seeks to limit <em>Johnson </em>to cases \u201cwhere the officer\u2019s real objective is search and seizure\u201d. In such cases, my brethren agree that \u201cthe householder\u2019s consent should not only be clearly voluntary, but also specifically directed toward search and not merely toward entry\u201d. The corollary of this proposition is that if the officer\u2019s \u201creal\u201d objective is merely to enter to talk, somewhat less unequivocal and clear consent suffices to waive one\u2019s constitutional right. This, it seems to me, is an unacceptable and unworkable doctrine. In effect it establishes a bifocal view of Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">Such a view, it seems to me, is unworkable because, to borrow my brethren\u2019s word, it would require the courts to be \u201cclairvoyant\u201d in assessing the motives of the officer. It is unacceptable because, under the court\u2019s view of the law, an officer, announcing his purpose as \u201cto talk\u201d, could gain entry into a house, apartment, or room on the basis of equivocal or ambiguous conduct prompted in large part by the instinct to submit to authority. Once inside, after preliminary conversation, any officer worth his salt would put the inevitable question, \u201cDo you mind if I look around?\u201d With not only the camel\u2019s nose but the camel himself in the tent, any real freedom of choice would be an illusion. The caveat of the majority that courts should be \u201cskeptical\u201d of purported consent under such circumstances is a frail substitute for the threshold requirement of unequivocal, specific, and intelligently given consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">In short, I look upon a categorization of consent linked to avowed purposes of entry as an erosion of the Fourth Amendment. It does not read, \u201cThe right of the people to be secure in their * * * houses * * * against unreasonable searches except for the entry of officers who wish merely to talk.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b101-13\">The very legitimate question remains: what is the police officer to do in such a situation as Officer Rideout faced? Where actions are ambiguous, I suggest that at least a verbal request to enter should be made. A knock on the door and a police identification are all too easily translated into \u201cOpen in the name of the law\u201d. A request to enter might very well not change the result in most cases. But it is a signal that there is still a choice to be made and rights to be respected.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This would not seem too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>much of a burden to impose on the police and would at least insure the presence of some unequivocal evidence of consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">So, while the court concludes that, after a policeman knocks, identifies himself, and states his purpose, the \u201cact of unlocking and opening the door, without more, is a consent to talk, and * * * the walking back into the room is an implied invitation to conduct the talking inside\u201d, I would have us hold on the facts of this case that there was not enough clear evidence of \u201can affirmative response\u201d, unequivocal, intelligently given, and free of duress, to make the entry lawful.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-8\">. Cf. Johnson v. Zerbst, 1937, 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, \u00cd023, 82 L.Ed. 1461, \u201cIt has been pointed out that \u2018courts indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver\u2019 of fundamental constitutional rights and that we \u2018do not presume acquiescence in the loss of fundamental rights.\u2019 A waiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege. !\u00a1S * * \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-16\">. In this case, as in others, it is perhaps arguable that the purpose of entry was not simply to talk but to \u201clook around\u201d and search. This very observation underscores the difficulty of making the required specificity of consent depend on the purpose of the requesting officer. Any officer gaining access to a room or home of a suspect must also expect to use his eyes.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">. My suggestion does not go so far as to include a statement that the householder has the right not to consent. It merely sets the stage for a clear response to a specific request to enter on premises. That <em>at least </em>a specific request to enter should be made where voluntary consent is sought to be drawn from ambiguous actions seems to follow <em>a fortiori </em>from the language of the Supreme Court in Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436, 86 S. Ct. 1602 (6/13/66), where the Court, in spelling out the rationale for a warning to an in-custody suspect of his right to remain silent, said: \u201cFor those unaware of the privilege, the warning is needed simply to make them aware of it \u2014the threshold requirement for an intelligent decision as to its exercise. More important, such a warning is an absolute prerequisite in overcoming the inherent pressures of the interrogation atmosphere.\u201d In this case, the pressures were those created by the appearance of the officer at the doorway, as Albert testified. The analysis is equally applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"AP\">In so citing <em>Miranda, </em>I do so with full recognition that the Court was speaking of another constitutional right in an opinion which is not retrospective. Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882, (6/20/66).</p>\n<p id=\"AD\">But, since, in my view, this court is articulating clearly a new rule covering non-verbal acts in response to a knock on the door and an officer\u2019s announced purpose to talk, I deem <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>reasoning relevant in corroborating the traditional requirements of specificity and clarity in waiving the Fourth Amendment right.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
