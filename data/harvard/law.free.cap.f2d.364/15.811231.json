The prior felony conviction occurred on March 16, 1949 after appellant pleaded guilty to a charge of burglary in the third degree. On March 23, 1964 appellant made a motion in the Nassau County Court for re-sentence asserting that the 1949 conviction should be set aside on the ground that he had not intelligently waived his right to counsel at that time. A hearing held before Nassau County Judge Dowsey on September 24, 1964 revealed that appellant was indicted on March 8, 1949 on a charge of burglary in the third degree and petit larceny. On March 9, 1949 he was arraigned before County Judge Donohue at which time he was advised of his right to counsel; expressly-waived his right to counsel; and pleaded guilty as charged. Later that same day appellant, in a note sent from the Nassau County Jail, advised the District Attorney\u2019s office that he was aware that he was entitled to counsel and wondered if he could have one at that time. He received no reply and was brought before the county court seven days later, on March 16, 1949, for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-14\">At the September 24, 1964 <em>coram nobis </em>hearing, appellant testified that prior to the actual sentencing he had a conversation with Assistant District Attorney Harold M. Spitzer in which Spitzer acknowledged the receipt of the note and that appellant said that he wanted a lawyer to explore the possibility of pleading guilty to a lesser offense than burglary. According to appellant, he asked Spitzer whether he felt a lawyer could help him and Spitzer replied that he did not think anyone could help appellant. Although Spitzer testified at the hearing that he did not recall the conversation, he did record his impression of the meeting with appellant on the back of appellant\u2019s note as follows: \u201cI spoke to defendant in court. Kept vacillating. Finally decided he did not want a lawyer.\u201d Moreover, prior to imposing a sentence on appellant, County Judge Donohue indicated that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>was aware that appellant had recently requested counsel and asked appellant if he had changed his mind. Appellant answered yes and stated that he had no objection to having sentence imposed at that time. The sole explanation offered by appellant at the state court hearing for his decision to proceed without counsel in 1949 was that he was under the impression that the District Attorney\u2019s office \u201chad something to do with the assigning of counsel\u201d and he felt that in view of Spitzer\u2019s remark that no one could help him, \u201cthere was nothing I could do.\u201d Other evidence introduced at the hearing showed that when appellant entered his guilty plea in 1949 he was twenty-three years old, had attended school through the eighth grade, and had prior criminal experience. Previously he had been arrested for burglary and petit larceny at which time he was represented by counsel assigned by the state court on its own motion and was permitted to plead guilty to petit larceny.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The state court denied appellant\u2019s motion for resentence finding that the evidence adduced at the hearing showed that he had intelligently made his choice to proceed without counsel in 1949. Thereafter, appellant applied to the district court for a writ of habeas corpus which was denied without a hearing in an order dated October 5, 1965. The court concluded that appellant received a full and fair hearing in the state court and that the finding that the waiver was valid was \u201centirely consistent with the evidence before the court.\u201d On November 26, 1965 the court granted appellant\u2019s request for a certificate of probable cause, leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis, </em>and assigned the Legal Aid Society as appellant\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">On appeal, appellant argues that the evidence adduced at the state court hearing was insufficient to support a finding that his waiver was intelligent, relying on his contention that his decision to proceed without counsel was induced by Spitzer\u2019s alleged statement that no one could help him. We do not agree. In view of appellant\u2019s prior experience with assigned counsel, Spitzer\u2019s comment that appellant kept vacillating and finally decided he did not want a lawyer, and the sentencing judge\u2019s inquiry concerning appellant\u2019s change of mind, the state court was justified in rejecting appellant\u2019s attempt to shift the responsibility for his actions to Spitzer. Von Moltke v. Gillies, 332 U.S. 708, 68 S.Ct. 316, 92 L.Ed. 309 (1948) cited by appellant does not require a contrary result. There a defendant claimed that her waiver of a right to counsel had been coerced by federal officers who had given her erroneous legal advice. While the Court pointed out that a waiver must take place in the \u201cabsence of subverting factors so that the choice is clearly free and responsible * * <em>id. </em>at 729, 68 S.Ct. at 326 (separate opinion of Justice Frankfurter), it remanded the case to the district court, with directions to make a finding as to the effect of the federal officers\u2019 advice on the defendant\u2019s waiver. <em>Id. </em>at 727, 68 S.Ct. 316. Here the record indicates that the state court determined that Spitzer did not exert a subverting influence on appellant, i. e., that his waiver was free and responsible, and there is ample evidence to support that determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-9\"> Appellant\u2019s contention that the district court erred in failing to hold a hearing on the ground that the state court imposed an improper burden of proof on appellant is untenable. Initially, the burden is on the State to demonstrate that a petitioner affirmatively acquiesced in the surrender of his right to counsel, i. e., that he was advised of and waived the right. Once .the State satisfies that requirement, the petitioner is \u201ccalled upon to prove by a fair preponderance of the evidence that his waiver was not competently or understandingly made.\u201d United States ex rel. Brown v. Fay, 242 F.Supp. 273, 276 (S.D.N.Y. 1965). It is clear that the state court probably employed these principles in disposing of appellant\u2019s motion for resentence. There is no doubt that appellant affirmatively acquiesced in the surrender of his right to counsel and, thus, was re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>quired to show that his waiver was not freely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">Finally, the record shows that the state court\u2019s findings were adequate and, thus, there was no necessity for a further hearing in the district court. See Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293, 83 S.Ct. 745, 9 L.Ed.2d 770 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
