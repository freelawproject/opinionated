Grand Prairie is a home rule city, abutting on its eastern limits the City of Dallas. The two theaters are known as the Twin Drive-In Theater. Twin West exhibits motion pictures suitable for general family viewing. Twin East exhibits so-called \u201cart pictures.\u201d Mrs. Fisher testified that these include pictures where the nude female body is exhibited to the patrons of the theater as well as being visible from the public highways and streets. They include also movie screen scenes visible to the audience and to the people on the public highways and streets in which a female performer reveals her uncovered breasts. At Twin East only such so-called \u201cadult\u201d films are shown, which Mrs. Fisher con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>ceded are not suitable to show to children.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-5\">In 1963 Mr. and Mrs. Fisher were charged with the exhibition of an \u201cobscene\u201d motion picture in violation of Vernon\u2019s Ann.Texas Penal Code, Art. 527, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit A to this opinion. The case was dismissed because of the exemption written into the act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-6\">\u201cThe provisions of this Act shall not apply to any motion pictures produced or manufactured as commercial motion pictures which (1) have the seal under the Production Code of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc.; or (2) legally move in interstate commerce under Federal Law; or (3) are legally imported from foreign countries into the United States and have been passed by a Customs Office of the United States Government at any port of entry.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">After this dismissal, various groups of citizens in Grand Prairie circulated petitions which read substantially as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-8\">\u201cWe, the undersigned, do hereby petition the City of Grand Prairie to take necessary action to prohibit the Twin Drive-In Theatres located between Highway 80 and Jefferson Boulevard in east Grand Prairie from showing lewd, obscene, offensive pictures. These pictures are in full view of all persons using the above mentioned traffic routes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-9\">Thereafter, the individual defendants (with the exception of Fred Conover, the Chief of Police), acting as the mayor and city council of Grand Prairie, passed two ordinances numbered 1621 and 1622 A copy of each of these ordinances is attached as Exhibits B and C, respectively, to this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Chemline, Inc. filed its complaint against Grand Prairie, its Mayor, City Councilmen, and Chief of Police, seeking to enjoin the enforcement of both ordinances, principally upon the ground that they abridge First Amendment freedoms of speech and expression. Grand Prairie and the individual defendants defended, seeking to enforce said ordinances under the general police power of the City and because they claim that the operation of Twin East presents a clear and present danger to the citizens of Grand Prairie.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-14\">After a hearing, the district court permanently enjoined the defendants from enforcing paragraphs Via and VIII of Ordinance 1621. The defendants had earlier admitted that the standards set forth in Via are too vague and had agreed to abandon that subdivision of the ordinance. Paragraph VIII reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b771-15\"><em>\u201cUnlawful to Exhibit Nude or Semi-nude Pictures on Theatre Screens within View of Public Street or Highway. </em>It shall be unlawful for any licensee, ticket seller, ticket taker, usher, motion picture machine operator and any other person connected with or employed by any licensee to show or exhibit at a theater in the City or to aid or assist in such exhibition any motion picture, slide, or other exhibit which is visible from any public street or highway in which the bare buttocks or the bare female breasts of the human body are shown or in which striptease, burlesque or nudist-type scenes constitute the main or primary material of such movie, slide or exhibit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-16\">The district court denied Chemline\u2019s prayer for an injunction against the enforcement of the remainder of Ordinance 1621 and against the enforcement of Ordinance 1622. The City and the individual defendants appeal from that part of the judgment enjoining them from enforcing paragraph VIII of Ordinance 1621. Chemline appeals from that part of the judgment denying its prayer for an injunction against the enforcement of the remainder of Ordinance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>1621 and against the enforcement of Ordinance 1622.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">CITY\u2019S APPEAL</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">As has been stated, the appeal of the City and its officers is from that part of the final judgment which enjoins them from enforcing paragraph VIII of Ordinance 1621, which has been quoted.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">The City concedes that, \u201cThe guarantees of free speech and press set by the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and protected by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States was extended to the motion picture industry in Burstyn v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 77 [777, 96 L.Ed. 1098].\u201d It further concedes that the pictures and scenes to which the quoted paragraph of the ordinance applies may not necessarily be \u201cobscene\u201d as defined by the Supreme Court. It emphasizes, however, that the paragraph applies only when the exhibit is visible from a public street or highway, and insists that the paragraph is a reasonable restriction necessary to safeguard the public interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-7\">The district court held that paragraph VIII violates the First Amendment. It concluded that there was no evidence that the <em>average person </em>from the highway viewing pictures prohibited by the paragraph would be invited to antisocial conduct, that parking cars on the shoulder of the highway in violation of the no parking ordinance presents no clear and present danger, that the evidence of accidents and of possible traffic hazards in the vicinity of Twin East is insufficient to show such a threat to public safety as to create a clear and present danger. The district court defined the test of clear and present danger as follows: \u201cIn order to show a clear and present danger, the substantive evil must be extremely serious, and the degree of imminence extremely high before the freedom guaranteed by the First Amendment will be interfered with. Such danger is not shown to exist requiring the enactment of Article VIII of Ordinance 1621.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b772-8\">We think that the district court has fallen into the error of applying the term \u201cclear and present danger\u201d as a mechanical test without regard to the context of its application. See American Communications Association, CIO v. Douds, 1950, 339 U.S. 382, 394, et seq., 70 S.Ct. 674, 94 L.Ed. 925.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-9\">It is almost self-evident that a city is well within its legitimate police powers in enacting reasonable ordinances to protect children in its public streets and highways from viewing \u201cbare buttocks\u201d or \u201cbare female breasts\u201d or \u201cstriptease, burlesque or nudist-type scenes which constitute the main or primary material.\u201d The City introduced witnesses to show that the Twin East screen was clearly and plainly visible for approximately nine-tenths of a mile on U. S. Highway 80, and for about three-tenths of a mile on Jefferson Boulevard. Mr. Burr, Lieutenant of Police, testified to a series of moral offenses on the premises, including the forcible rape of a fourteen-year-old girl and teenagers arrested for illegal possession of alcohol, of lewd material, and caught in the act of masturbation. Dr. Glenn, a psychiatrist, testified as to the harmful effects on children viewing such scenes from the highways.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-10\">\u201cA. * * * For instance, a young child who is being brought up in a rather strict home with certain standards that prohibit the discussion of this kind of sexual stimulation \u2014 even in the relatively short time that the child was exposed to this might arouse considerable question in their mind and a great deal of concern, and this would range from the age of about four on up to about 12 or 14. By that time they most likely already know most of the facts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-11\">\u201cQ. How might this concern or disturbance manifest itself in children in this age classification ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b772-12\">\u201cA. Well, there are many ways it could manifest itself. It could create doubt in their minds about what their parents are telling them, why haven\u2019t <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>my parents told me about this kind of thing, and weaken the parental structure. It could encourage fantasies along this line which would be viewed as very forbidden, and generally, a rather undesirable conflict might develop in the child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-5\">\u201cA. * * * I think if you get a</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-6\">child who has already a somewhat shakey environment and who already has considerable problems in their sexual fantasy area, it might aggravate this quite considerably.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">* -x- * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">\u201cQ. What about the adolescent years, Doctor, what effect will we see from the exhibition of this type of thing during the adolescent years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-9\">\u201cA. Shall we say it might heat passions that were somewhat latent or not very active, to try and reproduce what was being shown on the screen.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-10\">Lieutenant De Wolfe, the police officer in charge of traffic, testified that he had found it impossible to effectively enforce parking regulations adjacent to the theater.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-11\">\u201cPrimarily, because of the frequency of the occurrence of parking violations in that area and the shortage of police manpower in the City of Grand Prairie, it would be impractical. We would nearly have to keep an officer right there on the spot, during the hours of theatre operation, solely to enforce the No Parking regulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b773-12\">He further testified to instances of erratic driving and to a number of accidents which in his opinion were caused by \u201cfailure to keep a proper lookout or failure to keep one\u2019s mind on his business.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">It may be noted that paragraph VIII of the ordinance is not directed toward the paid audience for which the pictures are intended. As found by the district court, the patron buys a ticket for admission and parks his automobile in a position on a ramp in close proximity to a post on which is located an in-car-speaker. \u201cFor the enjoyment of any of the commercial motion pictures exhibited by the plaintiff it is necessary to have the benefit of a speaker which reproduces the sound tract that runs in conjunction with the action viewed upon the screen.\u201d There was no evidence to show how expensive it might be to construct a wall or screen which would confine the exhibitions to the view of those for whom they were intended.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">Since Chemline admitted that the pictures were not suitable for viewing by children and undertook not to admit children, it seems not unreasonable for the City to require that one exhibiting such \u201cadult\u201d films for a profit should do so on premises not accessible to the view of children.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-17\">So far as appears from its reasoning, the district court gave no separate consideration to the harmful effects of such pictures on children, but confined its consideration to their effect on the \u201caverage person.\u201d It was not proper thus to ignore the special interests of children. As said by Mr. Justice Brennan in Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 1964, 378 U.S. 184, 195, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 1682, 12 L.Ed.2d 793:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-18\">\u201cWe recognize the legitimate and indeed exigent interest of States and localities throughout the Nation in preventing the dissemination of material deemed harmful to children. But that interest does not justify a total suppression of such material, the effect of which would be to \u2018reduce the adult population * * * to reading only what is fit for children.\u2019 Butler v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380, 383 [77 S.Ct. 524, 526, 1 L.Ed.2d 412], State and local authorities might well consider whether their objectives in this area would be better served by laws aimed specifically at preventing distribution of objectionable material to childen, rather than at totally prohibiting its dissemination. Since the present conviction is based upon exhibition of the film to the public at large and not upon its exhibition to children, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>judgment must be reviewed under the strict standard applicable in determining the scope of the expression that is protected by the Constitution.\u201d <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">It seems to us that the City has followed the suggestion of the Supreme Court and has enacted an ordinance reasonably aimed at preventing the exhibition of objectionable pictures to children.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">If there be capacity for evil in a motion picture \u201cit may be relevant in determining the permissible scope of community control.\u201d Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson, 1952, 343 U.S. 495, 502, 72 S.Ct. 777, 780, 96 L.Ed. 1098. As said in American Communications Association, CIO v. Douds, supra, 339 U.S. at 397, 70 S.Ct. at 683: \u201cWhen the effect of a statute or ordinance upon the exercise of First Amendment freedoms is relatively small and the public interest to be protected is substantial, it is obvious that a rigid test requiring a showing of imminent danger to the security of the Nation is an absurdity.\u201d See also Adams Newark Theater Co. v. City of Newark, 1957, 354 U.S. 931, 77 S.Ct. 1395, 1 L.Ed.2d 1533; Breard v. City of Alexandria, 1951, 341 U.S. 622, 71 S.Ct. 920, 95 L.Ed. 1233; Feiner v. People of State of New York, 1951, 340 U.S. 315, 71 S.Ct. 303, 95 L.Ed. 267; Kovacs v. Cooper, 1949, 336 U.S. 77, 69 S.Ct. 448, 93 L.Ed. 513; Chaplinsky v. State of New Hampshire, 1942, 315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031; Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 1941, 312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">In brief, the right to disseminate motion pictures is not absolute. It does not mean that any motion picture can be distributed at any time, at any place, and under any circumstances. We think that the City of Grand Prairie acted well within its authority in adopting paragraph VIII of Ordinance 1621.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-10\">CHEMLINE\u2019S APPEAL.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-11\">Chemline attacks the definition of \u201cobscene\u201d used in both ordinances, viz: \u201cFor purposes of this ordinance, the word \u2018obscene\u2019 is defined as whether to the average person, applying contemporary national standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interests.\u201d Chem-line insists that that definition omits the quality of \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d required by Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, 1962, 370 U.S. 478, 486, 82 S.Ct. 1432, 1436, 8 L.Ed.2d 639:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b774-12\">\u201cObscenity under the federal statute thus requires proof of two distinct elements: (1) patent offensiveness; and (2) \u2018prurient interest\u2019 appeal. Both must conjoin before challenged material can be found \u2018obscene\u2019 under \u00a7 1461. In most obscenity cases, to be sure, the two elements tend to coalesce, for that which is patently offensive will also usually carry the requisite \u2018prurient interest\u2019 appeal. It is only in the unusual instance where, as here, the \u2018prurient interest\u2019 appeal of the material is found limited to a particular class of persons that occasion arises for a truly independent inquiry into the question whether or \u00abnot the material is patently offensive.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b774-14\">The two ordinances adopted substantially the test of obscenity as stated in Roth v. United States, 1957, 354 U.S. 476, 489, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1311, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498, viz: \u201cwhether to the average person, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u201d Instead, however, of referring to \u201ccontemporary community standards,\u201d the ordinances referred to \u201ccontemporary national standards,\u201d in accord with the case of Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, 1964, 378 U.S. 184, 195, 84 S.Ct. 1676, 12 L.Ed.2d 793. The definition of obscenity in Roth, as thus qualified, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>been consistently followed in every obscenity case thereafter decided by the Supreme Court. See Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 1963, 372 U.S. 58, 65, 83 S.Ct. 631, 9 L.Ed.2d 584; Jacobellis v. State of Ohio, supra; Freedman v. State of Maryland, 1965, 380 U.S. 51, 52, 85 S.Ct. 734, 13 L.Ed.2d 649; Ginzburg v. United States, 1966, 383 U.S. 463, 86 S.Ct. 942, 969, 16 L.Ed.2d 31; Mishkin v. State of New York, 1966, 383 U.S. 502, 86 S.Ct. 958, 16 L.Ed.2d 56; A Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, 1966, 383 U.S. 413, 86 S.Ct. 975, 16 L.Ed.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">It was not the intention of Manual Enterprises, Inc. v. Day, supra, to add to the Roth definition a separate element of \u201cpatent offensiveness.\u201d On the contrary, that opinion clearly indicated that what it referred to as \u201cpatent offensiveness\u201d was already included in the Roth definition. \u201cThese magazines cannot be deemed so offensive on their face as to affront current community standards of decency \u2014 a quality that we shall hereafter refer to as \u2018patent offensiveness\u2019 or \u2018indecency.\u2019 \u201d 370 U.S. at 482, 82 S.Ct. at 1434. Any possible doubt on that score was removed by Memoirs v. Massachusetts, supra, where it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-7\">\u201cWe defined obscenity in Roth in the following terms: \u2018[WJhether to the average persons, applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.\u2019 354 U.S., at 489. Under this definition, as elaborated in subsequent cases, three elements must coalesce: it must be established that (a) the dominant theme of the material taken as a whole appeals to a prurient interest in sex; (b) the material is patently offensive because it affronts contemporary community standards relating to the description or representation of sexual matters; and (c) the material is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d (383 U.S. 418, 86 S.Ct. 977.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">In short, if a work appeals to the prurient interest of the average American judged by contemporary national standards, then it is <em>ipso facto </em>\u201cpatently offensive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">Paragraph IV of Ordinance 1621 imposes a license fee as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-11\"><em>\u201cLicense Fee. </em>An application for license hereunder shall be accompanied by a license fee of $25.00 to defray the expense of investigation and issuance of license, which fee shall be returned to the applicant if the license is not issued. Any license issued hereunder shall be renewable on the 1st day of January of each succeeding year after the date of issuance upon payment of a renewal fee of $10.00.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-12\">Chemline insists that that license fee is an unreasonable tax upon the right of free communication in violation of the First Amendment, and relies principally upon Grosjean v. American Press Co., 1936, 297 U.S. 233, 56 S.Ct. 444, 80 L.Ed. 660. Without elaborating upon the history of that case, we think it clear that it has no application to this small license tax, for as there said: \u201cIt is not intended by anything we have said to suggest that the owners of newspapers are immune from any of the ordinary forms of taxation for support of the government. But this is not an ordinary form of tax, but one single in kind, with a long history of hostile misuse against the freedom of the press.\u201d 297 U.S. at 250, 56 S.Ct. at 449. Similarly, Murdock v. Com. of Pennsylvania, 1943, 319 U.S. 105, 63 S.Ct. 870, 87 L.Ed. 1292, has no application to \u201ca- nominal fee imposed as a regulatory measure to defray the expenses of policing the activities in question.\u201d 319 U.S. 113, 114, 63 S.Ct. 875. An operator of a motion picture theater, like others, must pay equitable and nondiseriminatory taxes on its business. See Associated Press v. National Labor Relations Board, 1937, 301 U.S. 103, 133, 57 S.Ct. 650, 81 L.Ed. 953; Arizona Publishing Co. v. O\u2019Neil, D.C.Ariz.1938, 22 F.Supp. 117, aff\u2019d, 304 U.S. 543, 58 S.Ct. 950, 82 L.Ed. 1518. See also Cox v. State of New Hampshire, 1941, 312 U.S. 569, 61 S.Ct. 762, 85 L.Ed. 1049.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>Chemline does not and cannot question the propriety of requiring theaters to conform to health, building, electrical, fire and sanitary standards. The nominal license fee is imposed expressly to \u201cdefray the expense of investigation and issuance of license.\u201d There is no evidence that that fee is excessive. Chemline\u2019s constitutional attacks upon the two ordinances are not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Chemline insists, however, that Art. 527 of the Penal Code of Texas<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> precludes the defendants from passing an ordinance regulating commercial motion pictures in the exempted categories. The district court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">\u201cArticle 527 of the Penal Code of the State of Texas prohibiting obscene pictures but excluding from its provisions motion pictures produced or manufactured as commercial motion pictures which (1) have the seal under the production Code of the Motion Picture Association of America, Inc., or (2) legally move in interstate commerce under Federal law, or (3) are legally imported from foreign countries into the United States and have passed the Customs Office of the United States Government at any port of entry, leaves the field of regulation of such pictures excluded from Article 527 to the City.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-6\">\u201cSince motion pictures excluded from Article 527 of the Penal Code of the State of Texas, as set out in the above conclusion, the power to regulate such pictures is delegated to the City of Grand Prairie and are subject to regulation by the City.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">The only Texas case dealing with the effect of article 527\u2019s exclusion is Janus Films, Inc. v. City of Fort Worth, Tex.Civ.App.1962, 354 S.W.2d 597. Without explanation or discussion, it holds that the exclusion does not prevent home-rule cities from prohibiting the exhibition of obscene movies. The Texas Supreme Court in refusing writ of error, n. r. e., 163 Tex. 616, 358 S.W.2d 589, did the unusual thing of writing a brief opinion. The Court said that the trial court had not abused its discretion in denying a temporary injunction of the City ordinance, since the purpose of such injunction is to preserve the status quo and had the court granted it, the movie would have been shown and the status quo would not have been preserved. The Court further said: \u201cThis opinion is not to be construed as passing on the merits of the case in any respect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">In the light of the Texas Supreme Court\u2019s opinion, the Court of Civil Appeal\u2019s decision is not very convincing. We have considered the advisability of invoking the abstention doctrine, but we reject that idea in view of the decisions of the Texas courts in United Services Life Ins. Co. v. Delaney (Tex.Civ.App.1965), 386 S.W.2d 648, and (Tex.Sup.Ct.1965) 396 S.W.2d 855. The only evidence which we have under the Erie doctrine is the decision of the Texas Court of Civil Appeals in the <em>Janus Films </em>case, supra.

Insofar as the first phase of the paragraph is addressed to possible obscenity, this aspect is covered by Ordinance 1622, held constitutional on Chemline\u2019s appeal. Paragraph VIII does not attempt to equate the mere exhibition of bare breasts and buttocks with obscenity.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">As to the second phase, the testimony relating to the traffic hazard caused by exhibition of \u201cnudie\u201d movies provides an ample basis upon which to uphold the constitutionality of the paragraph. Not only were cars continually parked on the shoulder of the road; accidents in the vicinity of the Twin East on Highway 80 during the hours of theater operation jumped from a total of 15 in the four years before the theater started showing \u201cnudies\u201d to a total of 29 in the four years since that transformation. This seems danger enough to warrant regulation, particularly since the ordinance in question will not prevent the exhibition of such films, but only the exhibition of such films when they are visible from the road.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-16\">For this reason, I concur in the result reached in Judge Rives\u2019 opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
