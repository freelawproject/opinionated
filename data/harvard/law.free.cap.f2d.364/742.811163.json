In a careful opinion detailing all the pertinent facts, many of which had been stipulated, the Tax Court held that this payment was not deductible because the loan transaction had no substance apart from its anticipated tax consequences and was a \u201csham\u201d that created no real indebtedness. Barnett v. Commissioner, 44 T.C. 261 (1965) We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">In 1957 petitioner received $50,000 as a prize for winning a newspaper contest, and this case arises out of a plan for reducing petitioner\u2019s 1957 income taxes by taking a deduction for the alleged payment in December of that year of $30,850.49 as claimed prepaid interest on a loan to finance the purchase of $750,000 of U. S. Treasury obligations. This plan is similar to, but significantly more transparent than, the plan devised by the taxpayer and her advisors in Goldstein v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 364 F.2d 734 (2 Cir. 1966), also decided today. In this case, as in Goldstein, the Tax Court concluded on the basis of sufficient evidence that the petitioner could not have expected to realize a profit on the transaction and that the transac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>tion had no purpose, utility, or substance apart from the tax consequences petitioner anticipated it would have. It follows from what we said in <em>Goldstein </em>that the Tax Court\u2019s disallowance of the deduction must be affirmed. See 364 F.2d at 740.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">Moreover, in the present case, unlike the situation in <em>Goldstein, </em>the nature of the diaphanous arrangement between petitioner and Gibraltar (as differentiated from the arrangement between Gibraltar and the various financial institutions Gibraltar involved in its financial \u201cround robin\u201d), plus the extremely short duration of the loan transaction,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> lead us without peradventure of doubt to conclude that the Tax Court was correct in determining that the purported loan transaction here was indeed without substance and was a \u201csham\u201d of the discredited Goodstein variety. Goodstein v. Commissioner, 267 F.2d 127 (1 Cir. 1959), affirming 30 T.C. 1178 (1958). And see 4 Mertens, Law of Federal Income Taxation, \u00a7 26.04a (1960 Revision and Supplements).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">We affirm on this ground as well as on the other grounds the Tax Court so ably and exhaustively advanced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\">. We point out, as we did in <em>Goldstein, </em>that our discussion of a taxpayer\u2019s tax avoidance motives is only pertinent to Section 163(a). We do not hold that the existence of a tax avoidance motive, standing alone, is always, or even usually, sufficient to disallow a taxpayer the tax consequences he hopes for when he enters into a transaction. We here hold that Congress did not \u201cintend\u201d Section 163(a) to be utilized by taxpayers who are motivated to borrow funds for no other reason than to obtain a Section 163(a) deduction. Section 163(a) does not \u201cintend\u201d that a deduction be allowed in such a case. See Knetsch v. United States, 364 U.S. 361, 365, 81 S.Ct. 132, 5 L.Ed.2d 128 (1960) ; Goldstein v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 364 F.2d 734 (2 Cir. 1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b792-16\">. On December 26, 1957, petitioner paid Gibraltar $30,850.49 as \u201cprepaid interest\u201d for nine months at the rate of 5%% on the principal sum of $747,890.63 which, with other monies, was to be used to acquire $750,000 of <em>3%% </em>Treasury certificates at a very slight premium over face. Gibraltar made purchases and sales so that by January 20, 1958 taxpayer\u2019s \u201csham obligation\u201d to it was fully paid. Gibraltar paid petitioner $9,140.89 on January 3, 1958 and $18,282.17 on January 20, 1958, representing a refund of $27,423.06 in calendar 1958 of the \u201cprepaid interest\u201d of $30,850.49 paid in calendar 1957.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
