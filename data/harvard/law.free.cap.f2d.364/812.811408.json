The amended complaint bases jurisdiction on 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 410(a) and 101(14) (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-23\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 211(a) reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-24\">\u201cExcept as provided in sections 775, 784, 1661, 1761 * * * chapter 37 of this title, the decisions of the Administrator * * * shall be final and conclusive and no other official or any court of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"813\">*813</page-number><em>shall have power or jurisdiction </em>to review any such decision.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASe\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4005 relates to appeals before the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals; not to appeals from that Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 410(a) reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ANNK\">\u201c410. <em>Deaths entitling survivors to dependency and indemnity compensation</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-6\">(a) When any veteran dies after December 31, 1956, from a service-connected or compensable disability, the Administrator shall pay dependency and indemnity compensation to his widow, children, and parents. The standards and criteria for determining whether or not a disability is service-connected shall be those applicable under chapter 11 of this title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">38 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(14) (B) reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b861-8\">\u201c(14) The term \u2018dependency and indemnity compensation\u2019 means a monthly payment made by the Administrator to a widow, * * * (B) pursuant to the election of a widow * * *, in the case of such a death occurring before January 1, 1957.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-9\">Appellant\u2019s husband, a veteran, disappeared sometime in July 1953. From October 1, 1953 monthly payments were made to appellant as the wife of a veteran whose whereabouts were unknown. Payments were discontinued in October 1960. In 1961, the Superior Court of the State of California administered the veteran\u2019s estate (appellant was executrix) and in proceedings to establish the veteran\u2019s death, the State of California decreed it occurred on July 31, 1960. Appellant thus was enabled to, and did, collect on the veteran\u2019s National Life Insurance Policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">Appellant sought to have the Administrator continue gratuitous veteran\u2019s widow payments to her. The Administrator refused to eliminate the finding of presumed death, and refused to restore the claim to a live claim status. Appellant also sought a holding that her husband\u2019s death was caused by a totally disabling service-connected psychiatric condition. The Administrator held that the evidence did not establish that the veteran\u2019s death was due to a service-connected disease or injury, and that the cause of death was undetermined.-</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\">Appeal was had to the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, and denied. A review of this denial was allowed by the Board of Appeals without change in the principal result. A second reconsideration was had from the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals, with the same result.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\">Appellant then filed her complaint and amended complaint, as outlined above, asking for a review of the decision of the Administrator for the Veterans Administration. It was dismissed on the government\u2019s motion for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\">There is no jurisdiction in the court below, or here, to review a final action of the Administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\">The payments sought were gratuities, and Congress \u201cin its wisdom\u201d has defined where the right of appeal stops when such gratuities are denied to a citizen.
