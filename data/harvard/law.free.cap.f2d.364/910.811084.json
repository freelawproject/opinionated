Wiss and Sons Co., is an old established scissors, shears and garden tool manufacturer. Defendant-appellee, Gee Whiz Tool Corporation, is a newer entrant into at least some of the same lines of manufacture. Plaintiff-appellant holds trademark registrations for eleven different trademarks, including WISS and WIZZ, and it sells its products under these marks and with the use of its trade name, J. Wiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-21\">Appellant\u2019s complaint alleges that defendant\u2019s corporate name, Gee Whiz Tool Corporation, and its trade name GEE WHIZ \u201cnearly resembles and is a color-able imitation of plaintiff\u2019s name, J. Wiss,\u201d and that defendant has advertised a pruning shear under the name GEE WHIZ.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-22\">The first of these allegations is said to constitute unfair competition, and the second, an infringement of appellant\u2019s trademarks.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>To date appellant is able to point to only one tool, the Gee Whiz multi-pruner, which is competitive with appellant\u2019s products. The trial judge compared this tool and the words used to describe it by appellee with the J. Wiss long-handled pruner which employs the trademark WIZZ on one handle, and found no trademark infringement or unfair competition resulting from sale of the GEE WHIZ item. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">It is clear to us, as it was to the trial judge, that to this point the Gee Whiz Tool Corporation has not sought to imitate either the equipment produced by J. Wiss and Sons Co. or its trademarks. Cf. McCormick &amp; Co. v. B. Manischewitz Co., 206 F.2d 744 (C.A.6, 1953). Nor do we think that any use of the Gee Whiz name or the corporate name of defendant-appellee demonstrated in this record is such as to tend to confuse the buying public concerning the source of the tools.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">Much of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s argument is devoted to the fact that the Gee Whiz Corporation plans to produce other articles in the garden tool field which might prove to be directly competitive with those manufactured by the J. Wiss and Sons Co. and unfairly confusing to the buying public. We do not now seek to pass upon the justification or lack thereof for plaintiff-appellant\u2019s fears. We simply hold that the mere fact of the use by appellant of its corporate name Gee Whiz Tool Corporation, and the use of the term \u201cGee Whiz\u201d on defendantappellee\u2019s multi-pruner as it has been employed to date have not constituted either infringement of plaintiff-appellant\u2019s trademarks or unfair competition. The Seven Up Co. v. Get Up Corporation, 340 F.2d 954 (C.A.6, 1965), cert. denied, 382 U.S. 901, 86 S.Ct. 235, 15 L.Ed.2d 155 (1965); John P. Dant Distillery Co. v. Schenley Dist. Co., 297 F.2d 935 (C.A. 6, 1962), appeal dismissed, 371 U.S. 802, 83 S.Ct. 14, 9 L.Ed.2d 47 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-7\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
