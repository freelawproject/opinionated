The amended complaint is entitled \u201cCOMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND TO IMPRESS CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST ON REAL PROPERTY FOR DAMAGES AND FOR UNJUST ENRICHMENT.\u201d In the amended complaint plaintiff claims to be the owner of the property in question and alleges that appellee acquired title to said real property through alleged surreptitious and unlawful tax sales proceedings, and seeks to have it declared that title to said property is held in trust by appellee, and that title to said property be vested in appellant on payment of all de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>linquent taxes and penalties accruing prior to appellant\u2019s demand upon appellee for reconveyance of title to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">The District Court dismissed the action without leave to amend. On appeal to this court, by appellant, from such order of dismissal, we construed the order dismissing the action to be based upon lack of any jurisdiction in the District Court to entertain the action, and held that the allegations of the amended complaint were sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We further held that the allegations of the amended complaint were not sufficient to invoke the diversity jurisdiction of the District Court under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. In reversing and remanding the cause to the District Court we stated that we were not in any way passing upon the merits of appellant\u2019s claimed grievance. Miller v. County of Los Angeles, a Political Subdivision of the State of California, 9 Cir., 341 F.2d 964 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">On remand appellee moved for summary judgment on the grounds that appellant\u2019s cause of action is barred by the provisions of Sections 175, 3521, and 3809 of the Revenue and Taxation Code of the State of California. The motion was heard on affidavits, and thereafter the District Court made findings of fact, conclusions of law, and entered judgment in favor of appellee.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-8\">From our examination of the record, we are satisfied that there existed in the cause no genuine issue as to a material fact, and that the District Court, under applicable decisions of the reviewing courts of the State of California properly caused to be entered the summary judgment appealed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b549-10\">. \u201c\u00a7 1331.
