It is the contention of respondents that the record before the Board considered as a whole fails to support the Board\u2019s conclusion that respondent was guilty of violations of said Act. This court has jurisdiction of the proceeding, the alleged unfair labor practices having occurred in Seattle and Tacoma, Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\"> We have examined the record of the testimony produced before the trial examiner upon which the Board based its order. It would serve no useful purpose to set this testimony out in detail. The matter of the credibility of the witnesses is not for this court to pass upon. This is a function of the trial examiner and of the Board. We are satisfied that upon the record considered as a whole there is substantial evidence to support the findings of the Board as to the unfair labor practices in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The order of the Board will be enforced.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-24\">. 153 N.L.R.B. 34.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
