The suit was removed to the District Court for the Southern District of New York, on the basis of diversity, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441 (1964 ed.). The District Court rendered judgment for National and USF&amp;G appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-27\">The facts are these: National, the appellee, is engaged in the business of producing and distributing motion picture \u201ctrailers,\u201d more commonly known as coming attractions and other motion picture display material. None of the material was ever sold to exhibitors, but rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>was licensed for theatre use. When the trailers were no longer of any use they were returned to National, which in accordance with a continuing agreement with the Eastman Kodak Company, sent all worn out film which it could no longer use to that company at Rochester, New York. The film was shipped, by transportation selected and paid for by National, to Kodak\u2019s Rochester facility where the film was examined to determine whether there was sufficient silver compound remaining on the face of the film to make salvage feasible. In practice Kodak accepted and paid for all scrap film which was tendered to it, though the amount of payment varied according to suitability of the film for salvage. Kodak had the right, however, to reject any shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">The present suit involves an incident which occurred on June 24, 1954. National had in force on that date a \u201cComprehensive General Liability Policy\u201d issued to it by the appellant, USF&amp;G, on December 31, 1953 for a one year period. The policy protected National against all potential liability for negligence in connection with the conduct of its business, which was declared on the face of the policy to be \u201cmotion picture previ\u00e9wsdisplays,\u201d except to the extent that the policy explicitly excluded coverage for certain risks. The policy obligated USF&amp;G to defend National in any suits brought against it \u201calleging such injury, sickness, disease or destruction and seeking damages on account thereof * * *\u201d; it also contained a number of exclusion clauses, two of which are particularly relevant to this case. First, the so-called \u201cproducts hazard exclusion\u201d provided that the policy did not cover \u201cproducts hazard as defined in the policy.\u201d The definition was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">\u201cThe term \u2018products hazard\u2019 means (1) the handling or use of, the existence of any condition in or a warranty of goods or products manufactured, sold, handled or distributed by the Named Insured, other than equipment rented to or located for use of others but not sold, if the accident occurs after the Insured has relinquished possession thereof to others and away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the Insured or on premises for which the classification stated in Division (a) of the declarations or in the Company\u2019s manual excludes any part of the foregoing;\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">It was apparently the purpose of that exclusion to place a certain limit on the coverage for products liability of the kind imposed by MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co., 217 N.Y. 382, 111 N.E. 1050 (1916) (Cardozo, J.). See also La Rocca v. Farrington, 301 N.Y. 247, 250, 93 N.E.2d 829, 830 (1950). Second, there was a clause which excluded liability for \u201cinjury to or destruction of property arising out of * * * blasting or explosion * * * while such operations are being performed by the Named Insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">A few days before June 24th, National had filled with scrap film and sealed several steel drums, and readied them for shipment to Kodak. On June 24th the Wayland Transfer Co. called for the drums at National\u2019s Charlotte, N. C. premises and furnished National with a non-negotiable uniform straight bill of lading. Wayland had been retained by the Southern Railway Co. to make the pick up and to transport the drums to the railroad\u2019s local freight depot, whence they were to be shipped to Kodak by rail. After the drums arrived at the depot they remained on the outdoor platform for several hours until they were moved inside. Later in the day a fire, allegedly caused in part by the combustion or explosion of National\u2019s film, occurred at the depot, causing damage to the property of a number of innocent third parties, who in due course asserted claims against National for negligence and sought to recover for their losses. National, in turn, gave timely and sufficient notice of the claims against it to USF&amp;G and requested that the insurance company undertake to defend the claims. After an investigation, however, USF&amp;G disclaimed any liability, for two reasons: first, on the ground that liability was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>excluded under the \u201cproducts hazard exclusion,\u201d and second, that the damage was caused by explosion, a risk which was explicitly excluded from coverage. As a result of the insurance company\u2019s refusal, National had to retain its own local counsel in North Carolina. Ultimately the claims were settled for a total of $25,-201.50 and legal fees, conceded by USF &amp;G to have been reasonable, were incurred in the amount of $7,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">In the district court, the trial centered around the issues of whether or not either of the two exclusion .clauses precluded coverage for the losses sustained by National. The court submitted for determination by jury the questions of \u201cwhether the exclusion clause in the insurance contract covering explosions was applicable to the events in question,\u201d and whether or not the loss was occasioned by explosion. A general verdict for the plaintiff was returned. The district judge reserved for his own determination \u201cthe question of the applicability of the products liability exclusion clause * * *, the issue of damages and the defendant\u2019s post-trial motion to set aside the verdict * * * or in the alternative for a new trial.\u201d In a careful opinion the district judge held that the insurer was liable to National. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">Products Hazard Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">USF&amp;G urges that it was absolved from liability for the loss incurred by National by the terms of the products hazard exclusion, because the loss occurred, in the words of the policy, \u201cafter the Insured has <em>relinquished, possession </em>thereof to others and away from premises owned, rented or controlled by the Insured * * (Emphasis added.) The central issue thus is whether National had possession of the film at the time of the loss, and that question in turn depends upon whether the word \u201cpossession\u201d as used in the policy clause should be read to include the concept of \u201cconstructive possession\u201d as well as actual possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">The trial judge held that (1) National\u2019s business, was such that it was \u201cnot in a position to require it to purchase products liability coverage and that as such the products hazard exclusion would have no application to the facts present * * He also found that, in any case, the word \u201cpossession,\u201d as used in the exclusion clause, included constructive as well as actual possession, and that therefore, since National still retained constructive possession of the drums at the time of the loss, USF&amp;G remained liable on the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">We think that it is not necessary to reach the question of whether National\u2019s business was such that it should have carried products liability insurance, as it is our opinion that the products hazard exclusion did not affect the coverage in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-13\">Since the policy in question was issued by USF&amp;G from its principal office in New York, the law of that state governs this ease, as the parties concede. Fleet Messenger Service v. Life Insurance Company of North America, 315 F.2d 593 (2d Cir. 1963). We are of the opinion that on the facts here presented the New York courts would construe the word possession broadly to include constructive as well as actual possession. The relevant case law in New York evinces a very strong tendency to favor the insured when construing words of ambiguous meaning in insurance contracts. There is a general tendency in a majority of jurisdictions to apply the principle of <em>contra proferentem </em>and thus to choose the construction most favorable to the insured (see 1 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 15:73 (2d ed., Anderson ed. 1959); 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 559 (I960)). New York clearly and unequivocally adheres to this rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-14\">The appellant argues that \u201cpossession\u201d must be defined to include only actual possession, because \u201ca contract of insurance, drawn by the insurer, must be read through the eyes of the average man in the street or the average housewife who purchases it.\u201d That particular formulation of the plain meaning rule is taken from Lachs v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of New York, 306 N.Y. 357, 364, 118 N.E.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>555 (1954). Somewhat different statements can be found in other New York cases. E. g., Abrams v. Great American Ins. Co., 269 N.Y. 90, 92, 199 N.E. 15, 16 (1935); Hartol Products Corp. v. Prudential Ins. Co., 290 N.Y. 44, 49, 47 N.E.2d 687, 690 (1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">The appellant relies strongly upon the <em>Abrams </em>case which concerned a policy issued to cover a jeweler\u2019s loss \u201carising from any cause whatsoever except * * * (a) Loss or damage or expenses by or resulting from theft, conversion or other act or omission of a dishonest character * * * on the part of * * * any person to whom the property hereby insured may be entrusted by whomsoever for any purpose whatsoever * * * \u201d The decision turned upon whether the word \u201ctheft\u201d in its ordinary sense included larceny by trick, and whether the word \u201centrusted\u201d in its ordinary sense included delivery of the jewels into the hands of a thief where the owner made the delivery, confident that the jewels would be used for the purpose which the owner intended and without any knowledge on his part that the recipient was a thief. The court gave affirmative answers to both questions. There was no issue and no discussion in the case of constructive possession. The general rule of interpretation laid down was \u201c[t]he language employed in the contract of insurance must be given its ordinary meaning, such as the average policyholder of ordinary intelligence, as well as the insurer, would attach to it.\u201d 269 N.Y. 92, at 93, 199 N.E. 15, at 16. The word \u201ctheft\u201d is frequently interpreted not only in ordinary speech but in legal contexts as including larceny by trick, embezzlement and kindred offenses. It is by no means limited to the technical common law definition of larceny. American Insurance Co. of Newark v. Burson, 213 F.2d 487, 490, 43 A.L.R.2d 1 (5th Cir. 1954); Pennsylvania Indemnity Fire Corp. v. Aldridge, 73 App.D.C. 161, 117 F.2d 774, 778, 133 A.L.R. 914 (1941); N.Y. Penal Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 40, \u00a7 1290. The word \u201centrusted\u201d in the general context in which it was used in the <em>Abrams </em>case has no technical legal meaning apart from its use in ordinary speech, as the opinion appears to have recognized.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-11\"><em>Abrams, </em>decided in 1935, in applying the general rule of construction, said nothing of an authoritative nature with regard to the meaning which the average policyholder of a general business liability policy would give to the word \u201cpossession\u201d in the circumstances of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-12\">The criterion for the application of the plain meaning rule contained in Lachs v. Fidelity and Casualty Co. of New York, supra, that the terms of an insurance contract must be read \u201cthrough the eyes of the average man on the street or the average housewife who purchases it\u201d, is particularly suited to, an airplane flight insurance policy purchased by a passenger at an airport through a coin machine and should be confined to that kind of policy. It is not, however, particularly useful in construing the policy at issue in the present case, because few men on the street and few housewives would be purchasers of the specialized business policy with which we are concerned. A better measure is that enunciated in Tonkin v. California Insurance Company of San Francisco Inc., 294 N.Y. 326, 329, 62 N.E.2d 215, 216, 160 A.L.R. 944 (1945) in which the Court of Appeals said, \u201cWe know of no better guide in a situation of this sort than \u2018the reasonable expectation and purpose of the ordinary businessman when making an ordinary business contract.\u2019 \u201d See Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co. v. Town of Pound Ridge, 362 F.2d 430 (2d Cir. June 14, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-13\">For the purpose of this kind of policy the average person is not the housewife purchasing flight insurance but the average purchaser of broad business liability insurance such as the appellee here. It is more than likely that such an insured would be aware that it would still have constructive possession of goods which it has turned over to a delivery man and a common carrier for transportation on the insured\u2019s behalf to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>another. Particularly where, as here, it still held title to the products and was exposed to liability. National knew that it was the owner of the drums of used films and remained so until title passed on delivery of the goods into the hands of Kodak. It must have been clear both to the insurer and the insured that National, the insured, remained liable under the MacPherson v. Buick Motor Co. rule to third persons who suffered injury or damage even after title passed to Kodak. In view of this the insurer sought to limit the coverage of its policy at the point where the insured lost its power to control the product, as an incident of its ownership, and that power to control passed to Kodak when it became owner of the product. It is hardly likely that it was the reasonable expectation of the insured, or its purpose, to purchase liability insurance to cover its product only while it was inside the gates of its own plant and that it would become its own insurer while the product was in the hands of a delivery man and a common carrier transporting it on National\u2019s behalf, and when the chance of injury to third persons was even greater. Nor is it logical to suppose that the insurer thought or understood that its policy was so limited. Therefore, it is apparent that the general rules of interpretation of insurance policies adopted by the New York courts lead to the conclusion that the word \u201cpossession\u201d as used in the exclusion clause of the policy in question should be construed to include \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">Even putting this determination aside, however, there was certainly a question whether or not under the circumstances of this case, the word \u201cpossession\u201d meant not only actual but also \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d This in itself created an ambiguity in the \u201cproducts hazard\u201d exclusion clause. The appellant insurance company does not dispute that the appellee had constructive possession, as the trial court found, but asserts that the word \u201cpossession\u201d in the exclusion clause does not include \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d New York law, however, calls for a liberal interpretation of the terms of insurance policies in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">In Sincoff v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., 11 N.Y.2d 386, 230 N.Y.S.2d 13, 183 N.E. 2d 899 (1962) the New York Court of Appeals held that where there is an ambiguous word in an insurance policy the burden which the defendant insurer must carry is to show that the construction it urges is such \u201cthat it would be unreasonable for the average man reading the policy to conclude\u201d that a meaning other than that urged by the insurance company was possible and \u201cthat its own construction was the only one that fairly could be placed on the policy.\u201d 230 N.Y.S.2d at 16. Thus, it would seem that in New York the insurance company can avail itself of the plain meaning rule only in those cases where \u201csuch a definition was the <em>only </em>one that could \u2018fairly be placed thereon.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) 230 N.Y.S.2d at 15. See also Hartol Products Corp. v. Prudential Ins. Co., supra, 290 N.Y. at 49-50, 47 N.E.2d 687. The appellant has not met that test in this case. When that condition is not satisfied the rule is, that where an ambiguous word is used, \u201csuch ambiguity should ' * * * [be] resolved in favor of the insured.\u201d Sincoff v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co., supra, 230 N.Y. S.2d at 16; Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co. of N. Y. v. Groth, 296 N.Y. 788, 71 N.E.2d 470 (1947); Janneck v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 162 N.Y. 574, 57 N.E. 182 (1900). And as the New York Court noted in <em>Sincoff, </em>supra, \u201cthis rule [of favoring the insured] has particular application where exclusions are involved.\u201d 230 N.Y.S.2d at 16. See also Schneiderman v. Metropolitan Casualty Company of N. Y.,,14 A.D.2d 284, 289, 220 N.Y.S.2d 947, 951 (1961); Sperling v. Great American Ins. Co., 7 N.Y.2d 442, 447, 199 N.Y.S.2d 465, 469, 166 N.E.2d 482 (1961); Birnbaum v. Jamestown Mut. Ins. Co., 298 N.Y. 305, 313, 83 N.E.2d 128 (1948). The rule would seem to have special vigor when applied to a policy such as the one involved here which is by its own terms denominated a \u201ccomprehensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>general liability policy.\u201d Cf. <em>Sincoff, </em>supra, 230 N.Y.S.2d at 16, where it was said that \u201ca vague exclusion * * * should not be permitted to prevent indemnity\u201d where the policy was of the kind denominated \u201call risks\u201d by the insurance company.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Appellant relies heavily upon the decision of the Ninth Circuit in General Casualty Co. of America v. Azteca Films, Inc., 278 F.2d 161 (1960), a case which presents a set of facts virtually identical to those in the present ease, and in which a contrary result was reached under California law. We feel, however, that the governing law of New York is so strong that we are constrained to reach a different result from <em>Azteca.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">Furthermore, we find no reason to question the factual determination made by the district court that National did in fact have constructive possession of the drums while they were <em>in transitu. </em>And therefore we agree with the result reached by the trial court, that the products hazard exclusion did not relieve USF&amp;G from liability under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">Explosion Exclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">The trial judge charged the jury in substance that they must first \u201cdetermine whether or not it was the understanding and agreement of these parties that this rider [i. e., the explosion exclusion] applied to them.\u201d The jury was further instructed that it was next to decide \u201cwhether or not the damage was caused by an explosion.\u201d The jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff. On this appeal the insurance company urges as error the part of the charge in which the jury was asked to determine whether the parties had intended to include the explosion exclusion in the policy. While we agree with the appellant that that issue was not properly in the case, and the jury should not have been charged as it was, we nevertheless affirm because of the failure of the defense counsel to make any objection to the charge at the trial. F.R.Civ.P. 51. See United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887,15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966). The trial judge specifically admonished counsel \u201cto keep their eye open for any objections they care to make.\u201d Furthermore, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have concluded that there had been no explosion.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-12\">We have considered the other points raised by the appellant, and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-13\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b328-14\">HAYS, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"Apq\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-15\">I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-16\">The issue is whether the plaintiff \u201crelinquished possession\u201d within the meaning of the products hazard exclusion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If so, the insurance company is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-17\">The fact that under New York law any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the insured does not warrant the creation of doubt through a strained or hypertechnical construction of an otherwise plain and unambiguous contract provision. See Doyle v. Allstate Ins. Co., 1 N.Y.2d 439, 443, 136 N.E.2d 484, 487, 154 N.Y.S.2d 10, 13 (1956) ; Abrams v. Great American Ins. Co., 269 N.Y. 90, 92, 199 N.E. 15, 16 (1935); 1 Couch, Insurance \u00a7 15:85 (2d ed. Anderson 1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-18\">In General Casualty Co. of America v. Azteca Films, Inc., 278 F.2d 161, 165 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 863, 81 S.Ct. 103, 5 L.Ed.2d 85 (1960), a case that my brethren concede is \u201cvirtually identical\u201d with the case before us, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals framed the issue as we must: \u201cwhether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>clause under examination- \u2014 because of the word \u2018possession\u2019 \u2014 is ambiguous.\u201d The court properly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-4\">\u201cit would seem that the word \u2018possession\u2019 as here used would convey to the ordinary mind, the layman, the idea of actual possession. The concept of constructive possession is the sort of concept that would more likely occur- to a lawyer. * * * If this [i. e., what the insured did] does not amount to relinquishment of possession, as the term would be understood by a layman, it is difficult to conceive what additional facts and circumstances would be required.\u201d Id. at 168.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">In the present case the majority seeks to distinguish the <em>Azteca Films </em>case on the ground that the \u201cresult was reached under California law.\u201d But the crucial question is whether there is ambiguity, and California and New York law do not differ in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">The rule in New York is that language in a contract of insurance must be given its \u201cordinary meaning, such as the average policy holder of ordinary intelligence\u201d would attach to it. Abrams v. Great American, supra at 92, 199 N.E. at 16; see Lachs v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co., 306 N.Y. 357, 364, 118 N.E.2d 555, 558 (1954). Compare, e. g., Trousdell v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc., 55 Cal.App.2d 74, 130 P.2d 173, 990 (1942). A court must determine whether there is \u201cambiguity from the standpoint of a layman, not from that of a lawyer.\u201d 1 Couch op. cit. supra \u00a7 15:83 at 824. In Abrams v. Great American, supra, the claim of a policyholder, a commercial jeweler, that common words in an exclusion clause should be given a technical legal definition, was rejected because \u201ccommon words in the policy as \u2018theft,\u2019 \u2018dishonest,\u2019 and \u2018entrusted\u2019 cannot be deemed to have been used as words of art with legalistic implications.\u201d Id. at 92, 199 N.E. at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">Although Abrams was a commercial jeweler who had purchased a comprehensive policy insuring his business, the majority, still purporting to interpret New York law, limits the rule of <em>Abrams </em>and similar cases to \u201can airplane flight-insurance policy purchased by a passenger at an airport through a coin machine.\u201d Then, relying on Tonkin v. California Ins. Co., 294 N.Y. 326, 329, 62 N.E.2d 215, 216, 160 A.L.R. 944 (1945), where the court looked at a policy through the eyes of an \u201cordinary businessman,\u201d my brothers argue that such a businessman would be aware of the technical legal concept of \u201cconstructive possession.\u201d But the New York Court of Appeals in <em>Tonkin </em>did not endow their \u201cordinary businessman\u201d with the powers of a skilled attorney. In \u201capplying this general principle\u201d the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-10\">\u201cit is reasonable to suppose * * * that the fair meaning and use of the word \u2018comprehensive\u2019 included those damages which an <em>ordinary individual </em>would reasonably and naturally regard as incidental to or flowing from the hazard insured against.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Id. at 329, 62 N.E.2d at 217.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-11\">In a later case, the Appellate Division made clear that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b329-12\">\u201cThe courts have repeatedly held that the interpretation of a clause in a policy of insurance is to be determined by what it means to the ordinary businessman, not what it might convey on careful analysis to a trained lawyer.\u201d Whiteside v. Ins. Co. of Pennsylvania, 274 App.Div. 36, 79 N.Y.S.2d 715, 717 (1st Dep\u2019t 1948).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b329-13\">To a layman, whether businessman or housewife, possession means actual or physical control.
