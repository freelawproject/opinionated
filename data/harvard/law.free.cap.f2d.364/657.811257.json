On September 29, 1962, when she was sixty years old, a policeman found her wandering about and took her to the D.C. General Hospital.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 11, 1962, she filed in the District Court a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. The court transferred her to St. Elizabeths Hospital for observation in connection with pending commitment proceedings, allowed her to amend her petition by naming the Superintendent of Saint Elizabeths as defendant, and on November 2, 1962, dismissed her petition without holding a hearing or requiring a return.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">After she filed her appeal from denial of habeas corpus, she was adjudged \u201cof unsound mind\u201d and committed to Saint Elizabeths. At the commitment hearing two psychiatrists testified that she was mentally ill and one of them that she was suffering from a \u201cchronic brain syndrome\u201d associated with aging and \u201cdemonstrated very frequently difficulty with her memory * * *. Occasionally, she was unable to tell me where she was or what the date was.\u201d Both psychiatrists testified to the effect that she could not care for herself adequately. She did not take a timely appeal from the commitment order. We heard her appeal from the summary dismissal of her petition for habeas corpus and remanded the case to the District Court with directions to require a return and hold a hearing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-20\">At the hearing on remand, the sole psychiatric witness testified that appellant was suffering from a senile brain disease, \u201cchronic brain syndrome, with arteriosclerosis with reaction.\u201d The psychiatrist said she was not dangerous to others and would not intentionally harm herself, but was prone to \u201cwandering away and being out exposed at night or any time that she is out.\u201d This witness also related that on one occasion she wandered away from the Hospital, was missing for about thirty-two hours, and was brought back after midnight by a police officer who found her wandering in the streets. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>She had suffered a minor injury which she attributed to being chased by boys. She thought she had been away only a few hours and could not tell where she had been. The psychiatrist also testified that she was \u201cconfused and agitated\u201d when first admitted to the Hospital but became \u201ccomfortable\u201d after \u201ctreatment and medication.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">At both the commitment hearing and the habeas corpus hearing on remand, appellant testified that she felt able to be at liberty. At the habeas corpus hearing her husband, who had recently reappeared after a long absence, and her sister said they were eager for her release and would try to provide a home for her. The District Court found that she \u201cis suffering from a mental illness with the diagnosis of chronic brain syndrome associated with cerebral arteriosclerosis\u201d; that she \u201cis in need of care and supervision, and that there is no member of the family able to give the petitioner the necessary care and supervision; and that the family is without sufficient funds to employ a competent person to do so\u201d; that she \u201cis a danger to herself in that she has a tendency to wander about the streets, and is not competent to care for herself.\u201d The District Court again denied relief in habeas corpus, but noted appellant\u2019s right \u201cto make further application in the event that the patient is in a position to show that there would be some facilities available for her provision.\u201d The court thus recognized that she might be entitled to release from Saint Elizabeths if other facilities were available, but required her to carry the burden of showing their availability.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">Appellant contends in written and oral argument that remand to the District Court is required for a consideration of suitable alternatives to confinement in Saint Elizabeths Hospital in light of the new District of Columbia Hospitalization of the Mentally 111 Act,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which came into effect after the hearing in the District Court. Indeed, her counsel appointed by this court, who had interviewed appellant, made clear in answer to a question from the bench on oral argument that although appellant\u2019s formal pro se pleading requests outright release, her real complaint is total confinement in a mental institution; that she would rather be in another institution or hospital, if available, or at home, even though under some form of restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\"> Habeas corpus challenges not only the fact of confinement but also the place of confinement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> And the court is required to \u201cdispose of the matter as law and justice require.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2243. The court is not restricted to the alternative of returning appellant to Saint Elizabeths or unconditionally releasing her.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-9\"> We are not called upon to consider what action we would have taken in the absence of the new Act, because we think the interest of justice and furtherance of the congressional objective require the application to the pending proceeding of the principles adopted in that Act. It provides that if the court or jury finds that a \u201cperson is mentally ill and, because of that illness, is likely to injure himself or other persons if allowed to remain at liberty, the court may order his hospitalization for an indeterminate period, or order any other alternative course of treatment which the court believes will be in the best interests of the person or of the public.\u201d D.C.Code \u00a7 21-545 (b) (Supp. V, 1966). This confirms the view of the Department of Health, Education and Welfare that \u201cthe entire spectrum of services should be made available, including outpatient treatment, foster care, halfway houses, day hospitals, nursing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>homes, etc.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The alternative course of treatment or care should be fashioned as the interests of the person and of the public require in the particular case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Deprivations of liberty solely because of dangers to the ill persons themselves should not go beyond what is necessary for their protection.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The court\u2019s duty to explore alternatives in such a case as this is related also to the obligation of the state to bear the burden of exploration of possible alternatives an indigent cannot bear. This appellant, as appears from the record, would not be confined in Saint Elizabeths if her family were able to care for her or pay for the care she needs. Though she cannot be given such care as only the wealthy can afford, an earnest effort should be made to review and exhaust available resources of the community in order to provide care reasonably suited to her <em>needs.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">At the habeas corpus hearing, the psychiatrist testified that appellant did not need \u201cconstant medical supervision,\u201d but only \u201cattention\u201d; that the psychiatrist would have no objection if appellant \u201cwere in a nursing home, or a place where there would be supervision.\u201d At the commitment hearing one psychiatrist testified that \u201cMrs. Lake needs care, whether it be in the hospital or out of the hospital,\u201d and did not specify what, if any, <em>psychiatric </em>care she needs. The second psychiatrist testified that she \u201cneeds close watching. She could wander off. She could get hurt and she certainly needs someone to see that her body is adequately cared for * * *. [She] needs care and kindness * * <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>appear from this testimony that appellant\u2019s illness required the complete deprivation of liberty that results from commitment to Saint Elizabeths as a person of \u201cunsound mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\"> Appellant may not be required to carry the burden of showing the availability of alternatives. Proceedings involving the care and treatment of the mentally ill are not strictly adversary proceedings.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, appellant plainly does not know and lacks the means to ascertain what alternatives, if any, are available, but the government knows or has the means of knowing and should therefore assist the court in acquiring such information.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\"> We remand the case to the District Court for an inquiry into \u201cother alternative courses of treatment.\u201d The court may consider, <em>e. g., </em>whether the appellant and the public would be sufficiently protected if she were required to carry an identification card on her person so that the police or others could take her home if she should wander,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>, or whether she should be required to accept public health nursing care, community mental health and day care services, foster care,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> home health aide services, or whether available welfare payments might finance adequate private care.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Every effort should be made to find a course of treatment which appellant might be willing to accept.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-18\">In making this inquiry, the District Court may seek aid from various sources, for example the D.C. Department of Public Health, the D.C. Department of Public Welfare, the Metropolitan Police Department, the D.C. Department of Vocational Rehabilitation, the D.C. Association for Mental Health, the various family service agencies, social workers from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>the patient\u2019s neighborhood, and neighbors who might be able to provide supervision.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The court can also require the aid of the Commission on Mental Health, which was established \u201cin recognition of the fact that the assistance of unbiased experts was essential to assist courts in dealing with insanity cases.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s aid is available in habeas corpus proceedings as well as commitment proceedings.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission, like the court, may obtain the aid of appropriate groups and individuals.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">We express no opinion on questions that would arise if on remand the court should find no available alternative to confinement in Saint Elizabeths.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">We respectfully reject the suggestion that our opinion may be read as amounting to a revival of all commitments that had already become final. This case has its special features within which the opinion is confined. This appears from the factual setting of the opinion. The District Court recognized the problem in suggesting that if this patient could show that there were other facilities available for her provision she could apply again to the court. Our decision does no more than require the exploration respecting other facilities to be made by the government for the indigent appellant in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">Habeas corpus .proceedings always have been available to test the validity of a deprivation of liberty \u2014 see, <em>e. g., </em>Stewart v. Overholser, 87 U.S.App.D.C. 402, 186 F.2d 339 (1950); and where there has occurred, as here, a change in the applicable statutory law pending the appeal, remand for consideration by the trial court under the intervening statute is appropriate if not required. To require in a habeas corpus proceeding that the court consider an intervening statute applicable to the situation is not to require a new commitment proceeding, nor does it open one already concluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">Remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-16\">.

The record shows only that Mrs. Lake is somewhat senile; that she ' has a poor <em>memory, </em>has wandered on a few occasions, and is unable to care for herself at all times. This evidence makes out a need for custodial care of some sort, but I can<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>not accept the proposition that this showing automatically entitles the Government to compel Mrs. Lake to accept its help at the price of her freedom.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b711-5\">BURGER, Circuit Judge, with whom DANAHER and TAMM, Circuit Judges, join</author>\n<p id=\"A7h\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">We disagree with remanding the case to require the District Court to carry out an investigation of alternatives for which Appellant has never indicated any desire. The only issue before us is the legality of Mrs. Lake\u2019s confinement in Saint Elizabeths Hospital and the only relief she herself has requested is immediate unconditional release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority does not intimate that Appellant\u2019s present confinement as a patient at Saint Elizabeths Hospital is illegal,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or that there is anything wrong with it except that she does not like it and wishes to get out of any confinement. Nevertheless, this Court now orders the District Court to perform functions normally reserved to social agencies by commanding search for a judicially approved course of treatment or custodial care for this mentally ill person who is plainly unable to care for herself. Neither this Court nor the District Court is equipped to carry out the broad geriatric inquiry proposed or to resolve the social and economic issues involved. This \u2022 is particularly illustrated in the first alternative the majority commands the District Court to explore:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">whether the appellant and the public would be sufficiently protected if she were required to carry an identification card on her person so that the police or others could take her home if she should wander * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The list of subjects to explore concludes with an admonition that \u201cevery effort should be made to find a course of treatment which appellant might be willing to accept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">Although proceedings for commitment of mentally ill persons are not strictly adversary, a United States court in our legal system is not set up to initiate inquiries and direct studies of social welfare facilities or other social problems. This Court exists to decide questions put before it by parties to litigation on the basis of issues raised by them in pleadings and facts adduced by those parties. D.C.Code \u00a7 21-545 (Supp.1966) does not transmute the United States District Court for the District of Columbia into an administrative agency for proceedings involving the mentally ill. This statute provides only that \u201cthe court may order [a mentally ill person\u2019s] * * * hospitalization for an indeterminate period, or order any other alternative course of treatment which <em>the court believes </em>will be in the best interests of the person or of the public.\u201d (Emphasis added.) All this section does, or was intended to do, is authorize the court to order alternative courses of treatment, provided the evidence presented to it leads it to believe that some alternative is preferable to confinement in Saint Elizabeths Hospital. This appellant seeks only her release, not a transfer. We cannot find anything in this statute which even vaguely hints at a requirement that the court conduct broad inquiries into possible treatment facilities. In the absence of such language, we must interpret the statute as not enlarging the role of the court beyond its normal judicial function of deciding issues presented by the parties on the basis of such facts as the parties present.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-13\">Even if the statute were read to require the District Court or the Mental Health Commission to investigate alternatives during the commitment proceedings, clearly a petitioner in a- habeas corpus proceeding bears the initial burden of establishing the illegality of the present confinement. If, in order to accomplish this end, it is relevant to show that there are preferable alternatives to confinement in Saint Elizabeths, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>burden is on the petitioner to show the existence of these alternatives. Yet, from the filing of Mrs. Lake\u2019s petition to the present moment, no one including the majority of this Court has demonstrated any alternative \u201ccourse of treatment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">What the majority has done here is first rewrite Mrs. Lake\u2019s petition for her, to demand something which she has never requested, then it has proceeded to remand, ordering the District Court to consider this new \u201cpetition\u201d written by this court. Mrs. Lake and her successive lawyers have never asked for exploration of alternatives; she requested total release. The majority orders the District Court to make \u201cevery effort * * * to find a course of treatment which appellant might be willing to accept\u201d yet at the same time the majority flouts the petitioner\u2019s wishes. What she wants this Court to do is to decide the legality of her commitment; however, the majority explicitly reserves that question pending the results of the study of District of Columbia social welfare facilities which it has ordered the Trial Court to undertake. We believe that this court should decide the issues raised by Appellant, not the issues it feels the Appellant should have raised. The Court\u2019s failure to decide the issues raised leaves her confined in St. Elizabeths Hospital while the District Court conducts a study largely unrelated to the question of the legality of that confinement, and for which a court is not equipped.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-5\">To show that Appellant really does object to the <em>place </em>of her confinement, the majority is forced to rely on the response of her appointed counsel to a question from the bench at oral argument. Counsel said that Appellant\u2019s major objection was that she was confined in a mental institution, and he intimated that possibly she might not be so unhappy with confinement in some other institution. This indicates that a large part of what troubles both Appellant and the majority is the fact that she is being confined in a <em>mental </em>institution and not some type of home for the aged which would provide essentially the same care but would not have attached to it the \u201conus\u201d of being associated with a mental institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-7\">If Appellant were to receive precisely the same care she is presently receiving in the geriatrics ward of St. Elizabeths at an institution elsewhere with a name like Columbia Rest Haven, it does not appear that there would be much disagreement over the propriety of her confinement. However, a person\u2019s freedom is no less arrested, nor is the effect on him significantly different, if he is confined in a rest home with a euphemistic name rather than at St. Elizabeths Hospital. The cases the majority cites to support the proposition that habeas corpus is available to challenge the place of custody all involved the quite different situation of challenges based on the nature rather than simply the name of the place of custody. Any conceivable relevance of those cases to the contentions made in the present case is eliminated by the fact that no one denies that Appellant is mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-8\">We can all agree in principle that a series of graded institutions with various kinds of homes for the aged and infirm would be a happier solution to the problem than confining harmless senile ladies in St. Elizabeths Hospital with approximately 8000 patients, maintained at a great public expense. But it would be a piece of unmitigated folly to turn this appellant loose on the streets with or without an identity tag; and I am sure for my part that no District Judge will order such a solution. This city is hardly a safe place for able-bodied men, to say nothing of an infirm, senile, and disoriented woman to wander about with no protection except an identity tag advising police where to take her. The record shows that in her past wanderings she has been molested, and should she be allowed to wander again all of her problems might well be rendered moot either by natural causes or violence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b711-9\">. The question of alternative treatment was never raised until this court requested counsel to discuss it in their briefs and arguments on rehearing <em>en banc.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b711-14\">. Undisputed medical testimony was that Appellant \u201csurely could not take care of herself in the community; * * * she needs supervision.\u2019\u2019</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b712-9\">McGOWAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"ARB\">(dissenting) :</p>\n<p id=\"b712-10\">I dissent for the reason that, with all respect, I am unable to understand just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>what the majority\u2019s concept of finality is in civil commitment proceedings for the mentally ill.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">As for the instant case, appellant sought only her outright release on habeas corpus. Represented by counsel, she endeavored to show by evidence that her condition did not require further custody of any kind, and that, in any event, her husband and other relatives could furnish such care and supervision as might be required. The District Court found the facts to be otherwise on both of these approaches, and no one suggests that those findings are erroneous. That ordinarily would end the matter, subject always to the right of appellant to seek hereafter a different disposition of her person, either on habeas corpus or under the specific provisions of the new law referred to hereinafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Appellant\u2019s original commitment in mental health proceedings was under a statute which, effective September 15, 1964, was replaced by a new one, which is now codified as 21 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 501-591 (Supp. V, 1966). The majority opinion may perhaps mean that all those originally committed under the old law may, by means of habeas corpus, have a new original commitment hearing under the terms of the new statute. This would presumably be for the purpose of giving everyone a chance to have the committing tribunal consider \u201cany other alternative course of treatment which the court believes will be in the best interests of the person or of the public.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 21 D.C.Code \u00a7 545. Under this approach, all commitment proceedings which became final before the new statute are now open for a <em>de now </em>inquiry, with the party seeking the commitment cast in the usual role of moving party. But, if the majority opinion be regarded as accomplishing this much, it is by no means clear that the replay on habeas corpus is limited only to those finally committed before the new law became effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-12\">I am by no means persuaded that Congress, by the enactment of the new statute, intended either of these consequences. The new law, indeed, contains its own provisions for periodic review of commitments made either under it or the old law, 21 D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 546, 589; and those provisions are hardly to be identified with what is prescribed on the remand which the court orders. And it may well come as a surprise to Congress to know that the new mental hospitalization act is fully retrospective in operation to the point of reopening all commitments which had become final earlier. It may have thought, contrarily, that such complete retroactivity was not necessary in view of the traditional availability of habeas corpus under which any person under commitment, aided by counsel either retained or provided, may come into court and show that the particular relief sought is justified. In any event, it seems likely that it was this kind of habeas corpus which Congress expressly preserved in the new law, 21 D.C.Code \u00a7 549, for the benefit of all persons originally committed under either the new or the old law.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-13\">Judges DANAHER, BURGER, and TAMM have authorized me to say that they concur in this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b713-7\">. Just how much of a change in substance there is between the new law and the old in this respect is problematical. The corresponding language of the latter, 21 D.C. Code \u00a7 315 (1961 ed.), is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Atm\">If the judge be satisfied that the alleged insane person is insane, or if a jury shall so find, the judge may commit the insane person <em>as he in his discretion shall find to be for the best interests of the public and of the insane person. </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
