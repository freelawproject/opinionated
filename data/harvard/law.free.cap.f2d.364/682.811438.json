No. 19703 is a petition by the Union for a determination that the Board erred in not giving the full measure of relief requested, and No. 19720 is the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement of its order against the respondent employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-17\">The unfair labor practices relate to the Union\u2019s organizing efforts. The Board found that respondent coerced its employees in violation of Section 8(a) (1) of fhe National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), by interrogating them about their union sympathies and by posting a notice declaring its views on the organizational campaign.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Board also found that the discharge of one Styles, after he refused to carry out a job assignment because it entailed crossing a picket line at the premises of a customer of respondent, violated both Section 8(a) (1) and Section 8(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-18\">The Board\u2019s determination that respondent\u2019s interrogation constituted unlawful coercion and interference with protected rights finds sufficient support in the record. Nor do we alter the Board\u2019s order with respect to Styles. Respondent contends that a refusal to cross a picket line at the premises of another employer is not protected by the Act and that our previous decisions do not foreclose this contention.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> But the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Board, independent of its finding that Section 8(a) (1) was violated, thought the dismissal was discriminatorily motivated in violation of Section 8(a) (3). Since substantial evidence in the record supports this last mentioned ground, we need not consider whether Styles engaged in protected activity under Section 7. Styles honored a picket line deployed by the same union that was organizing respondent\u2019s plant. The Board thought it reasonable to conclude, in light of respondent\u2019s other anti-union actions and the frailty of the asserted business justification for the discharge, that this indication of sympathy for the Union colored the decision to discharge him. We cannot say this conclusion lacks the requisite record support; and we direct enforcement founded upon Section 8(a) (3).</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">But we cannot uphold the Board\u2019s ruling that the notice violates the Act. Another panel of this court has recently considered the innuendoes that could fairly be drawn from a nearly identical notice. Amalgamated Clothing Workers v. NLRB (Sagamore Shirt Co.), 124 U.S.App.D.C.-, 365 F.2d 898, decided June 27, 1966.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It concluded that the language used \u201cin and of itself cannot reasonably be construed as a \u2018threat of reprisal or force\u2019 as required by the Act.\u201d We agree. Although the context in which the notice is placed may doubtless bear upon its meaning, here as in <em>Amalgamated Clothing Workers, </em>the Board has not set forth particular findings which indicate the coercive aspects of the notice. The Act contemplates freedom of expression even in the robust atmosphere of an organizational campaign so long as that expression does not constitute a \u201cthreat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(c). Since, in our view, the Board\u2019s findings are inadequate in demonstrating that the notice conveyed this prohibited implication, we deny enforcement to that part of the order.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-9\">The Union, contrary to the conclusion of the Board, contends that respondent discriminatorily discharged one Ratledge who was active in the organizational effort. But the Board regarded Ratledge\u2019s assault upon a supervisor as prompting the discharge, and that conclusion is amply supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-10\">The petition in No. 19703 is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-11\">The petition for enforcement in No. 19720 is granted in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-12\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, concurs except that he would enforce also the order of the Board insofar as it rests upon the notice referred to in the opinion of the court. The decision of the Board states that the Board is in subtantial agreement with the Trial Examiner as to the notice \u201cand particularly in the light of the other unfair labor practices found * * * including interrogations of employees and threats of economic reprisal *</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b731-11\"><em>. </em>The notice, in pertinent part, is as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Am8\">\u201cSince the Teamsters Union is putting on another campaign to get in here, a good many questions have arisen with regard to the following matters..
