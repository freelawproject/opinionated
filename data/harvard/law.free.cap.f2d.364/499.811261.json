Liebhafsky, Asst. U. S. Atty. for Southern District of New York (Robert M. Morgenthau, U. S. Atty., Richard A. Givens, Asst. U. S.

In D\u2019Ercole v. United States, 361 F.2d 211 (2d Cir. 1966) we held that such \u201can objection must be made at the latest at the time of trial, and perhaps even earlier * See United States v. Sanchez, 361 F.2d 824 (2d Cir.1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b547-30\">After arrest, appellant did not press for an early trial; indeed, his request at trial part, where he was advised of his \u201cright to have his case go forward promptly,\u201d to return the case to calendar part, was partially responsible for the delay. Appellant\u2019s detailed testimony as to the events that took place on the date <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>of the commission of the offense indicates that he suffered no prejudice because of the delay. See United States v. Torres, 343 F.2d 750, 751 (2d Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-4\">Appellant also urges the inadmissibility of evidence as to certain post-arrest statements. Since appellant failed to object to admission of this evidence at the trial, the point is unavailable on appeal. See United States v. Indiviglio, 352 F.2d 276 (2d Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 907, 86 S.Ct. 887, 15 L.Ed.2d 663 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">The court wishes to express to Gerald J. Flintoft its gratitude for his conscientious and able handling of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
