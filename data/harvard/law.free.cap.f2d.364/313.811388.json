See Lynch v. United States, decided May 24, 1966, 9 Cir., 362 F.2d 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">In the instant cause, appellant moved the district court to vacate judgment and sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 on two grounds: (1) the sentence of ten years was allegedly invalid because it was a general sentence upon a three-count indictment and (2) the judgment was allegedly invalid because it materially departed from the oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-8\">We find no merit in appellant\u2019s contentions. The indictment is in one count and charges appellant with but one offense. Any reference in the indictment and judgment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2 relates only to appellant\u2019s co-defendant Gallant, who was charged with \u201caiding and abetting\u201d appellant in the commission of the offense to which appellant pleaded guilty. Any reference in the indictment and judgment to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2113(a) and (d) does not constitute two separate and distinct offenses. Green v. United States, 365 U.S. 301, 81 S.Ct. 653, 5 L.Ed.2d 670 (1961). This court has reached the same conclusion, holding that, \u201c[F]or sentencing purposes, an offense under subsection (a) becomes merged with the more aggravated offense under subsection (d).\u201d Bayless v. United States, 347 F.2d 354, 356 (9 Cir., 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-10\">We find no material inconsistency between the judgment of conviction and the oral pronouncement of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-11\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
