He petitioned for habeas corpus on two grounds. First, appellant alleged that statements obtained in violation of the rule established in Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964), were used against him at preliminary hearing. The Escobedo rule is not available to appellant in view of Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). Second, appellant alleged that \u201cthe public prosecutor used trickery and deception to obtain a guilty plea.\u201d The few facts alleged in support of this conclusory allegation indicate that the prosecuting attorney agreed to recommend a one-year sentence, but that the sentencing judge \u201cheld that the minimum term would have to be two years in spite of the district attorney\u2019s recommendation.\u201d The court\u2019s rejection of the prosecutor\u2019s recommendation as to sentence is not a ground for habeas corpus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-29\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
