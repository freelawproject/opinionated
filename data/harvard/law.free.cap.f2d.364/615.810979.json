There is no dispute as to the facts. The court rendered a summary judgment in favor of the ship owner and the Port appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-14\">The lien claim arises under a tariff establishing charges for wharfage and cargo handling services, which also contains the language set out in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The services were rendered to the S.S. Duval at a time when she was under bareboat charter containing a no lien clause.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Port of Tacoma did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>know of these provisions; it made no inquiry; it simply relied upon the tariff.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Coneededly, but for the tariff, the liens would not be valid, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 973; Gilmore &amp; Black, The Law of Admiralty \u00a7 9-46, at 566-68 (1957). See Dampskibsselskabet Dannebrog v. Signal Oil &amp; Gas Co., 1940, 310 U.S. 268, 275, 60 S.Ct. 937, 84 L.Ed. 1197; United States v. Carver, 1923, 260 U.S. 482, 43 S.Ct. 181, 67 L.Ed. 361; Colonial Beach Co. v. Quemahoning Coal Co., 1923, 260 U.S. 707, 43 S.Ct. 246, 67 L.Ed. 474. The Port says that the. tariff gave constructive notice to the owner and makes the no lien provisions of the charter ineffective under the provisions of the Shipping Act of 1916, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 801-842 and of the Intercoastal Shipping Act of 1933, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 843-848. It is settled, however, that such filing gives constructive notice only \u201c * * of everything contained in such published tariff schedules which is by law required to be therein inserted * Pacific S.S. Co. v. Cackette, 9 Cir., 1925, 8 F.2d 259, 260, cert. denied, 269 U.S. 586, 46 S.Ct. 203, 70 L.Ed. 426. We can find no such requirement of law as to the provisions of the tariff that purport to give the Port a lien valid against the owner in spite of the no lien provisions of the charter party.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">We assume that the Port is correct in urging that 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 814 required the filing with the Federal Maritime Commission of an agreement called the \u201cNorthwest Marine Terminal Association Agreement\u201d to which it was a party. That agreement contains the paragraph set out in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But section 814 does not purport to give to such filed agreements the effect of tariffs, nor to make their filing equivalent to constructive notice of their contents to the world at large. It confers exemption from the anti-trust laws, if the Commission approves them. It excepts from the requirement of approval, \u201ctariff rates, fares, and charges, and classifications, rules, and regulations explanatory thereof * * * if otherwise in accordance with law * * * upon compliance with the publication and filing requirements of section 817(b) * * Section 817(b) (1), however, deals only with the tariffs of \u201cevery common carrier by water in foreign commerce and every conference of such carriers.\u201d The Port is not such a carrier; the Northwest Marine Terminal Association is not such a conference. See definitions in 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 801. The Port does not rely on section 817(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-11\">Reliance is also placed on 46 U.S.C. \u00a7 844, which is a part of the Intercoastal Shipping Act. It applies only to tariffs of a \u201ccommon carrier by water in intercoastal commerce.\u201d On its face, when construed with section 843, defining such a carrier, it would seem that it does not apply to the Port\u2019s tariff. The Commission, however, asserts that a marine terminal operator is embraced within the term \u201ccommon carrier by water in intercoastal commerce.\u201d In re Transportation of Lumber through Panama Canal, 2 U.S.M.C. 143, 149 (1939). Assuming, without deciding, that this is correct, section 844 deals only with \u201crates, fares and charges for or in connection with transportation.\u201d We do not think that the lien provision falls within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>this language, nor the further language relating to \u201crules or regulations which in anywise change, affect, or determine any part of the aggregate of such aforesaid rates, fares or charges, or the value of the service rendered * *</p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\">We find nothing in either of the acts upon which the Port relies that authorizes a tariff provision that has the effect of nullifying the provisions of the Maritime Lien Act, 46 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 971-75, and particularly \u00a7 973 <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It follows, under that section and our decision in Pacific S.S. Co. v. Caekette, supra, that the owner of the S.S. Duval did not have constructive notice of the lien provision, and is not bound by it. See also United States v. S.S. Lucie Schulte, 2 Cir., 1965, 343 F.2d 897; The Western Wave, 5 Cir., 1935, 77 F.2d 695, 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b664-7\">. \u201c(b) Charges, Collected, From Whom:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AAG\">\u201cWharfage, loading and unloading, when not absorbed by ocean or rail carriers, are due from the owner, shipper or consignee of the freight.
