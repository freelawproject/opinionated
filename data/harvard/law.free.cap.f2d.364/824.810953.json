He did not appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-28\">A petition for a writ of habeas corpus was denied by the California Supreme Court on February 11, 1965.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-29\">Appellant next filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court. On July 30, 1965, his petition was dismissed on the ground that Escobedo v. State of Illinois, 378 U.S. 478, 84 S.Ct. 1758, 12 L.Ed.2d 977 (1964) was not retroactive. The district court relied on Carrizosa v. Wilson, 244 F.Supp. 120 (N.D. Calif. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b873-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>Since then the Supreme Court, in Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (decided June 20, 1966), affirmed this view of the law. Mr. Chief Justice Warren stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b873-5\">\u201cWe hold that <em>Escobedo </em>affects only those cases in which the trial began after June 22, 1964, the date of that decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b873-6\">Appellant\u2019s case was tried prior to June 22, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-7\">Appellant additionally urges \u201cmisrepresentation of counsel,\u201d yet no facts are alleged to prove or support this conclusionary statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-8\">The dismissal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
