O\u2019Donnell\u201d (appellant) and \u201cLawrence F. O\u2019Donnell \u2014 Client\u2019s Account\u201d, and also films of checks and debit memos charged to the former account. Neither the bank nor the assistant cashier is a client of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">Appellant cannot claim these records, kept by the bank for its own purposes, as his property. Nor can he invoke the attorney-client privilege. These were not confidential communications to an attorney by a client. They had already been disclosed to a third party, the bank. They were not the property of a client. These circumstances fall far short of cases where accounting and tax papers relating to a client were held subject to summonses even though in the possession of the attorney.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">As was said in Schulze v. Rayunec, 7 Cir., 1965, 350 F.2d 666, 668, where the court ordered the production under summons of records relating to a cashier\u2019s check caused to be issued by a lawyer for an unnamed client, \u201cwe do not think * * * [the attorney] can clothe the bank records with the * * * [attorney-client] privilege under the facts and circumstances of this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">Moreover, appellant has no more standing to object to the summons on the bank than the taxpayers in Application of Cole, 2 Cir., 1965, 342 F.2d 5, cert. denied, Cole v. United States, 381 U.S. 950, 85 S.Ct. 1803, 14 L.Ed.2d 723; De Masters v. Arend, 9 Cir., 1963, 313 F.2d 79, petition for cert. dismissed, 375 U.S. 936, 84 S.Ct. 341, 11 L.Ed.2d 269, or Foster v. United States, 2 Cir., 1959, 265 F.2d 183, cert. denied, 360 U.S. 912, 79 S.Ct. 1297, 3 L.Ed.2d 1261. See also Stone v. Williams, 1 Cir., 1966, 356 F.2d 934.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-11\">Appellant\u2019s contention that Section 7602 is being used to serve the purposes of a criminal prosecution conceived by the Organized Crime Division of IRS is similarly unsupported. The district judge found, and the lengthy record amply supports his findings, that the investigation of appellant had several proper and non-conspiratorial sources. Appellant\u2019s 1962 return was chosen for examination because of a large bank deposit consisting mostly of bills of $100 or more. His 1963 return was chosen for audit by an agent who had no knowledge of the prior selection, as the result of a routine classification of a block of returns, where claimed deductions for medical expenses and Schedule C reporting of business income and expenditures indicated the desirability of checking. This investigation of appellant\u2019s 1962 and 1963 returns is the only one in which appellant is involved. It has been assigned to the Intelligence Division of IRS because of possible understatement of appellant\u2019s gross receipts. Appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>has refused to produce his books and records and the bank summons has issued as we have noted above. This investigation, therefore, is far from complete, with no determination of liability having been made and, as the district court found, no evidence that criminal charges are being considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">A peripheral examination of appellant\u2019s returns was made by agents within the Intelligence Division assigned to the Organized Crime Drive in connection with the tax liability of Bernard G. McGarry. Appellant did not then represent McGarry, but did represent seventeen witnesses (of whom twelve were related to McGarry by blood or marriage) who had been summoned in the McGarry investigation. Appellant\u2019s returns for the years 1956-1962 were scrutinized by these agents for the purpose of checking any business connection or financial transactions between McGarry and appellant as they might bear on McGarry\u2019s tax liability. The returns disclosed no such connection. They were not checked for correctness and were ultimately returned to file. None of the agents connected with the Organized Crime Drive Group have taken any part in the current investigation of appellant\u2019s 1962 and 1963 returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">What we have said in McGarry v. Riley, supra, applies <em>a fortiori </em>to this issue. In <em>McGarry, </em>there were mixed criminal and civil aspects of the investigation which we held did not constitute misuse of Section 7602. Here the civil aspects have so far clearly been not only present but dominant if not exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that the district court erred to the extent of partiality in modifying the scope of documents produced in response to his numerous <em>subpoenae duces tecum. </em>The nine subpoenae asked, among other records, for all diaries (official and personal) and work sheets covering four years, and all notes during attendance at various schools. The requests were made without limitation to matters related to appellant. The district judge, faced with what might well be considered frivolous requests, exercised admirable patience in giving every opportunity to appellant to designate documents. The appellant failing to do this, the judge ordered all relevant documents to be produced. Appellant was allowed to place them in evidence and recall witnesses for further questioning based on the documents. Clearly there was no error and only such partiality as indulged the appellant.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b91-15\">. This opinion arises out of the same general subject matter as that giving rise to McGarry v. Riley, 1 Cir., 1966, 363 F.2d 421, issued this date, in which we have indicated the other chapters of this extended litigation at n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b92-7\">. These three claims are distilled from thirteen points stated as the basis of appeal. A fourth claim, that the district judge refused to act on appellant\u2019s requests for rulings of law, was properly not briefed since the lower court\u2019s opinion was in effect a disposition of the \u25a0 issues so raised. A fifth point of appeal, challenging a ruling by the court that Internal Revenue agents subpoenaed by appellant were his witnesses, was also not briefed or argued.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b92-13\">.

Having been confronted in this appeal by a record of 457 pages and a 52 page brief for appellant in which only three cases, not particularly pertinent, were cited, we can only respect the patience demonstrated by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
