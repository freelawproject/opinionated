He was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and ten months.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-19\">Pruitt claims that when he entered his plea of guilty, he was unaware that the section of the Code providing for registration of firearms (Title 26 U.S.C., \u00a7 5841) had been declared unconstitutional as requiring one in his situation to incriminate himself. Russell v. United States, 306 F.2d 402 (9th Cir. 1962). He also relies on Dugan v. United States, 341 F.2d 85 (7th Cir. 1965); United States v. Fleish, 227 F.Supp. 967 (D.C. Mich.1964); McCann v. United States, 217 F.Supp. 751, 752 (D.C.Colo.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b874-20\">Russell and the other eases relied on by Pruitt charged violation of the registration section, \u00a7 5841. Pruitt was charged in the present case with possession of an unregistered firearm in violation of Section 5851. Section 5861 merely prescribes the penalty. The gist of Pruitt\u2019s offense was not that he failed to register the firearm, but that he possessed a firearm which had not been registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-21\">This distinction was pointed out in later decisions by the Ninth Circuit, which had decided <em>Russell. </em>They upheld convictions under Section 5851. Frye v. United States, 315 F.2d 491 (9th Cir. 1963); Starks v. United States, 316 F.2d 45 (9th Cir. 1963). In Sipes v. United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"827\">*827</page-number>States, 821 F.2d 174 (8th Cir. 1963) the Court followed <em>Frye </em>and <em>Starks.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b875-6\">We applied the same rule to an indictment under Section 5855 charging unlawful transportation of unregistered firearms in interstate commerce. United States v. Forgett, 349 F.2d 601 (6th Cir. 1965), cert. denied, 383 U.S. 926, 86 S.Ct. 929, 15 L.Ed.2d 845 (1966). See also Lovelace v. United States, 357 F.2d 306 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b875-7\">Since Pruitt was charged with violation of Section 5851, he is not in position to attack the constitutionality of Section 5841. The decisions on which he relies are inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-8\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
