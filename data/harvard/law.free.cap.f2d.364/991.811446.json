Southwestern Skyways, Inc., D.C., 220 F.Supp. 441, affm\u2019d 10 Cir., 336 F.2d 603, the trial court held that the activities of the employee on which attempted service was made were quantitatively and qualitatively insufficient to meet the test of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d so as to constitute doing business in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b1039-29\">We affirm the judgment of the trial court for the reasons stated in its opinion. 257 F.Supp. 537.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
