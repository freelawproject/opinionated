Under the circumstances presented by this case, we conclude that the district court properly denied USC's motion to compel arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Allen Munro and eight other current and former USC employees (\"Employees\") participate in both the USC Retirement Savings Program and the USC Tax-Deferred Annuity Plan (collectively, the \"Plans\"). In this putative class action lawsuit, they allege multiple breaches of fiduciary duty in administration of the Plans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Each of the individual Employees was required to sign an arbitration agreement as part of her employment contract. The nine Employees signed five different iterations of USC's arbitration agreement. Consistent among the various agreements is an agreement to arbitrate all claims that either the Employee or USC has against the other party to the agreement. The agreements expressly cover claims for violations of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In their putative class action lawsuit, the Employees sought financial and equitable remedies to benefit the Plans and all affected participants and beneficiaries, including but not limited to: a determination as to the method of calculating losses; removal of breaching fiduciaries; a full accounting of Plan losses; reformation of the Plans; and an order regarding appropriate future investments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   USC moved to compel arbitration, arguing that the Employees' agreements bar\n   the Employees from litigating their claims on behalf of the Plan. It also requested the district court to compel arbitration on an individual, rather than class, basis because the parties did not specifically agree to class arbitration. The district court denied USC's motion, determining that the arbitration agreements, which the Employees entered into in their individual capacities, do not bind the Plans because the Plans did not themselves consent to arbitration of the claims. USC timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction under ERISA \u00a7 502(e)(1),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court held that an individual may bring an ERISA claim alleging breach of fiduciary duty even if the claim pertains only to her own account and seeks relief for losses limited to that account.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n    552 U.S. at 256\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In doing so, the Court made clear that it had not reconsidered its longstanding recognition that it is the plan, and not the individual beneficiaries and participants, that benefit from a winning claim for breach of fiduciary duty, even when the plan is a defined contribution plan.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"[A]lthough \u00a7 502(a)(2) does not provide a remedy for individual injuries distinct from plan injuries, that provision does authorize recovery for fiduciary breaches that impair the value of plan assets in a participant's individual account.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Even if\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   held the meaning USC attributes to it, it would not control this\n   case. The claims brought by the Employees arise from alleged fiduciary misconduct as to the Plans in their entireties and are not, as in\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   , limited to mismanagement of individual accounts.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n    at 250-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3675824\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/552/248/#p256\">\n    128 S.Ct. 1020\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that the lawsuit arose from the fiduciary's alleged failure to carry out the participant-plaintiff's directions). As we have noted, the Employees seek financial and equitable remedies to benefit the Plans and all affected participants and beneficiaries, including a determination as to the method of calculating losses, removal of breaching fiduciaries, a full accounting of Plan losses, reformation of the Plans, and an order regarding appropriate future investments. The relief sought demonstrates that the Employees are bringing their claims to benefit their respective Plans across the board, not just to benefit their own accounts as in\n   <em>\n    LaRue\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   In short, there is no principled distinction to be drawn between this case and\n   <em>\n    Welch\n   </em>\n   .

USC contends that\n    <em>\n     Amaro\n    </em>\n    is \"clearly irreconcilable\" with intervening Supreme Court case law and, therefore, we should overrule it. Although the Supreme Court has never expressly held that ERISA claims are arbitrable, there is considerable force to USC's position.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     Comer v.

However, given our decision that the claims asserted in this case fall outside the arbitration clauses in the employee agreements, it is unnecessary to decide that question here. Therefore, we leave the issue of\n    <em>\n     Amaro\n    </em>\n    's viability for another day.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
