The Clause protects \"the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience.\"\n   <em>\n    Wallace v. Jaffree\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512457\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/38/#p49\">\n    472 U.S. 38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 49,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512457\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/38/#p49\">\n    105 S.Ct. 2479\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1512457\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/472/38/#p49\">\n    86 L.Ed.2d 29\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). It likewise ensures that the government in no way acts to make belief-whether theistic or nontheistic, religious or nonreligious-relevant to an individual's membership or standing in our political community.\n   <em>\n    Lynch v. Donnelly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p688\">\n    465 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p688\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11337057\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/668/#p688\">\n    79 L.Ed.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring). The Establishment Clause, grounded in experiences of persecution, affirms the fundamental truth that no matter what an individual's religious beliefs, he has a valued place in the political community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These principles are central to our analysis in the context of public schools. Because children and adolescents are just beginning to develop their own belief systems, and because they absorb the lessons of adults as to what beliefs are appropriate or right, we are especially attentive to Establishment Clause concerns raised by religious exercise in the public-school setting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   This case implicates just such concerns. Freedom From Religion Foundation, two parents of students in the district, and twenty Doe plaintiffs-students, parents, district employees, a former district employee, and attendees of school board meetings (collectively \"the Foundation\")-challenge a religious exercise at a local school board's meetings-including a prayer in the portion of the meeting that is open to the public and that includes student attendees and participants. The Chino Valley Unified School District Board of Education (\"Chino Valley\" or \"the Board\") appeals the district court's grant of summary judgment to the Foundation on its Establishment Clause claim and challenges the scope of the injunctive relief ordered\n   by the district court. They also seek to vacate, as moot, a separate portion of the district court's judgment, declaring that the Board's policy and custom of prayer and Bible readings at its meetings violates the Establishment Clause. We affirm the district court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Board is the governing body for the school district and accordingly oversees all district schools.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2035010\">\n    Cal. Educ. Code \u00a7 35010\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Board holds roughly eighteen public meetings per year. These meetings for some period of years included a public prayer, until enjoined by the district court. In October 2013, the Board adopted an official policy regarding the prayer practice, permitting an invocation at each Board meeting and providing a means for the Board to select the prayer-giver. The Board's policy and practice of prayer are at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Board Meetings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Board meetings share a familiar structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   After a roll call and opportunity for public comment on closed-session items, the first portion of the meeting is closed to the public. During this time, the Board's five adult, non-student members make decisions on student discipline, including suspension and expulsion, student readmission, negotiations with the employee labor union, and hiring, firing, and discipline of district personnel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The open portion of the meetings begins with a report by the Board president on the preceding closed session. Next, a member of the school community-sometimes, a student-recites the Pledge of Allegiance, and the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps presents the colors. Then, there is an opening prayer, usually led by a member of the clergy. On occasion, a Board member or member of the audience leads the prayer instead.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A \"student showcase\"-presentations by classes or student groups from the district-often follows the opening prayer. At times, the Board also sets aside time for \"student recognition,\" to highlight the academic and extracurricular accomplishments of students in the district. Following comments by the student representative and employee representatives, there is a period for public comment. The Board then conducts its business of making decisions regarding district administration. At one typical meeting, it approved fundraising activities, field trips, the chemistry textbook, course revisions and new courses, the expulsion of two students, a bid for asphalt slurry seal at certain facilities, the revision of the use-of-school-facilities policy, and personnel items. During this time, the Board also approves student discipline and readmission cases, and requests\n   for waiver of high school graduation requirements. The meeting closes with \"communications\"-public statements by each of the adult Board members to the school community. Very occasionally, a second closed session occurs after the open portion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Both the student showcase and the student recognition components of the meeting center on the accomplishments of students of all ages-from elementary school to high school-who are in attendance. Musical or dance performances by elementary school students are common. For example, at one meeting second-graders sang folk songs; another meeting featured the elementary school's advanced band students. Sometimes, the \"student showcase\" is academic. Elementary and high school students make presentations to the Board on their studies in innovative classes. The student recognition portion celebrates both academic and extracurricular achievements. The Board has honored the district's elementary school and high school science fair winners, recipients of college scholarships, and the district high school student with the highest GPA. It has also recognized the Chino High School girls' varsity softball team, Cub Scout award recipients, winners of an elementary school art contest and school read-a-thons, and high school students fundraising for breast-cancer research.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Board's student representative is also an active participant in the meetings. She\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is president of the Student Advisory Council and sits on the Board to represent student interests. The student representative votes with the Board in the open session, though her vote is recorded separately. During the period for comment at meetings, she discusses issues of importance to the student community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Board meetings are open to any member of the public.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2054954.3\">\n    Cal. Gov't Code \u00a7 54954.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . They are also broadcast on local television.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Board's Prayer Policy and Practice\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The Board has included prayer as part of its meetings at least since 2010. In September 2013, the Foundation sent the Board a letter requesting that it \"refrain from scheduling prayers as part of future school board meetings.\" One month later, the Board adopted a policy regarding invocations at board meetings. The prayer policy provides for prayer delivery \"by an eligible member of the clergy or a religious leader in the boundaries of\" the district. Should the selected member of the clergy not appear, the Board president can solicit a volunteer from the Board or audience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Board selects clergy for each meeting pursuant to a list of eligible local religious leaders and chaplains kept by the superintendent's designee. The designee compiles this list, under the terms of the policy, by 1) looking through a commercial phone book \"for 'churches,' 'congregations,' or other religious assemblies\"; 2) collating \"research from the Internet\"; and 3) consulting with \"local chambers of commerce.\" Any \"religious assembl[y] with an established presence\" in Chino Valley is eligible, and a religious entity can write to the superintendent's designee to ensure that it is on the list. All chaplains for fire departments and law enforcement agencies in Chino Valley and \"any nearby military facilities\" are automatically on the list. Once a year, the designee mails an invitation to pray at Board meetings to the \"religious leader\" of each congregation on the list, as well as to all the chaplains. The policy provides both that clergy are \"scheduled\n   on a first-come, first-serve, or other random basis\" and that the \"designee shall make every reasonable effort to ensure that a variety of eligible invocational speakers are scheduled.\" No single individual may be scheduled to pray at consecutive meetings, or at more than three per year. The Board adopted its prayer policy unanimously. All five adult members of the Board voted in favor; the student representative also voted for its adoption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Invited clergy have typically given the prayers. However, Board members gave the opening prayer at least four times after the adoption of the policy. The president of the California School Employees Association and the district's director of secondary curriculum also provided opening prayers on different occasions. At least twice, community members gave prayers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Expression of Religious Beliefs at Board Meetings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Historically-including after the adoption of the prayer policy, and during the pendency of the litigation now before us-Board members' invocation of Christian beliefs, Bible readings, and further prayer were a regular feature of Board meetings. Board members stressed that they viewed such religious engagement as central to the mission and life of the school community. In a meeting in February 2014, following adoption of the prayer policy, Board member Andrew Cruz stated, \"I think there are very few districts of that powerfulness of having a board such as ourselves having a goal. And that one goal is under God, Jesus Christ.\" At another meeting, then-Board president James Na \"urged everyone who does not know Jesus Christ to go and find Him.\" Na informed the assembled audience in May 2014, \"God appointed us to be here-whether you to be teachers, or our staff members, or our principals, or our directors, assistant superintendents....\" At another meeting, he instructed the teachers and the assembled audience: \"anything you desire, depend on God.\" Cruz publicly thanked a school principal \"for placing God before herself and praying for every classroom on Saturday.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   During Board meetings from 2013 to 2015, Na and Cruz regularly endorsed prayer, read Bible verses, and reaffirmed their Christian beliefs. A third member of the five-member Board that approved the prayer policy, Charles Dickie, gave the invocation at the Board meetings at least three times and was identified by Na as a future \"neighbor ... in heaven,\" after Na discussed Dickie's missionary work in Africa at a Board meeting. No Board member sought to halt any of the religious comments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The religious discussion at Board meetings included specific comments on the opening prayers given by outside clergy. At a June 2013 meeting, Cruz stated that the pastor who had given the opening invocation \"was right, in his prayers, that I need [to] first look up to Jesus Christ for serving our students.\" At another meeting following the adoption of the prayer policy, Na thanked the Christian pastor who gave an opening prayer \"for your serving the Lord Jesus Christ and serving all of our students because we do need your prayers [on a] daily basis.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Na and Cruz's explicit linkages of the work of the Board, teachers, and the school community to Christianity, and their endorsement of prayer by the faculty, were frequent. Minutes from one meeting state that Cruz \"praised personnel for putting God first.\" On another occasion, Cruz described \"one voice united in prayer at Chino,\" and read Romans 15:6-\"so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ\"-to the Board-meeting audience.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In the course of Board meetings, preaching to the district community and biblical readings by the Board members were also common. At one meeting, Na stated that he thought a deceased community member \"wanted you, all the TV viewers and our friends to hear again,\" and then read, John 3:16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Cruz, at another meeting, stated to the audience: \"If we have confessed our sins and ask God's forgiveness, we simply need to keep a forward focus toward the goal of pleasing Christ.\" At yet another meeting, Cruz told the audience: \"Christ died for our sins, according to the scripture, and ... he was buried, and ... he was raised on the third day, according to the scripture. Now that is the gospel.\" Another time, he instructed the audience \"that the two greatest commandments are to [l]ove the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind\" and to \"[l]ove your neighbor as yourself.\" During the comment period at one meeting, Na \"thanked God for sending his son Jesus Christ so that our sins are forgiven and [we] may have eternal life in heaven.\" He also described a news story about a murder in order to instruct the audience as to \"how much we need God in today's society.\" The record contains at least fourteen instances in which Cruz read Bible verses to the assembled district community during the period set aside for Board-member comment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Foundation brought this suit against the school district and, in their official capacities, the (adult) Board members, in November 2014. The Foundation alleged that the Board's policy and custom of opening board meetings with prayer, as well as its policy and custom of including Bible reading and preaching in meetings, violated the Establishment Clause, the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause, and the California Constitution. It sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as nominal damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The district court granted partial summary judgment for the Foundation on the Establishment Clause claim\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and enjoined the current Board members \"in their official representative capacities ... from conducting, permitting or otherwise endorsing school-sponsored prayer in Board meetings.\" The court also entered a declaratory judgment that the prayer policy \"and the policy and custom of reciting prayers, Bible readings, and proselytizing at Board meetings\" violated the Establishment Clause. The district court dismissed all claims against the Board and all state claims against the Board members in their official capacities as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. All claims against a former Board member, who left the Board during the pendency of the district court proceedings, were likewise dismissed. The Board and Board members, including the former Board member, appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   At the outset, while the Foundation does not challenge appellate standing, we evaluate it pursuant to our \"special obligation to satisfy [ourselves] of [our] own jurisdiction....\"\n   <em>\n    Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch.

The Board and its former Board member lack standing to appeal. As described above, all claims against them were dismissed, and they lack any ongoing obligations pursuant to the district court's judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Beyond direct physical control, the school district also holds a more subtle power over the students' academic and professional futures, which manifests itself in the program at Board meetings. For example, the Board's power to suspend and expel students is a power to determine students' continued membership in the district community. The Board also waives high school graduation requirements in specific cases, and bestows recognition on particular district students. The student board member's authority is subject to the continued goodwill of the Board: under Board bylaws, the Board delegates authority to the student, and any authority the student has is \"an exercise in student responsibilities.\" Unlike the legislative sessions in\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   , where constituents may replace legislators and need not fear their exercise of comprehensive control, students do not enjoy such autonomy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Moreover, legislators and constituents hold equal status as adult members of the political community, which means that in the ordinary course of events constituents may feel free to exit or voice dissent in response to a prayer at a legislative session. Minors in the school district essentially lack those options. For student attendees, then, the school-board meetings in which the prayer occurs, and the relationship between students and the Board, lack the democratic hallmarks present in legislative sessions and in constituents' relationship with the legislature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Further, academic and social pressures make students' presence at the Board meetings not meaningfully voluntary. Children attend the Chino Valley Board meetings pursuant to academic or extracurricular obligations. The student representative on the Board, for instance, attends pursuant to her duty to \"provide continuing input for board deliberations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Student presentations at meetings-such as presentations by sixth-grade students reading chapters from their autobiographies-expand on in-class educational activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Neither\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   nor\n   <em>\n    Town of Greece\n   </em>\n   implicated the audience's access to, and experience of, a public-school education. A requirement that a child choose whether to participate in a religious exercise or to dissent in order to participate in a complete educational experience, on par with that of her peers, implicates graver Establishment Clause considerations than the prayers at public meetings found to be within the\n   <em>\n    Marsh\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Greece\n   </em>\n   tradition.

Of these two purposes, the Board proffers the solemnization rationale as the key motivator.

In its evaluation, the Court looked in part to the means-end fit between the policy's expressed purposes and its \"approval of only one specific kind of message, an 'invocation.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because other messages that were not invocations could equally well serve the expressed purposes, the policy's restriction of the message to an invocation made those expressed purposes suspect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, too, Chino Valley's choice to restrict the opening message to an invocation belies the expressed purposes of the policy. There is no secular reason to limit the solemnization to prayers or, relatedly, to have a presupposition in the policy that the solemnizers will be religious leaders. Rather, these aspects of the policy point to a religious purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Next, the Board's second expressed purpose of demonstrating respect for religious diversity also fails the secularity test for multiple reasons. First, the means-end fit is off in that the policy does not capture all the religious diversity in Chino Valley. The policy limits invited prayer-givers to religious leaders with established religious communities within the district's boundaries. However, there are people of minority faiths living within the borders of the Chino Valley Unified School District whose faith lacks a sufficient critical mass to sustain an established community within the district's borders. For instance, roughly two percent of California's population is Buddhist, two percent is Jewish, one percent is Mormon, one percent is Orthodox Christian, and one percent belong to religions besides Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, or Judaism.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, there are no religious communities from these traditions on the Board's list of eligible congregations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Far from highlighting the full range of religious diversity and beliefs, the invocation policy reinforces the dominance of particular religious traditions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Second, the purpose of respecting religious diversity, to the extent that it does not encompass\n   <em>\n    non\n   </em>\n   religious belief systems and their diversity, is itself constitutionally suspect. Atheists and agnostics comprise four percent and five percent of the California population, respectively.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Neither the purpose of respecting religious diversity nor the means of doing so via prayer acknowledges or respects the beliefs of nonreligious citizens in the district.\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe ISD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    530 U.S. at 309-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hence, Chino Valley's failure to acknowledge nonreligious beliefs undermines the validity of the second putative secular purpose for its prayer policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   While the lack of a secular purpose is sufficient to find the Board's policy and practice unconstitutional, the prayers in this appeal also fail the second and third prongs of the\n   <em>\n    Lemon\n   </em>\n   test.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/#p612\">\n    403 U.S. at 612-13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12027402\" index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/403/602/#p612\">\n    91 S.Ct. 2105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Readings about the import of religious diversity, the pluralistic nature of our society, or leaders from various religious (and explicitly nonreligious) traditions could provide for serious reflection, without conveying an explicitly religious message or performing a religious activity during the Board meeting.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe ISD\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    530 U.S. at 306\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413732\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/290/#p310\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Hence, the means-end fit here is skewed in the same way that it was in\n   <em>\n    Santa Fe ISD\n   </em>\n   : an invocation is not necessary to accomplish these purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In sum, the existence of equally available secular means of accomplishing the Board's stated purposes, coupled with the history of Christian prayer, demonstrates that the prayer policy's purpose is predominantly religious in violation of the Establishment Clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
