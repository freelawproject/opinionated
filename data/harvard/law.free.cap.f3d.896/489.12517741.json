While district courts generally have discretion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) to adjust the terms of an existing consent decree in light of changed circumstances, the issuance of a new injunction must meet the strict preconditions for such exceptional relief set out in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65. Because the district court's order in this case provided brand new relief based on brand new facts alleging violations of a new law without the requisite findings for an injunction, it crossed the line from permissibly modifying into impermissibly enjoining. For that reason, we reverse the district court's order, vacate the new injunctive relief, and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   By way of background, under long-established practice, federal courts may enter, as final judicial orders, consent decrees that reflect the agreement of the parties to forward-going injunctive relief, as long as the consent decree arises from and resolves a dispute \"within the court's subject-matter jurisdiction[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Frew v.

Under the Affordable Care Act, the majority of Medicaid applicants and recipients have their eligibility determined by the amount of modified adjusted gross income that they report on their federal income taxes. The Act thus uses household tax information to assess income, household composition, and family size.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20435.901\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 435.901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 435.911, 435.916.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For such tax-based eligibility determinations, the District had to replace its old paper recertification system with a new passive renewal model.

When the DC Access System is fully realized, the District plans to retire its legacy application and recertification system. However, the transition from the old system to the new DC Access System has been halting, due to \"technology challenges, contracting issues, and funding.\" J.A. 827.

In 1994, the district court certified a class consisting of five Subclasses. The first two Subclasses, which involved Medicaid-eligible newborns and certain hospitalized applicants, settled before trial and are not at issue here. Of the remaining three, Subclass III consisted of individuals who alleged delayed processing of their initial Medicaid applications. Subclass IV consisted of individuals who alleged that the District failed to comply with pre-Affordable Care Act requirements to provide adequate advance notice of the termination or suspension of Medicaid eligibility.\n   <em>\n    Liability Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7772667\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/954/278/#p292\">\n    954 F.Supp. at 326-328\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In 1999, while that appeal was still pending, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which the district court approved as the governing Consent Decree in this case. The Consent Decree divided the District's obligations by sections that very roughly mapped onto the remaining Subclasses, albeit (alas) with non-corresponding roman numerals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Sections II and IV of the Consent Decree (which, to escape all the roman numerals, we will refer to as the \"Eligibility Provisions\") addressed Subclass III's grievances concerning the District's slow handling of initial Medicaid applications. It generally required the District to determine Medicaid eligibility within 45 days of an application's submission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section III of the Consent Decree (the \"Renewal Provisions\") addressed the District's failure to provide the legally required notice to Subclass IV members of the need to renew their Medicaid eligibility, and it mapped out a detailed schedule for the District to follow in processing recertification forms and providing advance notice to beneficiaries of the District's eligibility determinations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Finally, Sections V and VI (the \"Early Childhood Provisions\") remedied the District's failures to provide notice of and to deliver Early Childhood Services to the Subclass V members by requiring the District to adopt a variety of measures designed to improve access to and the provision of Early Childhood Services. Section V of the Consent Decree applies only to \"Medicaid recipients\"-that is, persons already enrolled in the Medicaid program. Section VI of the Consent Decree required the District to \"effectively inform all pregnant women, parents, child custodians, and teenagers\" whom the District had \"found eligible for Medicaid benefits\" of the availability of Early Childhood Services. J.A. 286 \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Each Consent Decree section prescribed specific criteria for measuring when the District had satisfied the terms of the Consent Decree and could exit from its governance, generally framed in terms of demonstrated levels of compliance over a specified period of time.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Consent Decree would automatically terminate in its entirety \"at the same time\" the last remaining section of the Consent Decree was satisfied and coverage ended.

The Decree also provided that either party could, at any time, move the court to modify the Consent Decree if a \"change of law\" materially affected the District's continuing obligations under the\n   Consent Decree. J.A. 293 \u00b6 70. The district court's review of any request for modification was to be controlled by the \"general body of federal law governing motions to modify orders in contested matters pursuant to Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure[.]\" J.A. 294 \u00b6 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    3\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Over the next fourteen years, several provisions of the Consent Decree terminated. In 2009, the parties agreed that the District had come into compliance with the standards governing the timely processing of initial Medicaid applications for the Plaintiffs in Subclass III. As a result, the district court \"vacated\" the Eligibility Provisions (Sections II and IV) of the Consent Decree.\n   <em>\n    Salazar v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   , No. 93-452, MINUTE ORDER (D.D.C. Feb. 24, 2009) (\"\n   <em>\n    2009 Vacatur Order\n   </em>\n   \").

(adopting the language of the proposed order).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Renewal Provisions for Subclass IV were the next to go. The District requested termination of the Renewal Provisions following enactment of the Affordable Care Act because that law materially changed the law governing the renewal of beneficiaries' Medicaid eligibility. Specifically, the Act required the District (and States) to implement a passive renewal system that started with the individual's federal tax filing and generally required no affirmative action by the beneficiary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396a(e)(14) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20435.916\">\n    42 C.F.R. \u00a7 435.916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In October 2013, the district court granted the District's motion.

Nor was the district court's order aimed at enforcing a point of relevant overlap between the longstanding Medicaid statute and the new Affordable Care Act. As the district court previously found, the two renewal schemes are \"apples and oranges,\" and \"there is simply no comparison between the statutory framework[s]\" because the Affordable Care Act worked \"almost a seismic\" change in the District's legal obligations.\n   <em>\n    2013 Termination Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325363\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/34/#p37\">\n    991 F.Supp.2d at 37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It was not until almost three months later, after their preliminary injunction motion had been fully briefed, that the Plaintiffs decided to try the Rule 60(b) route. As it turns out, their first instinct that they were seeking a new injunction was the correct one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Second\n   </em>\n   , the district court's order provided relief for Subclasses of Plaintiffs and corresponding sections of the Consent Decree that had already been vacated or terminated.

But the Consent Decree's Subclasses for Medicaid eligibility (Subclasses II and IV) were \"[v]acate[d],\"\n   <em>\n    2009 Vacatur Order\n   </em>\n   , and the district court's supervision \"ended,\" No. 93-452, CONSENT MOTION TO VACATE SECTIONS II AND IV , ECF No. 1443 at 6. Likewise, in 2013, the district court \"terminat[ed]\" the Consent Decree's Medicaid Renewal Provisions, and \"relieved\" the District of any forward-going compliance obligation under the Consent Decree.\n   <em>\n    2013 Termination Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4325363\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/34/#p37\">\n    991 F.Supp.2d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Whatever the scope of a district court's modification authority under Rule 60(b), it cannot resurrect vacated and terminated provisions as a vehicle for imposing novel obligations under a new law based on new facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The district court insisted that its order did not revive closed aspects of the Consent Decree, but instead gave effect to the \"only [executory] portions\" of the Consent Decree still \"in force\"-the Early Childhood Provisions governing notification for and the delivery of Early Childhood Services.\n   <em>\n    2016 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355106\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/418/#p440\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court reasoned that children must be eligible for Medicaid before they can receive such services. True enough. But the Consent Decree never contained an Early Childhood eligibility or renewal Subclass or corresponding sections of the Consent Decree. The Early Childhood Service Subclass, and the relevant provisions of the Consent Decree, were expressly limited to Medicaid\n   <em>\n    recipients\n   </em>\n   -that is, individuals who had already been determined to be eligible for Medicaid benefits. J.A. 271-272, 280. All issues concerning eligibility determination and redetermination matters were governed by the terminated Provisions. None of those Provisions continued in effect at the time of the district court's latest injunctive order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The court's order also applies unqualifiedly to all Medicaid applicants and beneficiaries seeking renewal, without regard to whether they are children or have children. The order, in other words, based a remedy of classwide structural reform on anecdotal evidence and individual testimonies, only a subset of which implicated the children for whose benefit the Early Child Services exist. Indeed, despite a lengthy recitation of Affordable Care Act implementation issues culled from a voluminous record, the district court cited only four instances where the putative Medicaid recipients even had eligible children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2016 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355106\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/418/#p440\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 427-437\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The district court's new injunctive obligations, in short, have no anchor in the remaining executory portions of the Consent Decree and seek to provide benefits to many individuals wholly outside the remaining operative Subclass. Writing new injunctive obligations governing eligibility and renewal into Consent Decree provisions that never addressed those matters and extending the protections to individuals never included within the corresponding Subclass would turn the power to modify a consent decree into an injunctive blank check. \"Who would sign a consent decree if district courts had free-ranging interpretive or enforcement authority untethered from the decree's negotiated terms?\"\n   <em>\n    Pigford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9418203,3699683\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/292/918/\">\n    292 F.3d at 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Third\n   </em>\n   , and finally, this case vividly illustrates the hazards of an uncabined conception of Rule 60(b) modification. The district court imposed brand new injunctive commands on governmental operations without any of the ordinary protections for such exceptional relief. The district court resolved factual disputes in the record against the District.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2016 Order\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355106\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/177/418/#p440\">\n    177 F.Supp.3d at 430, 441-443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court then imposed the burden on the District to\n   <em>\n    disprove\n   </em>\n   the existence of a problem in need of classwide structural relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 441-442. The court, in fact, acknowledged that, at the time of its new order, the District had made impressive progress in improving its systems and that there were \"zero individuals\" in the case-processing backlog.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 428. The district court nonetheless ruled that \"individual errors combine to form systemic problems.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 430.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Yet no such showing of a persisting structural breakdown was made on this record. The court made no factual finding of a pattern or high volume of eligibility or renewal delays. Instead, the district court faulted the District for not \"\n   <em>\n    entirely\n   </em>\n   remediat[ing]\" the problems arising from the transition to the Affordable Care Act.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (emphasis added). But a local government cannot be subjected to ongoing classwide structural relief simply because a problem has not been 100% eradicated.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lewis v.

Expansive, classwide structural relief that judicially superintends local government operations cannot issue based on a factual predicate consisting only of one-off errors that have, at best, a marginal connection to the only remaining executory portions of the Consent Decree. The burden was on the Plaintiffs to prove the existence of a continuing and widespread problem. By shoehorning the Plaintiffs' new injunction into a Rule 60(b) modification, the district court evaded that proof problem, finding it\n   sufficient to enter a sweeping injunction just because it had \"no assurance\" that already-solved problems \"w[ould] not arise again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 441.
