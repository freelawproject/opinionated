Appellants Automotive Industries Pension Trust\n   Fund (\"AIPTF\") and New England Teamsters &amp; Trucking Industry Pension Fund (together, the \"Funds\") are named plaintiffs in a putative class action alleging violations of the Exchange Act and the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act of Japan (\"JFIEA\") against Toshiba Corporation (\"Toshiba\") based on its now-admitted fraudulent accounting practices that caused hundreds of millions of dollars in loss to U.S. investors. The complaint alleges (1) violation of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 on behalf of American Depository Shares or Receipts (\"ADRs\") purchasers, (2) violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act on behalf of ADR purchasers, and (3) violation of JFIEA Article 21-2 on behalf of ADR purchasers and purchasers of Toshiba common stock. The district court dismissed the case with prejudice on the grounds that the over-the-counter market by which ADRs are sold was not a \"national exchange\" within the meaning of\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , and that there was not any domestic transaction between ADR purchasers and Toshiba. Having dismissed the Exchange Act claims, the district court dismissed the Japanese law claim under principles of comity and forum non conveniens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Thus, at the heart of this appeal is the question of the nature of ADRs and their transactions, and whether Toshiba ADRs are covered by the Exchange Act through either registry on a national exchange, or through domestic sales and purchases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the wake of Toshiba's admission of substantial institutional accounting fraud and accompanying restatements of pre-tax profits,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mark Stoyas filed this securities fraud class action on June 4, 2015, against Toshiba, its current chief executive officer, and its former chief executive officer based on his ownership of thirty-three Toshiba ADRs and a loss of $180.53. Later, AIPTF became lead plaintiff based on its purchase on March 23, 2015, of 36,000 Toshiba ADRs in the United States on an over-the-counter market run by OTC Markets Group and a loss of $196,913.47.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Funds filed the first amended complaint (\"FAC\") on December 17, 2015. The FAC added New England Teamsters &amp; Trucking Industry Pension Fund as a named plaintiff; unlike AIPTF, it had purchased 343,000 shares of Toshiba common stock on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The FAC alleges three class action claims for relief against Toshiba.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The first two claims are brought on behalf of a class of all persons who acquired Toshiba ADRs (\"ADR class\") between May 8, 2012, and\n   November 12, 2015 (\"Class Period\"). The first claim alleges violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .10b-5. Class members \"acquired\" Toshiba ADRs \"in reliance upon the truth and accuracy\" of Toshiba's fraudulent financial statements, paid artificially inflated prices, and suffered economic loss when the ADRs declined in value after the fraud was revealed and pre-tax profits were restated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The second claim alleges violation of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78t(a). Toshiba, despite having the ability to control its directors, officers, and managers, including twenty-four specific individuals, failed to prevent their fraudulent conduct or, alternatively, \"actively controlled and directed those actions so as to cause the violations\" of securities laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The third claim alleges violation of JFIEA Article 21-2. It is brought on behalf of both the ADR class and a class of \"all citizens and residents of the United States who otherwise acquired shares of Toshiba common stock during the Class Period.\" Appellants claim that \"Toshiba breached its duty to make a reasonable and diligent investigation of the statements\" in its financial reports and \"to ensure that the statements contained therein were truthful and accurate.\" The material false information and omissions artificially inflated the price of Toshiba common stock, and class members were harmed when the value of the stock declined due to the revelation of fraudulent accounting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The district court dismissed the FAC with prejudice on May 20, 2016. Applying\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   , the district court held that the over-the-counter market was not a \"stock exchange\" within the meaning of the Exchange Act, and that the FAC failed to allege Toshiba's involvement in the ADR transactions at issue, rendering Section 10(b) inapplicable. Having dismissed the Funds' Exchange Act claims, the district court dismissed the Japanese law claim on the basis of comity and forum non conveniens. Finding any amendment would be futile, the district court dismissed the case with prejudice. The Funds timely appeal. Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II. JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court had jurisdiction over the Exchange Act claims pursuant to Exchange Act Section 27(a), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa(a). The district court had jurisdiction over the JFIEA claim based on diversity jurisdiction, as Toshiba is a foreign corporation, as well as supplemental jurisdiction, because it arises from the same case or controversy as the Exchange Act claims.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), (d)(2) ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201367\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We have jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   to review the district court's order and final judgment dismissing the Funds' claims with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

However, the FAC omits basic details about ADRs. It also fails to include factual allegations regarding the over-the-counter market on which Toshiba ADRs are listed, whether Toshiba ADRs are sponsored, the depositary institutions that offer Toshiba ADRs, the Form F-6's they used to register the Toshiba ADRs, the trading volume of Toshiba ADRs, and the Toshiba ADRs' contractual terms (along with relevant variants between depositary institutions). And it lacks detail regarding AIPTF's purchase of the Toshiba ADRs, including how the purchase was made and which particular depositary institution holds the corresponding Toshiba common stock. Instead, the FAC erroneously ignores the distinction between ADRs and common stock, alleging simply that AIPTF \"acquired Toshiba common stock during the Class Period through the purchase on March 23, 2015 of 36,000 shares of [Toshiba ADRs] in the United States,\" that OTC Link is a \"highly efficient and automated market,\" and that \"shares of Toshiba common stock and [ADRs] are owned by hundreds of thousands of persons.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Second, before the district court and on appeal, the Funds argued that \"it is likely that Toshiba was indeed involved in the establishment\" of the ADRs. In support, the Funds rely on (1) a letter sent by Deutsche Bank (one of the Toshiba ADR depositary institutions) to the Securities and Exchange Commission during ADR rulemaking in 2008 stating that \"in practice, depositary banks typically obtain the issuer's consent before establishing an unsponsored ADR facility,\" 2008 SEC ADR Rulemaking at 52,762 n.113; (2) a Paul, Weiss memorandum about the 2008 rulemaking which states that depositary issuers of unsponsored ADRs \"typically request[ ] a letter of non-objection\" from the foreign company; and (3) the fact that Toshiba made it possible for depositary\n   institutions to issue unsponsored Toshiba ADRs by meeting the requirements in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"202\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20240\">\n    17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .12g3-2(b), including posting its annual report in English on its website and by not establishing a sponsored ADR (which would preclude unsponsored ADRs),\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   1991 SEC ADR Release at 24,422-23. However, none of these facts is alleged in the FAC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Third and finally, the FAC alleges that Bank of New York Mellon is one of Toshiba's largest ten shareholders and that during the Class Period institutional investors in the United States owned \"at least 485 million shares of Toshiba common stock, representing more than 11% of the Company's outstanding shares.\" Absent from the FAC, however, is the Funds' assertion at oral argument that Bank of New York Mellon is unlikely to have acquired over fifty million Toshiba shares without Toshiba's involvement.

CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   The district court misapplied\n   <em>\n    Morrison\n   </em>\n   . And, without significant analysis, it concluded that leave to amend would be futile. It therefore dismissed the Funds' case with prejudice. For the reasons discussed above, we believe the FAC does not sufficiently allege a domestic violation of the Exchange Act, but that allowing leave to amend would not be futile.
