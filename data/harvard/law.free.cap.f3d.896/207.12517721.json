We now must decide a related question that we anticipated, but did not resolve, in\n   <em>\n    Vanderklok\n   </em>\n   : whether TSA screeners are \"investigative or law enforcement officers\" under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   This question, one of first impression among the Courts of Appeals, arises because Appellant Nadine Pellegrino has asserted intentional tort claims against TSA screeners. Although under the FTCA the United States generally enjoys sovereign immunity for intentional torts committed by federal employees, this rule is subject to an exception known as the \"law enforcement proviso,\" which waives immunity for a subset of intentional torts committed by employees who qualify as \"investigative or law enforcement officers.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h).

Pellegrino's claims are therefore barred by the Government's sovereign immunity, and we will affirm the District Court's judgment dismissing this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Screening locations are thus staffed by both TSOs and law enforcement officers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2006, Pellegrino and her husband, Harry Waldman, arrived at the Philadelphia International Airport, where they planned to catch a flight home to Florida. Pellegrino brought three bags to the security checkpoint: a rolling tote, a larger rolling bag that would fit in the overhead compartment of the airplane, and a small black canvas bag. After Pellegrino passed through a metal detector, a TSO directed her to step aside for further screening. A few minutes later, TSO Thomas Clemmons arrived and began to search Pellegrino's bags, but because Pellegrino believed that Clemmons was treating neither her nor her bags respectfully, she asked for a private screening. According to Pellegrino, Clemmons then \"walked off with a very\n   arrogant, negative, hostile attitude,\" Pellegrino Dep. 85:24-86:2, D.Ct. Dkt. No. 156, and TSO Nuyriah Abdul-Malik came to perform the screening in Clemmons's stead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As Abdul-Malik prepared to search Pellegrino's bags, Pellegrino \"had the distinct feeling\" that Abdul-Malik's gloves were not clean and asked her to put on new ones. Pellegrino Dep. 90:18-22, D.Ct. Dkt. No. 156. Abdul-Malik did as Pellegrino asked, but Pellegrino asserts that this request engendered hostility from Abdul-Malik. Abdul-Malik and Pellegrino then proceeded to a private screening room, where they were joined by TSA employees Laura Labbee, a supervisory TSO, and Denise Kissinger, another TSO.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kissinger swabbed Pellegrino's shirt and left the room to test the sample (for the presence of explosives), while Abdul-Malik inspected Pellegrino's luggage. Pellegrino contends that Abdul-Malik's screening was unnecessarily rough and invasive-extending to her credit cards, coins, cell phone, and lipstick.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   At some point, Pellegrino asked Labbee why she was being subjected to this screening, and Labbee responded that it was an \"airline-designated search.\" Pellegrino Dep. 104:12, D.Ct. Dkt. No. 156. Pellegrino took this to mean that her airline ticket had been marked in a way that prompted the search, and because she and Waldman had accidentally switched tickets, she sought to stop the search by explaining that she believed that Waldman should have been searched instead. Nevertheless, the search continued, and Pellegrino told Labbee that she was going to report her to TSA authorities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Once Abdul-Malik finished searching the rolling tote, Pellegrino, who believed that Abdul-Malik had damaged her eyeglasses and jewelry, asked Abdul-Malik to leave her items outside the tote so that Pellegrino could re-pack it herself. Abdul-Malik refused and the interaction continued to deteriorate. First, Abdul-Malik had trouble zipping the tote closed and had to press her knee into it to force it shut. Next, when Pellegrino asked Labbee for permission to examine the tote, which she believed Abdul-Malik had damaged, that request was also denied. Pellegrino then told Labbee and Abdul-Malik they were \"behaving like bitches.\" Pellegrino Dep. 114:13-14, D.Ct. Dkt. No. 156. Finally, after Abdul-Malik had searched Pellegrino's largest bag, which contained clothes and shoes, and Kissinger finished swabbing and testing, Pellegrino was told that she could leave.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   But simple closure was not to be. Instead, Pellegrino saw that Abdul-Malik had not re-packed her shoes, asked if she intended to do so, and was told \"no.\" Pellegrino Dep. 122:2, D.Ct. Dkt. No. 156. At that point, intending to re-pack her bags outside of the screening room, Pellegrino tossed her shoes through the open door toward the screening lanes and began to carry her largest bag out of the room. In the process, according to Labbee and Kissinger, she struck Labbee in the stomach with the bottom of the bag. When Pellegrino then returned to the screening room for her smaller rolling tote, Abdul-Malik allegedly stood in her way, forcing her to crawl on the floor under a table to retrieve it. According to the TSOs, Pellegrino then struck Abdul-Malik in the leg with this bag as she was removing it. Although Pellegrino denied (and has consistently denied) that either bag touched either TSO, Labbee\n   and Abdul-Malik immediately went to the supervisor's station to press charges against Pellegrino.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Philadelphia police officers arrived at the scene a short time later, arrested Pellegrino, and took her to the police station, where she was held for about 18 hours before being released on bond. Eventually, the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office filed ten charges against Pellegrino: two counts each of felony aggravated assault,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa.

And because the trial judge had ruled that no witnesses could testify about events that took place outside of the private screening room in the absence of footage from video surveillance, Labbee-who was positioned partially outside the door of the screening room during the alleged assault-was precluded from testifying to those events. Without that testimony, the trial judge entered a verdict of not guilty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In July 2008, Pellegrino submitted a claim to the TSA concerning the TSOs' alleged misconduct and requesting damages of $951,200. The TSA denied the claim by letter almost a year later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

In addition, as to the individual defendants, they raised\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims for malicious and retaliatory prosecution, \"aiding and abetting\" malicious prosecution, and conspiracy to deprive civil rights, as well as a conspiracy claim under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201985\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3). As to the TSA alone, they raised claims for failing to investigate their civil rights complaint in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and failing to comply with requests for information under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and the Privacy Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In a series of orders, the District Court denied relief to Pellegrino on all claims with the exception of one FTCA property damage claim that the parties settled. In this appeal, we focus primarily on Pellegrino's FTCA claims for the intentional torts of false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The District Court granted summary judgment on those claims on the ground that TSA screeners are not covered by the FTCA's law enforcement proviso because they are not \"empowered by law to execute searches ... for violations of Federal law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Pellegrino v.

Because it found the language of the proviso ambiguous, the Court turned to legislative history. The Court observed that \"[a] review of the legislative history reveals that Congress, in response to 'no-knock' raids conducted by federal narcotic agents on the wrong dwellings, passed the 1974 amendment to the Federal Tort Claims Act to provide compensation for such victims.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Solomon v.

Moreover, Amicus argues, the definition's reference to \"any\" officer shows that Congress intended for the term to be construed broadly and that \"officer\" itself has a broad, elastic definition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amicus Br. at 22 (stating that \"officer\" is defined as \"[o]ne who is charged by a superior power (and particularly by government) with the power and duty of exercising certain functions\" (alteration in original) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary (4th ed. 1968))). Amicus relies, at bottom, on the following syllogism: (a) federal workers who are authorized to perform\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   type of search are \"investigative or law enforcement officers\"; (b) TSA screeners perform searches;\n   <em>\n    ergo\n   </em>\n   (c) TSA screeners are \"investigative or law enforcement officers.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The Government, meanwhile, argues that the law enforcement proviso is designed to cover only\n   <em>\n    traditional\n   </em>\n   investigative or law enforcement officers, i.e., those who possess criminal justice powers. The Government contends that TSA screeners have much more circumscribed powers-as opposed to, for instance, FBI or DEA agents-and therefore are not covered by the proviso.

(1973); H.R. 8245, 93d Cong. (1973); and H.R. 10439, 93d Cong. (1973)-with Members referring regularly to the other bills as each was debated. Two of the bills (S. 2558 and H.R. 10439) waived sovereign immunity for the specified intentional torts for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   federal employees. Only one-H.R. 8245-limited the waiver of immunity to \"investigative or law enforcement officers.\" H.R. 8245 was the bill eventually signed into law, codifying the law enforcement proviso in its present form.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Act of March 16, 1974, Pub.

First, Congress was spurred to action by two ill-conceived raids conducted by federal narcotics agents in Collinsville, Illinois. In these raids, the agents, acting without warrants, kicked in doors without warning, drew weapons, and terrorized the residents, only to determine later that they had entered the wrong houses. As one committee report stressed, \"[t]here is no effective legal remedy against the Federal Government for the actual physical damage, mu[ch] less the pain, suffering and humiliation to which the Collinsville families have been subjected.\" S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 2 (1973),\n   <em>\n    as reprinted in\n   </em>\n   1974 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2789, 2790. Members of Congress returned again and again to the problem of these \"no knock\" raids and the need to create a meaningful remedy for the victims.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 120 Cong. Rec. 5287 (1974) (statement of Rep. Wiggins) (\"I believe the Members ought to realize that this Senate amendment was an emotional response to the unfortunate Collinsville case ....\"). Thus, the driving concern behind the enactment of H.R. 8245 was the potential for abuse of the devastating powers wielded by criminal law enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Second, Members of Congress explicitly discussed the fact that H.R. 8245, unlike the other bills, would not cover federal employees who perform administrative searches. Some observed that H.R. 8245 \"only applies to law enforcement officers. It does not apply to any other Federal employees that might violate the rights of an individual.\" 120 Cong. Rec. 5287 (statements of Reps. Donohue and Wiggins). Others, urging passage of the bills that waived immunity for all federal employees, lamented that H.R. 8245, by limiting the waiver to \"investigative or law enforcement officers,\" would provide no remedy for assaults committed by those who perform only administrative searches:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   I can give you an illustration. We have Department of Agriculture investigators who go into look at books and records. We have Defense Department auditors to look at books and records. I can see where we can get in a dispute where records should be shown or not shown and a report shown by mistake and the contractor takes it away and says you shouldn't have seen that and some sort of assault occurs.

There are many jobs that have the word \"officer\" in the title, such as \"chief executive officer\" or \"title officer,\" but they unquestionably are not \"investigative or law enforcement officer\" positions. On the other hand, other jobs, like \"special agent\" or \"postal inspector,\" do not have the word \"officer\" in the title, but they nonetheless qualify as \"investigative or law enforcement officer\" positions. Indeed, Amicus's argument, if anything, cuts the other way, for as we noted previously, TSOs were originally called \"screeners,\" and their title was changed in 2005 merely as part of an effort to improve employee incentives and \"upward mobility opportunities within [the] profession.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, it appears that the title change and related adjustments were intended to \"give TSOs an opportunity to ... apply for DHS\n   <em>\n    law enforcement positions\n   </em>\n   \"-further undermining the notion that TSOs already constitute a species of law enforcement officer. U.S. Gov't Accountability Office, GAO-07-299,\n   <em>\n    Aviation Security\n   </em>\n   56 (2007) (emphasis added). Thus, neither the TSO title nor the badge (which TSOs apparently began wearing two years after the conduct at issue in this case,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Press Release, Transp. Sec.

If a TSO does discover such evidence, he or she is required to alert a supervisor or a law enforcement official. The TSO can \"request[ ]\" the individual to wait for law enforcement to arrive, but the individual is nevertheless \"free to leave the checkpoint once applicable screening requirements have been completed successfully.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.A(4). By contrast, \"TSA law enforcement officers,\" and only \"TSA law enforcement officers,\" may engage in law enforcement activities, including investigations,\n   detentions, and searches that \"are not limited to administrative or special needs searches.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Recognizing that TSA screeners conduct administrative, not criminal searches thus not only respects the distinction Congress has made between \"employees\" and \"law enforcement officers\" in the FTCA, it also reflects the different job responsibilities and training of TSA \"screeners\" and \"law enforcement officers\" prescribed by the ATSA and agency policy. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Vanderklok\n   </em>\n   , unlike criminal law enforcement officers, \"line TSA employees are not trained on issues of probable cause, reasonable suspicion, and other constitutional doctrines that govern law enforcement officers.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264018\" index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/868/189/\">\n    868 F.3d at 208\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Put differently, TSOs, like most administrative employees, do not receive training on the specific constitutional doctrines and legal standards relevant to assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, abuse of process, and malicious prosecution-the torts covered by the law enforcement proviso. And that follows logically from the fact that doctrines like probable cause, as we described in\n   <em>\n    Vanderklok\n   </em>\n   , while of central importance to criminal law enforcement officers, are largely irrelevant to a TSO's job. Acknowledging that TSOs are not law enforcement officers under the proviso has the added value of maintaining this practical coherence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Although all of these indicators-our case law, the TSA's governing statute, and agency policy and practice-confirm that TSOs conduct only routine administrative searches, the dissent argues that TSA screenings constitute \"searches for violations of federal law because they are directed to illegal and prohibited items on passenger aircraft.\" Dissent at 238. But the fact that screenings are searches for prohibited items only points up why they are not searches \"for violations of federal law\": Screenings are aimed at items that must be removed before boarding-not at particular individuals-and their purpose is \"an administrative purpose, namely, to prevent the carrying of weapons or explosives aboard aircraft, and thereby to prevent hijackings,\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And as we explained in\n   <em>\n    Hartwell\n   </em>\n   -specifically addressing TSA screenings-such screenings are required of \"every air passenger\" and are \"minimally intrusive,\" \"public,\" and \"well-tailored to protect personal privacy.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939851\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/174/#p178\">\n    436 F.3d at 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . These screenings, we emphasized, \"escalat[e] in invasiveness only after a lower level of screening disclose[s] a reason to conduct a more probing search,\" so that even screenings that escalate to a pat-down may be properly categorized by their character at the outset as a \"single search under the administrative search doctrine.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939851\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/174/#p178\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"939851\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/436/174/#p178\">\n    at 178, 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

TSOs-like meat inspectors, OSHA workers, and other personnel who are permitted to perform only administrative searches-fall into the latter category and thus do not qualify as \"investigative or law enforcement officers\" under the law enforcement proviso of the FTCA. Because the proviso does not apply, Pellegrino's intentional tort claims are barred by\n   \u00a7 2680(h) 's intentional tort exception, and the District Court correctly dismissed those claims based on the United States' sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   We recognize that our holding here, combined with our decision in\n   <em>\n    Vanderklok\n   </em>\n   , means that individuals harmed by the intentional torts of TSOs will have very limited legal redress.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we are sympathetic to the concerns this may raise as a matter of policy, particularly given the nature and frequency of TSOs' contact with the flying public.

For these reasons, Congress may well see fit to expand the proviso or otherwise legislate recourse for passengers who seek to assert intentional tort claims against TSOs. But such policy judgments, particularly as they relate to sovereign immunity and the public fisc, fall squarely in the realm of the legislative branch.

Pellegrino contends TSOs fit fully within its purview because they are legally empowered to conduct searches of all passengers and property before boarding commercial flights originating in the United States. Consequently, she argues her intentional-tort claims should proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Although there is scant textual basis for denying Pellegrino's claims, my colleagues hold that TSOs are immune from suit because they deem \u00a7 2680(h) 's waiver of immunity to include only criminal law enforcement officers. They equate airport screenings with routine administrative inspections, even though the former involve rigorous and thorough searches that often extend to an individual's physical person. Their opinion leaves several plaintiffs without a remedy, even if a TSO assaults them, wrongfully detains them, or fabricates criminal charges against them. I do not believe this is what Congress intended when it drafted \u00a7 2680(h) or pertinent Transportation Security Administration (\"TSA\") statutes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   While I agree with my colleagues' reasoning on other points, I do not agree that \u00a7 2680(h) solely refers to criminal law enforcement officers. Instead, it applies to \"any officer\" who has legal authority to \"execute searches ... for violations of Federal law.\" TSOs may by law execute\n   searches, as they must screen \"all passengers and property, including United States mail, cargo, carry-on and checked baggage, and other articles, that will be carried aboard a passenger aircraft operated by an air carrier or foreign air carrier in air transportation or intrastate air transportation.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"293\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Background Matters\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factual Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   For ease of reference, I restate the facts as I understand them. On July 29, 2006, Pellegrino and her husband Harry Waldman arrived at the Philadelphia International Airport to board a flight home to Florida. After she passed through the security checkpoint, Pellegrino was randomly selected for additional screening. TSO Thomas Clemmons began examining her bags, but she stopped him, demanding a private screening.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   TSA employees subsequently led her to a private screening room, where TSOs Nuyriah Abdul-Malik, Laura Labbee, and Denise Kissinger conducted the screening. Kissinger swabbed the front and back of Pellegrino's shirt, and Abdul-Malik screened her luggage. According to Pellegrino, Abdul-Malik's inspection was unduly rough because she allegedly counted Pellegrino's coins and currency, rifled through her papers, examined her cell phone data, read the front and back of her membership and credit cards, and opened and smelled her cosmetics, mints, and hand sanitizer. She claims Abdul-Malik did not close the lids to various containers the latter opened, causing the previously enclosed items to spill inside her bags and damage her property. Pellegrino further contends Abdul-Malik punched, jammed, and forced her belongings back into her luggage, damaging it, her jewelry, and her eyeglasses in the process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   At that point in the search, Pellegrino informed Labbee, the supervisor at the checkpoint, that she intended to report the TSOs' conduct to TSA superiors. After Abdul-Malik had forcibly closed her luggage, Pellegrino also demanded to know \"what is going on here[;] both of you are behaving like bitches.\" In response to Pellegrino's comments, Abdul-Malik asked Labbee to call the police, but the TSOs did not summon law enforcement to arrest Pellegrino at that time. Instead, they continued searching her luggage. Kissinger swabbed various shoes and clothing in Pellegrino's bag, and Abdul-Malik searched the contents of the bag. After they finished, Kissinger and Abdul-Malik told Pellegrino that the search was over and that she could leave the private screening room. She proceeded to move her belongings to a search table outside of the private screening room. She first tossed her shoes from the doorway of the screening room onto the floor of the security checkpoint\n   area after checking that no one else was in her surroundings. She also made multiple trips from the private screening room to the search table because she had three pieces of luggage. On her first trip, she carried her largest bag out of the private screening room. Labbee contends Pellegrino struck her in the stomach with the bottom of the bag as she was moving the bag to the search table. When Pellegrino returned to retrieve a smaller bag, Abdul-Malik allegedly blocked her access to it, forcing her to crawl under a table to retrieve the bag. When Pellegrino did so, it tipped over, striking the ground with a loud noise. Abdul-Malik claims Pellegrino struck her in the leg while she was collecting the bag. She denies striking either Abdul-Malik or Labbee with her luggage and alleges she heard both TSOs say to each other, \"You saw her hit me, didn't you?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   After Pellegrino had retrieved her luggage, Labbee and Abdul-Malik walked to the supervisor's station to press charges against her and to summon local police. Labbee directed Pellegrino to stay at the security checkpoint until the police arrived. Although Pellegrino requested that the TSA official in charge of the airport be called to the checkpoint, her request went unheeded.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   When the police arrived, Pellegrino was frisked, handcuffed, and arrested. Labbee confiscated her driver's license and, along with Abdul-Malik, swore out criminal complaints against her. Kissinger offered a witness statement corroborating the allegation that Pellegrino struck Labbee in the leg with her bag. The police escorted Pellegrino out of the airport in plain view of other passengers. She was held for roughly 18 hours and released after her husband posted approximately $400 in bail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The police incident report stated Pellegrino struck both Labbee and Abdul-Malik with her bags and shoes that she tossed out of the private screening room. It also noted both TSOs suffered from leg pain and a stomach bruise as a result of Pellegrino's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Did things calm down? Hardly. The Philadelphia District Attorney's Office charged Pellegrino with ten criminal violations: two counts of felony aggravated assault,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"299\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20Pa.%20Cons.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%202702\">\n    18 Pa.

(Someone must have taken creative charging and aced the test; either that or there was a lot of lawyer-lounge temporizing.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   On October 25, 2006, Pellegrino attended a preliminary hearing in her criminal case. The presiding judge dismissed several charges, and the District Attorney abandoned other charges, with the exception of two counts of simple assault and two counts of possession of an instrument of a crime (the suitcases allegedly used to hit the TSOs). Those remaining charges proceeded to trial on March 28, 2008, in Philadelphia Municipal Court. The judge entered not guilty verdicts as to each charge based on insufficiency of the evidence put in by the TSA: it failed to produce video surveillance recordings of the incident;\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Abdul-Malik failed to appear in court; and Labbee's testimony was internally inconsistent and contradictory on key points.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   After criminal proceedings concluded, Pellegrino submitted a claim to the TSA describing the TSOs' conduct during and following the July 29th incident at the airport. The TSA denied the claim, and Pellegrino turned to federal court for relief. She alleged numerous constitutional and statutory violations against the TSA, Abdul-Malik, Labbee, Kissinger, and other unnamed TSOs. The District Court dismissed most of her claims except for property damage, false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution under the Federal Tort Claims Act and her\n   <em>\n    Bivens\n   </em>\n   claims for malicious prosecution under the First and Fourth Amendments. During summary judgment, the Court ruled in favor of the TSA on all of her remaining claims except for the property damage claim, which the parties later settled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Although Pellegrino appeals the District Court's rulings on all of her claims, I focus on those for false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution under the Federal Tort Claims Act. The Court held it lacked jurisdiction over those claims because they do not fall within \u00a7 2680(h) 's proviso, which waives sovereign immunity for certain intentional torts committed by investigative or law enforcement officers. Although the proviso defines \"investigative or law enforcement officer\" as \"any officer of the United States who is empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"304\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h), the District Court stated the phrase \"searches ... for violations of Federal law\" was \"ambiguous,\"\n   <em>\n    Pellegrino v.

In its view, \u00a7 2680(h) 's legislative history \"strongly suggests that the ... proviso was enacted as a response to specific eg[ ]regious behavior during raids conducted by federal law enforcement officers ... and was not intended to be expansive enough to cover airport security screeners.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *7.

The Government responds that the proviso encompasses only those who exercise traditional law enforcement functions.

Indeed, Pellegrino uses this point to argue that TSA screenings are \"searches ... for violations of Federal law\" under \u00a7 2680(h). In view of this argument, my colleagues characterize her position as extending to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   administrative searches.

Instead of directing her arguments to all administrative searches, Pellegrino asks us to resolve whether TSOs are investigative or law enforcement officers under \u00a7 2680(h). She notes that TSA screenings are more expansive than traditional administrative inspections, as they extend to the general public and often involve searches of an individual's physical person.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Suppl.

Under a reasonable reading of our case law and the pertinent regulations, TSA screenings are not consensual searches. It follows that \"consent\" is not an adequate basis for concluding TSA screenings fall outside the proviso in \u00a7 2680(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Similarly, the limited nature of TSA screenings does not put them outside the ambit of the proviso. To start, its plain language does not require searches to be limited or broad in nature. Its words also do not require searches to be directed to all violations of federal law or to traditional law enforcement functions. They simply require investigative or law enforcement officers to \"execute searches ... for violations of federal law.\" TSO screenings are searches for violations of federal law because they are directed to illegal and prohibited items on passenger aircraft.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"332\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2046505\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 46505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (providing criminal penalties for \"[c]arrying a weapon or explosive on an aircraft\");\n   <extracted-citation index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20172.101\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 172.101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 175.10(a) (listing \"hazardous materials\" that are not permitted on flights).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hence the limited nature of TSA's screenings is not sufficient to exclude them from the scope of \u00a7 2680(h) 's carve-out from immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Finally, while the proviso provides no definition for the term \"search,\" the lack of statutory guidance does not weigh in the Government's favor. In\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Pellegrino brings us an issue of first impression. She asks if she can recover against the TSOs who detained her and ordered her arrest at Philadelphia International Airport. Her specific claims-false arrest, false imprisonment, and malicious prosecution-fall within the Federal Tort Claims Act. While it ordinarily bars intentional tort claims against Government officials, it contains a proviso that would allow her claims to go forward if TSOs are \"investigative or law enforcement officers.\" They are so if they are \"officer[s] of the United States ... empowered by law to execute searches, to seize evidence, or to make arrests for violations of Federal law.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"614\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202680\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2680\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h). TSOs fit this definition because they conduct searches,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"615\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201546.207\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1546.207\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), and have the legal authority to do so,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"616\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2044901\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 44901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Thus they fall within the ambit of the proviso, and Pellegrino's claims should proceed to trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Yet my colleagues hold that they are not covered. They look to other statutes for clarification, consult various canons of construction, and also examine legislative history. Ultimately they conclude \u00a7 2680(h) covers only criminal law enforcement officers. In doing so, they depart from other Circuits' interpretation of the proviso.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bunch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266228\" index=\"619\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/938/#p943\">\n    880 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   943-45 ;\n   <em>\n    Sami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3786844,1386654\" index=\"620\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/617/755/\">\n    617 F.2d at 764-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Their decision insulates TSOs from all intentional tort claims, leaving plaintiffs without a civil remedy. Absent congressional action, they cannot recover if a TSO assaults them, unlawfully detains them, or unlawfully lodges a criminal complaint against them. All of this is because my colleagues look through a lens that legislates \"criminal\" into a provision it nowhere appears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   This is not what Congress intended, as it enacted \u00a7 2680(h) to serve as a broad remedy against tortious conduct.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   S. Rep. No. 93-588, at 2791 (1973) (noting the provision \"would submit the Government to liability whenever its agents act under color of law so as to injure the public through search and seizures that are conducted without warrants\"). It also ignores Congress's definition of \"investigative or law enforcement officer,\" which we must apply \"even if it varies from that term's ordinary\n   meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    Stenberg\n   </em>\n   , 530 U.S. at 942,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"623\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p942\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   In view of these principles, I disagree with my colleagues' reasoning. Instead of relying on non-textual sources, we must apply \u00a7 2680(h) 's plain language; other statutes, the canons, and legislative history (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , authorities outside of the proviso) cannot defeat its words. Because the text tells the tale, I part with today's holding. I conclude that TSOs are investigative or law enforcement officers under \u00a7 2680(h) and that TSA searches do not evade its reach. In line with my conclusion, Pellegrino (and similarly situated plaintiffs) are entitled to their day in court. I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-303\">\n    While the relevant TSA official was notified that Pellegrino wished to speak with him, neither he nor his representative arrived at the checkpoint to speak with Pellegrino or her husband.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-304\">\n    On August 14, 2006, Pellegrino received a letter from the TSA indicating it was considering imposing a civil penalty for her actions during the July 29th incident at the airport. The TSA's letter also stated it had begun a Civil Action Enforcement investigation of the incident.
