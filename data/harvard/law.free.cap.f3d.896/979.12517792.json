We further hold that California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) is categorically a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, as interpreted by the BIA. Finally, we hold that the BIA's interpretation applies retroactively to Martinez-Cedillo's conviction. Accordingly, we deny the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Marcelo Martinez-Cedillo is a citizen of Mexico and, since 2005, has been a lawful permanent resident of the United States. In August 2008, he was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (\"DUI\") with two prior DUI convictions. At the time of his final DUI, he had a child in his car who was not wearing a seatbelt. For this reason, he was also convicted of felony child endangerment under California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings on the grounds that Martinez-Cedillo's conviction under California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) was a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i). An Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") entered a final order of removal, which Martinez-Cedillo appealed to the BIA, arguing that (1) California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) is not a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and (2) he should be allowed to apply for cancellation of removal under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The BIA affirmed in part and remanded in part. The BIA held that California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) was categorically a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment under its prior interpretation of that phrase in two precedential opinions:\n   <em>\n    Matter of Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2008), and\n   <em>\n    Matter of Soram\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. 378\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2010). Nevertheless, the BIA remanded for the IJ to consider Martinez-Cedillo's eligibility for cancellation of removal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On remand, Martinez-Cedillo initially requested cancellation of removal but later conceded that recent authority defeated his request. He then, for the first time, moved for a continuance of removal proceedings based on a pending visa petition his father had submitted on his behalf. The IJ denied his motion for a continuance and again entered a final order of removal. Martinez-Cedillo appealed to the BIA a second time, and this time, the BIA affirmed in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Martinez-Cedillo now petitions our court for review, arguing that (1) the BIA's interpretation of a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment to encompass criminally negligent acts that do not result in actual injury to a child is unreasonable; (2) California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) is not categorically a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment even under the BIA's interpretation; (3) the BIA's interpretation should not apply retroactively to his 2008 conviction; and (4) denial of his motion for a continuance was an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We first review the history of the BIA's interpretation of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), and then address each of Martinez-Cedillo's arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   II. THE BIA'S INTERPRETATION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In 1996, Congress enacted the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), which added \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) to the INA and made \"a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment\" a deportable offense. Two years later, the BIA made a passing reference\n   to \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez-Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20991\">\n    22 I. &amp; N. Dec. 991\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 1999). At issue in that case was\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201101\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(43)(a), which makes \"sexual abuse of a minor\" an \"aggravated felony\" for purposes of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(iii). The BIA held that Texas's offense of indecency with a child was \"sexual abuse of a minor\" and thus an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), even though the Texas statute did not require physical contact with a child. The BIA reasoned that the term \"sexual abuse of a minor,\" like the term \"child abuse\" in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i), could refer to conduct that did not involve physical contact:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   We note that in including child abuse as a ground of removal in section 237(a)(2)(E)(i) of the Act, Congress likewise did not refer to a particular statutory definition, although in the same section it did designate a statutory definition for the term \"crime of domestic violence.\" By its common usage, \"child abuse\" encompasses actions or inactions that also do not require physical contact. See [\n   <em>\n    Child Abuse\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (6th ed. 1990) ] (defining child abuse as \"(a)ny form of cruelty to a child's physical, moral or mental well-being\").\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    at 996\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   's passing reference to child abuse was dictum and did not purport to offer a precedential interpretation of what constitutes a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For several years following\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , the BIA never interpreted the phrase \"a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment\" in a precedential opinion, and its unpublished decisions on the subject were equivocal. Some unpublished decisions during this period stated that \"child abuse\" means \"the physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent treatment of a child.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Palfi\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%201167145\">\n    2004 WL 1167145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Baez-Cazarez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2004%20WL%202952229\">\n    2004 WL 2952229\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2004). Other unpublished decisions hewed to the\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   definition of \"child abuse\" as \"any form of cruelty to a child's physical, moral or mental well-being.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Pacheco Fregozo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20698590\">\n    2005 WL 698590\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Maltez-Salazar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20952489\">\n    2005 WL 952489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2005) ;\n   <em>\n    In re Manzano-Hernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%20698392\">\n    2005 WL 698392\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (BIA 2005). In short, the BIA's interpretation of a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment was unclear at this time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Herrera\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In 2006, we considered the BIA's holding that a conviction for assaulting a child under Washington's fourth-degree assault statute was a crime of child abuse.\n   <em>\n    Velazquez-Herrera v. Gonzales\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775955\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/781/\">\n    466 F.3d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2006). We recognized that the BIA had previously used at least two definitions of \"child abuse,\" which were \"not entirely consistent\" with each other.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775955\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/781/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775955\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/781/\">\n    at 783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We held that the \"cruelty\" definition cited in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   's dictum was not \"a statutory interpretation that carries the 'force of law' \" and accordingly remanded \"to allow the BIA in the first instance to settle upon a definition of child abuse in a precedential opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775955\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/781/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3775955\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/466/781/\">\n    at 782-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The BIA followed our instructions and, in May 2008, issued its first precedential\n   interpretation of what constitutes a crime of child abuse.\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The BIA reasoned that, although \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) defined \"a crime of domestic violence,\" \"other operative terms, including 'crime of child abuse,' were left undefined, triggering the negative inference that Congress deliberately left them open to interpretation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    at 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The BIA further observed that, \"[i]n view of the fact that [ \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) ] is the product of a significant expansion of the grounds of deportability and was aimed at facilitating the removal of child abusers in particular,\" Congress intended a crime of child abuse to be interpreted \"broadly in this context.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    at 509\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The BIA considered various federal statutes defining \"child abuse\" and related concepts as of the date Congress enacted IIRIRA and found that \"the weight of Federal authority ... reflected an understanding that 'child abuse' encompassed the physical and mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, maltreatment, and negligent or neglectful treatment of a child.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The BIA also considered state criminal and civil statutes, concluding that \"there was a growing acceptance by 1996 that the concept of 'child abuse' included not just intentional infliction of physical injury, but also acts of sexual abuse or exploitation, criminally negligent acts, or acts causing mental or emotional harm.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Finally, the BIA noted that the most recent edition of\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary-\n   </em>\n   as opposed to the prior edition cited in\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   -defined \"child abuse\" as \"[i]ntentional or neglectful physical or emotional harm inflicted on a child, including sexual molestation.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Abuse\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (8th ed. 2004) ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Based on these considerations, the BIA \"interpret[ed] the term 'crime of child abuse' broadly to mean any offense involving an intentional, knowing, reckless, or criminally negligent act or omission that constitutes maltreatment of a child or that impairs a child's physical or mental well-being, including sexual abuse or exploitation.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    at 512\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Significantly, however, the BIA did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   address whether a crime of child abuse required actual injury to a child. A concurring opinion noted this very fact: \"It should be noted that, broad though the definition is, it is unclear whether it extends to crimes in which a child is merely placed or allowed to remain in a dangerous situation, without any element in the statute requiring ensuing harm, e.g., a general child endangerment statute, or selling liquor to an underage minor, or failing to secure a child with a seatbelt.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 518 n.2 (Pauley, concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Pacheco Fregozo\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We had our first opportunity to address\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   's definition of a crime of child abuse in\n   <em>\n    Pacheco Fregozo v.

That the BIA's interpretation does not require intentional or actual injury to a child-the critical distinctions in this case-would perhaps be troubling if the BIA were only interpreting the term \"child abuse,\" but the term \"child neglect\" surely admits of such conduct.\n   <em>\n    See Neglect\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014) (defining \"child neglect\" as \"[t]he failure of a person responsible for a minor to care for the minor's emotional or physical needs;\" and defining \"willful neglect\" as \"intentional or reckless failure to carry out a legal duty, esp. in caring for a child\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Even as we agree with the Second Circuit, we decline to follow the Tenth Circuit's reasoning because we find it flawed. First, there is no inherent problem in the BIA relying partly on civil statutes to understand the phrase \"a crime of child abuse, child neglect, or child abandonment.\" It would be unreasonable for the\n   BIA to interpret that phrase, which refers to one who is \"convicted of a crime,\" to cover a purely civil action, such as child neglect proceedings brought by a state's child protective services. We thus agree with the dissent that it would be improper for the BIA to use \"a civil definition for a crime.\" Dissenting Op. at 1003;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725698\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/903/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725698\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/903/\">\n    at 999, 1002-03\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But that is not what the BIA did. Rather, the BIA used civil definitions to inform its understanding of which\n   <em>\n    convictions\n   </em>\n   are crimes of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and that is not unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   A phrase such as \"child neglect\" surely can serve both civil and criminal purposes, and there is nothing unreasonable in trying to find a definition that would serve both simultaneously. That the BIA looked to civil definitions of abuse and neglect does not detract from the fact that an alien's deportability depends on having been convicted of a crime. The only question is what crimes constitute child abuse, neglect, or abandonment, and for that the BIA was well within reason to look to civil definitions. In fact, civil law makes a particularly apt comparison here: parental rights adjudicated in civil child neglect proceedings implicate serious due process concerns, and courts have sometimes referred to terminating parental rights as a \"civil death penalty,\"\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re K.A.W\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9255279\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/1/#p12\">\n    133 S.W.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 12 (Mo. 2004) ;\n   <em>\n    In re K.D.L.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9220262\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/737/\">\n    118 Nev. 737\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9220262\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nev/118/737/\">\n    58 P.3d 181\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 186 (2002), and have required the state to satisfy a heightened burden of proof before terminating those rights,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    In re E.A.F.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6954357\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/424/742/#p746\">\n    424 S.W.3d 742\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 746 (Tex.

That is one reasonable aid to interpreting statutes, but it is not the only reasonable method for doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Contrary to the Tenth Circuit's argument, the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   has no bearing on this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ibarra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725698\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/903/\">\n    736 F.3d at 913\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   instructs courts to find that 'generally accepted contemporary meaning' by looking to 'the\n   criminal codes of most States.' \"). In\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   , the Court interpreted the word \"burglary\" in a federal sentence enhancement statute and determined \"that Congress meant by 'burglary' the generic sense in which the term is now used in the criminal codes of most States.\" 495 U.S. at 598,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"634101\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/495/575/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Court was not, however, reviewing an agency's interpretation of an ambiguous statute and did not purport to offer any guidance to lower courts employing\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   's two-step framework. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   requires that the BIA conduct a fifty-state survey and agree with the majority approach among the states every time it interprets an ambiguous generic offense in the INA. And recently the Court has referred to this methodology as an \"aid [to] our interpretation ... offering useful context.\"\n   <em>\n    Esquivel-Quintana\n   </em>\n   , 137 S.Ct. at 1571 n.3. The BIA's statutory construction is not constrained to a mere head-counting exercise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    Taylor\n   </em>\n   's methodology worked in context: \"burglary\" is a well-recognized legal term in the common law, the MPC, and state law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, child abuse, neglect, and abandonment are not common law crimes; they are twentieth-century crimes. According to\n   <em>\n    Black's Law Dictionary\n   </em>\n   , the first prosecution for child abuse was in 1874, when \"[a]n eight-year-old girl named Mary Ellen was found to have been severely abused. Her abusers were prosecuted under the law for prevention of cruelty to animals\n   <em>\n    since no law protecting children then existed\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Abuse\n   </em>\n   , BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY (10th ed. 2014) (emphasis added). Similarly, the MPC offers virtually no clue to the terms in \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MPC \u00a7 230.4 (Endangering Welfare of Children). The notes to the MPC explain: \"The crimes of endangering the welfare of children and persistent nonsupport represent substantial modification and consolidation of offenses that were\n   <em>\n    variously treated\n   </em>\n   in prior law and that have also received\n   <em>\n    widely differing treatment\n   </em>\n   in recent revisions.\" MPC Pt. II, Art. 230, Refs. &amp; Annos. (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Moreover, states have developed different and varied terms in this area, thus complicating Congress's task in describing what crimes involving children count as crimes of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment. Indeed, it seems that Congress purposefully employed the overlapping concepts of child abuse, neglect, and abandonment to denote a broad array of crimes. As a BIA member's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   noted, \"crimes of child neglect or abandonment are a subset of 'child abuse' and, although technically redundant, were likely\n   <em>\n    inserted by Congress to assure coverage of such crimes, however denominated by the State\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=24%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20503\">\n    24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 519\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pauley, concurring)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   (emphasis added). In short, the lack of a common source for the terms and the varied ways in which states have addressed the problem of child abuse-however it is denominated-only reinforces the ambiguity in what constitutes a crime of child abuse, neglect, or abandonment. It is precisely because of that ambiguity that we must proceed to\n   <em>\n    Chevron\n   </em>\n   step two, where there is no single methodology for resolving ambiguity in a statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Third, the Tenth Circuit's ambitious, fifty-state survey was itself problematic. The court categorized state laws according to the minimum mens rea they required for conviction of a crime not resulting in injury to a child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   It found twenty-seven jurisdictions requiring \"a minimum\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of knowingness or intent for crimes not appearing to require a resulting injury to the child;\" six requiring \"a minimum\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   of criminal negligence for crimes not requiring a resultant injury;\" eleven requiring \"criminal negligence\" or something less for crimes not a resultant injury; and five that had no clear standard.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 915, 918-21. The court concluded that, because \"a clear majority of states did not criminalize such conduct when it was committed with only criminal negligence and resulted in no injury,\" the BIA's construction of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) fell \"outside the interpretive 'gap' left by Congress.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 918.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Tenth Circuit's methodology fails even under its own rules, and we need look no further than the California statute at issue here. According to the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 273a(a)\"required a minimum mens rea of knowingness or intent for crimes not appearing to require a resulting injury to the child.\"\n   <em>\n    Ibarra\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3725698\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/736/903/\">\n    736 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Tenth Circuit therefore included California in its \"majority\" of states that supposedly contradicted the BIA's interpretation. According to the California Supreme Court, however, California Penal Code \u00a7 273a(a) requires only a minimum mens rea of \"criminal negligence.\"\n   <em>\n    People v. Valdez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1103397\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/27/778/\">\n    27 Cal.4th 778\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%203\">\n    118 Cal.Rptr.2d 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20P.3d%20511\">\n    42 P.3d 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 517 (2002) (\"[F]or 25 years, the lower courts have identified criminal negligence as the relevant standard of culpability for section 273a..., and this court has applied that same standard.\"). The Tenth Circuit's mistake in this regard reinforces that a fifty-state survey-particularly one of difficult to discern mens rea categories-is not the only reasonable way to interpret the INA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Fourth, an agency need not give an answer to every conceivable question in one decision. The BIA noted in\n   <em>\n    Soram\n   </em>\n   that different state statutes employ different language regarding their requisite level of risk and that even similar statutes have been interpreted differently by various state courts.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    25 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 382-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Further, the BIA held that the risk of injury to a child must be sufficiently great, and it carefully explained why the Colorado statute at issue met that requirement.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    at 383-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It was reasonable for the BIA to decline to analyze all at once \"whether the myriad State formulations of endangerment-type child abuse offenses come within the ambit of 'child abuse' under\n   ... the Act.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20I.%20%26%20N.%20Dec.%20378\">\n    at 383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, the Tenth Circuit's flawed fifty-state survey shows the danger of a contrary approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Finally, this is not a case of the BIA changing positions without explaining its rationale for doing so. For one, the BIA did not change its position:\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   's brief discussion of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) was dictum;\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   gave the first precedential interpretation of \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(E)(i) but left the issue of actual injury undecided; and\n   <em>\n    Soram\n   </em>\n   merely filled the gap that\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   left open. The dissent's strained reading of\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Velazquez\n   </em>\n   tries to hold the BIA to an interpretation that was never in fact the agency's position.
