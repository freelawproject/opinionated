He twice in 2011 applied for a license to carry a handgun, either concealed or openly. His application was denied each time by the County of Hawaii's Chief of Police, Harry Kubojiri, because Young failed to satisfy the requirements set forth in section 134-9 of the Hawaii Revised Statutes (\"H.R.S.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Section 134-9 acts as a limited exception to the State of Hawaii's \"Place[s] to Keep\" statutes, which generally require that gun owners keep their firearms at their \"place of business, residence, or sojourn.\" H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 134-23, 134-24, 134-25. The exception allows citizens to obtain a license to carry a loaded handgun in public, either concealed or openly, under certain circumstances. H.R.S. \u00a7 134-9. Respecting concealed carry, section 134-9 provides that \"[i]n an exceptional case, when an applicant shows reason to fear injury to the applicant's person or property, the chief of police ... may grant a license to an applicant ... to carry a pistol or revolver and ammunition therefor concealed on the person.\" The chief of police may, under section 134-9, grant a license for the open carry of a loaded handgun only \"[w]here the urgency or the need has been sufficiently indicated\" and the applicant \"is engaged in the protection of life and property.\" The County of Hawaii has promulgated regulations to clarify that open carry is proper only when the license-holder is \"in the actual performance of his duties or within the area of his assignment.\" Police Dep't of Cty. of Haw.,\n   <em>\n    Rules and Regulations Governing the Issuance of Licenses\n   </em>\n   10 (Oct. 22, 1997).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Absent a license under section 134-9, a person may only transport an unloaded firearm, in an enclosed container, to and from a place of repair, a target range, a licensed dealer, a firearms exhibit, a hunting ground, or a police station, H.R.S. \u00a7\u00a7 134-23, 134-24, 134-25, 134-26, 134-27, and may only use those firearms while \"actually engaged\" in hunting or target shooting, H.R.S. \u00a7 134-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On June 12, 2012, Young filed this suit\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against the State of Hawaii, its then-Governor, Neil Abercrombie, and its then-Attorney General, David Louie (collectively \"the State\"), as well as the County of Hawaii, its then-Mayor, William Kenoi, the Hilo County Police Department, and its then-Chief of Police, Harry Kubojiri (collectively \"the County\"). Primarily alleging that denying his application for a handgun license violates his Second Amendment right to carry a loaded firearm in public for self-defense, Young requested, among other things, injunctive and declaratory relief from the enforcement of section 134-9's licensing requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The State filed a motion to dismiss Young's claims under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6), and the County filed a motion to dismiss the claims under Rule 12(b)(6). The district court granted both. As for the State of Hawaii, the district court found Young's action to be barred by sovereign immunity.

As the court reasoned, the State's \"substantial interest in safeguarding the public from the inherent dangers of firearms\" was reasonably furthered by policies that \"enable[ ] officials to effectively differentiate between individuals who need to carry a gun for self-defense and those who do not.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Young timely appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Young's argument is straightforward: he asserts that the County has violated the Second Amendment by enforcing against him the State's limitations in section 134-9 on the open carry of firearms to those \"engaged in the protection of life and property\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and on the concealed carry of firearms\n   to those who can demonstrate an \"exceptional case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   1\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The County and the State respond that Young's claim is foreclosed by our en banc decision in\n   <em>\n    Peruta v.

Rejecting Peruta's challenge, our en banc court held that \"the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms does not include,\n   <em>\n    in any degree\n   </em>\n   , the right of a member of the general public to carry concealed firearms in public.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/\">\n    at 939\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). But, as even the dissent acknowledges, our court explicitly left unresolved the question of whether the Second Amendment encompasses a right to open carry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . (\"There may or may not be a Second Amendment right for a member of the general public to carry a firearm openly in public. The Supreme Court has not answered that question, and we do not answer it here.\"). Young's claim therefore picks up where Peruta's left off and presents an issue of first impression for this circuit: whether the Second Amendment encompasses a right to carry firearms openly in public for self-defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Our interpretation of the Second Amendment is guided by the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    District of Columbia v.

In\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   , the Court invalidated a District of Columbia ban on handgun possession in the home, holding that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right to keep a handgun in one's home for self-defense, and rejecting a collective view of the right.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. at 635\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The dissent says we have yet to consider the impact of historical \"good cause\" restrictions on the scope of the Second Amendment right to carry a firearm in public. According to the dissent, many states heavily restricted the public carry of weapons absent good cause to fear injury to person or property. Dissent at 1077-79. A review of the dissent's evidence compels us to disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Many states during the nineteenth century required people who carried weapons in a disruptive fashion to post a bond (or a \"surety\") to ensure their good behavior.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    The Revised Statutes of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\n   </em>\n   750 \u00a7 16 (Boston, Theron Metcalf &amp; Horace Mann 1836) (hereinafter Mass. Acts). And to enforce the surety requirement, such states commonly relied on a citizen-complaint mechanism. That is, if an arms carrier gave any observer \"reasonable cause to fear an injury, or breach of the peace,\" the observer could complain to his local magistrate, who might then require the disruptive carrier \"to find sureties for keeping the peace,\" generally \"for a term not exceeding six months.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But if the disruptive carrier\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   had \"reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury,\" such person could be excused from posting sureties despite the complaint.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As an example of the pieces put together, Michigan's 1846 surety law provided that if any person went armed with an \"offensive and dangerous weapon, without reasonable cause to fear an assault or other injury ... he may, on complaint of any person having reasonable cause to fear an injury or breach of the peace, be required to find sureties for keeping the peace.\"\n   <em>\n    The Revised Statutes of the State of Michigan\n   </em>\n   692 \u00a7 16 (Detroit, Sanford M. Green 1846).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The dissent erroneously characterizes surety laws as imposing a severe restriction on the public carry of weapons absent good cause to fear injury. And its analysis of the actual historical evidence is, in a word, cursory. While the dissent focuses on the exception to the surety requirement for carriers with a specialized need for self-defense, it ignores the clearly limited scope of the requirement in the first place: only upon a well-founded complaint that\n   the carrier threatened \"injury or a breach of the peace\" did the good cause exception come into play, \"by exempting even the accused\" from the burden of paying sureties.\n   <em>\n    Wrenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275844\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/650/#p665\">\n    864 F.3d at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The dissent might wish to set aside the requirements to complain under surety laws, but we suspect those who actually did complain under such laws would hesitate before treating the requirements so lightly. Were a complainant to bring an \"unfounded, frivolous or malicious\" claim that an arms carrier threatened the public peace, the magistrate would not only dismiss the complaint, but also hold the complainant \"answerable to the magistrate and the officer for their fees.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1836%20Mass.%20Acts%20749\">\n    1836 Mass.

Exploring fourteenth century English law books (after a thorough dusting) reveals that the statute allowed no ordinary Englishman to \"bring ... force in affray of the peace, nor to go nor ride armed by night nor by day, in Fairs, Markets, nor in the presence of the Justices or other Ministers, nor in no part elsewhere.\" Statute of Northampton 1328,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2%20Edw.%20Ch.%203\">\n    2 Edw. 3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , c. 3 (Eng.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the statute's effects did not remain in the fourteenth century, as it \"would become the foundation for firearms regulation in England for the next several centuries.\"\n   <em>\n    Peruta II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/\">\n    824 F.3d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In the immediate period after Parliament enacted the statute, it appears that some English constables were ordered to enforce the statute literally and to arrest all those who dared to \"go armed,\" without regard for the bearer's apparent peacefulness.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter to the Mayor and Bailiffs of York (Jan. 30, 1334),\n   <em>\n    in Calendar of the Close Rolls\n   </em>\n   , Edward III, 1333-1337 294 (H.C.

And over the next few centuries, a narrow interpretation of the statute-like that given to Northumberland constables in 1332-began to dominate the English legal landscape. Writing almost 300 years after the statute was enacted, Serjeant William Hawkins, an English legal commentator praised by Blackstone, explained that \"no wearing of Arms is within the meaning of this Statute, unless it be accompanied with such Circumstances as are apt to terrify the People; from whence it seems clearly to follow, That Persons of Quality are in no Danger of Offending against this Statute by wearing common Weapons.\" 1 William Hawkins,\n   <em>\n    A Treatise of the Pleas of the Crown\n   </em>\n   136 \u00a7 9 (1716).\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Hawkins's narrow interpretation of the statute was in accord with that of the Court of King's Bench, which clarified that \"the meaning of the [Statute of Northampton] was to punish people who go armed\n   <em>\n    to terrify the King's subjects\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Sir John Knight's Case\n   </em>\n   , 87 Eng.

Indeed, there is a scholarly consensus that the 1689 English right to have arms was\n   <em>\n    less protective\n   </em>\n   than its American counterpart.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Jonathan Meltzer, Note,\n   <em>\n    Open Carry for All: Heller and OurNineteenth-Century Second Amendment\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"201\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20Yale%20L.J.%201486\">\n    123 Yale L.J. 1486\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1500 (2014) ; Joyce Lee Malcolm,\n   <em>\n    To Keep and Bear Arms: The Origins of an Anglo-American Right\n   </em>\n   120-21 (1994).

But not all laws that restricted the right of Englishmen to have arms found a place across the Atlantic. As St. George Tucker observed, it would have been strange to apply in the United States an English law that presumed any gathering of armed men was treasonous, because \"the right to bear arms is recognized and secured in the [American] constitution itself.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tucker,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , vol. 5, app., n.B, at 19;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Cooley,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 270 (noting that the Second Amendment \"was adopted with some modification and enlargement from the English Bill of Rights\"); William Rawle,\n   <em>\n    A View of the\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Constitution of the United States of America\n   </em>\n   126 (2d ed. 1829) (writing that the English right, unlike the Second Amendment, \"is allowed more or less sparingly, according to circumstances\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Thus, instead of stitching into the Second Amendment every odd law that hemmed in the rights of fourteenth century Englishmen, we consider those English laws only to the extent they inform the original public understanding of the Second Amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"204\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"205\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"\n   <em>\n    By the time of the founding\n   </em>\n   , the right to have arms had become fundamental for English subjects.\" (emphasis added)).

Dissent at 1077 n.1. As that argument goes, when the drafters of virtually every single state Northampton analogue criminalized going armed \"to the terror\" or \"in affray\" of others, the terror or affray language was just purposive; that is, \"terrorizing the public was the consequence of going armed,\" so such language was incorporated into the statutes merely to clarify\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   going armed was itself unlawful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ruben &amp; Cornell,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 129-30; Charles,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , at 33.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   What an odd way it would be to write a criminal statute! To interpret such language as merely purposive is to remove its operative effect, for if going armed was itself unlawful then clarifying the consequences of going armed adds not an iota of substance to the crime. Of course, \"where the text of a clause itself indicates that it does not have operative effect, such as 'whereas' clauses in federal legislation or the Constitution's preamble, a court has no license to make it do what it was not designed to do.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   578 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"212\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, Maine's 1821 Northampton analogue authorized the arrest of \"all affrayers, rioters, disturbers or breakers of the peace, and such as shall ride or go armed offensively, to the fear or terror of the good citizens of this State, or such others as may utter any menaces or threatening speeches.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1821%20Me.%20Laws%20285\">\n    1821 Me.

If riding armed were itself unlawful\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   it terrorized the good citizens of Maine, it strains credulity to suggest that Maine drafters would have felt the need to clarify such reasoning right in the middle of the statute's operative provisions. Indeed, why only clarify the consequences of riding armed, and no other prohibited conduct?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   More troubling, reading the \"to the terror\" language as merely purposive frequently places a Northampton analogue in conflict with its neighboring criminal provisions. Take a closer look at the Northampton analogue in chapter 97 section 13 of Delaware's 1852 Revised Statutes, which-in familiar fashion-authorized the arrest of \"all who go armed offensively to the terror of the people, or are otherwise disorderly and dangerous.\"\n   <em>\n    Revised Statutes of the State of Delaware, to the Year of Our Lord One Thousand Eight Hundred and Fifty-Two, Inclusive\n   </em>\n   333 \u00a7 13 (Dover, W.B. Keen 1852). With that provision in mind, turn to Section 30, where the Delaware Code authorized justices of the peace to \"punish any slave ... who shall, without the special permission of his master, go armed with any dangerous weapon.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1821%20Me.%20Laws%20285\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 336 \u00a7 30. How might one grant another permission to \"go armed with any dangerous weapon\" if one had no lawful authority to go armed in the first place? Or consider Tennessee's 1831 Revised Statutes, which, immediately after providing its standard-form Northampton analogue, authorized sheriffs to arrest any person \"armed with the intention of committing a riot or affray.\" 1\n   <em>\n    The Statute Laws of the State of Tennessee, of a Public and General Nature\n   </em>\n   10 (Knoxville, John Haywood &amp; Robert L. Cobbs 1831). Why on earth would Tennessee have so limited a sheriff's authorization to arrest if going armed was itself unlawful?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Thus, utterly confused by how we might read a Northampton analogue to prohibit all arms carry, we feel the better approach with these statutes is to take them at their word: an American, just like an Englishman, could not go armed offensively to the terror of the people. Such a reasonable restriction on public carry is perfectly consistent with a robust right peacefully to carry a firearm in public. In all, then, the various Northampton analogues found in states across the United States confirm that, \"whatever Northampton banned on the shores of England,\" the American right to carry common weapons openly for self-defense \"was not hemmed in by longstanding\n   bans on carrying.\"\n   <em>\n    Wrenn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275844\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/650/#p665\">\n    864 F.3d at 660-61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   G\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Concluding our analysis of text and review of history, we remain unpersuaded by the County's and the State's argument that the Second Amendment only has force within the home.

The dissent emphasizes the language of section 134-9 that purportedly authorizes the issuance of a concealed carry license in an \"exceptional case.\" Yet, to analyze section 134-9 as such, the dissent must shut its eyes to the inconvenient fact that no concealed carry license has ever been granted by the County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The dissent claims that we lack a factual basis to acknowledge that reality, but the dissent is clearly wrong. The County's attorney\n   <em>\n    conceded\n   </em>\n   at oral argument that no concealed carry license has ever been granted by the County.

In the meantime, this court and our counterparts elsewhere will\n   do the best we can to sort out the conflicting arguments. I respect the opinion of the majority, but my conclusion is different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   H.R.S. \u00a7 134-9 regulates both open carry and concealed carry. Open carry licenses are available to those who are \"engaged in the protection of life and property\" and \"[w]here the urgency or the need has been sufficiently indicated.\" Concealed carry licenses are available \"[i]n an exceptional case, when an applicant shows reason to fear injury to the applicant's person or property.\" H.R.S. \u00a7 134-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   In my view, this statutory scheme is the same type of \"good cause\" public carry regulation that the Second, Third, and Fourth Circuits upheld in\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Woollard\n   </em>\n   , respectively. Good cause licensing schemes, and extensive state regulation of public carry more generally, have a long history in the United States. While explicitly declining to elaborate on specific regulations, the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   expressly noted that the right secured by the Second Amendment is \"not unlimited\" and that there were \"longstanding prohibitions\" that were \"presumptively lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"363\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626-27 &amp; n. 26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"364\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I would hold that Hawaii's statute is a longstanding, presumptively lawful regulation under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   . At a minimum, the statute survives intermediate scrutiny, as the core of the Second Amendment does not include a general right to publicly carry firearms and there is a reasonable fit between the licensing scheme and Hawaii's legitimate interest in promoting public safety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   As a result, I respectfully dissent. As promised, I will try not to repeat all that has already been said by other judges. I will limit my comments to a few additional thoughts about the historical record and the application of intermediate scrutiny to the statute at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    I. History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The majority opinion's conclusions rest heavily on historical analysis in the vein of the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    McDonald\n   </em>\n   . The premise of that approach is that the history of firearms regulations prior to the adoption of the Second Amendment and in the decades that followed that adoption shed light on the right that the founders intended to provide. Much of the analysis offered in the majority opinion repeats what was said in\n   <em>\n    Peruta I\n   </em>\n   , despite the en banc rejection of that opinion in\n   <em>\n    Peruta II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The discussion in the majority opinion is incomplete, at best. Throughout our history, states and their predecessor colonies and territories have taken divergent approaches to the regulation of firearms. While some, like the states that the majority cites, have historically allowed for a general right to publicly carry firearms, many others have not. \"History and tradition do not speak with one voice here. What history demonstrates is that states often disagreed as to the scope of the right to bear arms, whether the right was embodied in a state constitution or the Second Amendment.\"\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710881\" index=\"365\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/81/#p89\">\n    701 F.3d at 91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The majority opinion supports its conclusion by focusing solely on the laws and decisions from one region, the antebellum South. Take a look at the jurisdictions relied upon by the majority opinion, at 1054-57: Kentucky, Tennessee, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana. What jumps out is that those were all slave states, and the decisions relied upon by the majority opinion all date from before the Civil War. The majority opinion affirmatively acknowledges, at 10598-61, the peculiar pattern of southern states following the Civil War, during the era of Black Codes and efforts to keep firearms out of the hands of former slaves, but it fails to appreciate that\n   the peculiarity did not start in 1865. To suggest that the approach of the antebellum South reflected a national consensus about the Second Amendment's implications for public carry of firearms is misguided. The cases from the antebellum South relied upon by the majority \"did not emerge in a vacuum and do not reflect the full range of American legal history. Rather, they come from a time, place, and culture where slavery, honor, violence, and the public carrying of weapons were intertwined.\" Eric M.

Hawaii's regulatory framework fits squarely into that long tradition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   There are two legal conclusions to be drawn from a more thorough historical analysis. First, good cause licensing schemes are longstanding and, therefore, are presumptively lawful limitations on public carry of firearms under\n   <em>\n    Heller.\n   </em>\n   Second, even if they are not presumptively lawful, the widespread and longstanding nature of such schemes supports the conclusion that a general right to publicly carry firearms is not part of the core of the Second Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <em>\n    A.

I am thus joined by most of the other circuits that have spoken to the question in defining the core of the Second Amendment as defense of hearth and home. My understanding is firmly grounded in the long history of allowing substantial state regulation of public carry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Intermediate Scrutiny\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Because I conclude that Hawaii's regulatory framework does not \"impose[ ] such a severe restriction on the fundamental right of self defense of the home that it amounts to a destruction of the Second Amendment right,\" the most demanding level of review that can be applied to Hawaii's regulatory framework is intermediate scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    Silvester v. Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12173394\" index=\"399\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/843/816/#p821\">\n    843 F.3d 816\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 821 (9th Cir. 2016). It appears to me that there is a reasonable fit between Hawaii's public carry regulations and its unquestionably legitimate goal of promoting public safety so that Hawaii's statute would pass constitutional muster. Given the stage of the case and the direction of the majority, it does not seem worthwhile to try to launch a complete intermediate scrutiny analysis at this point. I note, however, that the majority opinion makes some critical errors in declining to consider that analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   First, Hawaii does provide an alternative mode of access to publicly carry firearms for self-defense. As we stated in\n   <em>\n    Jackson\n   </em>\n   , \"firearm regulations which leave open alternative channels for self-defense are less likely to place a severe burden on the Second Amendment right than those which do not.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240538\" index=\"400\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/746/953/#p960\">\n    746 F.3d at 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under Hawaii's law, citizens may obtain a concealed carry permit if they can show reason to fear injury. They thus are not \"entirely foreclosed\" from obtaining a permit to bear arms in public for self-defense, as asserted in the majority opinion, at 1071. Moreover, the majority opinion's assessment, at 1071 n. 21, that \" section 134-9 does not offer a realistic opportunity for a concealed carry license\" lacks support in the record. No record has been developed in this case, so a conclusion that the regulation acts as a total ban is unsupported. It may be, as stated at oral argument, that no concealed carry permit has been issued by the County, but we have no information whatsoever about the applicants for concealed carry permits, let alone enough information to support a finding that those applicants would have been eligible for a permit even if Hawaii had a \"shall-issue\" regime. Under our precedent, the fact that Hawaii may provide an alternative channel for public carry should weigh in favor of finding that the law withstands constitutional scrutiny.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   Second, the majority's decision to pick apart the various studies cited by the state ignores the Supreme Court's dictate to \"accord substantial deference to the predictive judgments\" of the state legislature.\n   <em>\n    Turner Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/#p213\">\n    520 U.S. 180\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 195,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/#p213\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651420\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/180/#p213\">\n    137 L.Ed.2d 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). As the Second Circuit stated in\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   , \"[i]t is the legislature's job, not ours, to weigh conflicting evidence and make policy judgments.\"\n   <em>\n    Kachalsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5710881\" index=\"404\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/701/81/#p89\">\n    701 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   99 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Drake\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4067760\" index=\"405\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/724/426/#p431\">\n    724 F.3d at 439\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"conflicting empirical evidence ... does not suggest, let alone compel, a conclusion that the 'fit' between [a state's] individualized, tailored approach and public safety is not 'reasonable.' \"). The test is not whether the state has provided flawless empirical analysis that is immune to dispute to support its reasonable conclusion that the regulatory measures promote public safety. That limiting public carry of firearms may have a positive effect on public safety is hardly a illogical proposition. Many other states appear to have reached similar conclusions, and so have most other nations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Although the majority may not like the outcomes of those studies, and may even disagree with their approaches, intermediate scrutiny does not allow us to dismiss statutes based on our own policy views or disagreements with aspects of the analyses cited. In an intermediate scrutiny analysis, Hawaii is not required to show that its regulatory scheme \"is the least restrictive means of achieving its interest\" in public safety, but rather need only show that the scheme \"promotes a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively absent the regulation.\"\n   <em>\n    Fyock v.

There are undoubtedly many factors that lead to that result, but we should not ignore the evidence that Hawaii has been highly successful in limiting firearm deaths and promoting public safety. Hawaii has shown that there is a reasonable fit between its statutory scheme and public safety, and the state's decision is owed deference. Any conclusion otherwise disregards our proper role in an intermediate scrutiny analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-189\">\n   The majority opinion goes astray in several respects. Most obviously, the majority opinion has disregarded the fact that states and territories in a variety of regions have long allowed for extensive regulations of and limitations on the public\n   carry of firearms. Many have taken the approach that Hawaii has taken for almost a century. Such regulations are presumptively lawful under\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   and do not undercut the core of the Second Amendment. In addition, the majority opinion misconceives the intermediate scrutiny test, assumes without support in the record that Hawaii's statute operates as a complete ban, and substitutes its own judgment about the efficacy of less restrictive regulatory schemes. This approach is in conflict with Supreme Court precedent, our own decisions, and decisions by other circuits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-221\">\n    The majority's analysis of English law and the colonies' treatment of English law, at 1063-68, is also flawed. For example, the majority assumes that historical regulations authorizing the arrest of or criminalizing going armed \"to the fear or terror\" of the public mean that the person who goes armed must have had the\n    <em>\n     intent\n    </em>\n    to terrify the public.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Maj. Op. at 1066-68. But the majority opinion does not cite adequate authority for that proposition, and there is no consensus that supports such an interpretation. Another equally reasonable interpretation is that these statutes meant that a member of the general public could not go armed because to do so would terrify the people, and the statutes included this language to \"highlight[ ] the importance of the police power in preventing the dangers imposed by public carrying .... The terminology did not legally require circumstances where carrying of arms was unusual and therefore terrifying. Instead, the act of riding or going armed among the people was deemed terrifying itself and considered a breach against the public peace.\" Patrick J.

The fact that the public carry regulations may have been triggered by citizen-complaint mechanisms does not change the states' recognition that public carry may be limited.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-223\">\n    The majority opinion elects to disregard these enactments because it says it does not know the level of enforcement and cannot discern whether they were enacted \"with a militia or a self-defense oriented view of the right to bear arms in mind.\" Maj. Op. at 1063 n. 13. Those explanations do not speak to the point, though. States did in fact adopt these limitations on the carry of firearms, presuming the limitations to be lawful and consistent with the Second Amendment, and they did so long ago, making the restrictions long-established regulatory measures that are presumptively lawful.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-224\">\n    This point speaks to a broader problem with the majority's analysis. Throughout its opinion, the majority attempts to focus only on whether the Second Amendment protects a right to open carry, based on an erroneous assumption that any other analysis is foreclosed by our decision in\n    <em>\n     Peruta II\n    </em>\n    . I do not agree with this approach, and its artificiality becomes clear when we move to the intermediate scrutiny analysis.\n    <em>\n     Peruta II\n    </em>\n    specifically declined to decide not only whether the Second Amendment protects open carry, but also whether it protects \"a right of a member of the general public to carry firearms in public.\"\n    <em>\n     Peruta II\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4321795\" index=\"416\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/919/\">\n     824 F.3d at 927\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In applying intermediate scrutiny, the majority opinion specifically states, at 1069 n. 16, that it does not address whether \"a concealed carry regime could provide a sufficient channel for typical, law-abiding citizens to exercise their right to bear arms for self-defense.\" But this is illogical. The existence of alternative access to public carry for self-defense in the form of concealed carry is unquestionably relevant in an intermediate scrutiny analysis. Nothing in\n    <em>\n     Peruta II\n    </em>\n    said otherwise. If we apply intermediate scrutiny, we must consider the statute as a whole, rather than pretending that Hawaii has instituted a complete ban on public carry, both open and concealed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
