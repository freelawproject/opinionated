The district court sentenced Myers as an armed career criminal based on one prior serious drug conviction and two prior violent felonies under Arkansas law-first-degree terroristic threatening and second-degree battery.

On the other hand, the instruction could direct the jury to determine whether a defendant \"threatened to cause death to or serious physical injury to another person.\" Stated this way, the jury instruction would set out the alternates disjunctively, allowing the court to choose which is applicable.
