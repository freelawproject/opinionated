The issues before us today arise from the interactions of one of those plaintiffs, Franklin Savage, with the State's Attorney for Worcester County, Beau Oglesby. According to Savage, Oglesby created a hostile work environment by reading aloud, at a trial preparation meeting, potential evidence in the form of letters containing racial epithets. And then, Savage alleges, after he complained of the incident, Oglesby retaliated against him by refusing to call him as a witness in criminal cases and notifying Pocomoke City officials of that decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On the basis of these allegations, Savage sued State's Attorney Oglesby for violations of his civil rights. He also sued the State of Maryland under Title VII, asserting that Maryland, as Oglesby's employer, is vicariously liable for his unlawful acts. The district court dismissed the claims against Oglesby, holding that he is protected by absolute prosecutorial immunity, but allowed the claims against Maryland to proceed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   We agree with the district court that prosecutorial immunity bars Savage's claims against Oglesby. Reviewing and evaluating evidence in preparation for trial, making judgments about witness credibility, and deciding which witnesses to call and which cases may be prosecuted all are directly connected to the judicial phase of the criminal process, protected by absolute immunity. We disagree, however, with respect to Savage's retaliation claim against Maryland. Because no reasonable employee could believe that Oglesby violated Title VII at the trial-preparation meeting to which Savage objected, Savage's allegations fail to state a claim under Title VII, and should be dismissed for that reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Franklin Savage alleges that he was subjected to unlawful discrimination and retaliation while he was employed by the Pocomoke City Police Department and on detail to the Worcester County Criminal Enforcement Team (\"CET\"), a multi-jurisdictional drug interdiction task force led by the Worcester County Sheriff's Office. He and two co-plaintiffs, all African Americans and former Pocomoke City police officers, filed a suit against multiple state and local agencies and their employees, alleging widespread race-based employment discrimination and retaliation. The interlocutory cross-appeals before us today address just one discrete part of this broader litigation, and are limited to Savage's allegations against State's Attorney Oglesby and the State of Maryland as Oglesby's employer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Savage joined the Pocomoke City Police Department in 2011, and in 2012 was assigned\n   to the CET. In April 2014, Savage attended a meeting with members of the Worcester County State's Attorney's office, including State's Attorney Oglesby. The purpose of the meeting, according to Savage, was to \"discuss an upcoming case\" on which he had been the arresting officer. J.A. 109. During the meeting, Savage alleges, he \"presented some documents\"-letters written by the suspects-\"that were going to be looked at by the State's Attorney's Office to decide if they were going to use them in the upcoming court case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Then, Savage claims, Oglesby \"began to read the letters verbatim line for line,\" which meant \"us[ing] the word Nigga over and over again.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When Oglesby stopped and asked whether he was \"offending anybody by reading these letters,\" Assistant State's Attorney Ajene Turnbull, the only other African American present, left the room.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Savage remained, and Oglesby continued reading. After some discussion, Oglesby asked for \"copies of the letters so that he could use them for trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In July 2014, after Savage had resigned from the CET and returned to the Pocomoke City Police Department, he filed two written complaints, one with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and one with the Maryland Attorney Grievance Commission. Both objected to Oglesby's repeated reading of the racial slur during the April 2014 meeting. In his complaints, Savage described the word \"Nigga\" as \"highly powerful and hurtful,\" and expressed his deep offense that Oglesby would \"use the word Nigga so freely and without care in front of ASA Turnbull and me.\" J.A. 109. Since the meeting, Savage said, he was \"having problems with [his] cases being prosecuted\" and also \"problems sleeping.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In September 2014, Oglesby sent a letter to the Pocomoke City Mayor and City Council, \"implying that he would not allow Officer Savage to testify in court\" because of concerns about his \"veracity.\" J.A. 54. And indeed, Oglesby's letter directly stated that the \"recent conduct of ... Savage calls into question his veracity.\" J.A. 187.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Citing his legal obligation to disclose material that could be used to impeach state witnesses, Oglesby went on to conclude that he would be required to \"evaluate any case\" in which Savage would be a witness \"to determine what impact he w[ould] have on our ability to prosecute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The bottom line appeared to be that Oglesby would not call Savage as a witness without corroboration for his testimony, and would instead decline to prosecute in such cases: \"If we are unable to independently corroborate his testimony and therefore must rely solely on his word, the likely outcome will be a dismissal of the case.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Savage, because testifying in court was a \"vital part\" of his duties, that decision \"directly interfered\" with his ability to do his job. J.A. 69.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Over a year later, in October 2015, Oglesby and the Pocomoke City Manager had a telephone conversation. Savage's complaint describes it as follows: \"Oglesby was adamant that Officer Savage would never be able to testify again and was thus useless to the Pocomoke City Police Department. On information and belief, Oglesby reiterated that Officer Savage should be terminated.\" J.A. 59. Savage was fired from his position with the Pocomoke City Police Department ten days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Savage, along with his co-plaintiffs, filed suit against multiple defendants in federal court, seeking damages and attorney's fees as well as declaratory and injunctive relief. Savage sued Oglesby in his personal capacity, alleging violations of his civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1983, and 1985. Specifically, Savage claimed that Oglesby created a racially hostile work environment at the April 2014 trial-preparation meeting when he read aloud potential evidence containing numerous references to a racial epithet. Oglesby then violated the First Amendment, Savage claimed, by retaliating against him when he spoke out about the meeting, a matter of public concern. According to Savage's complaint, that retaliation took the form of Oglesby's decision to prohibit Savage from testifying and his letter to Pocomoke City (or \"City\") officials communicating that decision and impugning his veracity. As a result of those actions, Savage alleged, he was unable to perform critical job duties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Oglesby moved to dismiss the claims against him or, in the alternative, for summary judgment. The district court granted Oglesby's motion. Without elaborating further, it held that Savage's claims against Oglesby \"are barred by the doctrine of absolute prosecutorial immunity.\" J.A. 206.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In response, Savage amended his complaint to add Title VII claims against the State of Maryland, based on the same factual predicate as his claims against Oglesby. As Oglesby's employer, Savage alleged, the State was liable for Oglesby's unlawful acts. Savage acknowledged that Pocomoke City, and not the State of Maryland, \"constitutes [his] employer for purposes of Title VII.\" J.A. 268. But his retaliation claim against the State could go forward, he claimed, under a third-party interference theory: The State, though not his employer, unlawfully interfered with his employment relationship with Pocomoke City when Oglesby retaliated against him for complaining about race discrimination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The State moved to dismiss or, in the alternative, for summary judgment with respect to this retaliatory interference claim. According to the State, Oglesby's absolute immunity should extend to the State in an action based entirely on the same conduct for which Oglesby was immune. And in any event, the State argued, Savage could not state a claim under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision, which permits suits only against a plaintiff's employer-here, Pocomoke City-and not against third parties like the State. The district court denied the State's motion without discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   So that he could seek immediate appeal of Oglesby's dismissal from the case, Savage sought and was granted partial final judgment as to Oglesby. The State, too, wanted an immediate appeal, and the district court obliged by certifying for interlocutory appeal its order denying the State's motion to dismiss or for summary judgment. This court granted the State permission to appeal, and we now have before us timely filed interlocutory appeals by both Savage and the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We begin with the district court order dismissing Oglesby from the case\n   based on absolute prosecutorial immunity. We review that order de novo, accepting all of Savage's factual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor.\n   <em>\n    Singer v.

But how evidence should be evaluated is exactly the kind of professional judgment call that prosecutorial immunity is designed to\n   protect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Van de Kamp\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679192\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/335/#p341\">\n    555 U.S. at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679192\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/335/#p341\">\n    129 S.Ct. 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (describing the \"exercise of [legal] discretion\" protected by prosecutorial immunity). There is no claim in this case that Oglesby used the occasion of a trial-preparation meeting to make statements or engage in conduct divorced from the subject of the meeting; rather, Savage objects to the manner in which Oglesby reviewed potential evidence presented by Savage himself and concededly \"connected\" to the case at hand. Resp. Br. &amp; Opening Br. of Appellee/Cross-Appellant Savage (\"Savage Opening Brief\") at 6. And while we take as a given that Savage, as he alleges, was deeply offended by Oglesby's actions, the immunity analysis does not turn on \"the harm that the [prosecutor's] conduct may have caused,\" but rather on the function the prosecutor was performing at the time.\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p269\">\n    509 U.S. at 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"355969\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/509/259/#p269\">\n    113 S.Ct. 2606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This is clear from\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   itself, holding that prosecutors are absolutely immune from claims that they knowingly presented false testimony at trial: Because \"[t]he veracity of witnesses in criminal cases frequently is subject to doubt,\" the Court explained, the integrity of the criminal process would suffer if \"prosecutors were hampered in exercising their judgment as to the use of such witnesses by concern about resulting personal liability.\"\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/#p430\">\n    424 U.S. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026708\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/409/#p430\">\n    96 S.Ct. 984\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The facts in\n   <em>\n    Roe\n   </em>\n   are strikingly similar to those here: A police officer alleged that after he circulated a legal memorandum criticizing prosecutorial conduct, the prosecutor stopped calling him as a witness, determined that there would be no prosecutions of the officer's cases without corroborating evidence, and communicated that decision to the officer's state employer-all of which led to the officer being reassigned because he no longer could \"complete [his] duties.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833955\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/578/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833955\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/578/\">\n    at 580-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For instance, insisting that a former investigator, even after he has found new employment, be barred from working on any stage of an investigation, regardless of whether he will be a potential witness or his testimony is corroborated, may lack the requisite connection to the judicial process to bring it within the ambit of absolute immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Botello v.

Savage Opening Brief at 20. For the reasons given above, we disagree. And to the extent Savage can be understood to argue that his case should proceed because the phone conversation, in particular, lacks the required connection to the criminal trial process, we again must disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Critically, Savage's own complaint does not identify the phone conversation-more specifically, the part of the conversation in which Oglesby purportedly recommended that Savage be terminated-as having any independent significance, apart from Oglesby's protected conduct in prohibiting Savage's testimony and explaining that decision to City officials. Count IV of the complaint, for First Amendment retaliation, identifies two and only two actions taken by Oglesby in alleged retaliation for Savage's public statements about the April 2014 trial-preparation meeting: Oglesby \"prohibited ... Savage from testifying,\" and Oglesby sent City officials a September 2014 letter announcing that decision and \"falsely accusing ... Savage of lying.\" J.A. 69. It was those two actions, Savage alleges, that effectively made it impossible for him to fulfill his job functions, because \"[t]estifying at trial in criminal prosecutions was a vital part of [his] duties as a police officer.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8972001\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/413/971/#p977\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Nowhere does Savage allege that the phone conversation of a year later (described in his factual allegations and incorporated into each count of the complaint) was a separate act of retaliation, also caused by his objections to the meeting. Nor does he allege that Oglesby's purported employment recommendation during that conversation-as opposed to Oglesby's continued refusal to allow his testimony, which already, on his own telling, had rendered him unable to perform his job duties and relegated to purely administrative tasks, J.A. 60-played any independent causal role in his termination. Accordingly, Savage's allegations regarding the purported retaliatory nature of the September 2014 letter and the October 2015 phone conversation rely on the same shielded conduct discussed above, and therefore fail to state a plausible claim for retaliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    D.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Finally, Savage argues that even if Oglesby is entitled to absolute prosecutorial immunity, the district court erred in dismissing Oglesby from the case entirely.

Thus, Savage contends, the district court should have allowed claims for declaratory and injunctive relief against Oglesby to proceed. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Oglesby, unlike other defendants in this case, was sued only in his personal capacity, not his official capacity, and it is clear from the complaint that the only relief sought against him is money damages arising from past conduct. Savage has not alleged that he faces a \"real and immediate\n   threat of future injury\" from Oglesby, as would be required for entry of prospective injunctive or declaratory relief under \u00a7 1983 ; continuing \"emotional consequences\" from Oglesby's prior acts are not enough.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v.

Bitzer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178587\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/445/#p452\">\n    427 U.S. 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 452,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178587\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/445/#p452\">\n    96 S.Ct. 2666\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6178587\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/427/445/#p452\">\n    49 L.Ed.2d 614\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976). And although Maryland was not\n   <em>\n    Savage's\n   </em>\n   employer-Savage worked for Pocomoke City-Savage claims that Maryland can be held liable under a \"third-party retaliatory interference\" theory, for interfering with his employment relationship with the City through Oglesby's retaliatory actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The State resists what it views as an \"end run\" around its State's Attorney's absolute prosecutorial immunity: According to the State, if Oglesby is absolutely immune for his conduct, then so, too, should the State be immune as to claims arising from exactly the same factual allegations. And in any event, the State argues, Savage cannot state a claim for Title VII retaliation. Title VII's anti-retaliation provision makes it unlawful for \"an employer to discriminate against any of\n   <em>\n    his employees\n   </em>\n   or applicants for employment,\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a) (emphasis added), and according to the State, that plain text precludes a suit by non-employee Savage against the State of Maryland. Indeed, the State argues, because the abrogation of state sovereign immunity must be clear and unequivocal,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v.

This claim can be resolved on the narrower and more straightforward ground-also pressed by the State-that even assuming the State could be liable to Savage under Title VII's anti-retaliation provision for Oglesby's conduct, Savage has failed to make out a Title VII retaliation claim based on that conduct. For that reason alone, Savage's claim should be dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strawser v.

In order to state a prima facie claim of Title VII retaliation, Savage must allege facts establishing that he engaged in protected activity, that his employer took an adverse employment action against him, and that there was a causal link between those events.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Foster v.

Our focus here is on the first element, \"protected activity,\" in which an employee like Savage engages if he opposes either employment actions \"actually unlawful under Title VII\" or \"employment actions [he] reasonably believes to be unlawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Boyer-Liberto v.

The State argues on appeal, as before the district court, that Savage's formal complaints about the April 2014 meeting do not meet that standard, because Oglesby's conduct during the meeting was not unlawful under Title VII, and Savage could not reasonably have believed otherwise. We agree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Clark County School District v.

Review of and exposure to the reports-including the offensive portions-was part of the \"ordinary terms and conditions\" of the plaintiff's job, the Supreme Court reasoned.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Given that context, the Court concluded, the plaintiff's subsequent complaint about the meeting could not constitute \"protected activity,\" because no one reasonably could believe that the incident was sufficiently severe to establish a hostile workplace environment in violation of Title VII.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n    at 270-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The same reasoning applies to this very similar case. Again, we have the reading aloud of offensive material from a document at a work meeting; the document is germane to the meeting at which it is read; and dealing with such documents is part of the complaining employee's job. Indeed, Savage's own factual allegations make clear that \"the ordinary terms and conditions\" of his employment required at least some exposure to the documents and offensive language at issue, given that it was Savage himself who brought the letters to the meeting and presented them to Oglesby for review. If anything, the conduct alleged here is even more fully a part of the job than the conduct in\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   : In\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff's supervisor not only read aloud but also commented on and, with another employee, laughed about the sexually explicit material in the report,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n    532 U.S. at 269-71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301161\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/268/#p271\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , whereas Oglesby, according to Savage, read the letters verbatim with no editorial comment, stopping only to ask whether he was offending anyone. In this context, and in\n   light of the holding in\n   <em>\n    Breeden\n   </em>\n   , we think it is clear that the April 2014 meeting did not rise to the level of a hostile work environment under Title VII, and that Savage could not reasonably have believed that his grounds for complaint against Oglesby included a Title VII violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In arguing to the contrary, Savage reminds us that the racial slur read by Oglesby is particularly odious, and \"pure anathema to African-Americans.\"\n   <em>\n    Spriggs v.

We do not doubt that for a moment. And we have held that even a single incident in which that epithet or one like it is directed at an employee may be \"severe enough to engender a hostile work environment\" in violation of Title VII.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Boyer-Liberto\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4190918\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/786/264/#p282\">\n    786 F.3d at 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that \"single incident\" in which employee was called a \"porch monkey\" gave rise to Title VII claim for hostile work environment). Likewise, an employer's repeated and continuous use of that slur, among others, to insult African-American employees and customers, even when not directed specifically at the complaining employee, is \"sufficiently severe or pervasive (or both)\" to create an unlawful hostile work environment.\n   <em>\n    Spriggs\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124667\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/179/#p185\">\n    242 F.3d at 184-85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Perhaps no single act can more quickly alter the conditions of employment and create an abusive working environment than the use of an unambiguously racial epithet such as 'nigger' by a supervisor in the presence of his subordinates.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124667\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/179/#p185\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11124667\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/242/179/#p185\">\n    at 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Rodgers v.

On the facts as alleged by Savage, Oglesby was not aiming racial epithets at Savage, or, for that matter, at anyone else, or using slurs to give voice to his own views. Instead, he was reading the word \"Nigga\" aloud from letters written by criminal suspects, presented to him by a police officer in the course of a trial-preparation meeting. In that distinct context and without more, no inference of a racially hostile environment can be drawn, and it would not be reasonable to believe that a Title VII violation had occurred. For that reason, we reverse the district court's denial of the State's motion to dismiss Savage's Title VII retaliation claim against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   For the reasons given above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed in\n   part and reversed in part, and we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    We quote here from the full text of Oglesby's September 2014 letter, which, though not an exhibit to Savage's complaint, was attached by Oglesby to his responsive motion.
