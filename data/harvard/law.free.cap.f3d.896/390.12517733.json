The petition and the dissental instead challenge only the panel opinion's fact-bound narrow-tailoring analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   That issue does not warrant en banc review. This is especially so because, rather than neglect Second Amendment rights, the panel opinion gave petitioners the benefit of the doubt at every step of this analysis. At step one, the panel assumed out of an abundance of caution that federal laws governing the time, place, and manner of interstate gun sales are not among the longstanding \"conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms\" that the Supreme Court has deemed \"presumptively lawful.\"\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    554 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   626-27 &amp; n.26,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677081\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/570/#p635\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2783\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And at step two, the panel again cautiously assumed that the \"burdens\" of which petitioners complain-namely, the extra days it takes to ship out-of-state firearms to the District of Columbia, plus the attendant shipping costs and fees-are so onerous, and the right to out-of-state gun purchases so near the Second Amendment's \"core,\" that strict scrutiny is required. In my view, the panel opinion needed not concede either step.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Focia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12267263\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/869/1269/#p1286\">\n    869 F.3d 1269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1286-87 (11th Cir. 2017) (upholding\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(5) as within\n   <em>\n    Heller\n   </em>\n   's \"presumptively lawful\" categories);\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To be clear: \u00a7 922(a) is not a ban on interstate gun transfers. It does not prohibit law-abiding individuals in one state from purchasing a gun from another. It simply conditions that the purchase be made through an in-state, federally licensed dealer. The only prohibitions on gun sales are those imposed by state law. Given the diversity and complexity of those laws, Congress reasonably concluded that relying on dealers in one state to ensure compliance with the laws of all 49 other states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories would perpetuate the same under-enforcement and circumvention of\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   law that \u00a7 922(a) was meant to combat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The rejoinder that dealers would be better able to apply the laws of all states and territories if those laws were less complex has no bearing on whether this\n   <em>\n    federal\n   </em>\n   law is narrowly tailored. Put simply, Congress has no power to compel states to streamline their gun safety regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nor is the law fatally underinclusive. Instead, its focus on handguns highlights how \u00a7 922(a) hews closely to its compelling purpose of reducing gun-related crime and violence by preventing circumvention of state law. Contrary to the dissental's assertion, we need not speculate why Congress\n   was less concerned with out-of-state purchases of rifles: it's all there in the congressional record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In any event, underinclusivity is not itself fatal: \"A State need not address all aspects of a problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus on their most pressing concerns.\"\n   <em>\n    Williams-Yulee v.

Under its view, the Government can reasonably expect dealers to learn the laws of their own state-but not the laws of other states. The only way to ensure compliance with all state handgun laws, then, is to forbid all interstate handgun sales, and allow only in-state handgun sales.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Tellingly, however, the Government does not cite a single case in which regulatory complexity justifies a prophylactic rule under strict scrutiny. To the contrary, courts have generally rejected the notion that citizens are incapable of learning the laws of other states-or that such inability would justify otherwise unconstitutional laws.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Supreme Court v. Piper\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299205\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/274/\">\n    470 U.S. 274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285 &amp; n.19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299205\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/274/\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299205\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/274/\">\n    84 L.Ed.2d 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"Nor may we assume that a nonresident lawyer-any more than a resident-would disserve his clients by failing to familiarize himself with the rules. ... Because it is markedly overinclusive, the residency requirement does not bear a substantial relationship to the State's objective.\");\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    O'Reilly v. Bd. of Appeals\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521761\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/942/281/#p285\">\n    942 F.2d 281\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 285 (4th Cir. 1991) (rejecting \"[u]se of residency ... to determine familiarity with the geographic area to be served,\" and noting that \"other similar jurisdictions use a written examination to determine an applicant's familiarity with a specific area\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The same logic readily applies here. To begin with: Even assuming the Government's premise that it is hard to comply with the handgun laws of all 50 states, that does not justify forbidding dealers from complying with the laws of one or more neighboring states-presumably the most likely scenario for an interstate sale. A Texas dealer near the Oklahoma border might very well be eager to master the laws of both Texas and Oklahoma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The ban nevertheless forbids Texas dealers from serving Oklahomans. And for what reason? The Government does not contend (nor could it) that a dealer is fully capable of complying with the laws of one state, but incapable of complying with the laws of two. This alone demonstrates that a categorical ban on all interstate handgun sales is over-inclusive-it prohibits a significant number of transactions that fully comply with state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, this is not the only flaw in the Government's regulatory complexity theory. The Government presents no evidence that gun dealers cannot comply with the laws of multiple states. For example, the panel points to the fact that minimum age requirements vary by state. But that does not justify a categorical ban-the Government could easily provide, and dealers could easily follow, a one-page index of each state's minimum age requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   To be sure, there are more complex state laws than minimum age requirements-such as state laws defining prohibited purchasers in terms of mental illness or criminal history. But if in-state dealers are capable of complying with their own state's handgun laws, the Government has not explained why out-of-state dealers are incapable of doing so-for example, why Texans are uniquely capable of complying with Texas law, but uniquely incapable of complying with Oklahoma law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   To borrow from Judge Owen's concurrence: \"The Government has not explained how or why a state would be able to provide information such as mental health information for purposes of a transfer of a handgun by an in-state FFL but could not provide that information to an out-of-state FFL.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263705\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/183/#p185\">\n    880 F.3d at 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Owen, J., concurring).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   So there are plenty of less restrictive alternatives that further the Government's interest in ensuring compliance with state handgun laws, short of a categorical ban. For example, nothing prevents a state from imposing the same licensing or other requirements on out-of-state dealers that it already imposes on in-state dealers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   In addition, some states require their residents to obtain a police pre-approval certification before buying a handgun.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%207-2502.06\">\n    D.C.

If in-state dealers can use police pre-approval to ensure compliance with state law, so can out-of-state dealers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Similarly, Congress has established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (\"NICS\") to ensure that prospective gun buyers are legally eligible. The district court found that NICS is sufficient to ensure compliance with state and federal law, rendering an interstate handgun sales ban unnecessary.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4226375\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/74/795/#p807\">\n    74 F.Supp.3d at 810-11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The panel disagreed, noting that \"current federal laws ... do not require all information regarding compliance with the various state and local gun control laws to be included in databases accessible by FFLs nationwide.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263705\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/183/#p185\">\n    880 F.3d at 190\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   But 36 states think that relying on NICS adequately vindicates their interests. According to an FBI report cited by the Government, 36 states-including every state in this circuit, as well as the District of Columbia-rely\n   <em>\n    solely\n   </em>\n   on NICS to run background checks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   FBI Criminal Justice Information Services,\n   <em>\n    National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) Operations\n   </em>\n   3 (2014),\n   <em>\n    available at\n   </em>\n   https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/nics/reports/2014-operations-report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   What's more, the fact that nearly three-quarters of states rely entirely on NICS, and not on their own databases, further demonstrates why the interstate sales ban serves little purpose: If a D.C. resident wishes to buy a handgun, the dealer will run the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   NICS background check, regardless of whether the dealer is based in D.C., Texas, or most other states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   And in any event, even assuming the panel is correct that better information sharing would make the system more effective, that only furthers the point here: There are less restrictive alternatives to ensure compliance with state handgun laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Indeed, a majority of the Senate has voted to repeal the federal ban on interstate handgun sales, in favor of other regulations believed to be more effective at ensuring compliance with state handgun laws, including better information sharing-reflecting their view that the ban is not necessary to enforce those laws.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act of 2013 \u00a7 124, S.

Law-abiding Americans should not be conflated with dangerous criminals. Constitutional rights must not give way to hoplophobia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The ban on interstate handgun sales fails strict scrutiny. After all, a categorical ban is precisely the opposite of a narrowly tailored regulation. It applies to all citizens, not just dangerous persons. Instead of requiring citizens to comply with state law, it forbids them from even trying. Nor has the Government demonstrated why it needs a categorical ban to ensure compliance with state handgun laws. Put simply, the way to require compliance with state handgun laws is to require compliance with state handgun laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The Government's defense of the federal ban-that state handgun laws are too complex to obey-is not just wrong under established precedent, it is troubling for a more fundamental reason. If handgun laws are too complex for law-abiding citizens to follow, the answer is not to impose even more restrictive rules on the American people. The answer is to make the laws easier for all to understand and follow. The Government's proposed prophylaxis-to protect against the violations of the few, we must burden the constitutional rights of the many-turns the Second Amendment on its head. Our Founders crafted a Constitution to promote the liberty of the individual, not the convenience of the Government.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   I would affirm the district court.
