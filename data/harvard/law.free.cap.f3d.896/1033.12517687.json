Among other things, the Order allows copyright holders to seek limited discovery from an Internet Service Provider to establish a potential infringer's identity, directs that holders must alert potential defendants of the availability of pro bono counsel to defend against infringement claims, and limits holders to suing one alleged BitTorrent infringer at a time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    GLACIER'S LAWSUIT IN OREGON\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Glacier Films (USA), Inc. and Glacier Films 1, LLC (collectively, \"Glacier\") hold valid and enforceable copyrights in the film\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scheduled for widespread theatrical release in January 2015,\n   <em>\n    Heist\n   </em>\n   instead leaked prematurely on BitTorrent, where it became a top downloaded (i.e., pirated) movie. According to Glacier, over 100,000 Internet Protocol (\"IP\") addresses illegally downloaded and exchanged the copyrighted film on BitTorrent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Tracking one such infringing IP address to Oregon, Glacier brought suit in district court against the John Doe owner and subpoenaed records from Comcast to ascertain the Doe's identity. Glacier selected that particular IP address because the user distributed the film 80 times and was associated with over 700 other titles. When records revealed Andrey Turchin as the owner of the IP address, Glacier sent two letters seeking his participation in determining who downloaded the movie. After Turchin proved non-responsive, Glacier obtained leave to depose him. At his deposition, Turchin admitted to downloading copyrighted content with that IP address, right up until the day before his deposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Glacier amended its complaint to name the avid BitTorrent user as the single defendant\n   and sent Turchin a letter advising him of the district court's pro bono program so that he could obtain assistance in filing a responsive pleading. After nearly three months of attempting to contact Turchin, Glacier filed a motion for default. The court appointed pro bono counsel, who filed an answer raising various affirmative defenses, denying liability, and seeking costs and attorney's fees. On that same day, Turchin provided Glacier with a Rule 68 Offer of Judgment in which Turchin offered to pay $2,501 to Glacier in exchange for Glacier's agreement that the sum would satisfy all debts and obligations related to the suit, including any claim for damages, costs and attorney's fees. A few days later, Turchin filed an amended answer removing five of the seven affirmative defenses, but continuing to deny liability and maintaining his own request for costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After conferring, the parties reached a stipulated consent judgment. Per the agreement, Turchin stipulated to the \"allegations that give rise to liability for the infringement of [Glacier's] rights\" and to $750 in statutory damages. The court permanently enjoined Turchin from using the Internet to reproduce, copy or publish\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   , and ordered him to immediately delete any unlicensed copies of the movie in his possession. The parties agreed that \"any award of reasonable attorneys fees shall be determined by the [c]ourt in accordance with\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20505\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and pursuant to [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 54.\" Glacier moved for costs of $791.70 and attorney's fees totaling $4,833.35.

THE DISTRICT COURT ABUSED ITS DISCRETION IN APPLYING THE FACTORS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Although the court properly cited all of the Supreme Court and Ninth Circuit factors, it focused on three-\"minimal success\" in the litigation, the lack of need for further deterrence, and the goals of the Copyright Act. The court's analysis was\n   infused with criticism of\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   BitTorrent cases as well as a critique of Glacier's counsel in\n   <em>\n    other\n   </em>\n   file sharing litigation. While we understand that prolific BitTorrent litigation has taxed the courts and that the District of Oregon has adopted a sensible way to manage its dockets, individual cases nonetheless deserve to be judged on their own merits and not saddled with a blanket indictment against peer-to-peer copyright litigation. The sheer volume of suits should not preordain a court's fee determination in any one suit. Nor should an individual client, such as Glacier, be penalized for the tactics of its counsel in other cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   For these and the more specific reasons explained below, we conclude that the court misapplied the factors on which it focused while omitting analysis of other factors that may counsel toward an award of fees-including the unreasonableness of the losing party's (Turchin's) conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    A. THE DEGREE OF SUCCESS IN THE LITIGATION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The district court noted that Glacier's suit was \"not frivolous,\" but went on to conclude that its success was \"minimal.\" In fact, Glacier's infringement suit against Turchin was a \"total success.\"\n   <em>\n    Maljack Prods., Inc. v. GoodTimes Home Video Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652691\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/81/881/#p890\">\n    81 F.3d 881\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 890 (9th Cir. 1996). Glacier alleged that Turchin copied and distributed\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   through a public BitTorrent network without Glacier's permission; Turchin's actions infringed on Glacier's exclusive rights under the Copyright Act; and Turchin's conduct was \"willful, intentional, in disregard of and indifferent to [Glacier's] rights with the intent to deprive [Glacier] of income and cause [Glacier] harm.\" Turchin stipulated to those facts giving rise to liability and to $750 in statutory damages for violating the Copyright Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Despite Glacier's complete victory, the district court did not weigh the degree of success in the litigation in Glacier's favor; instead, the court twisted total triumph into a conclusion that \"the degree of success in each of these BitTorrent copyright cases is minimal.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The court's reasons for reaching this unexpected outcome lack support in the law and the record. To begin, the court observed that \"the $750 statutory damage award Defendant has agreed to pay is low in relation to the amount of attorney fees Plaintiffs have accrued ($4,833.45), to achieve that result.\" This is a flawed premise that mixes and matches actual success with the determination of a reasonable fee award.

In doing so, the district court elided that Turchin offered to pay Glacier $2,501 in exchange for Glacier's agreeing that the sum would satisfy all debts and obligations related to Glacier's lawsuit, including any claim for damages, costs and attorney's fees. That Glacier's counsel rejected the $2,501 offer in favor of $750 in stipulated damages and the opportunity for costs and fees hardly reveals \"minimal success\" in the litigation; rather, it underscores a belief that Glacier had a strong legal case for costs and fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Next, the court reasoned that because\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   had been illegally downloaded over 100,000 times and this suit yielded an injunction against only one infringer, \"that result is\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   in relation to the serious online piracy problem Plaintiffs seek to combat.\" This conclusion makes little sense in light of the district court's Case Management Order, which allows copyright holders to sue only one BitTorrent infringer at a time. Under that Order, an injunction against one infringer is the\n   <em>\n    best possible result\n   </em>\n   Glacier could have achieved in this suit. An assertion that \"lots of other people are doing it, too\" is not a persuasive equitable principle and does not counsel toward a denial of fees. Instead, we see dissonance between the district court's citation to the large number of infringers and its conclusion that fees are unnecessary as a deterrent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B. DETERRENCE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Overall, the district court did not appropriately weigh the interests of deterrence and compensation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Magnuson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"571870\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/85/1424/#p1432\">\n    85 F.3d at 1432\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Because it is not apparent from the district court's decision that it considered the factors listed in\n   <em>\n    Fogerty\n   </em>\n   , particularly the goal of deterring future copyright infringements, we remand for reconsideration of this issue.\"). The court asserted without support that a \"financial penalty\" of $1,500 (consisting of the costs and the agreed statutory damages) \"is sufficient to deter [Turchin], as well as others, from illegally downloading movies in the future.\" The record belies this contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   In fact, Turchin continued to use BitTorrent to pirate copyrighted content even after he received notice that he might be at risk of legal penalties-right up until the day before his deposition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a\n   court may order fee-shifting to deter repeated instances of infringement). Turchin was \"associated with\" 700 pirated titles, an amount that may be worth more in economic value than $1,500. An avid BitTorrent user like Turchin may rationally decide that the risk of being caught and sued for $1,500 is worth the price of admission for access to unlimited media.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Further, the district court identified various BitTorrent cases with stipulated consent judgments of over $8,000 that settled before Turchin continued to download copyrighted titles.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cobbler Nevada, LLC v.

In fact, in recognition of the ubiquity of file sharing and the need to enhance deterrence, in 1999, Congress increased available statutory damages: raising minimum damages from $500 to $750, maximum damages for non-willful infringements from $20,000 to $30,000, and maximum damages for willful infringements from $100,000 to $150,000.

Instead, the court referred only to the prevailing party's (Glacier's) position, confirming that \"a copyright holder's action against an individual BitTorrent copyright infringer is not frivolous under the Copyright Act.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We emphasize the reasonableness factor because \"[w]hen a litigant ... is clearly correct, the likelihood that he will recover fees from the opposing (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , unreasonable) party gives him an incentive to litigate the case all the way to the end. The holder of a copyright that has obviously been infringed has good reason to bring and maintain a suit even if the damages at stake are small.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1986\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court's guidance squarely addresses the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The failure to analyze Turchin's conduct in the litigation is particularly problematic because his actions added to Glacier's attorney's fees. Although an \"infringer with no reasonable defense has every reason to give in quickly, before each side's litigation costs mount,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n    at 1987\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Turchin delayed resolution of this case for nearly eight months from when he was first notified of Glacier's claims. Because Turchin did not respond to letter inquiries, Glacier needed to seek leave to subpoena Turchin for a deposition. There, Turchin admitted to regularly using BitTorrent to download content. Notwithstanding those admissions, Turchin did not file a responsive pleading for almost three months, causing Glacier to file a notice of default in May 2016. Only then did Turchin file an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Despite having previously admitted to regularly using BitTorrent to download media without permission and conceding that he downloaded\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   , Turchin denied liability, sought costs and fees from Glacier, and asserted seven baseless affirmative defenses. For example, Turchin argued that \"[a]ny downloading or uploading of the copyrighted work was permitted by the doctrine of fair use\" and that the film was not eligible for copyright protection under the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    scenes a faire\n   </em>\n   . But, in fact, this was not \"a close and difficult case.\"\n   <em>\n    Seltzer v. Green Day, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4071822\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/725/1170/#p1181\">\n    725 F.3d 1170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1181 (9th Cir. 2013). The district court, however, never considered the unreasonableness of Turchin's positions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    E. OTHER FACTORS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   We also note that the district court did not assess motivation, a potentially relevant factor here. Given Turchin's constant BitTorrent use (even after receiving notice of this suit) and his multiple admissions to unlawfully downloading content on the network (including\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   ), it may be that Turchin's affirmative defenses were not made in good faith.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Halicki Films, LLC v. Sanderson Sales &amp; Mktg.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052252\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/547/1213/#p1231\">\n    547 F.3d 1213\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1231 (9th Cir. 2008). And because Turchin repeatedly distributed copies despite the express warnings in\n   <em>\n    American Heist\n   </em>\n   that unlicensed duplication is illegal and will result in penalties, it may be that his copyright infringement\n   was willful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Historical Research v. Cabral\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7636460\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/80/377/#p379\">\n    80 F.3d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 379 (9th Cir. 1996) (noting that \"willful infringement is an important factor favoring an award of fees\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ON REMAND, THE DISTRICT COURT MUST ASSESS THE SPECIFICS OF THIS CASE\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In sum, based on a generally unfavorable view of other BitTorrent litigation, the district court abused its discretion by denying fees without assessing the particulars of this case. The court's analysis of whether fees are warranted should be based on Glacier's case against Turchin-and not on the court's view of BitTorrent litigation in general or on the conduct of Glacier's counsel in other suits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To be sure, the unfortunate facts of other BitTorrent cases may well warrant a denial of fees in certain cases. But an approach that furthers the goals of the Copyright Act considers the facts of a given case, weighs the appropriate factors, and makes a fee determination based on the conduct of both parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As the Supreme Court recently counseled, the district court \"must view all the circumstances of a case\n   <em>\n    on their own terms\n   </em>\n   , in light of the Copyright Act's essential goals.\"\n   <em>\n    Kirtsaeng\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597549\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1979/#p1985\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1989\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).
