Plaintiffs are a group of American, Israeli, and Canadian citizens who sued Hezbollah and two foreign banks for injuries sustained during the attacks. In one action, the American plaintiffs allege that Hezbollah's rocket attacks amounted to acts of international terrorism, in violation of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA). In a second action, all of the plaintiffs accuse the banks of funding Hezbollah's attacks, in violation of both the ATA and the Alien Tort Statute (ATS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The district court dismissed both complaints. The court concluded that the ATA's so-called act-of-war exception precluded the claims under that statute, and that the presumption against extraterritoriality barred the ATS claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   We vacate the district court's dismissal with respect to the ATA claims and remand for further proceedings. We conclude that the district court must first determine that it has personal jurisdiction over the defendants before applying the\n   statute's act-of-war exception. We affirm the district court's dismissal of the claims under the ATS based on the Supreme Court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    200 L.Ed.2d 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which holds that foreign corporations (like the bank defendants here) are not subject to liability under that statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The complaints in these cases contain the following allegations, which we assume are true given that the claims before us on appeal were dismissed based on the alleged facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    English v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3575880,3664297,3664620,3575631\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/717/968/\">\n    717 F.3d 968\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 971 (D.C. Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah militants left Lebanon, crossed the Israeli border, and kidnapped and killed several Israeli soldiers. Israel responded by mounting a ground offensive in Lebanon and deploying a bombing campaign against Hezbollah. Hezbollah then initiated a campaign of rocket attacks, firing thousands of unguided rockets into civilian populations in northern Israel, striking cities, towns, and villages. The conflict ended on August 14, 2006, when the United Nations brokered a cease-fire between Hezbollah, Israel, and Lebanon. Over the course of the 34-day conflict, numerous persons lost their lives, including more than 1,000 Lebanese civilians, between 250 and 500 members of Hezbollah, 119 Israeli soldiers, and 43 Israeli civilians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2009 and 2010, plaintiffs filed two separate actions to recover for their injuries from Hezbollah's rocket attacks. In the first action, a group of American plaintiffs brought Anti-Terrorism Act claims against Hezbollah, Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act claims against North Korea for funding the rocket attacks, and common law tort claims against both defendants. In the second action, the same American plaintiffs brought ATA claims against Bank Saderat PLC for transferring funds from Iran to Hezbollah, and Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act claims against Iran, the Central Bank of Iran, and Bank Saderat Iran for supporting the rocket attacks. The second action also included claims by a group of non-American plaintiffs against Bank Saderat Iran and Bank Saderat PLC under the Alien Tort Statute. In addition, all plaintiffs in the second action raised claims under Israeli tort law against Bank Saderat Iran and Bank Saderat PLC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court largely addressed the two cases together. Because Hezbollah and North Korea failed to appear after being served, the plaintiffs moved for a default judgment against those defendants. Bank Saderat Iran and Bank Saderat PLC both appeared and moved to dismiss the claims against them for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or personal jurisdiction, and for failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 20, 2013, the district court dismissed the Anti-Terrorism Act claims (which had been brought against Hezbollah and Bank Saderat PLC), holding that the ATA's act-of-war exception precluded liability. The court also dismissed the Alien Tort Statute claims (which had been brought against Bank Saderat PLC and Bank Saderat Iran), based on the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n   <em>\n    Kaplan v. Cent. Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874018\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/185/#p204\">\n    961 F.Supp.2d 185\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 204-05 (D.D.C. 2013). And the court dismissed the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act claims against Bank Saderat Iran, because the bank was not the \"agency or instrumentality of a foreign state.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 198-99.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On July 24, 2014, the district court issued an opinion concluding that Iran and North Korea, but not the Central Bank of Iran, had materially supported Hezbollah's attacks in violation of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. On September 30,\n   2016, after further proceedings on the claims against Iran and North Korea, the district court entered a default judgment against those defendants, awarding the plaintiffs more than $169 million in compensatory and punitive damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their Anti-Terrorism Act claims against Hezbollah and Bank Saderat PLC, as well as the dismissal of their Alien Tort Statute claims against Bank Saderat PLC and Bank Saderat Iran. Because Hezbollah had not entered an appearance, we appointed an amicus curiae to present arguments supporting the portions of the district court's judgment at issue on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We initially consider two challenges to our appellate jurisdiction. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201291\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we may review \"final decisions\" of the district courts in civil cases if an appeal is taken within thirty days of entry of the judgment or order being challenged.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A). Bank Saderat PLC and Bank Saderat Iran (the Banks) argue that plaintiffs' appeal is untimely because the district court entered its order dismissing the claims against the Banks on August 20, 2013, more than three years before the plaintiffs (on November 27, 2016) filed their notice of appeal concerning those claims. Amicus, for its part, argues that plaintiffs' appeal of the dismissal of the claims against Hezbollah is premature because the district court's September 30, 2016, order was not a \"final\" decision within the meaning of Section 1291. We disagree on both counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We first address the timeliness of the plaintiffs' appeal of the August 2013 dismissal of their claims against the Banks. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b) governs the entry of final judgment in a case involving multiple claims and parties. In order to enter \"a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties,\" a district court must \"expressly determine[ ] that there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Otherwise, any decision \"that adjudicates ... the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties\" is not a final, appealable judgment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Relatedly, our court has determined that unserved defendants \"are not 'parties' within the meaning of Rule 54(b).\"\n   <em>\n    Cambridge Holdings Grp., Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563189,3484415\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1356/\">\n    489 F.3d 1356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1360 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Therefore, \"a district court order disposing of all claims against all properly served defendants\" generally constitutes a final judgment \"even if claims against those not properly served remain unresolved.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1360-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Relying on that aspect of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   , the Banks contend that the plaintiffs' appeal is untimely. The Banks observe that, at the time of the district court's August 2013 dismissal of the claims against them, the remaining defendants in the case involving the Banks-Iran and Central Bank of Iran (CBI)-had not yet been properly served. Thus, in the Banks' view, Iran and CBI were not \"parties\" for purposes of Rule 54(b), meaning that the August 2013 order constituted a final judgment \"disposing of all claims against all properly served defendants.\"\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563189,3484415\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1356/\">\n    489 F.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That order, the Banks submit, thus needed to be appealed within 30 days.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The Banks are correct that, under\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   , the existence of unresolved claims against unserved defendants generally will not preclude treatment of an order disposing of all other claims as a final, appealable judgment. But\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   also recognized the possibility of a different result when the district court affirmatively contemplates further proceedings on the claims against the unserved defendants. We observed\n   that, in the Ninth Circuit, \"an order disposing of all claims only against served parties is not final if 'it is clear from the course of proceedings that further adjudication is contemplated' by the district court.\"\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563189,3484415\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1356/\">\n    489 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1360 n.2 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Disabled Rights Action Comm. v. Las Vegas Events, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9375991\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/375/861/#p872\">\n    375 F.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872 (9th Cir. 2004) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although we had no occasion in\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   to consider whether to adopt the same approach, we do so today. We conclude that, when a district court makes plain that it foresees further proceedings on unresolved claims against defendants who have yet to be properly served, a decision resolving all the claims against the properly served defendants is not a final, appealable judgment. In that situation, any appeal should await resolution of the contemplated further proceedings on the claims against the as-yet-unserved defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   That approach vindicates Rule 54(b)'s central purpose of avoiding the \"piecemeal disposition of litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cambridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3563189,3484415\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/489/1356/\">\n    489 F.3d at 1361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also ensures that Rule 54(b) continues to enable district courts to lend \"welcome certainty to the appellate procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. v. Mackey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105215\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/427/#p435\">\n    351 U.S. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 435,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1105215\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/351/427/#p435\">\n    76 S.Ct. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20L.%20Ed.%201297\">\n    100 L.Ed. 1297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1956). That is because, if a district court wishes to allow the immediate appeal of its disposition of claims against the properly served defendants even though it affirmatively contemplates further proceedings on the remaining claims, it can do so by expressly determining \"that there is no just reason for delay.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Consider the anomalous implications of a contrary approach, under which the resolution of claims against properly served defendants would be considered a final judgment even though the district court intends further proceedings against as-yet-unserved defendants. In such a regime, the district court would be unable to dispose of the claims against properly served defendants without entering a final judgment, even if it fully expects other defendants to be imminently served. The court might then opt to delay announcing its resolution of the claims against the already served defendants so as to avoid fracturing the case, contravening the Rules' general preference for the swift resolution of claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 1. The better course is to recognize that, when a district court plainly contemplates further proceedings on remaining claims against as-yet-unserved defendants, the resolution of the claims against properly served defendants is not a final, appealable judgment (absent an express and reasonable determination of \"no just reason for delay\" under Rule 54(b) ).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bldg. Indus. Ass'n of Superior California v. Babbitt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1366610,3666463\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/161/740/\">\n    161 F.3d 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (D.C. Cir. 1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Applying that approach here, it is clear that, when the district court dismissed the claims against the Banks in August 2013, it contemplated further proceedings on the claims against the unserved defendants, Iran and CBI. In its memorandum opinion dismissing the claims against the Banks, the court repeatedly referred to Iran and CBI as \"the remaining defendants,\" and the FSIA claims against them as the \"remaining claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Kaplan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3874018\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/961/185/#p204\">\n    961 F.Supp.2d at 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court also discussed the failed previous attempts at service and ordered the plaintiffs to serve Iran and CBI through diplomatic channels within twenty-one days.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, in its order accompanying the opinion, the court dismissed the claims against the Banks in two lines and then devoted a full page to describing how the plaintiffs should \"commence service of process via diplomatic channels\" for their \"remaining claims.\" Order,\n   <em>\n    Kaplan v. Cent. Bank of Islamic Republic of Iran\n   </em>\n   , No. 10-cv-483 (D.D.C. Aug. 20, 2013), ECF No. 41. In short, both the opinion and\n   order make clear the district court's expectation that the remaining defendants could be properly served and the claims against them would then proceed to resolution (which in fact happened).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In those circumstances, we hold that the district court's August 20, 2013, order, dismissing the claims against the Banks, was not a final, appealable judgment. Rather, the court's October 28, 2016, order denying plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration (and for alteration or amendment of the judgment) was the operative appealable judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4)(A)(iv). Plaintiffs timely filed their notice of appeal within 30 days of that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Whereas the Banks contend that the appeal of the dismissal of the claims against them was too late, Amicus suggests that the appeal of the dismissal of the claims against Hezbollah may have been too early. The district court initially dismissed the ATA claims against Hezbollah on August 20, 2013. And on August 20, 2015, plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the tort claims against Hezbollah. After further proceedings on claims involving other defendants, the district court, on September 30, 2016, entered an \"Order and Judgment\" that it characterized as a \"final judgment.\" Order &amp; Judgment,\n   <em>\n    Kaplan v. Hezbollah\n   </em>\n   , No. 09-cv-646 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2016), ECF No. 84. One week later, on October 7, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal concerning the dismissal of the claims against Hezbollah.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As we have seen, an order resolving fewer than all claims against all defendants generally is not a final, appealable order.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b). Amicus argues that we may lack jurisdiction over the appeal concerning the claims against Hezbollah insofar as the district court's September 30, 2016, order left unresolved certain of the claims in the case involving Hezbollah. In particular, although the plaintiffs' complaint in that case alleged both Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) claims and tort claims against North Korea, the district court expressly referenced only the FSIA claims in its opinion granting judgment on those claims. To the extent the tort claims against North Korea remained unresolved, Amicus contends, there may have been no final, appealable judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that there was a final, appealable judgment because the district court treated the FSIA and tort claims as a common, undifferentiated whole. That is consistent with the structure of the FSIA, under which foreign sovereigns are rendered \"liable in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201606\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Owens v.

Cir. 2017) (noting that because \"[n]one of the original exceptions in the FSIA created a substantive cause of action against a foreign state,\" plaintiffs bringing an FSIA claim generally must rely on a source of \"underlying substantive law\" such as tort law).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Throughout the proceedings in the district court, the court and parties treated the case as one involving claims brought under the FSIA, such that the tort claims were subsumed in the FSIA claims. For instance, after dismissing the ATA claims against Hezbollah, the court explained that only the FSIA claims against North Korea remained. And any ambiguity about the district court's intent to end the case-with respect to all claims-was resolved when the court issued its September 30, 2016, order, which it termed a \"final appealable order\" entering \"final judgment\" against North Korea for violating the FSIA. The judgment awarded the plaintiffs over $169 million in damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Plaintiffs, at that point, had obtained from North Korea all of the relief they sought, for all of the injuries they alleged. There was no remaining injury to be redressed via tort claims-any separate recovery on those claims would have been fully redundant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kassman v. Am.

Consequently, the judgment, along with the district court's unequivocal words of finality, brought the action to a close, just as the district court intended.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Attias v.

We thus have appellate jurisdiction to hear the appeal from that judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Recall that the district court dismissed the Anti-Terrorism Act claims against Hezbollah and Bank Saderat PLC under the statute's act-of-war exception, and dismissed the Alien Tort Statute claims against both of the Banks based on the presumption against extraterritoriality. Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred by resolving the ATA claims on those grounds without first confirming that it had personal jurisdiction over the defendants. And because we have a duty to assure ourselves of our jurisdiction, we must also consider whether the court erred in the same respect with regard to the ATS claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We take up the following questions in addressing whether the district court was obligated to confirm the existence of personal jurisdiction before resolving the ATA and ATS claims: (i) can plaintiffs challenge the dismissals on that basis even though they believe personal jurisdiction exists?; (ii) if so, is personal jurisdiction an issue that a district court must examine before reaching the merits of a claim?; (iii) if so, is the ATA's act-of-war exception a merits issue, such that it can be reached only after assuring the existence of personal jurisdiction?; and (iv) similarly, can the ATS claims be resolved based on the presumption against extraterritoriality, or based on the Supreme Court's recent rejection of ATS liability for foreign corporations,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jesner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12611257\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/1386/\">\n    138 S.Ct. 1386\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without first addressing personal jurisdiction?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   We agree with the plaintiffs as to the ATA claims, and so vacate the dismissal of those claims and remand to enable the district court to address personal jurisdiction.

In light of plaintiffs' position to that effect in the district court, Amicus argues that plaintiffs either waived the ability to raise a challenge based on the district court's failure to assure the existence of personal jurisdiction, or lack standing to bring such a challenge on appeal. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Plaintiffs do not now take back their previous assertion that the district court had personal jurisdiction over the defendants. Instead, plaintiffs want the district court to establish the existence of personal jurisdiction rather than bypass the issue, because a failure by the court to establish personal jurisdiction could undermine the enforceability of its judgment in a subsequent proceeding. For instance, if this court were to reverse the district court's dismissals and plaintiffs ultimately were to prevail on the claims, a failure to establish personal jurisdiction could impair the plaintiffs' ability to enforce the judgment in their favor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Combs v.

Thus, in\n   <em>\n    Kramer\n   </em>\n   , we held that \"issues related to ... a statutory limit (even one classified as jurisdictional for many purposes)\" are not primary under\n   <em>\n    Steel Co.\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3870721,3562609\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/481/788/\">\n    481 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   791 ;\n   <em>\n    see also Chalabi\n   </em>\n   (stating that \"[t]here is no Article III question here: [the plaintiff's claim] concerns only the limits of our statutory jurisdiction under the ...

The law has evolved, however, so I doubt that we can now say that a lack of statutory jurisdiction need not be a barrier to deciding issues on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Conceptually, this is unsurprising. Under Article III, jurisdiction is limited both by the bounds of the \"judicial power\" as articulated in Article III, \u00a7 2, and by the extent to which Congress has vested that power in the lower courts,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   U.S. CONST . art.
