For the reasons below, we now vacate the district court's forfeiture orders and remand for further proceedings. All other aspects of the district court's judgment are reaffirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 2013, a federal grand jury indicted Lorene Chittenden for originating and submitting fraudulent mortgage loan applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the government's request, the district court restrained nearly all of Chittenden's assets pending the outcome of the charges. After a seven-day trial, a jury convicted Chittenden of one count of conspiracy to commit bank and mail fraud, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201349\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and ten counts of bank fraud, under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201344\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The evidence showed that Chittenden, a loan officer at George Mason Mortgage, earned hundreds of thousands of dollars in loan commissions by falsely inflating the incomes of unknowing, first-time homebuyers. Higher stated incomes resulted in larger loans, and because each commission was a percentage of the loan, larger loans generally meant higher loan commissions. Chittenden worked in concert with numerous realtors who received hefty real estate commissions by selling houses to her clients. Similar to the loan commissions, each real estate commission was a percentage of the house's sale price such that higher sale prices resulted in greater profits for the realtors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Post-trial, the district court entered a forfeiture order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2), pursuant to the procedures in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The order consisted of a\n   $1,513,378.82 money judgment \"representing the foreseeable proceeds of the offenses of which the defendant has been found guilty.\" J.A. 1967. The court noted that Chittenden personally had received only $231,000 in fraudulent loan commissions and that none of Chittenden's restrained assets were proceeds traceable to the fraud-indeed, the government had stipulated as much. But, relying on our decision in\n   <em>\n    United States v. McHan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7640751\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/101/1027/\">\n    101 F.3d 1027\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 1996), the court concluded that Chittenden was jointly and severally liable for the reasonably foreseeable proceeds of the conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, because the government had not recovered any proceeds from Chittenden's co-conspirators, it moved for forfeiture of Chittenden's untainted, restrained assets to satisfy the entire $1,513,378.82 money judgment. Under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20853\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (p), a court \"shall order the forfeiture of any [untainted] property of the defendant\" when, \"as a result of any act or omission of the defendant,\" the proceeds of the underlying crime have been placed beyond the court's reach. The district court found that Chittenden's coconspirators had dissipated, comingled, or transferred their respective proceeds such that the government was unable to locate or seize them. Relying on\n   <em>\n    McHan\n   </em>\n   again, the court determined that \u00a7 853(p) required forfeiture of Chittenden's untainted assets as a substitute for her co-conspirators' proceeds that the government could not recover. However, the court found that the government had failed to prove that $250,000 of co-conspirator proceeds and all $231,000 of Chittenden's proceeds were in fact out of reach. Accordingly, the court entered a second order reducing the amount of untainted assets the government could take from $1,513,378.82 to $1,032,378.82.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Chittenden appealed to this Court, challenging the initial seizure of her assets, the validity of her conviction, and the forfeiture orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Chittenden\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277323\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/188/\">\n    848 F.3d at 192\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Specifically, she argued that the government's pretrial seizure of her assets violated her Sixth Amendment right to counsel, that the government failed to present sufficient evidence to support her convictions, that the district court erred in admitting certain hearsay evidence, that the government constructively amended the indictment, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to enter the forfeiture order, and that the district court improperly ordered forfeiture of her untainted assets based on her co-conspirators' acts of dissipating the conspiracy proceeds.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277323\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/188/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12277323\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/848/188/\">\n    at 194-204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

But \u00a7 2461, and by extension \u00a7 981, does not apply when a criminal forfeiture provision applies to the crime charged.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     United States v.

Here, a criminal forfeiture provision does apply to the crimes charged:\n    <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20982\">\n     18 U.S.C. \u00a7 982\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a)(2) provides that the court \"shall order\" forfeiture when imposing a sentence on a person convicted of certain crimes affecting a financial institution, including bank fraud, conspiracy to commit bank fraud, and conspiracy to commit mail fraud-the offenses listed in Chittenden's judgment of conviction.
