These applications, supported by an attorney's affidavit explaining the reasons the evidence is necessary, are often filed ex parte and under seal. The issue on appeal in this case-a question of first impression for this Circuit-is whether one defendant in a criminal case can get access to the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications and supporting documents that were filed under seal by another defendant's attorney in the same criminal case, either because of the presumptive right of public access to court records or upon a showing of special need. In view of the circumstances presented here, the district court properly denied the request for disclosure, and we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. THE PARTIES, TRIAL, AND SLEUGH'S APPEAL\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In March 2014, Damion Sleugh and Shawndale Boyd were indicted together on charges of (1) conspiring to distribute or to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, and (2) attempted possession with intent to distribute marijuana, each in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20846\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 841(a)(1) &amp; (b)(1)(D) ; (3) robbery affecting interstate commerce, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) ; (4) using or carrying a firearm during or in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ; and (5) using a firearm during a drug trafficking crime and causing a murder, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (j). Sleugh was also charged as being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). The charges arose from a five-pound marijuana drug deal that Sleugh and Boyd arranged, which ended in the death of the man who was delivering the marijuana, Vincent Muzac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   While awaiting trial, Boyd filed ex parte applications with the court seeking several Rule 17(c) subpoenas. Boyd requested that these applications be filed under seal. The subpoenas sought records relating to multiple cell phone numbers from various service providers for the time period surrounding the date of the alleged crimes, along with some surveillance video from other sources. To support the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications, and as required by local rule, Boyd's defense attorney submitted affidavits describing the need for the records.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Those affidavits were also filed ex parte and under seal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 5, 2015, Boyd pleaded guilty to all counts except the murder charge. He agreed to cooperate with the government, and he testified against Sleugh at trial. Sleugh also testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Evidence was presented at trial that Sleugh and Boyd arranged to purchase five pounds of marijuana from Vincent Muzac-Boyd's friend and co-worker-for $11,000. On the day of the deal, Boyd and Sleugh met at Sleugh's house. They decided to drive separately, Boyd getting a ride from a neighborhood acquaintance known by the nick-name \"Q,\" and Sleugh, carrying the purchase money, driving a white\n   Ford Escape that had been rented by Boyd's mother. They met at a Walmart parking lot, where there was also a Starbucks. Boyd met Muzac at the Starbucks. Video evidence showed Boyd and Muzac leaving the Starbucks together. Once in the parking lot, Boyd walked by himself up to the white Ford Escape where Sleugh was waiting. Boyd spoke to Sleugh for a few seconds. Boyd then walked away and entered \"Q's\" vehicle. Boyd and Q drove off, leaving the area. Muzac then walked to the Ford Escape where Sleugh was waiting and got inside. Four minutes later, the Ford Escape drove off without Muzac. Muzac's body was later found lying in the parking lot next to only one pound of marijuana, and without the $11,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Boyd testified that, after he and Q left the Starbucks parking lot, he tried repeatedly to contact Muzac on his cell phone, with no success. Later that day, Boyd met Sleugh at Sleugh's apartment, and asked Sleugh if everything was okay. Sleugh told Boyd that he and Muzac argued about the quality of the marijuana, that Muzac punched Sleugh in the mouth, and that Sleugh then shot Muzac in the arm. Boyd testified that Sleugh told him that after he shot Muzac, he pushed him out of the car and left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Muzac ultimately died from his wounds. Boyd testified that he did not become aware that Muzac had died until he and Sleugh were arrested on February 22, 2014 and charged in California state court with Muzac's murder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sleugh testified to a different version of events. He claimed that Q-the man who drove off with Boyd in another vehicle-shot Muzac.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 17, 2015, the jury convicted Sleugh of all charges. Sleugh was sentenced on November 4, 2015 to life in prison. Boyd received a three-year prison sentence. Sleugh appealed his conviction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Damion Sleugh\n   </em>\n   , No. 15-10547 (9th Cir.). At Sleugh's request, we stayed the briefing schedule of Sleugh's direct appeal while he sought permission from the district court to unseal Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Sleugh argued to the district court that he needed access to Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications for his appeal because of the \"possibility\" that Boyd testified inconsistently with Boyd's counsel's assertions in those applications. Sleugh did not specify any particular portion of Boyd's testimony as problematic, and did not articulate how he thought counsel's assertions in support of obtaining the cell phone and other records were likely to contain any inconsistent or otherwise impeaching statements. Sleugh reasoned that Boyd's shift from defending the case to pleading guilty and testifying for the Government suggested that Boyd either misrepresented facts in the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications, or lied during his testimony. Put differently, Sleugh asserts that Boyd's testimony on behalf of the Government must have been inconsistent with any defense theory Boyd used to support the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications. Standing on that assumption, Sleugh concluded that he could have used the statements of Boyd's counsel in the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications to cross-examine Boyd at trial. Sleugh also contended that he had a right to access the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications as judicial records. The magistrate judge who originally granted Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications denied Sleugh's motion to unseal them. The district court affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Sleugh appealed the district court's decision denying disclosure, Boyd\n   intervened, arguing that his Rule 17(c) subpoena applications should remain under seal. Sleugh's direct appeal of his conviction remains stayed, pending the instant appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A district court's denial of a motion to unseal is reviewed for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Auto Safety v. Chrysler Grp., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4058023\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/809/1092/#p1096\">\n    809 F.3d 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1096 (9th Cir 2016).

Fed. R. Crim. P. 17(c)(1). The Supreme Court has made it clear that a party seeking production of materials under a Rule 17(c) subpoena must demonstrate to the court \"(1) relevancy; (2) admissibility; [and] (3) specificity.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

If the grounds articulated in support of the subpoena request were made part of the public record, such a showing could reveal counsel's trial strategies or defense theories to the opposing party, here, the government. This concern about revealing defense strategies to the government could also apply to revelations of such confidential theories to co-defendants, who may have adverse interests-the issue implicated in this appeal. Recognizing this potential conundrum, some courts, like the district court here, have local rules that permit defendants to file their Rule 17(c) applications under seal for \"good cause.\" N.D. Cal.

Again, Sleugh does not identify any portion of Boyd's testimony which he believes is false (other than his statements regarding the government's promises, discussed below), and Sleugh does not explain how the attorney's affidavit detailing the relevance of the cell phone and other records sought in Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoenas could be used to show that Boyd's trial testimony was false. Sleugh simply speculates that the assertions of counsel in Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications must be different from Boyd's trial testimony. Underlying\n   Sleugh's conclusion is, again, the assumption that Boyd's testimony during trial was inconsistent with any defense theory that Boyd's counsel proffered in the pre-trial Rule 17(c) subpoena applications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Sleugh assumes too much. Boyd's testimony against Sleugh-that Sleugh admitted to shooting Muzac and that Boyd was not present at the time of the shooting-were compelling defense theories for Boyd. Sleugh offers no reason for believing that Boyd's counsel would have advanced a theory inconsistent with Boyd's trial testimony in the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications. Nothing about the face of Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications suggests that the affidavits in support of those applications would be likely to undercut Boyd's testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Sleugh also argues that Boyd \"lied\" when he testified on redirect that the government made no promises to him in connection with his cooperation. Sleugh's contention takes Boyd's testimony out of its surrounding context. During cross-examination, Sleugh's trial counsel asked Boyd if the government \"promised [Boyd] that they would bring a motion for a downward departure ... if the government feels that you have provided substantial assistance to the government through your cooperation.\" Boyd answered that such a motion was \"only a possibility. It's not guaranteed. It's subject to the government's discretion\" and that the judge is \"the only person that will be sentencing me on this case[.]\" Therefore, when Boyd later testified on redirect that the government did not promise him anything, Boyd clearly was referencing the fact that any government \"promises\" were not guaranteed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Regardless, Sleugh does not explain how any potentially inconsistent testimony by Boyd creates a \"special need\" for Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications. Even assuming the applications contain \"impeachment material,\" as Sleugh alleges, they cannot affect this appeal because they were never in front of the jury, and we do not engage in\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   fact-finding on appeal. Nor could Sleugh use the statements to bring a sufficiency of the evidence challenge to his conviction, because for such a challenge, \"we [only] look at the evidence actually presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. Sayakhom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"857751\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/186/928/\">\n    186 F.3d 928\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 942 n.7 (9th Cir. 1999).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Further, the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications pre-dated the plea agreement and Boyd's cooperation, and the subpoenas themselves mainly sought cell phone records and some surveillance video. Even if Boyd were caught in a lie about whether his plea agreement involved certain promises by the government, such a misstatement would not necessarily create an entitlement for Sleugh to examine the sealed affidavits proffered by Boyd's attorney to support the Rule 17(c) subpoenas for records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   We hold that Sleugh failed to present a \"special need\" to access Boyd's sealed Rule 17(c) subpoena applications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   c.\n   <em>\n    There is a continued need to seal Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena materials.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Alternatively, Sleugh argues that there is no reason to continue sealing Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena materials. He reasons that Boyd pleaded guilty, testified, and was sentenced and released. Therefore, according to Sleugh, revealing the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications poses no risk to Boyd.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Sleugh has a point, to an extent. There is some support for the position that these subpoena applications should not be sealed forever. Regarding transcripts of sealed trial proceedings, we require that such transcripts \"must be released when the danger of prejudice has passed.\"\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Newspapers, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1567154\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/156/940/#p946\">\n    156 F.3d at 948\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). If there is no longer any need to seal the Rule 17(c) subpoena materials at issue here, then perhaps they should be unsealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   There are two problems with applying this rule here, though. First, unlike the trial transcripts at issue in\n   <em>\n    Phoenix Newspapers\n   </em>\n   , which we held were entitled to a presumption of public access under the First Amendment \"experience and logic\" test, Rule 17(c) subpoena applications do not have a history of being available to the public; such applications do not constitute evidence, and they do not determine the merits of a criminal case. Accordingly, it makes sense that it is harder to unseal Rule 17(c) subpoena applications than trial transcripts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Second, in this case there is a continuing need to seal these Rule 17(c) subpoena applications. Boyd's plea deal and sentence resolved only his federal charges, but Boyd was initially charged with murder in California state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   That charge was dismissed, but the state is not precluded from refiling that charge against Boyd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Berardi v.

Because there is no statute of limitations for murder in California, the specter of that charge continues to loom over Boyd.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%20799\">\n    Cal.

Also, there is a possibility that the federal government could pursue the murder charge against Boyd should he breach his plea agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Unsealing Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena applications could reveal Boyd's defense theories to the state and federal governments for any future trial. The prospect of undermining the confidentiality of Boyd's defense strategies justified sealing these materials in the first place, which Sleugh does not contest.

The Court held that if defense counsel for an indigent defendant \"is convinced, after conscientious investigation, that the appeal is frivolous, of course, he may ask to withdraw on that account.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166128\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/674/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166128\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/674/\">\n     at 675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166128\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/674/\">\n     78 S.Ct. 974\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Then, \"[i]f the court is satisfied that counsel has diligently investigated the possible grounds of appeal, and agrees with counsel's evaluation of the case, then leave to withdraw may be allowed and leave to appeal may be denied.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6166128\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/674/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Thus,\n    <em>\n     Ellis\n    </em>\n    simply reminds us of the noncontroversial expectation that counsel diligently and conscientiously investigate grounds for appeal. Nothing in\n    <em>\n     Ellis\n    </em>\n    requires the production of a co-defendant's trial strategies or defense theories. Similarly,\n    <em>\n     Hardy v. United States\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11719292\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/277/#p282\">\n     375 U.S. 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 282,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11719292\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/277/#p282\">\n     84 S.Ct. 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11719292\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/375/277/#p282\">\n     11 L.Ed.2d 331\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1964), only held that appellate counsel for indigent defendants are entitled to a free copy of the entire trial transcript. This entitlement does not include a co-defendant's sealed filings.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-66\">\n    In response to Sleugh's counsel's request at oral argument, we reviewed in camera the sealed affidavits that Boyd's counsel submitted in support of the Rule 17(c) subpoena applications. Sleugh's position, that they contain factual assertions contradicting Boyd's trial testimony, is without merit. In situations where a reasonable and plausible basis is articulated suggesting that factual assertions attributable to a witness in a Rule 17(c) application contradict that witness's in-court testimony, a district court could also conduct such an in camera review to protect the integrity of the process.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-67\">\n    Because we hold that Sleugh has failed to demonstrate a \"special need\" for Boyd's Rule 17(c) subpoena application materials, we need not address whether Boyd's counsel waived any attorney-work product protection to those materials by filing them with the court under seal, or whether attorneys' representations as to defense theories in affidavits supporting subpoena applications could be attributable to the client for impeachment or other purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    We grant Boyd's request for judicial notice of his state court charges.

There may be instances when there is no longer any need to protect a defendant's theories of defense (\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n    , upon the defendant's death, or when the statute of limitations has run on all charges). Boyd's situation is unique because, as long as he lives, he will always face the risk of another state murder charge. Accordingly, we need not resolve whether all Rule 17(c) subpoena applications should remain under seal in perpetuity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
