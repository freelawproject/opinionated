While stationed in Germany following deployment to Iraq, Allen married Dorothea Baer (\"Mrs. Allen\"), a German citizen. They now have three children. In 2013, the Army ordered Allen to return from Germany to the United States for restationing. Mrs. Allen applied for a visa so she and the children could join him. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (\"USCIS\") approved Allen's Petition for Alien Relative (\"Form I-130\"). But after hosting Mrs. Allen for an interview, an officer with the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt denied her visa application, stating in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   This office regrets to inform you that your visa application is refused because you are ineligible to receive a visa under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(I) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. On July 16, 1998, you were convicted in a German court of theft pursuant to paragraphs 242 and 248a of the German criminal code. This crime constitutes behaviour reflecting moral turpitude. The maximum punishment is over one year in prison. You are eligible to seek a waiver of the grounds of ineligibility by filing an I-601 with USCIS in the United States.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Additionally your visa application is refused because you are ineligible to receive a visa under section 212(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

There is no waiver for this ineligibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The letter is signed \"Consular Officer.\" The consular officer's decision rested on two statutory grounds of inadmissibility in the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"):\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [A]ny alien convicted of, or who admits having committed, or who admits committing acts which constitute the essential elements of-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (I) a crime involving moral turpitude (other than a purely political offense) or an attempt or conspiracy to commit such a crime, or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (II) a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States, or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance (as defined in section 802 of Title 21),\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   is inadmissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Allen brought this action in the Eastern District of California against the Consul General of the U.S. Consulate in Frankfurt, the Consular Section Chief of the same, the United States Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, and the United States Secretary of State. Allen's one and only cause of action was under the APA: Allen argues that the consular decision was legal error,\n   that he had a right to judicial review under the cause of action codified at\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and that the district court should set aside the decision as \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20702\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 706(2)(A). Allen argues that the consular officer committed legal error when he identified Mrs. Allen's 1998 theft conviction as a \"crime involving moral turpitude,\" because the German theft statute does not categorically require an intent to deprive a person of property permanently-which he alleges is an element of the generic offense under federal law in the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Castillo-Cruz v.

Similarly, Allen claims that the consular officer committed legal error when he identified Mrs. Allen's 1997 conviction for illegal acquisition of narcotics under the German Criminal Code as her disqualifying \"violation of ... any law ... relating to a controlled substance,\" allegedly because those proceedings did not result in a \"conviction,\" as the German court applied only the ameliorative, rehabilitative, diversionary provisions of German juvenile law in consideration of Mrs. Allen's youth.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lujan-Armendariz v.

First, because she had been convicted of a theft offense, the consular officer determined that she was ineligible for a visa because theft is a crime involving moral turpitude.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I).

Circuit's analysis and conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Saavedra Bruno\n   </em>\n   . If Allen were correct, then constitutional claims would be reviewable under the limited\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   standard, and nonconstitutional claims would be reviewable under the APA; in other words, all claims would be reviewable under some standard. Allen's theory converts consular nonreviewability into consular reviewability. The conclusion flies in the face of more than a century of decisions limiting our review of consular visa decisions. Allen attempts to narrow our focus to\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   error, which he argues is within the province of the judiciary. We reject his argument for several reasons. First, the burden the INA places on consular officers-who may or may not have any formal legal training-is not to make\n   <em>\n    legal\n   </em>\n   determinations in a way that an administrative agency (such as the BIA) or a court might do. Rather the officer is charged with adjudicating visas under rules prescribed by law, and the officer is instructed not to issue a visa if the officer \"knows or has reason to believe that such alien is ineligible to receive a visa\" under any provision of law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201201\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Second, the distinction Allen presses for would eclipse the\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   exception itself. The claims in\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Fiallo\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Din\n   </em>\n   were all legal claims. To be sure, they were legal claims based on the law of the Constitution, as opposed to statutory law, but we fail to see why legal claims based on statute should receive greater protection than legal claims based on the Constitution. Indeed, we think the Court has already rejected such an argument in\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    486 U.S. at 594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There the Court addressed whether a statute giving the Director of the CIA blanket authority to terminate any officer or employee when deemed \"necessary or advisable in the interests of the United States,\" rendered the Director's decisions unreviewable under \u00a7 701(a)(2).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    at 594, 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20403\">\n    50 U.S.C. \u00a7 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) ). Although the Court found that Doe's claims could not be reviewed under the APA, it did find that Doe could nonetheless otherwise raise constitutional claims arising out of his termination, namely that his termination deprived him of liberty and property interests, denied him equal protection under the law, and impaired his right to privacy.\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"222\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    486 U.S. at 601-05\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6221672\" index=\"223\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/486/592/#p599\">\n    108 S.Ct. 2047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . After\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   , we have assumed that the courts will be open to review of constitutional claims, even if they are closed to other claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Am. Fed'n of Gov't Employees Local 1 v.

Allen's argument would flip\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   on its head: Statutory arguments would be subject to full APA review even if constitutional arguments, per\n   <em>\n    Mandel\n   </em>\n   , are not. We find no support for Allen's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Allen also argues that we have previously applied APA review to consular decisions. The cases cited by Allen do not help him. We subjected a State Department decision to APA review in\n   <em>\n    ASSE Int'l Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347102\" index=\"225\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1059/#p1068\">\n    803 F.3d at 1064-68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But it was not a consular visa decision that we reviewed, but rather a State Department decision to disqualify a U.S.-based third-party sponsor participating in the Exchange Visitor Program.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4347102\" index=\"226\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1059/#p1068\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly,\n   <em>\n    Singh v.

But what we faced was the State Department's failure to issue any decision on a visa application at all, a clear violation of a nondiscretionary duty, as \"[a] consular office is required by law to act on visa applications,\" because \"[i]ssuance or refusal [is] mandatory.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588425\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/929/#p931\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11588425\" index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/134/929/#p931\">\n    at 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=22%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2042.81\">\n    22 C.F.R. \u00a7 42.81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). In other words, a visa application must be adjudicated one way or the other.

Whether considered under \u00a7 702(1) or (2), the doctrine of consular nonreviewability is a limitation on the scope of our judicial review and thus precludes our review under \u00a7 706.
