The district court dismissed it as untimely and rejected Ross's argument that it related back to his original, timely petition. Ross argues that the claims in his new petition arose out of facts set out in a state court order attached to his original petition, and therefore the district court erred in failing to apply the relation back doctrine in Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Civil Rule 15(c) ). Because the facts set out in the state court order were not clearly incorporated into Ross's original petition, and Rule 2 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (Habeas Rule 2) precludes the court from construing the petition as incorporating such facts, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2009, Ronald Ross was convicted by a Nevada jury of several theft-related offenses. Ross, who had at least five prior felony convictions, including one for larceny, was sentenced under Nevada's habitual offender statute to a lifetime term of imprisonment with parole eligibility after 20 years.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Nev.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20207.010\">\n    Nev.

Because Ross did not petition for certiorari, the Nevada Supreme Court's judgment became final on February 7, 2011, and AEDPA's one-year limitation period for Ross to file a federal habeas petition began to run.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 30, 2011, Ross timely filed a pro se petition for post-conviction relief (PCR) in Nevada state court, temporarily tolling the one-year period for his federal habeas petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2). Ross asserted five claims for relief, including violations of his right to a speedy trial, and various theories of ineffective assistance of counsel. Ross also attached a 22-page handwritten memorandum, setting forth in great detail the factual bases for his claims. Ross repeatedly referred to this memorandum when the form petition asked for \"supporting facts\" for his claims. After Ross was appointed counsel, he filed a supplemental PCR petition, asserting six specific claims, as well as a claim that the cumulative effect of the alleged errors amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The state trial court denied Ross's amended PCR petition, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed on July 30, 2014. The Nevada Supreme Court's affirmance identified and rejected eight specific arguments for ineffective assistance of counsel, in addition to the cumulative error claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Nevada Supreme Court's remittitur issued on August 18, 2014, and AEDPA's\n   one-year limitation period began to run again the next day.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202244\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2) ;\n   <em>\n    Jefferson v.

Ross used the form \"Petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus Pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   By a Person in State Custody\" promulgated by that district court in its local rules.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habeas R. 2(d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas petition form stated: \"Attach to this petition a copy of all state court written decisions regarding this conviction.\" The habeas petition form also provided detailed instructions, which guided habeas petitioners on how to fill in the blanks in each section of the form in order to explain each of their separate grounds for relief. The form begins with the instruction that the petitioner should \"[s]tate concisely every ground\" for habeas relief and \"[s]ummarize briefly the facts supporting each ground.\" It also provided that Ross could \"attach up to two extra pages stating additional grounds and/or supporting facts.\" The form further cautioned that Ross \"must raise in this petition all grounds for relief that relate to this conviction. Any grounds not raised in this petition will likely be barred from being litigated in a subsequent action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the top of the template for each ground for relief, the form contained the following sentence \"I allege that my state court conviction and/or sentence are unconstitutional, in violation of my ___ Amendment right to ______________, based on these facts: _______________ ....\" Ross alleged three grounds for relief in the space provided by the form, alleging violations of his Fifth Amendment right to due process, his Sixth Amendment right to effective counsel, and his Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process and equal protection. In the space provided for supporting facts, however, Ross wrote substantially the same thing under each ground:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Counsel was ineffective for failing to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1) Secure a speedy trial\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   2) Failed to review evidence and adequately prepare\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   3) Failed to file pretrial motions\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   4) Failed to argue the prejudice of evidence lost prior to trial\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   5) Failed to prepare for jury selection\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   6) Failed to prepare for trial\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   7) Failed to retain defense experts\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   8) Failed to object to the state's use of expert witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ross also attached a handwritten affidavit explaining the reasons for his delay in obtaining a copy of the Nevada Supreme Court's ruling. Ross's affidavit explained that he was not listed on either the distribution list for the Nevada Supreme Court's order of affirmance on July 22, 2014,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor on the distribution list for the court's remittitur on August 18, 2014. The affidavit further alleged that Ross did not receive a copy of the order of affirmance until September 11, 2014, as demonstrated by his signature and time stamp on the front of the envelope. To document both his absence from the distribution lists and the date he received the order of affirmance, he attached: (1) a copy of the Nevada\n   Supreme Court's order of affirmance; (2) a copy of the Nevada Supreme Court's remittitur; (3) an envelope from his counsel; and (4) a letter from his counsel dated September 2, 2014, transmitting a copy of the Nevada Supreme Court's order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The district court appointed counsel for Ross, and on June 8, 2015, Ross filed an amended petition, raising 11 grounds for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This petition was filed nearly eight months after AEDPA's one-year limitation period had expired. After the district court ordered a response, the state moved to dismiss Ross's amended petition as barred by the statute of limitations. The district court granted Nevada's motion to dismiss. It rejected Ross's argument that the facts contained in the Nevada Supreme Court's order of affirmance were incorporated in the original petition, and therefore rejected his contention that the claims in his new petition related back to the date of the original pleading. Nevertheless, the court granted a certificate of appealability on that issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We have jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202253\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and we review de novo a district court's dismissal of an application for a writ of habeas corpus.\n   <em>\n    Jiminez v.

Finally, the dissent contends that because Civil Rule 15(a)(2) allows a court to deny a petitioner leave to file an amended petition, it provides an adequate safeguard against abuse. Dissent at 978. But\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   squarely rejected this argument.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[W]e do not regard Rule 15(a) as a firm check against petition amendments that present new claims dependent upon discrete facts after AEDPA's limitation period has run.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   We therefore reject Ross and the dissent's arguments based on Ross's pro se status at the time of his original petition. This is not to say that pro se habeas petitioners may not benefit from our practice of liberal construction. Consistent with the pleading scheme, a court may liberally construe the legal claims and facts set forth in the petitioner's habeas form, pursuant to Habeas Rule 2(c), as making out a plausible claim for relief. But giving a generous reading to the claims a petitioner has actually made is a far cry from requiring a court to piece together the claims themselves. Whether under the guise of Civil Rule 10(c) or 15(c), even \"a liberal interpretation ... may not supply essential elements of the claim that were not initially pled.\"\n   <em>\n    Ivey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=673%20F.2d%20266\">\n    673 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   268 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hall v.

There is no dispute that Ross did not comply with Habeas Rule 2(c) or the language in the standard form prescribed by the Nevada district court, which required him to \"summarize briefly\" the necessary facts in the space provided for each ground and to \"attach up to two extra pages stating additional\n   grounds and/or supporting facts.\" Unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Dye\n   </em>\n   , Ross did not incorporate the facts supporting his legal allegations by making \"clear and repeated references\" to the document as supporting his legal claims.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5968642\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/1/\">\n    546 U.S. at 4\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5968642\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/546/1/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, Ross made no attempt to do so. His federal habeas petition makes no reference to the state court order or indicates that it sets forth the facts supporting his claimed grounds for relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, his reference to the state court affirmance in his affidavit makes it clear he intended to use it for a different purpose, namely to support his affidavit's explanation of the timing of when he learned of the state court's ruling. This was no mistake; Ross knew how to incorporate by reference, because he had filled out a similar form for his state PCR petition, attached a 22-page handwritten memorandum that set forth the factual background for each claim and identified the facts that were relevant to each claim, and explicitly incorporated those facts with respect to each claim in his state PCR petition by writing \"please see supporting memorandum ...\" in the space provided for supporting facts for each claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because Ross did not comply with Habeas Rule 2(c) either directly or by incorporating (or attempting to incorporate) the facts in the Nevada Supreme Court affirmance into his original petition, that petition does not provide an aggregation of facts that can support the claims in his amended petition. Accordingly, the district court did not err in concluding that Ross's amended petition cannot relate back to the claims in his original petition because they contain no facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-99\">\n    The Nevada Supreme Court addressed Ross's claims that his counsel was ineffective for:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n    (1) \"failing to engage in pretrial discovery\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n    (2) \"violating [Ross's] right to a speedy trial\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n    (3) allowing \"a communication breakdown [that] prevented [Ross] from being able to assist counsel in the preparation of his defense\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n    (4) \"failing to object to expert testimony\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n    (5) \"failing to retain a defense expert\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n    (6) \"failing to properly challenge the use of a preliminary-hearing transcript\";\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n    (7) \"failing to renew at trial his preliminary-hearing objection for violating the best evidence rule\"; and\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n    (8) \"failing to raise certain objections during the State's closing arguments and at sentencing and for failing to move post-verdict to dismiss the case for lack of evidence.\"\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    As discussed in detail,\n    <em>\n     infra\n    </em>\n    Part III.A, the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the United States District Courts (or \"Habeas Rules\") apply to Ross's petition.

Respectfully, I disagree. Where, as here, a state-court decision denying postconviction relief is attached as an exhibit to a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   habeas petition and the petition lists claims that correspond to the claims addressed in that decision, principles of liberal construction require that the facts discussed in the decision be construed as \"set out\" in the petition for purposes of relation back under Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   This narrow rule makes sense. State-court decisions denying postconviction review usually distill the factual background of a petitioner's claims into an easily digestible summary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Rule 5 of the Rules Governing Section 2254 Cases in the U.S. District Courts (the \"Habeas Rules\") advisory committee's note to 2004 amendment (recognizing that such decisions \"may assist [the federal habeas court] in resolving the issues raised ... in the petition\"). Moreover, because AEDPA's exhaustion requirement bars a petitioner from asserting claims in a federal habeas petition that were not raised in state proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) - (c), the state-court decision will in most cases neatly summarize the facts underlying those claims-and\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   those claims-that the district court can consider on habeas review. And where the claims addressed in an attached state-court decision match the claims raised summarily in the petition, the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petitioner can fairly be said to have \"attempted\" to set out those facts in his petition. Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(c)(1)(B).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   The limitations of this approach are firmly grounded in the framework of habeas litigation. Unlike the state-court decision denying postconviction review, documents like trial transcripts or other parts of the state-court record are less likely to summarize concisely the facts underlying the petitioner's claims. And other decisions from earlier in the petitioner's state-court proceedings are less likely to summarize the facts underlying precisely those claims that the petitioner is entitled to assert on federal habeas review in light of AEDPA's exhaustion requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The majority's concern that a narrow ruling in Ross's favor would not \"stay limiting for long\" is unwarranted. Majority Op. at 971 n.16. District courts know that liberal construction does not require them \"to act as counsel or paralegal to\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   litigants.\"\n   <em>\n    Pliler v.

Majority Op. at 966. This is so, the majority explains, because applying Rule 10(c) in such a case would conflict with Habeas Rule 2, which states that a petition \"must ... state the facts supporting each ground [for relief].\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 964-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   I express no opinion on the majority's analysis of the interplay between Habeas Rule 2, Habeas Rule 12, and Civil Rule 10(c), because I do not think it is necessary to resolve this case. But the majority also rejects the narrow course here-liberally construing Ross's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   habeas petition as attempting to set out, for purposes of relation back, the facts discussed in the attached state-court decision that denied him postconviction relief-as inconsistent with Habeas Rule 2.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 968-73. In my view, this is error.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   To begin with, it is important to recognize what is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   at stake. The question here is not whether the district court should have considered the facts discussed in the attached state-court decision to evaluate the factual sufficiency of Ross's original petition under Habeas Rule 2. Indeed, there is no dispute that Ross's\n   <em>\n    amended\n   </em>\n   petition clearly states the factual basis for each of the claims it asserts. The question, rather, is whether the district court should have considered the facts discussed in the attached state-court decision as \"set out\"-or at least \"attempted to be set out\"-in his original petition for purposes of relation back under Civil Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   In concluding that allowing relation back here would conflict with Habeas Rule 2, the majority conflates these two inquiries. For example, the majority relies on three cases in which this Court refused to apply liberal-construction principles to \"supply 'essential elements of [a] claim that were not initially pled' \" in a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   plaintiff's civil complaint. Majority Op. at 969 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Ivey v.

In\n   <em>\n    Byrd\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pena\n   </em>\n   , however, the plaintiffs sought to rely on facts outside of their complaints to survive a motion to dismiss under Civil Rule 12(b)(6). And\n   <em>\n    Ivey\n   </em>\n   simply affirmed the dismissal of a complaint having no specific factual allegations that defendants engaged in the misconduct alleged. None of these cases involved relation back under Civil Rule 15(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   This distinction matters because Civil Rule 15(c) requires less for relation back than Habeas Rule 2 requires to survive dismissal. Civil Rule 15(c) is satisfied if the original petition \"set[s] out\"-or even \"attempt[s]\" to set out-the factual basis for the amendment's claims. Habeas Rule 2, by contrast, requires that the petition's claims be pleaded with \"particularity,\" a standard that the Supreme Court has called \"demanding.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This differential makes sense, because the two doctrines serve different purposes. Habeas Rule 2's pleading\n   standard seeks to discourage \"lengthy and often illegible petitions\" that require \"hours [to] decipher[ ],\" as well as petitions \"contain[ing] mere conclusions of law, unsupported by any facts.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habeas Rule 2 advisory committee's note. But relation back simply ensures that the respondent has fair notice of what the petitioner might later assert in an amendment to his petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anthony\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11165430\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/236/568/#p576\">\n    236 F.3d at 576\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The majority's real argument, then, is that permitting relation back here would conflict with the policy considerations that Habeas Rule 2 was intended to advance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority Op. at 966-67, 970-71. But while those policy concerns might control in the mine run of cases, they carry less force here. As one might expect of a decision from a state's highest court, the Nevada Supreme Court's order was neither \"lengthy\" nor \"illegible.\" On the contrary, it stated the facts underlying Ross's claims clearly, concisely, and in a manner that highlighted their legal significance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Habeas Rule 2 advisory committee's note (\"[I]t is the relationship of the facts to the claim asserted that is important ....\"). And since this will likely be true of most reasoned state-court opinions denying postconviction relief,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   relation back here implicates none of the efficiency concerns that animate Habeas Rule 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Indeed, the only sense in which the narrow approach that I have proposed could conceivably conflict with the policies underlying the Habeas Rules is that, in some cases, it would allow Habeas Rule 2's pleading requirement to be met by an amended petition filed after the running of AEDPA's one-year statute of limitations. The majority asserts such a result would run afoul of\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   , where the Supreme Court rejected a reading of the phrase \"conduct, transaction, or occurrence\" in Civil Rule 15(c) that would have encompassed the petitioner's entire trial and conviction in state court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"If claims asserted after the one-year period could be revived simply because they relate to the same trial, conviction, or sentence as a timely filed claim, AEDPA's limitation period would have slim significance.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   But Ross's case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   in two important respects. First, unlike the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   , whose proposed application of Civil Rule 15(c) would have allowed his claims to be \"raised later rather than sooner and relate back,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    at 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , many of Ross's claims\n   <em>\n    were\n   </em>\n   raised in his original petition-he simply failed to substantiate them with sufficient facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, the set of Ross's\n   claims that, in my view, should be allowed to relate back is far narrower than the set of claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   : a habeas petitioner should be allowed to amend his petition only to clarify claims whose factual bases were clearly addressed in an attached state-court decision denying him postconviction relief. Such a limited rule would hardly \"swallow AEDPA's statute of limitation.\"\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Nor are the finality concerns cited by the majority sufficient to justify withholding the benefit of liberal construction from a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petitioner. Ross by no means seeks a complete reprieve from AEDPA's filing deadline, since he indisputably filed his original petition within the applicable one-year limitations period. In many cases, moreover, a district court will have the power to deny leave to file an amendment if it finds that the petitioner delayed unjustifiably in preparing that amendment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2). Finally, the fact remains that when Ross filed his original petition, he was proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The majority is undoubtedly correct that AEDPA's one-year deadline was meant to \"advance the finality of criminal convictions.\" Majority Op. at 967 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But this finality interest should not be advanced on the basis of fairly trivial mistakes made by prisoners who proceed without the advice of an attorney.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   When applying a Federal Rule of Civil Procedure in a habeas case, courts must construe the rule in light of the basic policies that underlie the habeas framework.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mayle\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    545 U.S. at 661-663\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (interpreting the term \"conduct, transaction, or occurrence\" in Civil Rule 15(c) in light of the policy concerns underlying Habeas Rule 2);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Habeas Rule 12. But when the application of that rule involves a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   filing, courts must also heed traditional principles of liberal construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Porter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3782168\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/620/952/#p958\">\n    620 F.3d at 958\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the narrow circumstances presented by this case, the efficiency and finality concerns advanced by Habeas Rule 2 carry diminished force, while the fairness concerns underpinning the rule of liberal construction are directly implicated. Thus, Ross's original\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   petition should have been liberally construed as setting out-or at least attempting to set out-the facts stated in the attached state-court decision for purposes of Civil Rule 15(c), and the claims in his amended petition should have been allowed to relate back to the date of his original petition to the extent that they arose out of those facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    When asked what Ross would have had to do to incorporate these facts into his petition, counsel replied that \"he could have said, 'see page 3 of that decision, here's the facts that I want to incorporate as my supporting facts.' \"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,\n    <em>\n     16-16533 Ronald Ross v. Williams\n    </em>\n    , YouTube, 12:05-12:12 (Dec. 5, 2017), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bryJdYNcodY. In other words, the state contends that for incorporation to be effective, a petitioner must identify the specific facts that the petitioner believes support his claims. But the state-court decision attached to Ross's petition is only six pages long, four of which set out the factual basis for (and then reject) each of his eight claims. If a simple \"see pages 2 through 5\" would not have been enough to incorporate the facts stated on those pages, what more would Ross have had to write? The state's attempt to frame incorporation by reference as a demanding task is unpersuasive.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Under the approach I think we should take, federal habeas courts might have to consider the facts set out in lengthier state-court decisions. But surely even these decisions will not be \"illegible,\" and length alone is no reason to ignore such a decision when it is included as an attachment to a\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    habeas petition. Time is a valuable resource in state courts as well, and there is no reason to believe that a state court will recite more facts than are necessary to resolve whatever claims the petitioner raised below.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    The majority disputes this, asserting that Ross's original petition \"raised only ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\" Majority Op. at 972 n.17. But the majority again reads Ross's petition too narrowly. The petition alleged that \"counsel was ineffective for failing to\" do a number of things-including to \"[s]ecure a speedy trial.\" Liberally construed, this allegation states a freestanding speedy trial claim. Moreover, even if Ross's original petition were properly read as asserting only ineffective assistance of counsel claims, such claims make up the bulk of Ross's amended petition. Finally, although some of the claims in the amended petition do not seem to appear in the original (even with the state-court order attached), the match between the two petitions was not fully addressed in the parties' briefs-indeed, the state did not address the issue at all. Thus, we should have done as the state suggested and remanded this case to the district court to perform the relation-back analysis in the first instance.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    According to the majority, \"\n    <em>\n     Mayle\n    </em>\n    expressly rejected the argument that a more liberal relation back scheme was necessary to protect the interests of pro se prisoners.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Majority Op. at 971. True, the Court in\n    <em>\n     Mayle\n    </em>\n    rejected the petitioner's broad reading of Civil Rule 15(c) despite the dissent's observation that \"in the overwhelming majority of cases, the original petition is the work of a\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    petitioner.\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n     545 U.S. at 675\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (Souter, J., dissenting). But the rule proposed by the petitioner in\n    <em>\n     Mayle\n    </em>\n    was far broader than the one advocated here. Moreover, the\n    <em>\n     Mayle\n    </em>\n    Court described the dissent's concerns as \"understandable\" and noted that \"in [this] case, counsel was appointed, and had some two and a half months to amend the petition before AEDPA's limitation period expired.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 664 n. 8,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209728\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/644/#p655\">\n     125 S.Ct. 2562\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Here, Ross's counsel was appointed\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    his AEDPA deadline had run. By the\n    <em>\n     Mayle\n    </em>\n    Court's own estimation, then, Ross's\n    <em>\n     pro se\n    </em>\n    status should carry greater weight here.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
