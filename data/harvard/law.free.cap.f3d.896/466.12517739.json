Later, the United States Sentencing Commission lowered that range and made its amendment retroactive. Smith then moved for a corresponding reduction in his sentence. The district court ruled that a reduced sentence was both legally unavailable and unwarranted. Because, under circuit and recent Supreme Court precedent, Smith was eligible for a sentence reduction, we reverse and remand for the district court to more fully explain its decision to deny relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The United States Sentencing Guidelines establish a non-binding framework for determining criminal sentences in federal prosecutions. As relevant here, at the time of Smith's sentencing, Section 2D1.1(c) set the starting point of the sentencing calculation-the \"base level\"-at 32 for offenses like Smith's that involve at least one but less than three kilograms of PCP. Factoring in his criminal history and a downward departure for his guilty plea, Smith faced a recommended Guidelines range of 140 to 175 months of imprisonment. Following a plea agreement, the district court sentenced him to 156 months, the middle of the recommended Guidelines range and the sentence upon which the parties had agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Three years later, the Sentencing Commission amended Section 2D1.1(c) by reducing that particular offense to a base level of 30, which would carry a recommended sentencing range of 120 to 150 months of imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c) and Supp. to App'x C, Amend. 782 (\"Amendment 782\") (Nov. 1, 2014).

The district court also specifically recommended to the Bureau of Prisons that Smith be admitted into the drug rehabilitation program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In January 2016, Smith filed a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   letter requesting a sentence reduction based on the intervening Sentencing Guideline Amendment 782. He claimed that, under the amendment to his base offense level, the recommended range for his crime decreased to 120 to 150 months, and so a proportionate reduction in his sentence would lower it to 134 months. The government opposed Smith's motion on the ground that his sentence was based on the agreed-upon plea terms, and not the Sentencing Guidelines, and that, in any event, Smith did not merit such an exercise of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The district court denied Smith's motion for a reduced sentence. The court first ruled that Smith was disqualified from receiving a sentence reduction as a matter of law because his sentence turned on the terms of the plea agreement; \"the guideline range was not part of the Court's calculus in determining the sentence[.]\" Secondly, the court ruled that, even if Smith were eligible, the court would in its discretion deny a reduction because Smith conspired with a gang responsible for murdering a witness while he himself was on supervised release for unrelated drug and gun charges.

The career-offender provision, the government notes, was not amended and thus would not itself provide a basis for Smith to seek a sentence reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   That dog will not hunt.

By all indications, that particularized consideration did not happen here. Quite the opposite.

Plea Hr'g Tr. 13 (\"You are not charged with any of the violent activities, right?\"). Before going forward with the plea, Smith was adamant about preserving his eligibility for a Bureau of Prison rehabilitation program that is not available to individuals convicted of violent crimes.

But that was not new-the district court was aware of that at the original sentencing. It did not affect the court's original judgment about the non-violent character of Smith's offense because the record was undisputed that Smith had nothing at all to do with that aspect of the gang's activities.

(defense counsel explained that Smith \"doesn't know about\" all of the \"murder information,\" to which the district court affirmed \"Right\"). As far as the court's resentencing decision reveals, nothing had changed.
