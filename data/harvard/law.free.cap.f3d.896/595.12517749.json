About two weeks after the accident, Sconiers submitted an administrative tort claim form to USPS seeking damages for injuries that she claimed she suffered in the accident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Approximately seven months later, by letter dated July 14, 2016, and addressed to Sconiers's counsel, USPS denied her claim. The letter, citing the FTCA-i.e.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202401\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) and the relevant regulation-informed Sconiers that if she was \"dissatisfied with the Postal Service's final denial,\" she \"may file suit in a United States District Court no later than six (6) months after the date the Postal Service\n   <em>\n    mails\n   </em>\n   the notice of that final action.\" App. 19. Sconiers, however, filed her complaint before the District Court\n   <em>\n    eight\n   </em>\n   months later-or two months after the limitations period that USPS alleges that the FTCA requires-and named as defendants,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , USPS and Stephan D. Johnson, who was the driver of the USPS truck.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The United States moved before the District Court to be substituted in place of USPS and Johnson, as well as for summary judgment. It contended that Sconiers's failure to file her lawsuit within six months of the mailing of the denial of her administrative claim rendered her lawsuit untimely. Sconiers did not contest the substitution of the United States, but urged the District Court to equitably toll the statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District Court found that Sconiers's complaint was filed beyond the FTCA's six-month statute of limitations and determined that she had not identified any extraordinary circumstance that justified equitable tolling of the deadline. Accordingly, it granted the Government's motions. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"As a sovereign, the United States is immune from suit unless it consents to be sued.\"\n   <em>\n    White-Squire v.

In considering this matter, we note that \"[b]ecause the Federal Tort Claims Act constitutes a waiver of sovereign immunity, the Act's established procedures have been strictly construed.\"\n   <em>\n    White-Squire\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5687977\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/592/453/#p456\">\n    592 F.3d at 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Livera v.

The Sixth Circuit has aptly explained why, and we adopt its reasoning today:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   Context provides considerable support for this reading. Claimants, remember,\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   present their claims to the relevant agency before bringing suit in federal court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202675\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). And if we construe the Act's time bar to mean that the claimant must fail to satisfy both deadlines, that would pull at least two threads out of a coherent reading of the provisions. For one, a claimant cannot receive a notice of denial-the trigger for the six-month limitations rule-until she has filed an administrative claim. The statute thus plainly contemplates that one act (the administrative filing) will precede the other (court filing) and thus most naturally requires claimants to satisfy both deadlines.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   For another, the alternative would effectively eliminate\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   court deadline. It would mean that (1) claimants could wait as long as they wished before presenting tort claims to agencies as long as they filed the claim within six months of any denial or (2) they could present their claims to agencies within two years of accrual and then wait as long as they wished to file suit in district court. But no one doubts that Congress meant to impose\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   time limitation on administrative and court filings, and, if we left the Act without a meaningful time limitation, we would be \"tak[ing] it upon ourselves to extend the waiver [of sovereign immunity] beyond that which Congress intended.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

[T]he fact that the statute uses the disjunctive does not by itself tell us anything. The question remains whether the\n   statute sets forth alternative ways of barring a claim or alternative ways of preserving a claim. A statute that precludes an action if the claimant (disjunctively) fails to meet either of two requirements generally will come to the same end as a statute that requires the claimant (conjunctively) to fulfill both requirements. In barring an action if the claimant fails to meet the agency-filing deadline (because it is not \"presented in writing to the appropriate Federal agency within two years after such claim accrues\") \"or\" if the claimant fails to meet the court-filing deadline (because it is not \"begun within six months after the date of mailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice of final denial of the claim by the agency to which it was presented\"), the statute bars claims that fail to meet either deadline.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Ellison v.
