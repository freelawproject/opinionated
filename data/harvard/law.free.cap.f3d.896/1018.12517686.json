We conclude that it does, and that it therefore runs afoul of California law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016600\">\n    Cal.

While at CEP, Dr. Golden worked primarily as an emergency room physician, although he also worked part-time in several other facilities, including two family practice clinics and two occupational medicine clinics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2007, CEP terminated Dr. Golden's employment, ostensibly because he lacked board certification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Golden sued CEP\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   in Alameda County Superior Court, claiming that he had in fact been fired because of his race. CEP removed Dr. Golden's suit to federal court and, following a settlement conference before a magistrate judge, the parties orally agreed to settle the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When the settlement agreement was later reduced to writing, however, Dr. Golden refused to sign it. He claimed that one of its provisions, Paragraph 7, was contrary to California's statutory prohibition on contracts \"by which anyone is restrained from engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2016600\">\n    Cal.

Paragraph 7 states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties agree that, except as specified in Paragraphs 7a and b, below, Golden shall not be entitled to work or be reinstated at any CEP-contracted facility or at any facility owned or managed by CEP. The parties further agree that if CEP contracts to provide services to, or acquires rights in, a facility that is an emergency room as defined and regulated by California law at which Golden is employed or rendering services, CEP has the right to and will terminate Golden from any work in the emergency room without any liability whatsoever. Similarly, the parties agree that if CEP contracts to provide services to, or acquires rights in, a facility at which Golden is employed or rendering services as a hospitalist, CEP has the right to and will terminate Golden from any work as a hospitalist without any liability whatsoever.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Paragraph 7a states that if CEP contracts with or acquires rights in \"an urgent care facility that is not an emergency room ... and Golden is already working at that urgent care facility, Golden may be entitled to continue working at that urgent care facility\" so long as he meets certain criteria. Paragraph 7b goes on to state the terms of Dr. Golden's continued employment if the conditions in Paragraph 7a are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following Dr. Golden's refusal to sign the agreement, his attorney withdrew, intervened in the proceedings, and moved to enforce the agreement so that he could collect his fee. The district court granted the motion and ordered Dr. Golden to sign, reasoning that because Paragraph 7 would not prevent Dr. Golden from\n   <em>\n    competing\n   </em>\n   with CEP, it was not a restraint on his medical practice, and section 16600 did not apply. Dr. Golden continued to refuse to sign the agreement, however, and he instead took his first appeal to this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at 1085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We reversed the district court's order, holding that the court had misconstrued section 16600.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    at 1092-93\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the fact that Paragraph 7 did not prohibit Dr. Golden from competing with CEP was not dispositive; rather, the question was whether Paragraph 7 substantially restrained Dr. Golden's practice of medicine, particularly in light of CEP's large presence in California.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1089, 1092-93. Because the factual record on that question was not fully developed, however, we remanded to the district court to determine in the first instance whether Paragraph 7 \"constitutes a restraint of a substantial character to Dr. Golden's medical practice.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1093.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On remand, the district court again ordered Dr. Golden to sign the settlement agreement, concluding this time that Paragraph 7 was not a restraint of a substantial character. The court also denied Dr. Golden's request for a jury trial and ruled that an evidentiary hearing was unnecessary. Dr. Golden timely filed this appeal, challenging both the district court's order directing him to sign the agreement and its decision not to hold an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We review a district court's order enforcing a settlement agreement for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at 1089\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

To meet this standard, a provision need not completely prohibit the business or professional activity at issue, nor does it need to be sufficient to dissuade a reasonable person from engaging in that activity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20282\">\n    81 Cal.Rptr.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20P.3d%20285\">\n    189 P.3d at 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But its restraining effect must be significant enough that its enforcement would implicate the policies of open competition and employee mobility that animate section 16600.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20P.3d%20285\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20282\">\n    81 Cal.Rptr.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20P.3d%20285\">\n    189 P.3d at 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We stress, however, that it will be the rare contractual restraint whose effect is so insubstantial that it escapes scrutiny under section 16600. California's legislature has clearly expressed its disapproval of contracts that restrain lawful business and professional activities, and we are bound to heed that policy judgment wherever its logic applies. With these considerations in mind, we turn now to the contractual provision at issue in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Paragraph 7 impedes Dr. Golden's ability to practice medicine in three ways. First, it states that he \"shall not be entitled to work or be reinstated\" at \"any facility owned or managed by CEP.\" Second, it bars him from working at \"any CEP-contracted facility.\" Finally, it states that \"if CEP contracts to provide services to, or acquires rights in\" a facility where Dr. Golden is\n   <em>\n    currently\n   </em>\n   working as an emergency room physician or a hospitalist, CEP \"has the right to and will terminate\" him from that employment \"without any liability whatsoever.\" The second and third of these three provisions substantially restrain Dr. Golden's practice of medicine and are therefore barred by section 16600.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The first provision pertains only to Dr. Golden's future employment at CEP. To the extent that it prevents him from being reinstated at any of his prior CEP worksites-which consist of a single emergency room and a handful of nonemergency clinics-its impediment to medical practice is minimal. And to the extent that it provides that Dr. Golden \"shall not be entitled\" to work at any other facility owned or managed by CEP, it simply restates the obvious proposition that an employee does not have a general right to work for an employer without the employer's consent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Insofar as Paragraph 7 bars Dr. Golden from\n   future employment at facilities owned or managed by CEP, therefore, it does not impose a substantial restraint on his medical practice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kozinski, J., dissenting) (noting that \"[t]he provision barring Dr. Golden from current employment by CEP cannot possibly\" violate section 16600, because if it did, \"few employment disputes could ever be settled\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The remainder of Paragraph 7, however, affects not only Dr. Golden's employment at CEP itself, but also his current and future employment at third-party facilities. For example, Paragraph 7 bars Dr. Golden from working at \"any CEP-contracted facility.\" Under a fair reading of this provision, Dr. Golden would be ineligible for employment in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   department of a hospital where CEP has a contract to provide, say, anesthesiology services-even if he would never have any contact with CEP's staff.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, if Dr. Golden were compelled to sign the settlement agreement, CEP would be entitled to terminate him from his current employment at four facilities where CEP also has contracts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Paragraph 7 also states that CEP \"has the right to and will terminate\" Dr. Golden from a position as an emergency room physician or a hospitalist at any facility where CEP\n   <em>\n    later\n   </em>\n   contracts or \"acquires rights.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   This means that if Dr. Golden were employed as a hospitalist or an emergency room physician, and if CEP later\n   acquired a contract to provide, say, psychiatry services at his hospital, CEP would \"have the right to and [would]\" unilaterally terminate his employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   This interference with Dr. Golden's ability to seek or maintain employment with third parties easily rises to the level of a substantial restraint, especially given the size of CEP's business in California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   CEP currently staffs 160 facilities in the state-including hospitals, trauma centers, urgent care clinics, and skilled nursing facilities-and it handles between twenty-five and thirty percent of the state's emergency room admissions. Moreover, CEP appears to be growing: according to its own records, the group's market share has increased steadily over the past decade or so, moving from around twenty percent of all emergency room admissions in California in 2006 to just over twenty-seven percent in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   These facts persuade us that Paragraph 7's effect on Dr. Golden's medical practice is substantial, and that section 16600 therefore applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   CEP's arguments against the application of section 16600 are unpersuasive. CEP's main point is that we should review for clear error the district court's determination that Paragraph 7 is not a restraint of a substantial character, and that Dr. Golden has identified no such error here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wash. Mut., Inc. v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276879\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/856/711/#p721\">\n    856 F.3d 711\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 721 (9th Cir. 2017) (explaining that reversal under clear error review requires \"a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made\" (citation omitted) ). We do not think-and Dr. Golden does not argue-that any specific factual finding made by the district court was clearly erroneous. But as we have already said, the question whether a restraint is one of a substantial character is a mixed question of law and fact; thus, although we defer to the district court's factual findings, we review\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   its determination that Paragraph 7 is not a substantial restraint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Cherrett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266695,12269879\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/873/1060/\">\n    873 F.3d at 1066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And as we have already explained, the district court erred in making that determination here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Next, CEP suggests that Paragraph 7 does not impose a substantial restraint to the extent that it impedes Dr. Golden's ability to practice as an emergency room physician, because that position does not appear to be the focus of his current practice. At his deposition, for example, Dr. Golden testified that he no longer practices emergency medicine and that he had not applied for a position in that field since 2011. And Dr. Golden's CV lists seven specialties besides emergency medicine-starting with geriatrics, the specialty in which he completed his fellowship-which further suggests that Dr. Golden's medical practice extends beyond emergency medicine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"A person's 'profession' under section 16600 is not so expansive [as] to include all work for which he is qualified.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1671271\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/499/#p503\">\n    817 F.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (9th Cir. 1987). But Dr. Golden worked as an emergency room physician for three years before he was terminated by CEP, and he testified at his deposition that he still works as a hospitalist. Thus, work as an emergency room physician and a hospitalist is included within his \"profession\" for purposes of section 16600. And in any case, Paragraph 7 does not only restrain Dr. Golden from holding these positions: as we have already said, it would also prevent him from practicing any type of medicine at a facility where CEP has a contract. Even if emergency medicine were not properly characterized as Dr. Golden's current profession, then, Paragraph 7 would still restrain other aspects of his medical practice-including his work as a hospitalist.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   CEP also argues that Paragraph 7 does not substantially restrain Dr. Golden from practicing emergency medicine because his lack of board certification would independently preclude him from working at most emergency rooms. But CEP does not argue that Dr. Golden's lack of board certification prohibits him from practicing as a hospitalist.

Under this standard, Paragraph 7 survives to the extent that it bars Dr. Golden from working at facilities that are owned or operated by CEP, but it fails to the extent that it prevents him from working for employers that have contracts with CEP and to the extent that it permits CEP to terminate him from existing employment in facilities that are not owned by CEP. Thus, because CEP does not argue that any exception to section 16600 applies, and because the parties do not dispute that Paragraph 7 is material to the settlement agreement,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1088 n.2, the entire agreement is void, and the district court abused its discretion in ordering Dr. Golden to sign it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We therefore\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   the district court's order directing Dr. Golden to sign the settlement agreement and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The following facts are summarized, for the most part, in the majority opinion in\n    <em>\n     Golden I\n    </em>\n    .\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n     782 F.3d at 1084-85\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Instead, it required him to \"apply for available work at a site, go through an interviewing and credentialing process, and ... be accepted to the medical staff of the service location.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    The dissent contends that our \"approval of this restraint runs contrary to [our] own legal standard,\" because \"a provision that prevents Dr. Golden from practicing his profession with one of the largest providers of medical services in California\" is \"surely\" a restraint of a substantial character. Dissent at 1029 n. 2. But the dissent ignores the fact that this provision merely codifies a preexisting state of affairs between the parties. Dr. Golden has no right to work at CEP: even absent the settlement agreement, he could not work at CEP without CEP's consent. Conversely, should CEP and Dr. Golden later mutually agree to reinstate their employment relationship, a contrary provision of a prior contract between them would not preclude them from doing so. Thus, far from placing a restraint of a substantial character on Dr. Golden's medical practice, this part of Paragraph 7 imposes no restraint at all.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    In such a case, perhaps, CEP might not have the authority to prevent the third-party hospital from hiring Dr. Golden.

But CEP conceded in a reply brief below that, \"[a]s [Dr. Golden] correctly notes in his Declaration, CEP also has or had contracts for services with facilities that are owned and/or operated and/or otherwise affiliated with\" the facilities where Dr. Golden is presently employed. In light of this concession, we think it proper to consider Dr. Golden's assertion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    The dissent claims that, in so doing, we \"cursorily overrule[ ] the district court's exclusion of this testimony.\" Dissent at 1032. Not so. Dr. Golden has not asked us to review the district court's evidentiary ruling, and we do not do so here. Instead, we rely only on a concession made by CEP and the plain language of Paragraph 7, which states that CEP \"has the right to and will\" terminate Dr. Golden from employment with any employer who contracts with CEP.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    The record is unclear as to the exact meaning of the phrase \"acquires rights\" in Paragraph 7. Indeed, one CEP partner testified at his deposition that he had \"no idea what it means.\" But to the extent that it suggests that CEP could fire Dr. Golden from a facility where CEP acquires \"rights\" other than the contractual right to staff and operate the facility-an ownership interest, for example-it only broadens the scope of Paragraph 7's applicability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Indeed, we think it possible that even a smaller business with a more limited network of contractual relationships could run afoul of section 16600 by barring a former employee from current or future employment with its contractual partners. We need say no more than this, however, because here the restraint imposed by Paragraph 7 is clearly substantial.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    In his declaration, CEP's chief operating officer admits that CEP has \"rather ambitious\" plans for expansion, but he states that the group anticipates that its future expansion will take place primarily outside of California, because \"so many of the service locations in the state are part of the Kaiser system\" and because \"it is extremely unlikely that any medical group other than Kaiser would staff a Kaiser-owned service location.\" Nothing in the agreement itself guarantees that CEP will adhere to its stated plans, however, and CEP's growing share of California's market for emergency room services suggests that its business in the state is growing as well.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Moreover, even if it were proper to require Dr. Golden to prove that CEP would likely enforce Paragraph 7 according to its plain terms, there is some evidence in the record to support that conclusion. For example, Dr. Golden stated in his declaration that he was terminated from a position as an emergency room physician in late 2010, shortly after CEP took over the contract for the emergency room where he was working. And although the dissent contends that this was because Dr. Golden was not board certified or board eligible,\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Dissent at 1030 n.4, Dr. Golden stated in his declaration that \"there were [other] non-[board eligible or board certified] doctors\" employed at that emergency room \"who were not terminated\" when CEP took over.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    The dissent cites this language from\n    <em>\n     Golden I\n    </em>\n    for the proposition that we \"cannot rely\" on future events in evaluating Paragraph 7. Dissent at 1031 n.6. But this is not what\n    <em>\n     Golden I\n    </em>\n    said. Rather,\n    <em>\n     Golden I\n    </em>\n    said that the \"legal interest\" that Dr. Golden sought to vindicate was the contract's present invalidity-not its invalidity at some future point in time-such that his case was ripe.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n     782 F.3d at 1088\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\"[Dr. Golden] argues that, under the State's business and professions code, the agreement is\n    <em>\n     currently\n    </em>\n    void.\").

SMITH, Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Dr. Golden filed a lawsuit against CEP when it terminated his medical staff privileges, allegedly because of poor performance. Just before trial was to begin, the parties reached a settlement agreement in which CEP agreed to pay Dr. Golden some money, and he agreed to give up any opportunity to work again for CEP. At that point, however, this dispute ceased being a typical employment dispute and metastasized into one of those cases that only Franz Kafka could love. First, when the parties finalized the settlement agreement in writing, they appeared before a magistrate judge to confirm their agreement, at which appearance Dr. Golden expressly told the judge that he agreed with the terms of the settlement agreement. Apparently, his word meant nothing. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Golden backed out of the settlement agreement, and refused to sign the settlement document, which he knew stiffed his lawyer out of the contingency fee he had earned for representing Dr. Golden for three years. Then, undercutting the quid pro quo underlying the entire settlement, Dr. Golden claimed retroactively that the reason he refused to sign the settlement agreement to which he had assented in open court was that it violated California Business and Professions Code \u00a7 16600. This is sheer humbug, and it is lamentable that the change in California law conjured by the majority has the effect of rewarding Dr. Golden's dishonorable conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The parties are before us for a second time, disputing whether the district court abused its discretion in concluding that the settlement agreement did not constitute a restraint of a substantial character in violation of section 16600. I respectfully dissent because the majority concludes that the agreement violates section 16600 based primarily on a series of highly speculative future professional restraints that may or may not happen, and because the district court followed our guidance and applied it faithfully to the facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Section 16600 bars contracts that restrain an individual from \"engaging in a lawful profession, trade, or business of any kind.\" In\n   <em>\n    Edwards v.

The contracts in\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain\n   </em>\n   barred individuals from engaging in their chosen profession. In contrast, Dr. Golden has been employed, and has not been denied any position for which he has applied,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   since this litigation began. Nor can Dr. Golden point to any evidence that he would be fired, actually restrained, or barred from engaging in his profession upon signing the settlement agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In addition, Paragraph 7 limits employment only with CEP or CEP-affiliated facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. Golden is free to engage as a\n   hospitalist, emergency room physician, or in any other medical specialty for entities unaffiliated with CEP, which is far from a \"curb [on] competition,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=197%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20791\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , or a limitation on \"open competition,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20282\">\n    81 Cal.Rptr.3d 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=189%20P.3d%20285\">\n    189 P.3d at 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Similar to the provision in\n   <em>\n    USS-POSCO\n   </em>\n   , Paragraph 7 imposes certain restrictions on future employment options, but does not curb competition or substantially restrain Dr. Golden's ability to engage in his chosen profession. Therefore, Paragraph 7 is more akin to the provision upheld in\n   <em>\n    USS-POSCO\n   </em>\n   than the restraints struck down in\n   <em>\n    Chamberlain\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Edwards\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   More importantly, even if the two remaining categories could constitute an impermissible restraint, the evidence-including the facts found by the district court-indicate that any potential restraint remains too speculative to determine the outcome in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the dissent in\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   forewarned: \"We have no way of knowing whether this part of the settlement agreement will ever come into play, as its enforcement depends on numerous circumstances that are not capable of determination at this time ....\"\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kozinski, J., dissenting). The majority treats remote and contingent scenarios as if they were certainties in order to justify voiding the settlement agreement. In doing so, the majority expands the scope of section 16600 and preserves for Dr. Golden \"an unfettered right to employment ..., no matter how remote or contingent.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    at 1093-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   For instance, the majority suggests that Paragraph 7 may bar Dr. Golden from working as a hospitalist at a facility if CEP later contracts to provide anesthesiology services at that facility. First, it is speculative whether Dr. Golden will work as a hospitalist at a facility where CEP later contracts to provide unrelated services. Second, even if this did occur, we do not know now whether CEP, as a contractor of unrelated services, would have \"the right to and [would] terminate Golden\" from his position. Indeed, the majority recognizes that CEP might not have the authority to prevent the third-party hospital from hiring Dr. Golden or to require the third-party hospital to fire Dr. Golden.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because we do not know whether CEP will, at some unknown time, be able to \"interfere[ ] with Dr. Golden's ability to seek or maintain employment with third parties,\" it is improper to hold that Paragraph 7 constitutes an actual restraint of a substantial character.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Similarly, Dr. Golden's argument that he would be fired immediately from all his current jobs if the settlement agreement is enforced is baseless. The only evidence\n   that Dr. Golden proffers is his self-serving affidavit. However, the district court ruled Dr. Golden's declaration on this point inadmissible due to a lack of personal knowledge, and Dr. Golden fails to explain how the district court abused its discretion in doing so.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v. Lloyd\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4363366\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/807/1128/#p1151\">\n    807 F.3d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1151 (9th Cir. 2015). Therefore, there is no factual basis to conclude that he would be fired immediately from all his current jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The majority, in a footnote, cursorily overrules the district court's exclusion of this testimony. This is error. First, the majority fails to provide a legal basis for concluding that the district court abused its discretion in excluding this portion of Dr. Golden's affidavit. Second, it relies on specious reasoning. CEP conceded that it contracts with facilities that employ Dr. Golden; however, CEP did not concede that Dr. Golden would be fired immediately from his present jobs if the court enforced the settlement agreement. The majority makes this inferential leap without justification. Moreover, as stated above, it is not enough to state summarily that CEP will terminate Dr. Golden from any employer who contracts with CEP because we do not know whether CEP would have the authority to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The majority also points to CEP's growth in California in support of its view that the agreement will substantially restrain Dr. Golden's employment with CEP-affiliated facilities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   CEP's presence has grown in California in the past decade. Nevertheless, past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results: CEP's previous growth does not mean that its future growth in California is certain, or even likely. Indeed, CEP's chief operating officer states that CEP's future growth is aimed outside of California due to the extensive Kaiser system in California. CEP has plans to contract with only one facility in Northern California, where Dr. Golden currently resides and works.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, if CEP's current presence in California was sufficient in and of itself, we would have declared Paragraph 7 unlawful in\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   based on CEP's large presence,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    782 F.3d at 1084\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , instead of remanding for further fact-finding,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054214\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/782/1083/#p1093\">\n    at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Last, the majority's conclusion that Paragraph 7 imposes an impermissible restraint on his ability to practice emergency medicine is unsupported by the record. Dr. Golden did practice emergency medicine for a few years prior to 2011. However, the record indicates that he would not now be qualified to work at a CEP-affiliated emergency facility for reasons independent of Paragraph 7-he is not board certified in emergency medicine. If a person's profession does not necessarily \"include all work for which he is qualified,\" surely it goes without saying that Dr. Golden's profession does not include work for which he is not qualified.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1671271\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/817/499/#p503\">\n    817 F.2d 499\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (9th Cir. 1987). Therefore, any restraint on Dr. Golden's ability to practice emergency medicine is due to his want of professional credentials, and not as a consequence of Paragraph 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The majority's last resort is to rely on further speculation:\n   <em>\n    If\n   </em>\n   Dr. Golden is qualified to become board certified (which is uncertain at best),\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   he actually becomes board certified, and\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   he decides to practice emergency medicine, then the only restraint on practicing that specialty with a CEP-affiliate is Paragraph 7. This scenario is too remote to serve as the basis for striking down Paragraph 7, invalidating the settlement agreement, and changing California law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In sum, the settlement agreement would not substantially restrain Dr. Golden from engaging in his chosen profession. The only discernable limitation on his profession is that he can no longer work for CEP, which even the majority agrees does not violate section 16600. Even if the other provisions of Paragraph 7 may someday impose a substantial restraint, such future events are too speculative to justify reversing the district court today. Dr. Golden has been employed continuously since this litigation began and he cannot point to a single instance where Paragraph 7 will actually restrain his medical practice. Thus, to hold that Paragraph 7 constitutes a restraint of a substantial character is impermissibly speculative and erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Golden I\n   </em>\n   , we remanded this case to the district court with instructions to determine, based on the facts before it, whether the settlement agreement constitutes a restraint of a substantial character. The district court applied the correct law and did not rest its decision on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Latshaw v. Trainer Wortham &amp; Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329400\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/452/1097/#p1100\">\n    452 F.3d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100 (9th Cir. 2006). The majority's opinion today limits employers and employees from entering into settlement agreements based on hypothetical scenarios that may or may not happen years down the road. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in granting the motion to enforce the settlement agreement, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Under the majority's analysis of\n    <em>\n     Edwards\n    </em>\n    any restraint, no matter how \"narrow,\" is impermissible.

For example, Paragraph 7 does not expressly contemplate CEP's future growth in California. To strike down Paragraph 7 requires facts indicating that it\n    <em>\n     will\n    </em>\n    substantially restrain Dr. Golden, not that it\n    <em>\n     may\n    </em>\n    substantially restrain Dr. Golden.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    The majority suggests that Dr. Golden would breach the agreement if he worked at a facility where CEP has a contract.
