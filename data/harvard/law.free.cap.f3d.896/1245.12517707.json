His appeal raises three issues: (1) whether the district court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal based on insufficiency of the evidence; (2) whether the district court denied him his constitutional right to testify; and (3) whether the district court correctly applied the sentencing guideline enhancement for obstruction of justice, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   based on Watts's attempt to avoid identification by covering up his distinctive tattoos. For the following reasons, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 14, 2015, an armed robber entered a Wells Fargo Bank branch in Savannah, Georgia, and demanded money from the bank teller while brandishing a .22-caliber handgun. He wore a camouflage bandana to cover his face and a yellow hat. The robber escaped with approximately $2,400 in cash, and a hat and bandana matching were found nearby. Using security footage and eyewitness accounts, the police were able to complete a description of the suspect as a black male wearing dark pants, black and white athletic shoes, and blue latex gloves. The robber also had tattoo on his neck with the letter \"U\" visible and another tattoo on his forehead between his eyes in the shape of a small cross.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Acting on a confidential tip, the police arrested Watts the following day. A search of his residence and vehicle turned up, among other things, several .22-caliber rounds, sneakers that were similar in appearance to the black and white sneakers of the robber, and a blue latex glove. The search also uncovered .38-caliber rounds and a .38 caliber revolver in his vehicle, a bandana of a different color than the one used in the robbery, and $319 in cash which the police were unable to link to the stolen currency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The evidence at trial included text messages and a call log from Watts's mobile phone. The texts showed that after media reports came out on the day of the robbery, Watts was actively texting his friends, trying to find someone who could alter tattoos. The next day he contacted a tattoo artist who had done previous tattoos for Watts, seeking to modify the tattoos on his forehead (a small cross) and neck (spelling out \"TRU\"). The tattoo artist testified at trial that he covered up Watts's neck tattoo with an image of doves and a cloud, and modified the cross on Watts's forehead to be a Japanese symbol.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The FBI's forensic examiner testified that DNA obtained from the hat discovered near the scene was from \"at least three individuals\" and that the results of the DNA comparison were inconclusive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On the second day of trial, Watts requested permission to proceed\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   . The court ultimately granted his request, but required Watts's attorney to remain in an advisory role. Watts requested a continuance\n   more than once, but the court denied those requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   After the government rested its case, the court notified Watts that he had a right to testify on his own behalf and he responded, \"I would. I would like to.\" At that point, he had an off-the-record discussion with his attorney. The court then asked him again if he would like to testify, and he responded, \"I do not.\" The court then stated that since it had denied Watts's request for a continuance and there were no other witnesses to be called for the defense, the defendant's case was closed. Watts again stated \"I'm willing to testify, Your Honor. May I have-\" at which point the transcript simply notes that another \"off-the-record discussion was held between the defendant and his counsel.\" Watts did not pursue his request to testify after that second conversation with counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Watts stated that he would make closing arguments on his own behalf. He stated, \"But before we come to this rest, Your Honor, may I come to understand that the grounds of my testimony, like can I consult with my lawyer before we rule that out?\" Yet another off-the-record discussion immediately ensued between Watts and his advisory counsel. The court then stated that there would be a brief recess before closing arguments, and Watts asked, \"You're not going to rule on my-\" but was interrupted by the court. After the brief recess, the court stated that it found \"that the defendant's decision not to testify was ... made knowingly and voluntarily and also his decision to proceed pro se was made knowingly and voluntarily.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The jury convicted Watts on both counts. He then renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and moved for a new trial. The court denied his motions, finding that Watts provided no support for his allegations that the government failed to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At sentencing, the presentence report applied a two-level enhancement to the offense level under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3C1.1 because Watts \"willfully\" obstructed or impeded the administration of justice, or attempted to do so, by having the identifying tattoos on his face and neck altered or \"covered up.\" With a resulting offense level of 24 and his criminal history category of II, the guidelines range for the armed bank robbery was 57 to 71 months imprisonment. The conviction for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence required a mandatory minimum of 84 months imprisonment, consecutive to any other term of imprisonment imposed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Watts objected to the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, arguing that his conduct in attempting to cover his tattoos should not be considered obstruction under the guidelines. The court noted his objection, but adopted the factual statements in the presentence report and applied the enhancement. The court sentenced Watts to 148 months imprisonment, a term that is within the guideline range calculated in the presentence report but which would have been above the guideline range if the two-level enhancement had not been applied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    II. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A. Sufficiency of the Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When a defendant preserves a challenge to the sufficiency of the government's evidence by moving for a judgment of acquittal, we review the sufficiency of the evidence\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    United States v.

A \"jury's verdict cannot be overturned if any reasonable construction of the evidence would have allowed the jury to find the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Similarly, \"[t]he evidence need not be inconsistent with every reasonable hypothesis except guilt, and the jury is free to choose between or among the reasonable conclusions to be drawn from the evidence presented at trial.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

To prove armed bank robbery, the government must show that the defendant, in committing or attempting to commit an offense defined in subsection (a), \"assaults any person, or puts in jeopardy the life of any person by the use of a dangerous weapon or device.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202113\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2113(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A conviction for brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence requires the government to prove, among other elements, that the defendant \"display[ed] all or part of the firearm, or otherwise [made] the presence of the firearm known to another person, in order to intimidate that person, regardless of whether the firearm [was] directly visible to that person\" during a crime of violence.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1)(A)(ii), 924(c)(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Watts argues primarily that: the eyewitnesses did not positively identify him as the robber; there was no forensic evidence, including fingerprints or DNA analysis, that identified him; the hat and bandana worn by the bank robber were not recovered in his possession; the cash recovered from him was not tied to the bank robbery; the firearm found in his possession was of a different caliber than the one used in the robbery; and there was no location data or communications about a bank or robbery recovered from his phone. All of these facts, he asserts, show a lack of sufficient evidence to support his convictions for armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm during a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Watts describes the evidence as equally supporting guilt and innocence. While Watts correctly points out some evidence that does not help support the conviction, none of it is exonerating. And there was other evidence against Watts that the jury apparently found to be dispositive, and reasonably so. That evidence included: his similar appearance to the eyewitness accounts, including his distinctive tattoos and his haste to have them modified; a blue latex glove found in his car, similar to the gloves used by the robber; shoes found in his car that matched the appearance of the\n   robber's shoes; and the same caliber ammunition found in his possession as would be used in the weapon shown by the bank robber to the victims. In sum, there was ample circumstantial evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Watts: (1) robbed the bank with a dangerous weapon; and (2) brandished a firearm during the commission of that offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Watts cites\n   <em>\n    Cosby v. Jones\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that if a \"reviewing court is convinced by the evidence only that the defendant is more likely than not guilty then the evidence is not sufficient for conviction.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"538888\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/682/1373/#p1379\">\n    682 F.2d 1373\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1379 (11th Cir. 1982). But\n   <em>\n    Cosby\n   </em>\n   also states that \"[i]t is only where, after viewing the evidence in its most favorable light and making all credibility decisions in favor of the state the evidence still fails to at least preponderate in favor of the state, that we become concerned with conflicting inferences.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"538888\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/682/1373/#p1379\">\n    682 F.2d at 1383\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Right to Testify\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Watts argues that the district court violated his constitutional right to testify on his own behalf. In particular, he argues that as a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant, when the court raised the topic of his ability to testify, it did not sufficiently explain his options to ensure an intelligent decision, as required by\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In\n   <em>\n    Ly\n   </em>\n   , we noted that, \"absent evidence to the contrary, district courts should presume\" that even a\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   defendant has made a knowing and intelligent decision about whether to testify.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417858\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1307/#p1312\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417858\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1307/#p1312\">\n    at 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Despite proceeding\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   , he did have the benefit of the advice of his former counsel in an advisory role, and there was no indication that Watts held a mistaken belief regarding his ability to testify.

In this circuit, the \"right to testify generally must be exercised before the evidence-taking portion of the trial has closed.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

First, he asked before the close of evidence when the court notified him of his right to testify. But he then changed his mind after speaking with his advisory counsel and unequivocally stated that he did not want to testify. The court then concluded that Watts's case was closed. Watts asked to testify a second time, but once the court decided that Watts had rested his case, it was under no obligation to reopen the case when Watts made subsequent requests.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9022219\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/403/1278/#p1287\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this case, the court specifically found that Watts made his decision not to testify \"knowingly and voluntarily.\" The record does not rebut the presumption that Watts made his decision not to testify knowingly and voluntarily, even if he later had second thoughts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ly\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3417858\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/646/1307/#p1312\">\n    646 F.3d at 1317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[A]bsent\n   evidence to the contrary, district courts should presume that the defendant, even a pro se defendant, has made a knowing and intelligent decision about whether to testify.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   C.

At Watts's sentencing hearing, the district court adopted the statements in the presentence report as its finding of fact, and found that \"the facts of this case showed that the defendant attempted to obstruct or impede the administration of justice with respect to the investigation and the prosecution of this case by altering distinct physical features of his tattoos that the investigators were looking for in an attempt to identify the person who was the bank robber.\" Accordingly, by explaining how Watts's specific conduct was designed to hinder the investigation and thereby warranted the enhancement, the court's decision to apply the enhancement included sufficient explanation to comport with\n   <em>\n    Alpert\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Pursuant to the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant's offense level will be increased by two levels if:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice with respect to the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (2) the obstructive conduct related to (A) the defendant's offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (B) a closely related offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1 (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The commentary for \u00a7 3C1.1 explains that \"[o]bstructive conduct can vary widely in nature, degree of planning, and seriousness.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048604\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/938/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3C1.1 comment.

The \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement does not ordinarily apply to defendants who provide a false name or identification document at arrest, except where such conduct actually resulted in a significant hindrance to the investigation. Nor does it apply to those who avoid or flee from arrest.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9048604\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/88/938/#p944\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 3C1.1 comment.

The identity of the robber was the primary issue in the investigation, and his distinctive tattoos were a key factor, i.e., material evidence. Watts suggests that applying the enhancement to the facts of this case would broaden the enhancement to cover any situation where a defendant altered his appearance to avoid arrest. For example, he cites\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bliss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594227\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/640/\">\n    430 F.3d 640\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 2005), in which the enhancement did not apply to a defendant that gained weight and grew a mustache prior to his arrest, and\n   <em>\n    United States v. Bonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541670\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/152/\">\n    933 F.2d 152\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2d Cir. 1991), which held the enhancement did not apply to a defendant who dramatically changed his hair style and clothing. Yet in each of those cases the enhancement did not apply because there was not sufficient evidence to show that the defendant had the purpose of thwarting the investigation.\n   <em>\n    Bonds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541670\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/152/\">\n    933 F.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   154 ;\n   <em>\n    Bliss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1594227\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/430/640/\">\n    430 F.3d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover Watts's conduct in this case was far more obstructive to the investigation than a mere disguise. As the trial court explained at his sentencing, Watts's actions altered \"distinct physical features of his tattoos that the investigators were looking for.\" In other words, by permanently altering his identifying marks, he destroyed material evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Watts argues that without specific Sentencing Guideline commentary examples directly on point, the rule of lenity should apply. \"The rule of lenity is a canon of statutory construction that requires courts to construe ambiguous criminal statutes narrowly in favor of the accused.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.
