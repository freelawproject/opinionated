He had a security clearance. In June 2009, he and a Navy reservist friend had dinner with two Syrian nationals, one of whom worked for the Syrian embassy. The reservist told Palmieri that \"she felt compelled to report\" to American authorities their contact with foreign nationals. JA 352. Later, the reservist in fact reported the contact, mentioning that Palmieri had introduced her to the Syrians. According to the reservist, Palmieri had asked her\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to report his association with the Syrians.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The government opened an investigation. Without telling Palmieri, agents of the Naval Criminal Investigative Service (NCIS) reviewed his work emails, copied files from his office computers and kept tabs on his travel. In May 2010, the agents \"interrogated\" him. Compl. 19-20. They told him he was free to leave but that, if he did not answer their questions, his security clearance would be suspended. Afterward, the agents reported to Navy lawyers that Palmieri had been \"evasive\" and \"unwilling to provide information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21. Palmieri's supervisors had him removed from the base. NCIS agents searched his office and computers and seized his work documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Palmieri returned to the United States and continued working in a contractor job that required a security clearance. In July 2011, he submitted to an NCIS polygraph test. Thereafter, in a letter to the Defense Department, NCIS agent Lynda Carpenter summarized the investigation and the results of the polygraph test. According to her letter:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \u2022 The reservist told authorities that Palmieri had asked her \"not to report his association with the Syrian nationals to anyone inside of the U.S. government.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \u2022 In a security form, Palmieri \"did not acknowledge any ongoing foreign national contacts or associations with foreign government officials.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 When the NCIS agents interviewed Palmieri, he was \"reluctant to provide information\" about his foreign contacts. He eventually \"disclosed ongoing contact with an employee of the Syrian embassy\" but \"only after it was revealed [that] NCIS officials were already aware of the relationship.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \u2022 During the polygraph test, Palmieri was asked if he possessed \"classified material outside of government control\" or \"provided classified information to unauthorized personnel.\" The polygraph indicated \"[d]eception ... in his responses to both questions.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   JA 230-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In August 2011, the Defense Department suspended Palmieri's security clearance \"pending a final clearance decision from the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals [ (DOHA) ].\" Compl. 30. As a result, Palmieri's employer fired him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    ADMINISTRATIVE AND DISTRICT COURT PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   By executive order, as implemented through Defense Department Directive 5220.6 (Aug. 30, 2006), perma.cc/2DQ4-Z4KW, a contractor is not to be granted a security clearance unless clearance \"is clearly consistent with the national interest,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3.2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Exec.

In September 2012, per the Directive, the Defense Department issued a Statement of Reasons explaining why the government was \"unable to find that it is clearly consistent with the national interest\" for Palmieri\n   to regain clearance. JA 196;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. 33. The Statement of Reasons alleged (\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ) that Palmieri displayed \"questionable judgment\" by asking the reservist \"not to disclose [his] association with ... Syrian nationals.\" JA 196;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. 34. In a written response, Palmieri denied the allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The matter was submitted to a DOHA administrative judge to determine whether to revoke Palmieri's security clearance. Over Palmieri's confrontation and hearsay objections-and after Palmieri declined an opportunity to call the reservist as a witness-the judge admitted Carpenter's letter. Palmieri testified at length and \"denied that he told the [reservist] not to mention his name.\" JA 188. The judge discredited this testimony, finding that Palmieri was \"evasive and less than completely forthcoming.\" JA 188, 194. Ultimately, the judge concluded that Palmieri had indeed displayed questionable judgment in \"attempt[ing] to convince [the reservist] to leave him out of her report.\" JA 193. Accordingly, the judge revoked his clearance. The DOHA appeal board affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Palmieri filed suit, raising an assortment of constitutional and statutory claims. His 30-count complaint invokes (\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   ) the Bill of Attainder Clause, U.S. CONST. art.

Also, the court partially dismissed Count 21 and granted summary judgment to the government on the remainder of that count. Finally, the court ordered Palmieri to \"file a more definite statement about\" the other six counts: Counts 23-27 and 29. JA 462. It later granted summary judgment to the government on those six counts. In our claim-by-claim analysis, we summarize the necessary particulars of Palmieri's theories of liability and the district court's grounds of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <strong>\n    II. ANALYSIS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   First we clear some underbrush. We need not consider Counts 3, 7, 9 and 16 because Palmieri expressly forfeits any challenge to their dismissal. Appellant's Br. 32 (he \"invites\" us to \"dispense\" with them). We need not consider Counts 10-11, 17-18, 23-27 and 29 because neither Palmieri nor amicus raises any argument about them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    S. Cal. Edison Co. v.

Cir. 2010) (\"A party can and does [forfeit] any argument not presented in our court except those going to our own jurisdiction or similar structural issues[.]\"). And we need not consider Counts 28 and 30 because Palmieri acquiesced in their dismissal. Our task, then, is to decide whether Palmieri or amicus advances any good reason to reinstate any of the other fourteen counts: Counts 1-2, 4-6, 8, 12-15 and 19-22. We think not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    COUNTS 2, 20 AND 22: FRIVOLOUS CONSTITUTIONAL CLAIMS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Count 2 alleges that the government violated Palmieri's \"natural rights\" by investigating him and gathering information about him. Compl. 46. Count 20 alleges that Carpenter's letter and the ensuing revocation of Palmieri's clearance were part of a \"Soviet-style\" government conspiracy to \"punish\" Palmieri through \"extrajudicial\" means.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 104, 107. Count 22 alleges that the conspiracy was motivated by \"ethnic, lingu[i]stic, religious,\n   and/or racial\" animus.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 115 (alleging that defendants acted as they did because of Palmieri's \"associations with Arab and/or Muslim individuals\"). According to Counts 2, 20 and 22, this conduct violated the Bill of Attainder Clause, the Treason Clause and the First, Fifth, Ninth and Tenth Amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The district court concluded that Counts 2, 20 and 22 are barred by\n   <em>\n    Department of Navy v.

We recently reserved that question,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gill v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265580\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/875/677/#p681\">\n    875 F.3d 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 682 (D.C.

At some point, we will likely need to decide it, for the government warns us that individuals denied clearances are increasingly invoking cases like\n   <em>\n    Webster v. Doe\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Greenberg\n   </em>\n   to chip away at\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   This case squarely presents the question, for Palmieri\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   ask the Court to undo the revocation of his security clearance, and some of his claims challenge the constitutionality of\n   <em>\n    adjudicatory\n   </em>\n   as opposed to investigatory processes. The government understandably wants some answers, in light of the ongoing tension in the relevant precedents. Nonetheless, prudence\n   seems to counsel restraint in this case, given the\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   representation and the sprawling, unfocused nature of the complaint. Because Palmieri's claims can be rejected on non-\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   grounds, and because the Court's opinion leaves open the possibility that\n   <em>\n    Egan\n   </em>\n   might bar some or all of them, I join the opinion in its entirety.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
