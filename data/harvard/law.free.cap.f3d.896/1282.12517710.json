The Mayor of Birmingham, Alabama, William Bell, had just affixed his signature to Birmingham Ordinance No. 16-28, which guaranteed Lewis, Adams, and all other wage earners in the city $10.10 per hour. But the following afternoon, Alabama Governor Robert Bentley signed the Minimum Wage and Right-to-Work Act (The Minimum Wage Act or the Act) into law. The Minimum Wage Act nullified Birmingham Ordinance No. 16-28, preempted all local labor and employment regulation, and mandated a uniform minimum wage throughout Alabama-which, then and now, sits at $7.25 per hour. At the heart of this appeal is whether Lewis and Adams have stated a plausible claim that the Minimum Wage Act had the purpose and effect of discriminating against Birmingham's black citizens, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Because they have, we reverse the dismissal of that claim. We affirm the dismissal of all other claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The events giving rise to this proceeding began in April 2015, when the Birmingham City Council passed a resolution calling upon the state legislature to raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour across Alabama. At that time, no Alabama municipality had a minimum wage above the federal floor of $7.25.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 206\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1)(C). After the state refused the city's request, the city council adopted its own minimum wage law that August. The unanimous ordinance, which was scheduled to take effect in July 2016, raised the minimum wage to $8.50 per hour, and to $10.10 in 2017. The ordinance declared the need \"to take legislative steps to help lift working families out of poverty, decrease income inequality, and boost [Birmingham's] economy.\" Birmingham, the largest city in Alabama, has more total residents living in poverty (30% of its citizens) than anywhere else in the state.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The city is also home to\n   the largest black population in Alabama (72%), which is reflected in the racial composition of its city council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   About a week after the ordinance's approval, a white state representative from the neighboring community of Mountain Brook (where only 1.5% of residents are black and just 3% of residents live below the poverty line) introduced a bill in the Alabama House of Representatives designed to quash Birmingham's ordinance and establish a uniform minimum wage throughout the state. The bill stalled, but at the start of the 2016 session, a variation of the bill (now called HB 174) was introduced by the same representative, this time with the support of fifty-two additional sponsors, all of whom were white.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Things progressed quickly. Within a week of its introduction on February 9, 2016, HB 174 sailed through the House Committee on State Government and won the approval of a majority of the House, 71-31. No black member of the House voted in favor of the bill. Thirty-six hours later, the bill cleared the Alabama Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs and was on its way to the Senate floor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Meanwhile, the Birmingham City Council moved to accelerate the implementation of its own minimum wage law. On February 23, it adopted Ordinance No. 16-28, raising the minimum wage for Birmingham workers to $10.10 per hour, adjusted annually, effective immediately. Mayor Bell signed it into law the following day. Notice of the new minimum wage was slated for publication in the Sunday edition of the\n   <em>\n    Birmingham News\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   But on February 25, just a day after Birmingham raised its minimum wage, the Alabama Senate approved the Minimum Wage Act, 23-12, rendering Ordinance No. 16-28 null and void. The Act lacked support from any black senators. Governor Bentley signed it into law less than two hours later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Minimum Wage Act, codified at Alabama Code \u00a7\u00a7 25-7-40 et seq., \"establish[es] within the Legislature complete control over regulation and policy pertaining to collective bargaining ... or the wages, leave, or other employment benefits provided by an employer to an employee ... in order to ensure that such regulation and policy is applied uniformly throughout the state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-7-45(a). To that end, the Act \"occupies and preempts the entire field of regulation\" in these areas \"to the complete exclusion of any policy, ordinance, rule, or other mandate promulgated or enforced by any ... political subdivision of th[e] state.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20206\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 25-7-45(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A few months after the Alabama Legislature passed the Minimum Wage Act, Lewis and Adams-who live in Birmingham and make less than $10.10 per hour-along with several public interest groups, sued the Governor and the Attorney General of Alabama, claiming racial discrimination under multiple theories. The plaintiffs amended their complaint to include claims under the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments and \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act. They also added the State of Alabama, the City of Birmingham, and Birmingham Mayor William Bell as defendants, while dropping the governor from the suit. The defendants moved to dismiss for lack of standing and failure to state a claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The district court agreed with the defendants and dismissed the complaint. It concluded that the plaintiffs lacked Article III standing to sue any of the defendants; that the attorney general was an improper defendant under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    209 U.S. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    28 S.Ct. 441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8288600\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/209/123/\">\n    52 L.Ed. 714\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1908) ; that\n   \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act did not abrogate Eleventh Amendment state sovereign immunity; and that, in any event, the plaintiffs had failed to assert any plausible claims. The plaintiffs now appeal the dismissal of their Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendment claims against the attorney general and the City of Birmingham,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and their Voting Rights Act claim against the State of Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We review both subject matter jurisdiction and Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity issues de novo.\n   <em>\n    Summit Med.

The defendants contest each of these claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As an initial matter, we have little trouble concluding that the plaintiffs have suffered concrete injuries as a result of the Minimum Wage Act. According to the amended complaint, Lewis and Adams work in Birmingham and earn less than $10.10 per hour. Birmingham Ordinance No. 16-28 guaranteed them $10.10 per hour, adjusted annually to a cost of living index. And the Minimum Wage Act nullified Ordinance No. 16-28, in effect depriving Lewis and Adams of a significant increase in their hourly wage. If the Act is unlawful, they suffer an injury in fact with each working hour. Likewise, the plaintiff organizations, which are devoted to social, economic, and political improvements for Alabama's black citizens, have put forth sufficient facts demonstrating they have diverted resources to counteract the effects of the Minimum Wage Act on their operations. The plaintiffs have met Article III's injury requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Next, we address whether these injuries can be attributed to these defendants.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hollywood Mobile Estates Ltd. v. Seminole Tribe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7343520,4206076\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/1259/\">\n    641 F.3d 1259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1265-66 (11th Cir. 2011). We start with the attorney general. The attorney general's broad authority to interpret and enforce the Minimum Wage Act illustrates his Article III connection to the defendants' harm, which is the direct consequence of the Act's continued enforcement. Alabama imbues the attorney general with sweeping authority to interpret, enforce, and defend the laws and interests of the state,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2036-15-1\">\n    Ala.

What's more, the attorney general is given sole authority to direct and control all litigation concerning the interests of the state,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2036-15-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-15-21, and is empowered to \"institute and prosecute, in the name of the state, all civil actions and other proceedings necessary to protect the rights and interests of the state,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2036-15-1\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 36-15-12. Undoubtedly that authority applies to the Minimum Wage Act. Indeed, the defendants conceded at oral argument that if Birmingham implemented its minimum wage ordinance in spite of the Minimum Wage Act, the attorney general could sue the city to compel compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   And in fact, the attorney general recently did just that. After Birmingham erected a plywood barrier around one of its Confederate monuments, the attorney general sued the city and mayor to enforce the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act, citing his general authority under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2036-15-12\">\n    Ala.

Aside from the attorney general's authority to direct and control enforcement litigation, he is also responsible for determining whether Alabama's statutes are constitutional,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2036-15-1\">\n    Ala.

We have little doubt that an injunction declaring the Minimum Wage Act unconstitutional and prohibiting the attorney general from enforcing it-thereby requiring him to announce its invalidity to the governor and the legislature-would go a long way toward redressing the plaintiffs' injuries. The plaintiffs have fulfilled the Article III standing requirements to sue the attorney general.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The City of Birmingham, on the other hand, is not a proper defendant for these claims. The plaintiffs allege that the city's failure to enforce its own minimum wage law sufficiently connects it to their injuries sustained under the Minimum Wage Act. But the city's refusal to implement a nullified law does not make it the cause of the plaintiffs' injuries. And besides, the attorney general has the authority to enforce the Minimum Wage Act against the City of Birmingham, whether it wills to resist state supremacy or not. Thus, ordering Birmingham to implement Ordinance No. 16-28 would only kick the (wrong) can down the road and leave the plaintiffs subject to the same allegedly discriminatory statute from which they seek relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiffs' injuries are not traceable to the City of Birmingham, which is powerless to redress them. Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of the city from the suit, but we reverse the district court's holding that the plaintiffs lack Article III standing to assert their claims against the attorney general and the State of Alabama.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Before we move on to the merits, two other matters need addressing. Besides dismissing the plaintiffs' claims for lack of Article III standing, the district court also found that they were barred on sovereign immunity grounds. Thus, we must determine whether the attorney general was an improper substitute for the state under\n   <em>\n    Ex parte Young\n   </em>\n   , and whether Eleventh Amendment immunity bars the Voting Rights Act claim against the State of Alabama-that is, whether \u00a7 2 of the Voting Rights Act abrogated state sovereign immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Eleventh Amendment generally bars suits against a state by its own citizens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hans v.

The Minimum Wage Act denied 37% of Birmingham's black wage workers a higher hourly wage, compared to only 27% of white wage workers. What's more, black wage workers in Birmingham make, on average, $1.41 less per hour than white wage workers, and $2.12 less per hour statewide. Given these numbers, we find it plausible that the Minimum Wage Act \"bears more\n   heavily on one race than another.\"\n   <em>\n    Young Apartments, Inc. v.

To accept this argument would be to ignore the allegations in this case. The Minimum Wage Act was passed in direct response to Birmingham's minimum wage ordinances, which made it the only municipality in Alabama guaranteeing an hourly wage above the federal floor. Thus, it was not \"cherry picking\" for the plaintiffs to focus on Birmingham, the community at which the law was primarily directed and where its impact was most transparent. This is not the place to debate the Minimum Wage Act's long term macroeconomic merits. What we know from the pleadings is that the Act immediately denied a significant wage increase to roughly 40,000 Birmingham residents, the vast majority of whom were black. These facts are more than sufficient to support a plausible allegation that the Minimum Wage Act burdens black citizens more than white ones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   This leads us to the more challenging question: have the plaintiffs alleged facts plausibly supporting a conclusion that the Minimum Wage Act was enacted with a discriminatory purpose?

The Minimum Wage Act responded directly to the legislative efforts of the majority-black Birmingham City Council, which represents more black citizens (and more black citizens living in poverty) than any other city in Alabama. The Act swiftly nullified efforts of those Birmingham City Council members to benefit their majority-black constituents even though the Alabama legislature had previously \"failed to take any action to establish a statewide minimum wage law and had [ ] been indifferent to efforts to establish such a law.\" D.E. 18 at \u00b6 83. The Act was introduced by a white representative from Alabama's least diverse area, with the help of fifty-two other white sponsors, and was objected to by all black members of the House and Senate.
