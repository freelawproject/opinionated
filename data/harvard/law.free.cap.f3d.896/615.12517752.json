Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d 672\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Va. 2017). The FAQ 33 policy purported to clarify the methodology for calculating the maximum amount of financial assistance available to hospitals, like Plaintiff-Appellee Children's Hospital of the King's Daughters, Inc. (\"Children's Hospital\"), that serve a disproportionate number of low-income or special needs patients (commonly referred to as \"disproportionate share hospitals\" or \"DSHs\"). Under the methodology in FAQ 33, Children's Hospital would have to repay $19.1 million in DSH payments it received from the Medicaid program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The district court enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the FAQ 33 policy against Children's Hospital for two reasons: (1) the promulgation of the FAQ 33 policy failed to comply with the procedural requirements set forth in the Administrative Procedural Act (\"APA\") and (2) the FAQ 33 policy contradicted the plain and unambiguous language of the governing statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the district court correctly determined that the policy set forth in FAQ 33 constituted a \"legislative rule\" and, therefore, that the APA mandated that the agency establish the FAQ 33 policy through notice-and-comment rulemaking.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20553\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) - (c). We thus affirm the district court's judgment enjoining the Secretary from enforcing the policy set forth in FAQ 33 against Children's Hospital. Because we conclude that the policy violated the APA's procedural requirements, we decline to reach the substantive challenge by Children's Hospital to the FAQ 33 policy and vacate the part of the district court's opinion addressing whether that policy conflicts with the language of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396r-4(g).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Medicaid,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201396\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1396\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , is a cooperative federal-state program through which the federal government provides financial assistance to state Medicaid programs, which in turn provide medical insurance to qualifying individuals.\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 677\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The statute further establishes an\n   <em>\n    aggregate\n   </em>\n   limit on the amount of payment adjustments state programs can allocate\n   to all qualifying DSHs in their state. \u00a7 1396r-4(f)(3).

In particular, a section titled \"Total annual uncompensated care costs\" provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   The total annual uncompensated care cost equals the total cost of care for furnishing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid eligible individuals and to individuals with no source of third party coverage for the hospital services they receive less the sum of regular Medicaid [fee-for-service] rate payments, Medicaid managed care organization payments, supplemental/enhanced Medicaid payments, uninsured revenues, and Section 1011 payments for inpatient and outpatient hospital services. This should equal the sum of paragraphs (c)(9), (c)(12), and (c)(13) subtracted from the sum of paragraphs (c)(10) and (c)(14) of this section.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \u00a7 447.299(c)(16). Of particular relevance to this appeal, Section 447.299(c)(10) defines the \"Total Cost of Care for Medicaid [Inpatient/Outpatient] Services\" as \"The total annual costs incurred by each hospital for furnishing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services to Medicaid eligible individuals.\" And Section 447.299(c)(9) defines \"Total Medicaid [Inpatient/Outpatient] Payments\" as the sum of Medicaid fee-for-service payments, Medicaid managed care payments, and supplemental Medicaid payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The dispute between Children's Hospital and the Secretary turns on whether payments by private insurance companies to Children's Hospital on behalf of Medicaid-eligible patients should be accounted for in determining Children's Hospital DSH payment adjustment. In a Frequently Asked Questions document released in 2010, FAQ 33, which was not promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking, CMS took the position that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   days, costs, and revenues associated with patients that are eligible for Medicaid and also have private insurance\n   <em>\n    should be included in the calculation of the hospital-specific DSH limit\n   </em>\n   . As Medicaid should be the payer of last resort, hospitals should also offset both Medicaid and third-party revenue associated with the Medicaid eligible day against the costs for that day to determine any uncompensated amount.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 679-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Until it understood FAQ 33's import in October 2016-as a result of an audit by an outside auditor working on behalf of Virginia's Medicaid program-Children's Hospital did not include payments from private insurers in calculating its payment adjustment. The auditor determined that Children's Hospital was obliged to repay $19.1 million to the State Medicaid program as a result of DSH overpayments Children's Hospital received because it failed to include private insurance payments in its payment adjustment calculation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 7, 2017, Children's Hospital filed a complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. Children's Hospital sought a declaration that FAQ 33's requirement that private insurance payments be included in calculating the payment adjustment is contrary to the plain and unambiguous language of Section 1396r-4(g)(1), and therefore is unlawful and must be vacated under the Administrative Procedure Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20706\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2)(c). Alternatively, Children's Hospital argued that the FAQ 33 policy constituted a substantive amendment to the calculation methodology set forth in the 2008 rule and therefore that CMS unlawfully sought to effect a regulatory policy change without completing notice-and-comment rulemaking. Children's Hospital sought an injunction barring the Secretary from enforcing FAQ 33's policy of requiring inclusion of private insurance payments in calculating the payment adjustment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In an opinion and order entered June 20, 2017, the district court concluded that the FAQ 33 policy amounted to a substantive rule that should have been promulgated through notice-and-comment rulemaking and that the policy conflicted with the plain and unambiguous language of Section 1396r-4(g)(1).\n   <em>\n    Children's Hosp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n    258 F.Supp.3d at 687, 689\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The district court preliminarily enjoined the Secretary from enforcing the policy set forth in FAQ 33 against Children's Hospital.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12273606\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/258/672/\">\n    at 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . At the request of the parties, the district court subsequently converted its preliminary injunction opinion and order into an award of summary judgment to Children's Hospital and, therefore, an appealable final judgment. The Secretary timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, the Secretary makes two arguments: (1) that the FAQ 33 policy constitutes an \"interpretative\"-rather than \"legislative\"-rule and therefore need not have been the product of notice-and-comment rulemaking, and (2) that the policy set forth in FAQ 33 amounts to a reasonable administrative construction of the governing statutory language and therefore is entitled to judicial deference.
