Dumaresq's (Acting Secretary) November 19, 2014 order reinstating Vladimirsky to his position as a professional employee from July 20, 2011 to March 15, 2012, and sustaining Vladimirsky's March 15, 2012 employment termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Vladimirsky presents six issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the District and the School Reform Commission (SRC)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   failed to comply with the mandatory employment termination procedures set forth in the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code);\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) whether the District and the SRC's failure to comply with the School Code violated Vladimirsky's due process rights; (3) whether the Acting Secretary erred in sustaining Vladimirsky's March 15, 2012 discharge; (4) whether the District was required to impose progressive discipline before terminating Vladimirsky's employment; (5) whether a two-year delay in the issuance of the Acting Secretary's order created the appearance of impropriety; and (6) whether the SRC's hearing examiner's status as a long-time District employee violated Vladimirsky's due process right to an impartial and unbiased tribunal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The District presents five additional issues: (1) whether the School Code required the SRC to resolve that evidence existed and, if true, justified employment termination, before issuing charges; (2) whether the District was required to prove that the SRC read or knew about the charges or the employment termination hearing transcript before resolving to discharge him; (3) whether the District's July 20, 2011 letter suspended Vladimirsky without pay; (4) whether an SRC pre-charge determination would have violated Vladimirsky's due process rights; and (5) if the Court rules that there were procedural defects, whether remand is the proper remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The District hired Vladimirsky as a professional employee on September 1, 1997 and he was employed as a tenured professional until his employment was terminated. Vladimirsky worked as a social studies teacher at Overbrook High School (Overbrook). On February 17, 2011, because Overbrook's then-principal Payne Young (Young) observed Vladimirsky's students disengaged from classroom activities, she knocked on the door and asked\n   Vladimirsky about the class. Vladimirsky became angry and yelled at Young. Young walked away to attend a meeting and Vladimirsky followed her, speaking in a raised voice. Vladimirsky continued his aggressive behavior in front of Young's meeting participants. That day, Young issued an incident report concerning Vladimirsky's behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On March 9, 2011, Overbrook academic leader Catherine Smith (Smith) notified Vladimirsky that several books had been thrown out of his classroom window, and she assisted Vladimirsky in identifying the responsible students. One of Vladimirsky's students made a video documenting Vladimirsky's extremely agitated behavior at the time. In the video, Vladimirsky shouted about the books being thrown out of the window and yelled obscenities at the students. He then aggressively approached a student holding a cellphone and grabbed the student's arm in an attempt to take the phone. When the student resisted, Vladimirsky lost his balance and fell on the student. The school police officer was called. Written incident statements by students, Smith and Vladimirsky corroborated the incident and Vladimirsky's reaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 11, 2011, Assistant Superintendent Linda Cliatt-Wayman instructed Vladimirsky to report to work at the High School Academic Division on March 14, 2011 pending an investigation. On March 23, 2011, Young conducted an investigatory conference attended by Vladimirsky, Young, Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) staff Jackie Dubin (Dubin) and the District's labor relations assistant Carole Porter (Porter). At the conference, Vladimirsky admitted to the February 17, 2011 verbal exchange and that his temper caused him problems. Vladimirsky and Dubin also reviewed the March 9, 2011 witness statements and video. Thereafter, Young prepared an unsatisfactory incident report (SEH-204) referencing both the February 17 and March 9, 2011 incidents, and recommending Vladimirsky's discharge. Young also recommended placement of the SEH-204 in Vladimirsky's personnel file, and giving him an unsatisfactory rating for the September 2010 to June 30, 2011 period. Following an April 28, 2011 conference attended by Vladimirsky, Dubin, Porter and Young pertaining to the March 9, 2011 incident, Young issued a May 2, 2011 conference summary, wherein, she upheld the SEH-204 because Vladimirsky's March 9, 2011 response was excessive and unprofessional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 8, 2011, the District's Talent Acquisition Office's Deputy Chief Lissa S. Johnson (Johnson)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   held a second-level conference with Vladimirsky, Dubin and Porter regarding the February 17 and March 9, 2011 incidents. Johnson offered Vladimirsky an opportunity to provide additional information or comments. Vladimirsky apologized for the February 17, 2011 incident. With respect to the March 9, 2011 incident, Dubin, on Vladimirsky's behalf, stated that Vladimirsky felt that the students had betrayed his trust, and that he had acted emotionally. Vladimirsky acknowledged that he acted inappropriately when he physically confronted the student, and he did not deny using obscenities. Following the June 8, 2011 conference, Johnson issued a conference summary recommending that Vladimirsky's employment be terminated and that incident documentation be placed in his personnel file.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By a July 20, 2011 letter signed by SRC Chairman Robert L. Archie, Jr., Esquire and Deputy Superintendent Leroy D. Nunery (Nunery),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Vladimirsky was notified that the charges against him constituted \"a willful violation of or failure to comply with the School Laws of this Commonwealth, and other improper conduct such as to constitute cause pursuant to ... Section [1122] of the [School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1122 ].\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 162a. The letter informed Vladimirsky that they would recommend to the SRC that his employment with the District be terminated effective immediately, and that he had a right to request an SRC hearing. In the same letter, Vladimirsky was told that the District's payroll department would be advised to make the necessary salary adjustments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   By October 3, 2011 letter, Vladimirsky requested a hearing. On November 28, 2011, a hearing was held before Jeffrey White (Hearing Officer White), the SRC's hearing officer for all District dismissal, demotion or suspension cases. At the hearing, the District contended that it would demonstrate that Vladimirsky had willfully violated or failed to comply with Section 1122 of the School Code in that he had \"administered corporal punishment to the student.\" R.R. at 17a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   By April 5, 2012 letter, Hearing Officer White notified Vladimirsky that the SRC had recommended that Vladimirsky's employment be terminated for intemperance and willful violation of \"the School Laws.\" R.R. at 101a. The letter also advised Vladimirsky that after full consideration of the charges, testimony, evidence and arguments, on March 15, 2012, the SRC resolved to adopt Hearing Officer White's findings of fact and conclusions of law enclosed therein, and that Vladimirsky's employment was terminated effective July 20, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Vladimirsky timely appealed from the SRC's decision to the Acting Secretary. On June 4, 2012, argument was held before Hearing Examiner Karen S. Feuchtenberger. On November 19, 2014, the Acting Secretary ordered that Vladimirsky be reinstated to his position as a professional employee as of July 20, 2011, but sustained his March 15, 2012 discharge and ordered that he receive the compensation lost between July 20, 2011 and March 15, 2012. The District and Vladimirsky appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Vladimirsky's Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Vladimirsky first contends that the Acting Secretary erred in sustaining the March 15, 2012 dismissal because the District did not comply with the School Code's mandatory discharge procedures when\n   <strong>\n    the District terminated his employment as a professional employee on July 20, 2011\n   </strong>\n   without a hearing, and then, belatedly\n   <strong>\n    held a hearing more than four months later\n   </strong>\n   on November 28, 2011 which also did not comply with the School Code, and finally\n   <strong>\n    resolved to ratify Vladimirsky's illegal employment termination four months later\n   </strong>\n   on March 15, 2012. As a result, Vladimirsky asserts that his employment termination is\n   <em>\n    void ab initio.\n   </em>\n   The District argues that it complied with Section 1127 of the School Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The District sent Vladimirsky a letter dated July 20, 2011 which stated, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   This is to advise you that\n   <strong>\n    we shall recommend to the [SRC]\n   </strong>\n   that your employment with [the District]\n   <strong>\n    be terminated effective immediately.

Thereafter, Vladimirsky requested an SRC hearing which occurred on November 28, 2011. Vladimirsky's subsequent discharge did not occur until the SRC's March 15, 2012 resolution. Although the resolution stated that Vladimirsky's employment termination was effective July 20, 2011, the Acting Secretary's November 19, 2014 order reinstated Vladimirsky to his position as a professional\n   employee from July 20, 2011 to March 15, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 1127 of the School Code states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   Before any professional employe[e] having attained a status of permanent tenure is dismissed by the board of school directors, such board of school directors shall furnish such professional employe[e] with a detailed written statement of the charges upon which his or her proposed dismissal is based and shall conduct a hearing. A written notice signed by the president and attested by the secretary of the board of school directors shall be forwarded by registered mail to the professional employe[e] setting forth the time and place when and where such professional employe[e] will be given an opportunity to be heard either in person or by counsel, or both, before the board of school directors and setting forth a detailed statement of the charges. Such hearing shall not be sooner than ten (10) days nor later than fifteen (15) days after such written notice. At such hearing all testimony offered, including that of complainants and their witnesses, as well as that of the accused professional employe[e] and his or her witnesses, shall be recorded by a competent disinterested public stenographer whose services shall be furnished by the school district at its expense.

In fact, the District admits that the July 20, 2011 letter was\n   <strong>\n    not\n   </strong>\n   sent on the SRC's behalf as required\n   by Section 1127 of the School Code but,\n   <strong>\n    as explicitly admitted in the District's brief,\n   </strong>\n   was \"[t]he\n   <strong>\n    administration ['s]\n   </strong>\n   ... recommend[ation for] termination[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   District's Br. at 25 (emphasis added). Importantly, the July 20, 2011 letter also stated that the recommended employment termination was to be effective immediately, and that the payroll department would be so advised. Because Vladimirsky was paid for the 2010-2011 school year, but not thereafter, it would appear that his employment was terminated as of the date of the letter-July 20, 2011. The SRC resolution did not occur until March 15, 2012, but retroactively set Vladimirsky's dismissal date as July 20, 2011. Clearly, the November 28, 2011 SRC hearing and the March 15, 2012 resolution do not pre-date Vladimirsky's discharge. Accordingly, the Acting Secretary concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   The record evidences that ... Vladimirsky was paid for his employment with the District through the 2010-2011 school year but was no longer employed by the District beyond that school year. Thus, ...

However, the District's position contradicts its earlier argument that the July 20, 2011 letter was the result of SRC action, rather than administrative District action. These irreconcilable positions demonstrate the District's disingenuous attempt to justify its School Code violation. The July 20, 2011 letter does not lend itself to informing Vladimirsky that his employment with the District has been suspended. If that is what the District intended then it could have so communicated. Rather, the unambiguous words reveal finality and the District's intent to immediately discharge Vladimirsky. Moreover, the District's actions immediately after issuance of the letter in stopping Vladimirsky's pay with no statement beyond the words that the District recommends his immediate discharge further evidences a termination, not a suspension. \"[A]ssuming arguendo that there was ambiguity, doubtful language is construed most strongly against the drafter thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Rusiski v.

Further, on March 15, 2012, the SRC made Vladimirsky's dismissal effective July 20, 2011. The Acting Secretary subsequently revised the termination date to March 15, 2012, the date of the SRC resolution, and ordered back pay for the time in between.

The July 20, 2011 letter does not demonstrate that the charges were brought on the SRC's behalf. Rather, the letter and the District's admission reflect just the opposite. In fact, as the Acting Secretary stated: \"The only evidence in the record of the SRC's knowledge concerning ...

No resolution was passed, and no notice was sent before Vladimirsky's employment termination. Instead, the District sent Vladimirsky a termination letter. In addition, the date of Vladimirsky's notice of charges and hearing was actually the effective date of his employment termination which is directly contrary to the School Code's requirement that a hearing pre-date the employment termination. Indeed, the required resolution took place\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the hearing.

Were we to affirm the Acting Secretary's order, allowing her review to cure the District's noncompliance with the School Code, we would eviscerate the very statutory protections that the Legislature afforded tenured professionals, thereby contravening legislative intent. In essence, we would be amending the statute. This we may not do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v.
