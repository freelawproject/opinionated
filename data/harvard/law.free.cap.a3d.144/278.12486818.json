The trial court granted the petition with respect to tobacco accessories it concluded were drug paraphernalia but denied the petition for the remaining inventory, which ranged from store shelving and computers to cash. The appellants contend that the trial court erred in holding that the forfeited tobacco accessories, which could be used for legitimate purposes, constituted drug paraphernalia. They also argue that the trial court's forfeiture imposed an excessive fine in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. We reverse the trial court's order granting forfeiture of the tobacco accessories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 8, 2013, the York County Drug Task Force arrested Brandon Severns in the parking lot of One Step Above for possession with intent to deliver marijuana.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Upon learning that Severns was part owner of One Step Above, the police obtained a search warrant to search the shop. Russell, the other owner, was present when police arrived and conducted their search; no drugs were found. Nevertheless, the police confiscated the store's inventory of approximately 5,000 items, including cash, televisions, video game systems, shelving units, a motorcycle, a refrigerator, T-shirts, and electronic surveillance equipment. Relevant to this appeal was the seizure of smoking devices, such as glass pipes, and tobacco accessories, such as scales, grinders, and torch kits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police charged Russell with the crime of delivery of drug paraphernalia in violation of Section 13(a)(33) of The Controlled Substance, Drug, Device and Cosmetic Act (Drug Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   It provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (a) The following acts and the causing thereof within the Commonwealth are hereby prohibited:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (33) The delivery of, possession with intent to deliver, or manufacture with intent to deliver, drug paraphernalia, knowing, or under circumstances where one reasonably should know, that it would be used to plant, propagate, cultivate, grow, harvest, manufacture, compound, convert, produce, process, prepare, test, analyze, pack, repack, store, contain, conceal, inject, ingest, inhale or otherwise introduce into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   35 P.S. \u00a7 780-113(a)(33). The Drug Act defines drug paraphernalia, and it sets forth a test for determining whether an item of property meets the definition. Section 2 of the Drug Act states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"Drug paraphernalia\" means all equipment, products and materials of any kind which are used, intended for use or designed for use in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing, harvesting, manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing, preparing, testing, analyzing, packaging, repackaging, storing, containing, concealing, injecting, ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing into the human body a controlled substance in violation of this act. It includes, but is not limited to:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (1) Kits used, intended for use or designed for use in planting, propagating, cultivating, growing or harvesting of any species of plant which is a controlled substance or from which a controlled substance can be derived.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (2) Kits used, intended for use or designed for use in manufacturing, compounding, converting, producing, processing or preparing controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (3) Isomerization devices used, intended for use or designed for use in increasing the potency of any species of plant which is a controlled substance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (4) Testing equipment used, intended for use or designed for use in identifying or in analyzing the strength, effectiveness or purity of controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (5) Scales and balances used, intended for use or designed for use in weighing or measuring controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   (6) Diluents and adulterants, such as quinine hydrochloride, mannitol, mannite, dextrose and lactose, used, intended for use or designed for use in cutting controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (7) Separation gins and sifters used, intended for use or designed for use in removing twigs and seeds from or in otherwise cleaning or refining marihuana.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (8) Blenders, bowls, containers, spoons and mixing devices used, intended for use or designed for use in compounding controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (9) Capsules, balloons, envelopes and other containers used, intended for use or designed for use in packaging small quantities of controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (10) Containers and other objects used, intended for use or designed for use in storing or concealing controlled substances.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (11) Hypodermic syringes, needles and other objects used, intended for use, or designed for use in parenterally injected controlled substances into the human body.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (12) Objects used, intended for use or designed for use in ingesting, inhaling or otherwise introducing marihuana,\n   cocaine, hashish or hashish oil into the human body, such as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (i) Metal, wooden, acrylic, glass, stone, plastic or ceramic pipes with or without screens, permanent screens, hashish heads or punctured metal bowls.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   (ii) Water pipes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   (iii) Carburetion tubes and devices.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (iv) Smoking and carburetion masks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (v) Roach clips; meaning objects used to hold burning material such as a marihuana cigarette, that has become too small or too short to be held in the hand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (vi) Miniature cocaine spoons and cocaine vials.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (vii) Chamber pipes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (viii) Carburetor pipes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (ix) Electric pipes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (x) Air-driven pipes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (xi) Chillums.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (xii) Bongs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (xiii) Ice pipes or chillers.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   <em>\n    In determining whether an object is drug paraphernalia, a court\n   </em>\n   or other authority\n   <em>\n    should consider,\n   </em>\n   in addition to all other logically relevant factors, statements by an owner or by anyone in control of the object concerning its use, prior convictions, if any, of an owner, or of anyone in control of the object, under any State or Federal law relating to any controlled substance, the proximity of the object, in time and space, to a direct violation of this act, the proximity of the object to controlled substances, the existence of any residue of controlled substances on the object, direct or circumstantial evidence of the intent of an owner, or of anyone in control of the object, to deliver it to persons who he knows, or should reasonably know, intend to use the object to facilitate a violation of this act, the innocence of an owner or of anyone in control of the object, as to a direct violation of this act should not prevent a finding that the object is intended for use or designed for use as drug paraphernalia, instructions, oral or written, provided with the object concerning its use, descriptive materials accompanying the object which explain or depict its use, national and local advertising concerning its use, the manner in which the object is displayed for sale, whether the owner, or anyone in control of the object, is a legitimate supplier of like or related items to the community, such as a licensed distributor or dealer of tobacco products, direct or circumstantial evidence of the ratio of sales of the objects to the total sales of the business enterprise, the existence and scope of legitimate uses for the object in the community, and expert testimony concerning its use.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   35 P.S. \u00a7 780-102 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addition to charging Russell criminally, the Commonwealth filed a petition for forfeiture of the 5,000 items seized in the search of One Step Above. The petition alleged that all of the seized property represented the proceeds of drug transactions or had been used to facilitate drug transactions and, thus, was forfeitable as derivative contraband. Russell filed an answer denying that any of the seized property was traceable to drug transactions or had been used to facilitate a drug transaction. To the contrary, the answer asserted that the seized items constituted the inventory of an entirely lawful tobacco shop.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Russell waived his right to a jury trial and agreed to consolidate the trial on his\n   criminal drug paraphernalia charge with the civil forfeiture petition. At trial, the Commonwealth dropped its claim that the seized property represented the proceeds of drug transactions or had been used to facilitate a drug transaction. Instead, the Commonwealth argued that all of the seized property constituted drug paraphernalia that was\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   At trial, Russell explained that Severns had resigned as a principal in One Step Above, leaving him the sole owner. Accordingly, the property listed as being owned by both Severns and Russell was now owned by Russell as sole principal of One Step Above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Adam Bruckhart, a West Manchester Township police officer assigned to the York County Drug Task Force, testified for the Commonwealth. He stated that the task force learned that several pounds of marijuana were going to be delivered to \"Severns, who operated a business in West York.\" Notes of Testimony, 7/1/2015, at 13 (N.T. ----). That business was One Step Above, which is \"advertised on the Internet as a tobacco and smoking accessory shop.\" N.T. 14. Following Severns' arrest, Officer Bruckhart entered the shop and quickly decided that a large part of the inventory consisted of drug paraphernalia. He then obtained a search warrant, which was executed shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   On cross-examination, Officer Bruckhart testified that he had been surveilling One Step Above for a year and had been inside prior to the search. He agreed there were signs posted throughout the store stating that the products offered for sale were for \"tobacco use only.\" N.T. 26. He also acknowledged that other retail stores in York County sell glass pipes, bongs and grinders and that all of these items are used for smoking tobacco. He also testified that One Step Above sold tobacco and confirmed that police found no controlled substances in their search.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Russell Schauer, a detective with the Springettsbury Township Police Department, also assigned to the York County Drug Task Force, was qualified to testify as an expert in the investigation of narcotics trafficking. He was part of the team that did the search and seized the 5,000 items about which he testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Detective Schauer described the vacuum sealed containers confiscated from One Step Above as \"concealment containers.\" N.T. 35. He testified that \"some people had grandmothers that used to keep cereal in [such] a container to keep the cereal fresh. Mainly, we always see it to keep marijuana fresh.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He stated that \"hundreds\" of bongs and vaporizers were seized, which can be used to ingest marijuana as well as tobacco. N.T. 38. Also confiscated were T-shirts with references to \"seedless\" and \"joints\" and air preservatives labelled \"420,\" which he believed to be a reference to April 20th, a date commemorated by marijuana users. Detective Schauer acknowledged that \"420\" preservative can be used to store and preserve a variety of vegetable matter, including tobacco. This was also the case for the seized grinders. However, he opined that given \"the combination of every piece of item\" in the store, all of the seized property was drug paraphernalia intended for inhaling, ingesting or concealing marijuana. N.T. 47-48.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   On cross-examination, Schauer agreed that there were legitimate purposes for all of those items that he described as drug paraphernalia. For example, the \"420 Eliminator\" can be used to eliminate tobacco smoke and the drug cleanser kits can cleanse tobacco from a person's system. N.T. 51. He doubted, however, that anyone would use these items for that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   During the search, Schauer spoke with Russell, who was \"very cooperative\" and \"appeared to be shocked.\" N.T. 53. Russell told Schauer that he used the kiln in the store to make the glassware that is for sale and that he tells everyone that the glass pipes are for tobacco use. Schauer acknowledged Russell's artistry but testified that he believed that the glass items were produced for the purpose of ingesting marijuana.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Russell then testified. He explained that he opened One Step Above in 2012 after obtaining the appropriate township permits. Russell explained that he specifically advised the township of the nature of the business and of his plan to make glass pipes and glass water pipes at the store. Russell stated that he plans to teach glass blowing at the store. The store is advertised as a tobacco shop with accessories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Russell requires all patrons to present identification to establish a legal age of 18 before making a purchase. A \"for tobacco use only\" sticker is affixed to every water pipe. N.T. 60. Russell stated that any customer that refers to drugs is immediately \"kicked out\" of the shop. N.T. 58. In fact, Russell explained that he believed that the patrons he heard from time to time making drug references were actually undercover officers. Russell's goal is to have a \"nice clean glass shop of artwork and all that other nice stuff that comes along with it.\" N.T. 58-59.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Russell testified about the glass water pipes that he creates and sells for prices ranging from $25 to $6,000. He testified that he sells them for tobacco use, explaining that a water pipe filters out the tar in the tobacco and makes for a smoother smoking experience; likewise, a vaporizer prevents carcinogens from reaching the tobacco smoker's lungs. Russell's larger and more expensive water pipes are used exclusively as art. One of his customers, who has purchased several of Russell's water pipes, keeps them in a display case. Russell creates glass pendants, vases and perfume bottles, which are also available in the shop. The store sells glass bracelets for $200 by an artist who is teaching Russell how to make them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Russell testified that he sells loose tobacco in the shop by the pound or half-pound. This requires the use of scales and grinders. \"420 Preserve\" is sold to keep the tobacco fresh because it starts to dry once exposed to air.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Russell testified about the other seized items. He explained that the T-shirts with the word \"Seedless\" emblazoned thereon referred to the manufacturer, not to marijuana. The urine cleansing products are considered a dietary supplement and are sold at health and nutrition retailers such as GNC. He further explained that other retail stores, such as Spencer's, sell marijuana growing books, marijuana baking books and T-shirts promoting marijuana and have done so for many years without incident. When Russell offered photographs of glass pipes, grinders and scales sold in other stores in the York area, the Commonwealth stipulated that other York County retailers sell these items.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    Trial Court Decision\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The trial court found Russell not guilty of delivery of drug paraphernalia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It explained its decision as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The standard is beyond a reasonable doubt, and while it may appear obvious to the Court and anybody looking at the items that they would be used by a person who would want to ingest them for drugs, we cannot conclude that the Commonwealth's evidence sustains its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt with that regard.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Trial Court Order, 7/1/2015, at 4. On the forfeiture, the trial court held as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   With regard to the miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, which we mean to include smoking devices and accessories, scales, glass vials, the burden of proof in a forfeiture action is by a preponderance of the evidence, and that, simply, is it more likely than not that these items would be used by a person for ingestion of drugs and is it more likely than not the owner had reason to believe that such was the case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   We conclude that the Commonwealth has established its burden; and, accordingly, we will direct that the item[s] indicated as \"contents of store, miscellaneous drug paraphernalia, smoking devices, and accessories, scales, and glass vials\" are subject to forfeiture.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. However, the trial court denied the forfeiture petition with respect to the remaining store inventory, such as cash, computers, T-shirts, video game systems, a television, electronic surveillance equipment, business bank accounts and shelving units. It concluded that this property was part of a legitimate business enterprise and did not constitute either contraband or derivative contraband.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Russell appealed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Before this Court Russell raises two issues. First, he argues that the trial court erred as a matter of law because the Commonwealth did not prove that the forfeited property was contraband or derivative contraband because there was no nexus established between that property and any illegal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Second, he argues that the amount of the forfeiture exceeded the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against excessive fines. U.S. CONST. amend. VIII.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Commonwealth filed its forfeiture petition pursuant to the act commonly referred to as the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6801 -6802, which states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   (a) Forfeitures generally.-The following shall be subject to forfeiture to the Commonwealth and no property right shall exist in them:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    All drug paraphernalia,\n   </em>\n   controlled substances or other drugs which have been\n   <em>\n    manufactured, distributed, dispensed or acquired in violation of [the Drug Act].\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (2) All raw materials, products and equipment of any kind which are used, or intended for use, in manufacturing, compounding, processing, delivering, importing or exporting any controlled substance or other drug in violation of [the Drug Act].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (3) All property which is used, or intended for use, as a container for property described in paragraph (1) or (2).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6801(a)(1)-(3) (emphasis added). In a forfeiture, the Commonwealth bears the initial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the drug paraphernalia to be forfeited was \"distributed, dispensed or acquired in violation ... of the [Drug Act].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   If the Commonwealth makes a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case, the burden then shifts to the claimant of the property to show:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (1) That the claimant is the owner of the property or the holder of a chattel mortgage or contract of conditional sale thereon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (2) That the claimant lawfully acquired the property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   (3) That it was not unlawfully used or possessed by him. In the event that it shall appear that the property was unlawfully used or possessed by a person other than the claimant, then the claimant shall show that the unlawful use or possession was without his knowledge or consent. Such absence of knowledge or consent must be reasonable under the circumstances presented.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6802(j). \"Despite growing popularity as a means to battle against drug traffic, forfeitures are not favored in the law....\"\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. 502-504 Gordon Street in the Ninth Ward of City of Allentown, County of Lehigh,\n   </em>\n   147 Pa.Cmwlth. 330,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1431686\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/147/330/#p842\">\n    607 A.2d 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (1992).

No drugs were found in the store after a thorough search. The forfeited items consist of glass pipes, scales and grinders that are sold by competitors without incident. They were intended by the seller to be used with tobacco, and the Commonwealth did not prove otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Commonwealth responds that it is irrelevant that no drugs were found in the search of the store. Detective Schauer testified that the forfeited items were intended\n   to ingest marijuana and, thus, constituted drug paraphernalia. The trial court, as fact finder, was free to reject Russell's testimony that he was selling items \"for tobacco use only\" and credit Schauer's contrary testimony that the items in the store were being sold for illegal drug purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Drug paraphernalia is forfeitable contraband\n   <em>\n    per se.\n   </em>\n   However, the Commonwealth has the burden of proving that an item of personalty meets the legal definition of drug paraphernalia.

These findings are inadequate, as a matter of law, to prove the dual-use products were drug paraphernalia. Every dual-use item has the potential to be used for an unlawful purpose. Sandwich bags that keep peanut butter and jelly sandwiches fresh can also keep marijuana fresh. That potential does not make a sandwich bag drug paraphernalia. More is needed.

Eighth, the trial court found that the store instructed that the items for sale were \"for tobacco use only.\" Ninth, the trial court found that the items seized were labeled \"for tobacco use only.\" Tenth, the trial court found that there was no national and local advertising to show that the seized items were paraphernalia. Eleventh, the trial court found that the store displays did not support a finding that the seized items were drug paraphernalia. Twelfth, the trial court found it was not clear that Russell was a licensed purveyor of tobacco products. Thirteenth, no evidence was offered to show the ratio of sales of the seized items to the total sales of the business enterprise. Fourteenth, the trial court found there were legitimate uses for the seized items.
