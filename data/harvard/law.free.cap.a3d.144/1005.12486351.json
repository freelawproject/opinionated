We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 27, 2007, Withers was convicted of driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI) in violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(c) (driving under influence of alcohol or controlled substance-highest rate of alcohol)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   on September 2, 2006. (Record Item (R. Item) 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supplemental Reproduced Record (Supp. R.R.) at 19b.) The Department imposed an 18-month suspension of her operating privilege in accordance with 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3804(e)(2)(ii), effective November 9, 2007, the date that she surrendered her driver's license. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 17b, 19b.) On September 25, 2007, Withers was convicted of an additional violation of 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 3802(c) for a DUI that occurred on June 29, 2007. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 17b.) Because Withers also had a 2003 Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition (ARD) DUI and therefore had three ARDs or convictions for DUI committed within a five-year period, the Department mailed Withers a notice of revocation on January 22, 2008, imposing a five-year revocation of her operating privilege as a habitual offender for that conviction in accordance with 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1542. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 15b-16b, 19b.) This notice stated that \"[y]ou have been designated as a habitual offender because this is your third major violation within a five year period\" and that \"[y]our driving privilege is REVOKED for a period of 5 YEAR(S) effective 05/09/2009 at 12:01 a.m.,\" when Withers' 18-month suspension for her July 27, 2007 DUI conviction ended. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 15b) (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 7, 2008, Withers was convicted of violating 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543 for driving while her operating privilege was suspended or revoked on September 5, 2008. (R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 13b-14b.) Section 1543(c) of the Vehicle Code requires that upon receipt of a certified record of a conviction for driving while operating privilege are suspended or revoked,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   the department shall suspend or revoke that person's operating privilege as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1) If the department's records show that the person was under suspension, recall or cancellation on the date of violation, and had not been restored, the department shall suspend the person's operating privilege for an additional one-year period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2) If the department's records show that the person was under revocation on the date of violation, and had not been restored, the department shall revoke the person's operating privilege for an additional two-year period.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 14, 2008, the Department mailed Withers a notice imposing a one-year suspension of her operating privilege for her October 7, 2008 conviction, effective May 9, 2014, when her five-year revocation ended. (R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 11b-12b.) Before the expiration of her five-year revocation and that one-year suspension for her 2008 conviction, Withers was again convicted, on April 16, 2012, of driving while her operating privilege was suspended or revoked. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 7b-8b.) By notice mailed on April 25, 2012, the Department imposed an additional two-year revocation of Withers' operating privilege, effective May 9, 2015, extending the suspension and revocations of her operating privilege to May 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 5b-6b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2015, while Withers' operating privilege remained under revocation, the Department concluded that Section 1543(c) required that it impose a two-year revocation rather than a one-year suspension for her 2008 conviction because it was for a violation that occurred after the January 22, 2008 notice of revocation was issued. (R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 4b.) Accordingly, the Department, on June 18, 2015, mailed Withers a notice of revocation, changing her one-year suspension for the 2008 conviction to a two-\n   year revocation, effective May 9, 2014. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 9b-10b.) The Department on the same date also mailed her an additional notice concerning the two-year revocation for her 2012 conviction, correspondingly changing the effective date of that revocation to May 9, 2016. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Supp. R.R. at 2b-3b.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Withers filed a timely appeal to the trial court from the June 18, 2015 two-year revocation of her license for the 2008 conviction. At the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing held by the trial court, the Department introduced in evidence a certified copy of Withers' driver's license record, showing her convictions and license suspensions and revocations. (R. Item 10, Hearing Transcript (H.T.) at 3-4, 10, Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 4-5, 11; R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 1b-22b.) Withers did not testify or introduce any evidence at the hearing and did not dispute the accuracy of her driver's license record or the facts concerning her convictions, suspensions, and revocations. Rather, Withers only disputed the legal validity of the two-year revocation under those facts. (R. Item 10, H.T. at 4-7, R.R. at 5-8.) The trial court rejected Withers' arguments and dismissed her appeal. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The only argument asserted by Withers in this appeal is the contention that her license was under suspension, not revocation, on September 5, 2008 when she violated Section 1543 of the Vehicle Code, and that the applicable loss of her license was therefore the one-year suspension that the Department originally imposed under Section 1543(c)(1) for driving under a suspended license, not the two-year revocation provided by Section 1543(c)(2).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We do not agree. The Department issued its five-year revocation of Withers' operating privilege as a habitual offender on January 22, 2008, well before Withers' September 5, 2008 violation. The January 22, 2008 notice of revocation made final determinations that Withers was a habitual offender under Section 1542 of the Vehicle Code requiring revocation of her license, 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1542, and that her license was revoked, and specifically stated that it was an \"\n   <strong>\n    Official Notification of the Revocation\n   </strong>\n   of your Driving Privilege.\" (R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 15b-16b) (emphasis in original). Withers did not dispute that she received that notice of revocation in January 2008. The\n   revocation was therefore in effect as of January 2008 for purposes of determining the penalties for violation of Section 1543 of the Vehicle Code, and Withers' license was under revocation at the time she committed her September 5, 2008 violation.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Rather, where, as here the licensee is under a pre-existing suspension or revocation because of other violations, the effective date set forth in the Department's notice of an additional revocation or suspension is simply a statement of how the consecutive time periods of loss of driver's license are applied under Section 1544 of the Vehicle Code to determine when the licensee may obtain restoration of driving privileges. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1544(b) -(d) (requiring that the Department add subsequent suspension and revocation periods to the end of an existing suspension or revocation);\n   <em>\n    Jenner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867513,465141\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/1266/\">\n    681 A.2d at 1270, 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

That difference does not, however, make the reasoning of those decisions any less applicable here. The fundamental issue is the same, whether an enhanced penalty may be imposed where the suspension or revocation on which it is based was issued before the driver's violation but had a delayed effective date under Section 1544 solely because of the driver's past violations and suspensions or revocations. The statutory language on which these decisions are based is not materially different than the language of Section 1543(c).\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867513,465141\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/1266/\">\n    681 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1268 n. 3, 1270 (imposing enhanced penalty where violation occurs \"\n   <em>\n    at a time when their operating privilege is suspended or revoked\n   </em>\n   as a condition of acceptance of Accelerated Rehabilitative Disposition for a violation of section 3731 (relating to driving under the influence of alcohol or controlled substance) or because of a violation of section 1547(b)(1) (relating to suspension for refusal) or 3731\") (emphasis supplied)\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nuno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468127\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/385/6/\">\n    559 A.2d at 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(c) (\"[i]f the department's records show that the person\n   <em>\n    was under revocation on the date of violation,\n   </em>\n   and had not been restored\") (emphasis supplied).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Withers attempts to distinguish this case law on the grounds that licensees should be entitled to rely on the Department's statement of the effective date of a revocation and that her revocation was imposed under a different statutory provision. Neither of these contentions has merit. There is no evidence that Withers relied on or was in any way misled by the effective date in the Department's notice. Indeed, she did not testify or introduce any evidence at the\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   hearing. There is therefore nothing in this record that distinguishes her from the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Jenner, Harden,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nuno.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, the Department's January 22, 2008 notice of revocation could not possibly mislead Withers to believe that she could drive before the stated effective date without suffering consequences more serious than this two-year revocation of her license. The Department's revocation notice made clear that \"[t]his revocation is in addition to any other suspension already on your record,\" and Withers was still under a DUI suspension at the time of her September 2008 violation. (R. Item 10, Commonwealth Ex. 1, Supp. R.R. at 15a, 19a.) She\n   was therefore subject to imprisonment under Section 1543(b) of the Vehicle Code if she drove a motor vehicle in September 2008, regardless of when the revocation was in effect. 75 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1543(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Nor are\n   <em>\n    Jenner, Harden,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nuno\n   </em>\n   distinguishable on the grounds that the 2008 revocation of her license was under a different section of the Vehicle Code. While the DUI-related suspensions in those cases were under Section 1540(a) of the Vehicle Code, governing mandatory license suspension upon conviction of certain offenses, and Withers' license was revoked under Section 1542, governing habitual offenders, that difference is immaterial. The delayed effective date here was due to Section 1544, requiring consecutive application of suspensions and revocations, the same statutory provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Jenner, Harden,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Nuno.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, to the extent that the Court relied on Section 1540(a) in\n   <em>\n    Jenner\n   </em>\n   in holding that the DUI-related suspensions were in effect, Withers was equally required to surrender her license under Section 1540(a) at the time of conviction on which the revocation was based and, like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Jenner,\n   </em>\n   had already surrendered her license before the revocation notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Because the Department gave notice to Withers of the revocation of her license in January 2008, her license was under revocation under Section 1543(c)(2) at the time of her September 2008 violation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jenner,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7867513,465141\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/1266/\">\n    681 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1273-74 ;\n   <em>\n    Harden,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6902029\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/107/6902029/#p112\">\n    103 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   112 ;\n   <em>\n    Nuno,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"468127\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/385/6/\">\n    559 A.2d at 950-51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
