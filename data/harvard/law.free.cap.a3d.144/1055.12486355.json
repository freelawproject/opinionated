Oatis, Lobo &amp; Associates, LLC, James D. Batchelder, Glenn Montigny, Amy Blaymore-Paterson, Ann Letendre, John Summers, and Debra Wilson. The plaintiff sought to develop a Home Depot store in the town of Vernon that the defendants, a group of concerned citizens and their attorneys,\n   opposed for environmental reasons. Certain defendants, allegedly acting with the support of their codefendants, thus sought to intervene in various administrative and mandamus actions between the plaintiff and the Planning and Zoning Commission of the Town of Vernon (planning and zoning commission). Thereafter, the plaintiff brought this action, sounding in vexatious litigation, claiming that the defendants' conduct in intervening or supporting other defendants' interventions in the planning and zoning actions, and their appeals from the denials thereof, had delayed it in obtaining the necessary final approval from the planning and zoning commission. The plaintiff claimed that because those appeals delayed the approval of the Home Depot development project by the planning and zoning commission until after the deadline agreed to for that purpose in the plaintiff's agreement with Home Depot, Home Depot abandoned the development project to the plaintiff's great financial loss. The trial court granted all of the defendants' motions for summary judgment on the ground that the plaintiff could not establish that the defendants' actions had caused Home Depot to abandon the development project, or thus to sustain any compensable losses. The plaintiff appeals, claiming that genuine issues of material fact remain as to the causation of damages. The defendants argue that summary judgment was appropriately rendered, and raise various alternative grounds for affirmance as well. We agree with the plaintiff that summary judgment was improperly granted, and decline to affirm the court's judgment on any of the alternative grounds proposed by the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this case are closely related to those at issue in three other cases:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Batchelder v.

Under the terms of that agreement, Home Depot's duty to construct the Home Depot was conditioned on the plaintiff's obtaining all \"final approvals,\" including all permits, licenses, variances, and approvals necessary for the construction and operation of the development, by the deadline of March 9, 2010. The contract provided that approvals would not be considered \"final approvals\" thereunder until they \"[are] received and are valid, irrevocable, unqualified and unconditioned (except for such qualifications and/or conditions that are acceptable to Home Depot in its sole and absolute discretion), and are no longer subject to appeal or litigation....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendants objected to the proposed development for environmental reasons. In the petitions to\n   intervene filed by Montigny and Batchelder, the defendants claimed, inter alia, that the proposed site for the Home Depot was located three hundred feet from the Walker Reservoir, a source of public drinking water, and that the construction and operation of the Home Depot was \"unreasonably likely to result in the unreasonable disruption, pollution, impairment and destruction of the natural resources and hydrology of the immediate area....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On January 30, 2013, the plaintiff filed its third amended complaint (complaint), which was the operative complaint at the time summary judgment was rendered. The forty-two count complaint made identical\n   allegations against each defendant, claiming that their interventions in the administrative action (\n   <em>\n    Diamond 67, LLC v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission,\n   </em>\n   Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. CV-074007637S) and mandamus action (\n   <em>\n    Diamond 67, LLC v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission,\n   </em>\n   Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. CV-07-4007520S) constituted both common-law vexatious litigation and statutory vexatious litigation for which double and treble damages should be awarded under General Statutes \u00a7 52-568.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, the plaintiff alleged that Batchelder and Montigny, who were represented by Oatis, an employee or principal of the law firm of Lobo &amp; Associates, LLC, had pursued interventions in those actions, and that Blaymore-Paterson, Letendre, Summers, and Wilson had \"actively participated, supported, plotted, and planned to bring, pursue and maintain\" those interventions. In their answers, the defendants\n   asserted various special defenses, including reliance on the advice of counsel, the bar of the statute of limitations, and the\n   <em>\n    Noerr-Pennington\n   </em>\n   doctrine. See part II C of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   All of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment between April 4 and 11, 2014. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff could not establish any of the elements of vexatious litigation, which requires a plaintiff to prove that the defendant prosecuted a civil action against it, that terminated in its favor, without probable cause.\n   <em>\n    Bernhard-Thomas Building Systems, LLC v. Dunican,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960753\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/548/#p553\">\n    286 Conn. 548\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 553-54,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=944%20A.2d%20329\">\n    944 A.2d 329\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). In order to prevail on a claim of common-law vexatious litigation or to receive treble damages under \u00a7 52-568, the plaintiff must also prove that the defendants acted with malice.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=944%20A.2d%20329\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Certain defendants also argued that summary judgment should be granted on the basis of certain of their special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants also asserted that they were entitled to summary judgment because there was no genuine issue of material fact that their alleged conduct had not caused the plaintiff any compensable loss or injury. To that end, the defendants presented evidence that Home Depot had abandoned its development project in Vernon not because of the defendants' attempts to intervene in the plaintiff's actions against the planning and zoning commission, but because of an economic down-turn. For that reason, the defendants argued, Home Depot refused to consider a certificate issued by the State Traffic Commission (traffic commission) to be a \"final approval\" under the terms of the parties' contract due to certain unacceptable conditions contained therein.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   support of this argument, the defendants\n   submitted correspondence between the plaintiff and Home Depot to show that the two had failed to come to an agreement on how to deal with the conditions imposed by the traffic commission. The correspondence showed that although Home Depot was initially under the impression that the plaintiff was willing to contribute $500,000 toward satisfying the conditions set forth in the traffic commission's letter, the plaintiff was not willing to do so. Instead, it explained, in a letter to Home Depot, that \"[w]e are not interested in making a cash contribution.... However, we [are] interested in the possibility of our doing the work [required by the traffic commission] for $500,000....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On June 18, 2008, Home Depot wrote a letter to a representative of the plaintiff, stating, \"The [traffic commission] Report sets forth several conditions which require road widening and other offsite improvements [which] were not anticipated by Home Depot, are overly broad and are not currently within its construction budget.... Home Depot intends on filing an appeal of the [traffic commission] Report....\" On March 8, 2010, the plaintiff requested an extension of the deadline to obtain all final approvals. In a letter dated March 19, 2010, Home Depot declined the plaintiff's request for an extension of the deadline. In that letter, Home Depot also notified the plaintiff that, because the plaintiff had failed to obtain all final approvals for the project by the deadline of March 9, 2010, it was exercising its contractual right to terminate the contract by selling the property. The March 19, 2010 letter did not state which approvals Home Depot did not consider to be\n   \"final approvals\" under the terms of its contract with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On April 25, 2014, the plaintiff filed an opposition to the defendants' motions for summary judgment. The plaintiff argued in its opposition that it had in fact obtained all final approvals for the project by the contract deadline except for final approval from the planning and zoning commission, which remained pending only because of the appeals being pursued by the defendants. The plaintiff argued that approval by the planning and zoning commission did not become final until 2012, after the March 9, 2010 deadline, when our Supreme Court denied certification to appeal in\n   <em>\n    Batchelder v. Planning &amp; Zoning Commission,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4072700\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/133/173/\">\n    133 Conn.App. 173\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20A.3d%20465\">\n    34 A.3d 465\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It also contended that the traffic commission certificate was a final approval, as \"[a]ll approvals are subject to conditions of compliance.\" The plaintiff also maintained that, even if it was unable to establish causation as to the loss of the Home Depot contract, the defendants' conduct had caused it to incur losses in the form of \"extensive litigation costs,\" to which it would still be entitled if it could otherwise establish the elements of its vexatious litigation claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In opposition to the defendants' motions for summary judgment, the plaintiff filed an affidavit from Richard P. Hayes, Jr., the individual tasked by the plaintiff with obtaining all final approvals for the project. Hayes averred: \"As of March 9, 2010, which was the final date for securing approvals, the plaintiff had secured all necessary approvals except for the final approval from the planning and zoning commission which was subject to an appeal brought by the defendant, Montigny.... The Montigny appeal was from a decision by Judge Klaczak in December, 2009 at which time the defendants knew that there was no evidence to support the allegations of the defendants' petition for intervention, no experts to support the allegations therein and\n   that, in fact said petition contained false allegations in regard to Walker Reservoir East being a source of\n   public water supply.... But for the appeal, the plaintiff would have had an enforceable contract with Home Depot which was worth multiple millions of dollars to the plaintiff.... Further, at all times and notwithstanding a claim to the contrary, Home Depot did not take an appeal of the STC approval.... If in fact an STC appeal had been taken, the plaintiff easily could have resolved same by merely agreeing to absorb the costs incidental to the improvements mandated by the STC.... Plaintiff incurred professional fees, legal fees and litigation costs in defense of defendants' petitions, inclusive of costs for defense of appeals and preparation for hearing ordered upon remand at which [the defendants] failed to present any evidence in support of their petitions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The court,\n   <em>\n    Dubay, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a hearing on May 12, 2014, on all of the motions for summary judgment. At that hearing, counsel for the plaintiff argued that the STC had granted it a final approval, and that the STC conditions did not need to be accepted by Home Depot in order to constitute a final approval under the contract. On May 23, 2014, however, Judge Dubay recused himself from the case and the matter was reassigned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   A new hearing was held on September 28, 2014, before\n   <em>\n    Miller, J.,\n   </em>\n   after Judge Dubay had recused himself. On February 24, 2015, the court granted all of the motions for summary judgment, explaining its ruling as follows: \"The parties do not agree about many of the facts at issue in this case, but there are some critical and uncontested facts which are not in dispute:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"1. One of [the] plaintiff's major responsibilities, under its contract with Home Depot, was to obtain all necessary permits so that the development could take place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"2. Ultimately, [the] plaintiff obtained all of the necessary permits, including one from the [traffic commission], and there was no regulatory obstacle, once that happened, to the development of the site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"3. Home Depot thereafter informed [the] plaintiff that it would not proceed with the development because the [traffic commission] imposed conditions on the permit which Home Depot found to be unacceptable. The development agreement, therefore, did not go forward....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"The defendants raised several legal grounds for granting summary judgment in their favor. The court finds that one of those arguments so clearly requires a finding in favor of all the defendants that the court need only consider what was said in favor of and against that argument in granting all of the pending motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   \"No plaintiff in a tort action can prevail unless he or she can prove that the alleged wrongful conduct of the defendant was a proximate cause of his or her injuries. The record in this case makes it entirely clear that Home Depot did not go forward on its deal with the plaintiff because the permit which [the] plaintiff obtained from the [traffic commission] contained conditions which Home Depot refused to accept. [The] plaintiff's contention that its agreement with Home Depot was 'self-executing,' which is not supported in the record, is irrelevant to this inquiry. Home Depot, rightly or wrongly, decided, after it received the unpalatable [traffic commission] permit, that it would not go forward with its plans for the store in Vernon. The store did not get built, and all of [the] plaintiff's alleged damages flow from that decision. There is nothing in the record in this case which even suggests that Home Depot walked away from this deal because of any act by any of the defendants. There is certainly no evidence\n   from any\n   Home Depot employee-or anyone else-which supports any other conclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"There is therefore no evidence before this court which would allow a conclusion that the defendants' activities were vexatious. Under these circumstances, [the] plaintiff cannot, as a matter of law, prevail, and the court does not consider the other arguments made by the defense counsel in support of their motions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly rendered summary judgment in favor of all of the defendants. The defendants argue first that summary judgment was properly rendered and, second, that the judgment can be affirmed on several alternative grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plaintiff claims that summary judgment was improperly rendered because the facts found by the trial court were not supported by the record and, in any event, were not dispositive of the plaintiff's claims. In particular, the plaintiff argues that the trial court ignored the fact that the planning and zoning permit was not issued until after the contract deadline and that the defendants' actions were the cause of that delay. Moreover, the plaintiff argues that Home Depot's reasons for abandoning the development project were not dispositive of its vexatious litigation claims, for even if the defendants' challenged conduct did not cause the loss of the Home Depot deal, it was still entitled to recover damages from them for the costs it incurred in defending against the defendants' baseless claims. The defendants disagree, arguing that summary judgment was properly rendered because the plaintiff cannot establish causation. The defendants assert that Home Depot did not want to complete the development because of a downturn in the economy. According to\n   the defendants, they presented uncontroverted evidence that Home Depot was dissatisfied with the traffic commission conditions, and that was the reason that it did not pursue the development. Certain defendants also argue that the plaintiff cannot assert that it is entitled to attorney's fees and costs because it did not specifically plead that it was seeking to recover such damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Practice Book \u00a7 [17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... A material fact has been defined adequately and simply as a fact which will make a difference in the result of the case.... The test is whether a party would be entitled to a directed verdict on the same facts.... Once the moving party has presented evidence in support of the motion for summary judgment, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue.... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact ... are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45].... The movant has the burden of showing the nonexistence of such issues but the evidence thus presented, if otherwise sufficient, is not rebutted by the bald statement that an issue of fact does exist.... To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts ... which contradict those stated in the movant's affidavits and documents.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Hammer v.

In a cause of action for malicious prosecution, the plaintiff additionally must establish that the defendant caused the proceeding to be instituted.... This requirement is due to the fact that, unlike a vexatious litigation claim, in which the underlying civil action was filed either by the defendant herself, acting pro se, or by an attorney acting on behalf of the defendant, in a malicious prosecution action, a public official, acting on behalf of the state, institutes the criminal action against the malicious prosecution plaintiff. It is, therefore, more problematic in a malicious prosecution action, as opposed to an action for vexatious litigation, for the plaintiff to connect the defendant with the actual institution of the underlying action. In accordance with the indirect connection between the underlying action and the defendant in a malicious prosecution action, we have specified the initiation of the underlying action as a separate element in malicious prosecution cases, as opposed to vexatious litigation cases, in which the plaintiff is not required to establish that the defendant initiated the underlying action.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bhatia v.

The plaintiff claimed that the defendants acted together as part of a group known as Smart Growth\n   for Vernon to prevent its development of the Home Depot store. In particular, the plaintiff submitted e-mails among the defendants that detailed their joint efforts to pursue the challenged interventions. One of those e-mails, from Summers to Wilson, Montigny, Batchelder, and Blaymore-Paterson, discusses (1) the proposed hiring of Oatis to represent the group in connection with the planned building of a Home Depot store in Vernon; (2) the fact that Smart Growth for Vernon, as an unincorporated entity, could not sign the retainer agreement with Oatis on their behalf; and (3) the fact that they would need to hire a hydrogeologist, a civil engineer, and a traffic engineer to oppose the Home Depot project.

We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   \"Courts have taken three approaches to the termination requirement. The first, and most rigid, requires that the action have gone to judgment resulting in a verdict of acquittal, in the criminal context, or no liability, in the civil context. The second permits a vexatious suit action even if the underlying action was merely withdrawn so long as the plaintiff can demonstrate that the withdrawal took place under circumstances creating an inference that the plaintiff was innocent, in the criminal context, or not liable, in the civil context. The third approach, while nominally adhering to the favorable termination requirement, in the sense that any outcome other than a finding of guilt or liability is favorable to the accused party, permits a malicious prosecution or vexatious suit action whenever the underlying proceeding was abandoned or withdrawn without consideration, that is, withdrawn without either a plea bargain or a settlement favoring the party originating the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   \"Notwithstanding our recitation of the term favorable termination ... in\n   <em>\n    Vandersluis\n   </em>\n   and a few other cases\n   ... we have never required a plaintiff in a vexatious suit action to prove a favorable termination either by pointing to an adjudication on the merits in his favor or by showing affirmatively that the circumstances of the termination indicated his innocence or nonliability, so long as the proceeding has terminated without consideration....
