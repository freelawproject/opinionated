We affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The opinion of the Appellate Court, as supplemented by the record, sets forth the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found. \"The defendant and his girlfriend, Denise Cintron, rented a basement apartment from Thomas Blake in [the town of] East Haven. Blake's property is immediately adjacent to property owned by Donald Gennette (Donald) and Maria Gennette (Maria). There is a shed in the backyard of the Gennettes' property located approximately twenty feet from the Gennette-Blake property line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"On May 5, 2011, Donald and Maria went to work at 6:20 a.m. and 7:15 a.m., respectively. Maria returned home at 11:40 a.m. to take care of her grandchild while her son went to work. Upon arriving home, Maria observed the defendant and Cintron sitting in the defendant's vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla. Maria then took her dog for a walk in her backyard and observed that the defendant's car, although on the Blake property, was parked immediately next to the Gennette-Blake property line. Maria noted that the defendant's car was parked in close proximity to her shed and that the location of the car was unusual because she had never seen the car parked there before. Maria observed that Cintron was now alone in the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Cintron exited the vehicle and began to ask Maria questions about her dog. This interaction was unusual, according to Maria, because Cintron had never spoken to her during the nine months that Cintron had resided on the Blake property. After Cintron ... questioned her for about two minutes, Maria went back inside her house. Approximately ten minutes later, at 12:15 p.m., Maria, her son, and [her] grandchild departed, leaving\n   no one in the house. Upon leaving, Maria observed that the defendant's car had not moved.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"Maria returned home at 3:15 p.m. and noticed that an exterior light on the shed was turned on, which she described as unusual. Donald, an experienced electrician, explained how he had wired the exterior light on the shed. He explained that a switch inside the shed controls the exterior light. If the switch is in one position, the light stays on continuously. If the switch is in the other position, the light is controlled by a motion sensor mounted on the exterior of the shed. The motion sensor will [cause] the light [to turn] on if someone moves in front of [the sensor]. He explained, however, that he configured the motion sensor so that it is disabled while it is light outside. The only explanation for the light being on during the day is that someone went inside the shed and put the switch in the position that turns the light on continuously. According to Donald, on May 5, 2011, the exterior light was off\n   when he left for work and should have remained off throughout the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Donald was 'suspicious' after Maria told him that the defendant's car had been parked on the property line and that the exterior light on the shed was on when she arrived home. Donald went into the shed and noticed [that] several items were missing. He immediately called the police and spoke with his neighbor, [Ricardo] Gallo, who resides on the other side of the Gennettes' property. Gallo was unemployed at the time and testified that he was home painting his son's room on the date in question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"At 2 p.m. on May 5, 2011, Gallo observed the defendant enter the Gennettes' shed, remove items from it, and place them in the trunk of [his] car, which was parked in close proximity to the Gennette-Blake property line. Gallo stated that, although he observed someone\n   other than one of the Gennettes removing items from their shed, he '[did not] want to assume that [the defendant] was stealing' because it was possible that the defendant was assisting Donald with his work as an electrician. Gallo later reported his observations to the police after Donald notified him that he called to report the burglary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"Officer Craig Michalowski of the East Haven Police Department responded and met with Donald, Maria, Gallo, and Blake. Donald told Michalowski that the following items were taken from his shed: (1) a chain saw; (2) a miter saw; (3) a drill; and (4) a 'cordless kit' containing a drill and two saws. The next day, after Donald conducted a more thorough search of the shed, he reported to the police that he was also missing (1) sixty to seventy feet of 'two aught' copper wire, (2) 'a couple [of] rolls' of 'number two' wire, (3) approximately 750 feet of yellow 'Romex' wire, and (4) approximately 750 feet of white 'Romex' wire. Donald had this wire on hand in order to perform a specific modification to his house's electrical system.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"After his initial investigation, Michalowski identified the defendant as a potential suspect.... He continued the investigation by checking the records from area scrap yards and pawn shops in order to determine whether the defendant sold any of the items taken from the shed. Michalowski explained that when someone sells something to either a scrap yard or [a] pawn shop, the businesses keep a record of the date and time of the sale, the item sold, and the seller's name and address. The businesses send these records to the police department approximately every six weeks. Michalowski checked the records on file at the police department and found that, at 6:55 a.m. on the day after the burglary, the defendant sold wire to a scrap yard that was consistent with the type of wire reported missing from the Gennettes' shed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The defendant was arrested on June 14, 2011, and charged with burglary in the third degree and larceny in the third degree. At trial, the defendant [who did not testify, presented an alibi witness who claimed that the defendant was with him at the time of the alleged burglary. The defendant also] argued that Donald had lied about the amount of wire taken in order to defraud his insurance company. He specifically argued that Donald's account of the amount and value of the wire taken from the shed was inconsistent. Moreover, the defendant argued that the amount of wire purportedly in the shed was disproportionate to the amount necessary to modify the electrical system for the Gennettes' house, as Donald had claimed. [In addition, the defendant maintained that the amount of wire and tools Donald claimed had been stolen could not have fit inside the trunk of the defendant's vehicle. In light of the foregoing, the defendant\n   further argued that] the state did not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the property taken was worth more than $2000, the amount necessary to [sustain a conviction] of larceny in the third degree pursuant to [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-124 (a)(2).\" (Footnotes omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Although the defense made no contrary request, the trial court did not instruct the jury, as required by \u00a7 54-84(b), that it could draw no unfavorable inferences from the defendant's failure to testify. Thereafter, the jury returned a verdict of guilty on both counts, and the trial court rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant appealed to the Appellate Court, claiming, inter alia, that the trial court's failure to instruct the jury in accordance with \u00a7 54-84(b) was plain error entitling him to a new trial. The Appellate\n   Court agreed, stating in relevant part: \"[T]he total omission of the no adverse inference instruction is plain error that is not subject to a harmless error analysis. The unconditional language of the statute is a legislative mandate, and the failure to use that language is a pivotal aspect of the defendant's privilege against self-incrimination. The statutory language is based on a constitutional right, and its omission can never be harmless.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)

The state further maintains that, if the Appellate Court had undertaken such an analysis, as it was required to do, it would have recognized that the defendant was not prejudiced by the omission of the required instruction because \"the balance of the instructions facilitated the appropriate application of the law\" and because the evidence of the defendant's guilt was so overwhelming that the verdict would have been the same even if the instruction had been given. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The following legal principles guide our analysis of the state's claim. \"It is well established that the plain error doctrine, codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved [and nonconstitutional in nature], are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved\n   party. [T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment ... for reasons of policy.... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

In that case, a police officer testified that he witnessed the defendant, James R. Dudla, toss a gun near where he was standing during a routine traffic stop. See id., at 6-7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=458%20A.2d%20682\">\n    458 A.2d 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reversing Dudla's conviction for illegal possession of a firearm, this court observed that, \"[a]lthough the evidence presented might have been sufficient to support a conviction, this court will not presume to hold that the jury necessarily found [the officer's] testimony to be true. The jury [is], of course, the sole [judge] of [the] credibility of witnesses ... [and is] free to reject even uncontradicted testimony, if [it does] not find it credible....

In support of this claim, the state also relies on the fact that, during voir dire, the venire panel was instructed not to \"hold [it] against him\" if the defendant decided not to take the stand. As the state acknowledges, however, this court has considered whether the charge as a whole, including instructions given during voir dire, adequately conveyed the substance of the instruction mandated by \u00a7 54-84(b) when that charge included an instruction that deviated only slightly from the statutory language.

In enacting \u00a7 54-84(b), the legislature has done so. While the constitutional right to a 'no adverse inference' charge depends upon the defendant's request of such a charge, the statutory right is conferred upon the defendant unconditionally, in the absence of his request that the charge not be given.

The present case involved a theft\n   of power tools and wire from a shed in the backyard of Donald Gennette and Maria Gennette; the backyard of their property was an open space that abutted the property lines of their neighbors on either side, Thomas Blake and Ricardo Gallo. Specifically, multiple witnesses, including Gallo and Maria Gennette, were familiar with the defendant and his vehicle, a red Toyota Corolla, because he rented a basement apartment in Blake's home. Gallo and Maria Gennette testified that, on May 5, 2011, they saw the defendant's red Toyota Corolla parked immediately next to the property line between the Gennette and Blake properties. The vehicle had been backed in so that it was facing the street, in close proximity to the shed on the Gennettes' property. Gallo saw the vehicle at approximately 2 p.m., and Maria Gennette saw it between 11:30 a.m. and 12 p.m., after she had returned home from work. Maria Gennette testified that she had never seen the defendant's vehicle parked in that particular spot before. Even more unusual, the defendant's girlfriend engaged Maria Gennette in a conversation when she passed by, which had never happened in the nine months that the defendant and his girlfriend lived next door. Later that afternoon, around 2 p.m., Gallo saw the defendant enter the Gennettes' unlocked shed,\n   remove items including a circular saw, a yellow chop saw, and a large portion of wire, and place them into the trunk of the Corolla. The very next day, the defendant went to a scrap yard in New Haven, where he provided photographic identification in order to sell a quantity of wire, for which he received $65. The wire that the defendant sold was consistent with the wire that had been reported stolen.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   I conclude that the cumulative strength of the evidence in this case renders it distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    State v.

In contrast, in the present case, Gallo's eyewitness testimony about the theft itself was bolstered by the other circumstantial evidence, including Maria Gennette's testimony about the unusual location of the defendant's vehicle near their shed, the unusual friendliness of the defendant's girlfriend toward Maria Gennette when she approached the defendant's vehicle, and the defendant's sale of a large quantity of wire on the very next day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Finally, I note that the state's closing arguments treaded nowhere near mentioning the defendant's failure to testify; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Griffin v.

The defendant asked Blake to meet him that evening at a nearby Burger King restaurant to bring him some medications from the apartment.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The majority also cites inconsistencies in Donald Gennette's testimony about the amount of wire that was taken, which the defendant used to support his argument at trial that there was reasonable doubt about whether he was at the scene and as to what, if anything, was taken. This is consistent with the defendant's theory of the case, which was that Donald Gennette and Gallo lied to the police about the burglary in order to defraud the Gennettes' homeowners insurance company, and that if there was in fact a theft, Gallo-who was unemployed, home during the day, and knew the contents of the Gennettes' shed-had the motive and the opportunity to be the thief. None of these inconsistencies cast doubt, however, on the identification of the defendant as the person who had parked his vehicle in an unusual location near the shed, took items from the shed, and then sold wire consistent with that taken from the shed on the day after the burglary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Further, the majority relies more on the defendant's alibi witness than the defendant himself did, as the defendant spent virtually all of his closing argument at trial attempting to discredit the testimony of the state's witnesses, and made only one isolated reference to the alibi witness, thus suggesting that alibi was not a major strategic focus for the defense. This was for good reason. As the prosecutor emphasized during rebuttal argument, the testimony of the alibi witness was shaky at best, insofar as he testified that the defendant was with him at his auto body repair shop the entire time during the day of the burglary, but he could not remember whether the defendant's girlfriend was present the entire time, what she did while she was at the body shop, and when she had left.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    During voir dire, the trial court instructed the venirepersons that the \"defendant has no obligation to put on any evidence at all. He doesn't have to put on any evidence and he doesn't have to take the stand. And if he chooses not to take the stand or not to put on any evidence, you as a juror are not to hold that against him because those are his rights.\" Although the trial court's subsequent preliminary instructions prior to the start of evidence included a discussion of the burden of proof and the fact that the defendant may present evidence, but is not obligated to, they did not provide a specific \"no adverse inference\" admonition. I do not consider the voir dire instructions in my analysis because I recognize that preliminary instructions, including those during jury selection prior to the actual commencement of the trial, have been held insufficient to satisfy the court's obligations under \u00a7 54-84(b).
