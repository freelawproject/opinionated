For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On July 29, 2014, Plaintiff tripped over a sandbag in a construction area as he was hurrying toward a Port Authority bus to try to reach the bus and board it before it left. (June 1, 2015 Hearing Transcript (H.T.) at 5-6, 13; Plaintiff's Pretrial Statement at 1-2.) After he tripped, Plaintiff's hands hit the side of the bus and he fell backwards on the sidewalk. (H.T. at 6; Plaintiff's Pretrial Statement at 2.) Plaintiff was taken to a hospital emergency room where he was examined and released following a CT scan or MRI of his head. (Plaintiff's Dep. at 34, attached to Defendant's Motions\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   as Ex. A.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On August 13, 2014, Plaintiff, acting\n   <em>\n    pro se,\n   </em>\n   filed a complaint against the Port Authority alleging that the bus driver operated the bus \"so as to cause his bus to collide with plaintiff's body\" and seeking damages for headaches and back pain that he claimed were caused by his fall. The Port Authority pleaded sovereign immunity as a defense in its answer and new matter. Approximately one month before trial, it became apparent that Plaintiff was not claiming that the bus ran into him. Instead, Plaintiff asserted that the Port Authority bus driver was negligent in letting passengers on and off in the construction zone, approximately a bus length behind the designated bus stop, rather than waiting for the vehicle in front of the bus to move when the light changed and stopping at the designated bus stop. (Plaintiff's Pretrial Statement at 1-2; Plaintiff's Dep. at 34-35.) On May 22, 2015, the Port Authority served a motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   on Plaintiff seeking to preclude him from asserting this claim on grounds that it was barred by sovereign immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On June 1, 2015, the day that trial was scheduled to begin, the trial court held a hearing on this motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   at which Plaintiff was given a full opportunity to state what negligence claims he sought to prove against the Port Authority at trial and what evidence he intended to present if the case proceeded to trial. (H.T. at 4-34, 39-47.) The trial court granted the Port Authority's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   to preclude evidence based on sovereign immunity, and, following that ruling, the Port Authority made an oral motion for summary judgment on the ground that Plaintiff's action was barred in its entirety by sovereign immunity, based on the same law and facts raised and argued in its motion\n   <em>\n    in limine.\n   </em>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34-39.) After giving Plaintiff an additional opportunity to state what claims and evidence he intended to present and to respond to this motion, the trial court granted the motion for summary judgment and dismissed the action with prejudice on the ground that it was barred by sovereign immunity. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39-47; Trial Court Order; Trial Court Opinion at 1-2, 4-5.) Plaintiff timely appealed the trial court's grant of summary judgment to the Superior Court, which transferred the appeal to this Court pursuant to Pa. R.A.P. 751.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before this Court, Plaintiff asserts two arguments: 1) that summary judgment could not be granted because the motion was made on the day of trial; and 2) that he had a legally valid negligence claim against the Port Authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that neither of these arguments is meritorious.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   It is error for a trial court to grant summary judgment or judgment on the pleadings on a motion made on the day of trial where the plaintiff has no notice that he must respond to the legal issue on which the motion is based and does not have a full opportunity to respond to the motion.\n   <em>\n    Cagnoli v.

The mere fact that summary judgment is sought on the day of trial does not, however, require that the trial court deny the motion; rather, the issue is whether plaintiff has received a full and fair opportunity to respond to the motion.\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Lock,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6950228\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/906/#p914\">\n    86 A.3d 906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 914-15 (Pa.Super.2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Pa.

Where the plaintiff has sufficient notice of the issues raised by the summary judgment motion and a full opportunity to respond and raise any factual and legal\n   arguments against the motion, the granting of summary judgment on a motion made on the day of trial is not reversible error.\n   <em>\n    Phillips,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6950228\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/906/#p914\">\n    86 A.3d at 911-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming grant of motion for summary judgment made by defendant on the morning of trial).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Here, Plaintiff had both ample notice and an unrestricted and unimpaired opportunity to oppose the Port Authority's motion for summary judgment. Plaintiff received notice over a week before trial of the precise legal issue, sovereign immunity, and the case law and facts on which the summary judgment was based, as these legal and factual arguments were set forth in the Port Authority's motion\n   <em>\n    in limine.\n   </em>\n   (Defendant's Motions\n   <em>\n    in Limine\n   </em>\n   at 2-8.) The trial court gave Plaintiff extensive opportunities at the motion\n   <em>\n    in limine\n   </em>\n   hearing to respond to the summary judgment motion and show that he intended to present evidence at trial that would support a negligence claim not barred by sovereign immunity. (H.T. at 4-34, 39-47.) Notably, Plaintiff has not set forth in this appeal any evidence or legal arguments that he did not have the opportunity to present to the trial court and argues in his brief only the same facts that the trial court considered. Because Plaintiff was given a full and fair opportunity to oppose the Port Authority's summary judgment motion, the trial court did not err in ruling on the motion and granting summary judgment on the day of trial.\n   <em>\n    Phillips,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6950228\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/86/906/#p914\">\n    86 A.3d at 914-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court also correctly held that Plaintiff's action is barred by sovereign immunity.

The mere fact that the plaintiff alleges negligence by a driver of a Commonwealth agency vehicle is not sufficient to bring an action within this exception. Because Section 8522(b)(1) waives sovereign immunity only for claims arising out of negligence in the \"operation\" of the vehicle, suit is permitted only where the negligent act involves movement of the\n   vehicle or some part of the vehicle.\n   <em>\n    White v.
