The instant case arises from a dispute over the approval of a PUD application in Baltimore County. Petitioners, Kenwood Gardens Condominiums, Inc.,\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   (\"Kenwood\"), allege that the PUD developer made illegal campaign contributions to the county councilman who formally accepted the PUD application submitted by the developer. Respondent, Whalen Properties, LLC (\"Whalen Properties\"), the developer, submitted the PUD application on August 9, 2011, to First District Councilman Thomas Quirk (\"Councilman Quirk\") of Baltimore County. The proposed site for the PUD is located in Councilman Quirk's legislative district. On August 30, 2011, Stephen Whalen, Jr., owner and principal of Whalen Properties, withdrew $8,500 from the company's account and subsequently distributed this money to several individuals, who were instructed to deposit the sums into their own accounts and to write checks in those amounts to the campaign committee, Friends of Thomas Quirk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kenwood is an adjacent landowner who challenges the approval of the PUD on the appearance of impropriety generated\n   by the donations. We conclude that because the introduction and passage of a resolution is a legislative action, the legislative intent is subject to limited judicial review. In addition, the alleged \"appearance of impropriety\" generated by illegal campaign contributions does not negate the presumption of validity of the legislative act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Pursuant to Article 32, Title 4, Subtitle 2, \u00a7\u00a7 32-4-242-402.1 (2003, 2012 Supp.) of the Baltimore County Code (\"BCC\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   the PUD approval process in Baltimore County begins with the submission of an application to the county councilman for the district in which the proposed PUD is to be located. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(a). The application is subsequently incorporated into a County Council Resolution. Substantive review of the application may not proceed unless the County Council passes the resolution. Following the passage of the resolution, the application undergoes an extensive review and approval process by various Baltimore County planning and zoning agencies before concluding in a final public hearing before an administrative law judge (\"ALJ\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On August 9, 2011, Whalen Properties submitted a PUD application to Councilman Quirk for a seven story mixed-use medical services building. Notice of the PUD was posted and a community input meeting was held on September 1, 2011. On September 19, 2011, Councilman Quirk introduced Resolution 108-11, which contained the PUD proposal. The County Council unanimously approved the Resolution on October 17, 2011. Whalen Properties met with Baltimore County agencies on October 24, 2011 and October 29, 2011 to review the concept plan and held a community input meeting on December 22, 2011 \"to solicit detailed comments from local community members.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 6, 2012, approximately eight months after the County Council adopted Resolution 108-11, the Council enacted Bill 38-12, which exempted PUDs in certain areas of Baltimore County from traditional compatibility standards under the zoning regulations and substituted a more lenient set of compatibility objectives for all qualifying future PUD applications. Kenwood alleges this is evidence of an improper \"special law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 8, 2012, Whalen Properties filed a finalized development plan, which it reviewed with Baltimore County on August 1, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Pursuant to BCC \u00a7 32-4-245(b) (2003, 2012 Supp.), a Hearing Officer, hereinafter designated as an ALJ, is required to \"review the proposed [PUD] for compliance with the requirements of the Baltimore County zoning regulations and the development regulations.\" The ALJ's review is narrow and fact-specific. Between August 22, 2012 and December 3, 2012, an ALJ conducted five days of public administrative\n   hearings on the PUD development plan and approved the PUD on January 29, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Kenwood challenged the proposed PUD at the hearing before the ALJ and subsequently at the hearing before the Baltimore County Board of Appeals (\"Board of Appeals\" or \"the Board\"). The ALJ rejected Kenwood's challenge that the alleged appearance of impropriety was reviewable or invalidated the process. Kenwood appealed the ALJ's approval of the PUD to the Board of Appeals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BCC \u00a7 32-4-281(a), (c) and (d) (2016) (\"The Board of Appeals shall hear the appeals in accordance with the rules of procedure adopted by the Board of Appeals\"). Following a review of the ALJ's decision, the Board may:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (i) Remand the case to the ALJ;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (ii) Affirm the decision of the ALJ;\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (iii) Reverse or modify the decision of the ALJ if the decision:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   1.

The decision to affirm the ALJ's approval of the proposed PUD was the agency's final decision in the matter. The Board agreed with the ALJ and concluded that any alleged improper motivation underlying the actions by the County Council was beyond the permitted scope of review. Kenwood sought judicial review in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. The Circuit Court reviewed the record and arguments presented by the parties and affirmed the decision\n   of the Board of Appeals. The Circuit Court concluded, however, that the passage of Resolution No. 108-11 constituted a quasi-judicial action rather than legislative action because the County Council's process with regard to the \"resolution for the PUD [wa]s focused upon the analysis of factors relating to a single property.\" Notwithstanding that conclusion, the Circuit Court recognized that \"[t]he issue for judicial review is not how the process for a PUD review was initiated\" and that \"[t]he focus is [on] whether the substance of the administrative review process was fair, and whether the decision to approve the PUD complied with the law and was supported by the evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Kenwood noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed\n   the judgment of the Circuit Court. It held that the ALJ's decision did not exceed his statutory authority or result from an unlawful procedure or other error of law and that the ALJ's findings were supported by substantial evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Kenwood filed a petition for writ of certiorari. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Kenwood Gardens Condo. v. Whalen Properties\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20Md.%20218\">\n    446 Md. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20507\">\n    130 A.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Kenwood raised multiple overlapping questions in its petition, which revolve around whether the alleged appearance of impropriety generated by the campaign donations invalidates Whalen's submission of the PUD application to Councilman Quirk and whether the County Council's development process for approval of the PUD is subject to judicial review and the scope of that review. We have condensed and restated these issues for the purposes of clarity and concision:\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   1.

In Baltimore County, the evaluation of a PUD application is initiated by the introduction of a resolution for consideration by the County Council. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242. Article 32, Title 4, Subtitle 2, Part IV of the BCC sets forth the scheme for evaluating and approving PUDs in that County. In 2005, the County Council passed Bill No. 130-2005 and changed the PUD application process. Prior to the enactment of Bill No. 130-2005, developers applied directly to the County Planning and Zoning Commission. Currently, the process of obtaining a PUD begins by submitting an application to the councilman responsible for the district in which the proposed PUD will be located. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(a). The application requires the developer to submit the following: a map of the project site with\n   an explanation of how the site and acreage meet the criteria for the type of PUD proposed; architectural schematics indicating the use, size, and location of the proposed structures; comparison of the present existing and the proposed future population density, floor area ratio, and parking spaces; the projected impact on the surrounding community; and a statement of compatibility with the requirements listed in BCC \u00a7 32-4-402. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(b)(1)-(5). Additionally, the application must also list the community benefits that the PUD will provide, including environmental, land use, capital improvement, and public policy benefits. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(b)(6)(i)-(iv). The application is required to be posted on the County Council website, and a community meeting must be held. Notice of the meeting must be posted and mailed to all adjoining property owners. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(c)(2)(i)(1). The councilmember has the discretion to schedule a second post-submission community meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   After the councilmember submits the application to the Department of Permits, Approvals and Inspections, that Department\n   transmits the application to the Departments of Planning, Public Works, Environmental Protection and Sustainability and other appropriate reviewing agencies for preliminary review and comment. The reviewing county agencies must provide a written preliminary evaluation of the proposal to the Council member within fifteen days of the filing of a PUD application. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(c)(3). Each department reviews the application and posts the preliminary evaluation on the county's internet website.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=261%20S.E.2d%20882\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Following this preliminary evaluation, the matter of the PUD application is then referred to the full County Council in the form of a Resolution for action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   If the Council concludes that the proposed PUD will achieve a development of substantially higher quality than a conventional development would achieve, and that the proposed site for the PUD is in accordance with the procedures of this title as well as the requirements of the zoning regulations, then the proposed site is \"eligible for County review.\" BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(d)(1).

Further, Kenwood maintains that the County Council's process for the introduction and adoption of Resolution 108-11 was substantially administrative or adjudicatory in nature and thus subject to judicial review on the grounds of an \"appearance of impropriety.\" According to Kenwood, an \"appearance of impropriety\" exists when there is an undisputed email\n   record indicating that Mr. Whalen made illegal campaign contributions to Councilman Quirk, the sponsor of the PUD resolution. Conceding that the County Council serves a gatekeeping function in the PUD approval process, Kenwood contends that this function involves making a significant amount\n   of specific factual findings to evaluate a particular PUD proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As an alternative argument, Kenwood suggests that even if Resolution 108-11 is legislative in nature, it is nonetheless subject to judicial review, because there is undisputed evidence of extraordinary impropriety in the PUD approval process. Kenwood relies upon several out-of-state cases to support its conclusion that Councilman Quirk created a conflict of interest that infected the entire PUD application process, and argues that the only way to remove the taint of his involvement is for this Court to \"void the resolution and resulting PUD approval.\" Moreover, according to Kenwood, the \"appearance of impropriety\" is compounded by the County Council's passage of Bill 38-12, a legislative act, which, in Kenwood's view, is linked to other favorable council actions to facilitate the approval of the Whalen Properties PUD application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Whalen Properties sees the case differently. It contends that the introduction and adoption of Resolution 108-11 was a legislative act subject to very narrow judicial review. It maintains that the alleged improper motives underlying the passage of Resolution 108-11 are irrelevant to the PUD application process, because the resolution relates primarily to general policy-oriented considerations, such as environmental concerns, employment and economic opportunities, and unique characteristics relating to the site of Whalen Properties' proposed PUD. In addition, Whalen Properties posits that the passage of Resolution 108-11 was not quasi-judicial because no hearings were held by the Council to consider documentary evidence or opinions in order to pass the Resolution. According to Whalen Properties, the processes employed by the ALJ and the Board of Appeals were rigorous. The ALJ engaged in a substantive review process that included\n   five days of on the record hearings. The Board of Appeals engaged in a detailed review of the administrative record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Whalen Properties asserts that neither the Board of Appeals nor the ALJ had the authority to scrutinize Resolution 108-11 as long as the Council acted within its legal bounds in passing the legislation. Whalen Properties points out that the County Council's process involved a separate proceeding which began with Councilman Quirk's introduction of the Resolution. The approval process that involved the ALJ and the Board did not include Councilman Quirk or the County Council. Finally, Whalen Properties argues that Kenwood's reliance on several out-of-state cases, in an attempt to create an exception to the general rule that legislative motives are not subjective to judicial inquiry, is not persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    Legislative Nature of the Process and the Appearance of Impropriety\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The relevant sections of the BCC regarding the PUD process specifically note that the application must be submitted to the councilman responsible for the district in which the proposed PUD is located. BCC \u00a7 32-4-242(a). Because the Code expressly provides that submission to the councilman is the correct channel and does not provide for alternative means of initiating the PUD process, it follows that Councilman Quirk was the only individual authorized by law to act in accepting Whalen Properties' PUD application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Kenwood asserts, however, that the introduction and passage of Resolution 108-11 was administrative and quasi-judicial in character, and therefore, is reviewable for impropriety. To the contrary, Whalen Properties contends that the County Council performed a legislative action, which is not subject to review for motive. It is most noteworthy that we have previously held\n   that \"a single decision-making process may require both legislative and adjudicative roles for the hearing body.\"\n   <em>\n    Talbot Cnty. v.

Neither Councilman Quirk nor the County Council participated in the ALJ's decision to approve the PUD or the review conducted by the Board of Appeals. Thus, the Board of Appeals correctly held that it, and the ALJ, lacked the authority and responsibility to review the Resolution for an appearance of impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The standards of review applicable to the ALJ and the Board of Appeals do not contemplate scrutiny of the County Council's motives or\n   review for an appearance of impropriety of those motives.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   BCC \u00a7 32-4-245(b) (stating that the ALJ shall review the proposed [PUD] for compliance with the requirements of the Baltimore County Zoning Regulations and the development regulations); BCC \u00a7 32-4-281(e) (stating that the Board of Appeals in reviewing the ALJ's determination may reverse or modify the ALJ's decision only under certain circumstances delineated by statute). Applying the above principles and in light of our determination that Resolution 108-11 was legislative in nature, we conclude that the ALJ and the Board of Appeals were not permitted to examine the alleged appearance of impropriety arising from Mr. Whalen's and Councilman Quirk's involvement. And, in any event, as explained above, the process by which the PUD was actually approved was an independent process\n   that did not involve Councilman Quirk or even the County Council.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    Bill 38-12 as a \"Special Law\"\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Lastly, Kenwood alleges that the appearance of impropriety is compounded by the passage of Bill 38-12, the content and timing of which indicate that the primary purpose of the bill was to facilitate approval of Whalen Properties' PUD. Bill 38-12 applies to parcels of land in certain areas of the County and relaxes the compatibility requirement between current land use and proposed future land use. The Bill was voted into law on June 6, 2012, two days before Whalen Properties filed a finalized development plan on June 8, 2012. We reject Petitioners' argument that Bill 38-12, now codified at Article 32, Title 4, Subtitle 4, \u00a7 32-4-402.1 (2003, 2012 Supp.) of the BCC, is in some way affected by the alleged impropriety and therefore invalid as a \"special law.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court of Special Appeals noted that the Bill was intended to provide alternative compatibility requirements for a specified class of future PUD developments and does not apply solely to the Whalen Properties PUD application. In our view, there is nothing unlawful or improper about the County Council's\n   enactment of Bill 38-12. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that we cannot reasonably conclude that the law was designed specifically to assist in the passage of this PUD simply because the Bill applied to this PUD application. The record before us does not support Kenwood's conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The introduction and passage of Resolution 108-11, essentially, were legislative actions, the motivations behind which are not subject to review for the appearance of impropriety. The alleged appearance of impropriety generated by Mr. Whalen's actions did not invalidate Councilman Quirk's or the Council's legislative actions. The preliminary fact-finding review processes carried out by the planning and zoning agencies and the Board of Appeal's substantive review following the passage of the resolution were quasi-judicial actions, which are subject to broader review. Councilman Quirk and the County Council were not involved directly in the proceedings before the ALJ or the Board of Appeals. Any alleged appearance of impropriety involving Councilman Quirk or the County Council would not invalidate the ALJ's decision or the Board of Appeal's decision. Therefore, we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Agency's final decision to approve the PUD. That decision was not contrary to the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS IS AFFIRMED.
