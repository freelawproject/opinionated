In doing so, we preserve the historic role of the jury as the sole fact-finder in criminal jury trials.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case presents another issue that the Court was not called upon to address in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   : namely, the manner in which a defendant in a criminal case preserves for review an issue as to allegedly inconsistent verdicts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , although this issue was not before the Court, in a concurring opinion, Judge Glenn T. Harrell, Jr. provided guidance on the matter. Judge Harrell, in his concurrence in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , and, indeed, the Court of\n   Special Appeals in multiple cases, and the vast majority of courts in other jurisdictions that have addressed the issue, have concluded that, to preserve for review an issue as to allegedly inconsistent verdicts, a defendant in a criminal trial by jury must object to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts before the verdicts become final and the trial court discharges the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the below reasons, we agree with Judge Harrell's concurrence, the Court of Special Appeals, and the authority from other jurisdictions, and hold that, to preserve the issue of legally inconsistent verdicts for appellate review, a defendant in a criminal trial by jury must object or make known any opposition to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts before the verdicts become final and the trial court discharges the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Charges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In an indictment dated February 24, 2012, in the Circuit Court for Prince George's County (\"the circuit court\"), the State, Respondent, charged Dominic Givens (\"Givens\"), Petitioner, as to various victims with one count of first-degree premeditated murder, three counts of robbery with a dangerous weapon and robbery, three counts of attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon and attempted robbery, conspiracy to commit the same, and six counts of use of a firearm in the commission a crime of violence. The victims were identified as Marvin Darrell Tomlinson (\"Tomlinson\"), Jeramy Dobbs (\"Dobbs\"), Antwan Wilkins (\"Antwan\"), Tyrell Jones (\"Jones\"), Reginald Langley (\"Langley\"), and Jayvon Wilkins (\"Jayvon\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to the indictment, Givens's co-conspirators were Trevon Marquise Montgomery (\"Montgomery\"), Ronald Minor (\"Minor\"), and Dajuan Jamal Brooks (\"Brooks\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    State's Theory, Trial Testimony, and Stipulations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State's theory of the case was that Givens, Montgomery, Minor, and Brooks robbed Jones, Langley, and Jayvon, and attempted to rob Tomlinson, Dobbs, and Antwan, and that Tomlinson was fatally shot during the attempted robbery. Four of the five surviving victims-Jones, Langley, Antwan, and Jayvon-testified at trial as witnesses for the State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Jones testified that, on or about November 15, 2011, he, Langley, Antwan, Jayvon, Tomlinson, and Dobbs stopped at a playground on the way to a store. A van pulled up, and at least four or five people, including Montgomery,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   got out of the van. Montgomery was holding a gun. The people from the van told the victims to \"get down\" and said: \"You know what time it is.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the victims lay on the ground, the robbers used the gun to hit Tomlinson in the head multiple times. Meanwhile, Montgomery took Jones's jacket and money, Jayvon's jacket and shoes, Antwan's jacket, and Langley's money. Before any of the robbers could take anything from Tomlinson or Dobbs, Tomlinson got up and \"rushed\" toward the gun, which was in Montgomery's hand. Tomlinson told the other victims to run. Jones, Langley, Antwan, and Jayvon fled and climbed over a nearby wall. As he climbed over the wall, Jones heard gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Jones testified that he did not recognize anyone in the courtroom as one of the robbers. During his testimony, Jones did not mention Givens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Langley testified that, on November 15, 2011, he, Jones, Antwan, Jayvon, and Tomlinson stopped at a playground on the way home from a store. A van pulled up, and four or five people, including Montgomery and Minor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   got out of the van. Montgomery was holding a gun. The people from the van said \"You know what time it is\" and \"Lay everything down.\" As the victims lay on the ground, the robbers patted the victims' pockets. One of the robbers took money from Langley. The robbers used the gun to hit Langley and Tomlinson. The gun fell to ground, and Tomlinson told the other victims to run. Jones, Langley, Antwan, and Jayvon fled and climbed over a nearby wall. As he climbed over the wall, Langley heard two gunshots. Langley testified that he did not recognize anyone in the courtroom as one of the robbers. During his testimony, Langley did not mention Givens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Antwan testified that, on November 15, 2011, he, Jones, Langley, Jayvon, and Tomlinson stopped at a playground on the way to a store. Another group of people, including Montgomery, appeared; one of them was holding a gun, and one of them told the victims to get down. Montgomery took Jones's jacket and Jayvon's jacket and shoes, and checked Antwan's pockets, which were empty. Tomlinson got up and began \"tussling\" with the robber who was holding a gun, which fell to the ground. Antwan fled and climbed over a nearby wall. As he fled, Antwan heard gunshots. While testifying, Antwan was not asked whether he recognized anyone in the courtroom as one of the robbers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Jayvon testified that, on November 15, 2011, he, Jones, Langley, Antwan, Tomlinson, and Dobbs stopped at a playground on the way home from a store. A minivan pulled up, and four people, including Givens, Montgomery, and Minor, got out of the minivan. Montgomery was holding a gun, and\n   said \"Y'all know what time it is\" and \"Y'all get on the ground.\" As the victims lay on the ground, the robbers began searching the victims. Givens took Jayvon's phone and money. Other robbers took Jayvon's jacket and shoes. The robbers took two other jackets from the other victims, and hit Tomlinson in the head with the gun twice. Tomlinson \"barged\" toward the robber with the gun, which fell to the ground. Tomlinson told the other victims to run, and \"a scuffle for the gun\" ensued. Jayvon fled and climbed over a nearby wall. As he climbed over the wall, Jayvon heard gunshots.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As a witness for the State, Corey Young (\"Young\"), Givens's cousin, testified\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   that, on November 15, 2011, Young's car broke down, and he texted Givens to ask for help. Givens, Montgomery, and Minor arrived in Givens's gray minivan. The four people pushed Young's car to his grandmother's house. Afterward, the four people entered the minivan, which Givens drove around. Givens later asked Young to drive to pick up \"Mouse,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Young complied. Young then drove the minivan to Minor's house, and the five people got out of the minivan. Minor entered his house, came back outside, and got into the minivan's driver's seat. The other four people entered the minivan, which Minor drove to a spot near\n   a playground. Givens, Montgomery, and Mouse got out of the minivan. At some point, Minor said: \"Man, they're taking too long.\" Minor got out of the minivan, and a fight broke out between Minor and a man who was holding a gun. Givens grabbed the gun and shot the man twice. Givens, Montgomery, Minor, and Mouse got back into the minivan, which Young drove away. While Young was driving, Givens, Montgomery, and Mouse told Minor: \"The robbery was over with. Why did you have to take it out of [Givens]'s hand?\"\n   At trial, the prosecutor informed the circuit court that the parties had stipulated that, on November 15, 2011, members of the Prince George's County Police Department responded to 2122 County Road in District Heights, Maryland, where Tomlinson was suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. Tomlinson was transported to Prince George's County Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    Verdicts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On March 14, 2013, the circuit court instructed the jury; the parties made closing arguments; and, at 11:15 a.m., the jury began deliberating. At 1:40 p.m.-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , within two-and-a-half hours-the jury indicated that it had reached verdicts; however, the transcript reveals that the jury received lunch before being called into the courtroom to announce the verdicts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   At 3:05 p.m., the jury entered the courtroom to render the verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In response to questions from the courtroom clerk, the jury's foreperson announced that the jury found Givens guilty of first-degree felony murder of Tomlinson, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery of each of the six victims. The jury's foreperson announced that the jury found Givens not guilty of first-degree premeditated murder of Tomlinson; attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence against each of Tomlinson, Dobbs, and Antwan; and robbery with a dangerous weapon, robbery, and use of a firearm in the commission of a crime of violence against each of Jones, Langley, and Jayvon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Immediately after the jury's foreperson stated the verdicts, the circuit court asked: \"Any requests?\" Givens's counsel's responded by asking that the jury be polled. The courtroom\n   clerk repeated the verdicts exactly as the jury's foreperson had stated them. The courtroom clerk polled the jury by asking the jury's foreperson \"Is this your verdict?\" and asking each other juror \"[I]s [the foreperson]'s verdict your verdict?\" Each of the twelve jurors separately responded: \"Yes.\" The courtroom clerk hearkened\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   the verdict, stating \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, h[e]arken to your verdict as the Court has recorded it.\" The courtroom clerk repeated the verdicts again, then asked: \"So say you all?\" The jurors responded \"Yes.\" The circuit court thanked and discharged the jury, and the jury exited the courtroom at 3:25 p.m. Immediately afterward, the circuit court, the prosecutor, and Givens's counsel discussed matters that were related to the\n   sentencing proceeding, and then the circuit court adjourned at 3:30 p.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Motion to Strike\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On March 14, 2013, at 4:38 p.m., a little over an hour after the jury was discharged, Givens filed in the circuit court a \"Motion to Strike Inconsistent Guilty Verdicts and/or Motion to Dismiss\" (\"the motion to strike\"), contending that \"[t]he felony murder guilty verdict is inconsistent with the robbery and attempted robbery not guilty verdicts\" and that \"[n]o felony other than robbery, and no attempt to commit any felony other than attempted robbery, could have formed the basis for a felony murder verdict[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Givens requested that\n   the circuit court strike the conviction for first-degree felony murder or dismiss that count of the indictment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On March 19, 2013-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , five days after the jury reached the verdicts-Givens filed in the circuit court a \"Memorandum in Support of Motion to Strike Inconsistent Guilty Verdicts and/or Motion to Dismiss,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which Givens again requested that the circuit court either strike the conviction for first-degree felony murder of Tomlinson or dismiss the relevant count of the indictment on the ground that the conviction for first-degree felony murder of Tomlinson was legally inconsistent with the acquittals of robbery with a dangerous weapon, attempted robbery with a dangerous weapon, robbery, and attempted robbery. Givens expressly acknowledged that he had not moved to strike the allegedly inconsistent conviction until after the circuit court had discharged the jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Givens argued that he had not waived the issue as to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts because, according to Givens, a defendant is not required to move to strike a guilty verdict that is allegedly inconsistent with a not-guilty verdict before the trial court discharges the jury. To support that proposition, Givens relied on\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739686\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/10/#p29\">\n    405 Md. at 34, 29, 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740013,3739686\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/619/\">\n    949 A.2d at 633-34, 630, 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which this Court ordered the reversal of a conviction that was inconsistent with acquittals, despite the circumstance that the defendant apparently moved to strike the conviction after the trial court discharged the jury. Givens asserted that, in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , the Majority of this Court took a position that was inconsistent with that of Judge Harrell, who,\n   in a concurring opinion, stated: \"[A] defendant must note [an] objection to the inconsistent verdict[s] while the trial court has an opportunity to remedy the error,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    before the verdict[s are] final and the jury is\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    discharged\n   </strong>\n   . Failure to do so constitutes waiver.\"\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739686\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/10/#p29\">\n    405 Md. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740013,3739686\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/619/\">\n    949 A.2d at 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harrell, J., concurring) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   On March 21, 2013, the State filed a response to the motion to strike. In the response, the State contended that, by failing to object before the circuit court discharged the jury, Givens waived any issue as to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts. Alternatively, as to the merits, the State asserted that the verdicts were legally consistent because, as a co-conspirator, Givens was criminally liable for the first-degree felony murder that occurred during the attempted robbery of Tomlinson.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On April 26, 2013, the circuit court conducted a sentencing proceeding, at which the circuit court heard argument on the motion to strike. After hearing arguments from the parties, the circuit court denied the motion to strike, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   Judge Har[rell]'s [concurring] opinion made absolute good sense, and even the [C]ourt of [S]pecial [A]ppeals said they [\"]find significant solace in [his] well[-]reasoned and articulate[\"] opinion.

The feature distinguishing [ ] factually inconsistent verdict[s] from [ ] legally inconsistent verdict[s] is that [ ] factually inconsistent verdict[s are] merely illogical. By contrast, [ ] legally inconsistent verdict[s] occur [ ] where a jury acts contrary to a trial [court]'s proper instructions regarding the law. The difference between the two is perhaps best illustrated by examples[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   Assume [that] a legally intoxicated ... driver causes a head-on collision, killing on impact the driver and passenger of the other car. The intoxicated driver is charged with two counts of vehicular homicide. The jury convicts the defendant of vehicular homicide as to the death of the driver of the other car, but finds the defendant not guilty of the same crime with regard to the death of the passenger. Such a result would constitute factually inconsistent verdicts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   The verdicts in the present case also contain a factual inconsistency. [The defendant] was acquitted of being a felon in possession of a handgun, but convicted of possessing a handgun in the course\n   of drug trafficking. There was no dispute at trial as to [the defendant]'s prior felony convictions. Therefore, it is illogical for the jury to find that [the defendant] is guilty of possessing a firearm in the course of drug trafficking without possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. Despite the illogical verdict[s], this does not rise to the level of [ ] legally inconsistent verdict[s]. Thus, if this were the only ground[ ] for challenging [the defendant]'s conviction for possession of a handgun in the course of drug trafficking, his conviction should be affirmed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   A legal inconsistency, by contrast, occurs when an acquittal on one charge is conclusive as to an element which is necessary to[,] and inherent in[,] a charge on which a conviction has occurred. ... [I]f the essential elements of the counts of which the defendant is acquitted are identical and necessary to prove the count of which the defendant is convicted, then the verdicts are inconsistent. Verdicts of guilty of crime A but not guilty of crime B, where both crimes arise out of the same set of facts, are legally inconsistent when they necessarily involve the conclusion that the same essential element or elements of each crime were found both to exist and not to exist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   As [the defendant]'s acquittal established conclusively that he was not engaged in drug trafficking, the Majority opinion correctly concludes that the conviction for possession of a handgun while engaged in drug trafficking may not stand.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 35-38,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740013,3739686\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/619/\">\n    949 A.2d at 634-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harrell, J., concurring) (brackets, citations, footnotes, and internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In Part C, Judge Harrell addressed preservation of any issue as to allegedly inconsistent verdicts as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   The Majority opinion properly notes that[,] \"where the issue was preserved[,]\" ... \"inconsistent verdicts shall no longer be allowed.\" Because of the \"sea change\" announced by the Majority's opinion, some prospective direction is necessary and desirable to highlight the procedure [that is] required in order for a defendant to preserve for appellate review a challenge to [ ] legally inconsistent verdict[s].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   [A] jury may render [ ] legally inconsistent verdict[s] to show lenity to [a] defendant.

The obvious cure for an inconsistency\n   in verdicts would be to send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency: \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you can't have it both ways. Give us two acquittals or give us two convictions.\" The problem, of course, is that few defendants, enjoying the quite[-]unexpected boon of an inconsistent acquittal, are willing to \"roll the dice, double or nothing.\" Consistency for its own sake does not mean that much to them. They are prone to complain about the lack of consistency after it is no longer available, but are far from enthusiastic about pursuing consistency while it is still available.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   There is a small window of opportunity in which the jury may still be sent back to the jury room to resolve any troubling inconsistencies or ambiguities. At such a strategic junction, the defendant enjoys an immense advantage, but it is an advantage that must be exercised then and there. When inconsistent verdicts are rendered, the [trial court] may not,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency, because it is the defendant who is entitled, should he [or she] so wish, to accept the benefit of the inconsistent acquittal. By the same token, the prosecutor may not ask to have the jury sent back to resolve the inconsistency, because it is the defendant, once again, who is entitled, should he [or she] so wish, to accept the benefit of the inconsistent acquittal. The defendant is authorized to\n   call the shots at that critical moment, but the defendant must call them before the moment passes. After that, the jury will be gone beyond recall.\n   <strong>\n    The defendant may not stand mute and later complain about the verdicts [that] he [or she] did nothing to cure at the only time [that] a cure was still possible.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   <strong>\n    [Part C of Judge Harrell's concurring opinion in\n    <em>\n     Price\n    </em>\n    ] spells out the obvious procedure that must be followed. It is the only procedure that makes sense. The defendant faces the choice either of having the jury resolve the inconsistency or of standing pat and enjoying the inconsistency. He [or she] has to decide \"when to hold 'em and when to fold 'em.\" If he [or she] chooses the latter, he [or she] may not later complain. A defendant simply may not seek to exploit an alleged inconsistency without taking the necessary step to cure or resolve the inconsistency when it is still possible to do so. If a defendant chooses, on the other hand, to cast him[- or her]self as the champion of jury verdict consistency, he [or she] must accept the perils of the part.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Tate II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    182 Md.App. at 134-36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    957 A.2d at 651-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Applying Part C of Judge Harrell's concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    Tate II\n   </em>\n   's facts, the Court of Special Appeals noted that the defendant \"clearly did nothing by way of objecting to the reception of the verdicts or by way of asking that the jury be sent back to resolve any alleged inconsistency in [the] verdicts.\"\n   <em>\n    Tate II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    182 Md.App. at 136-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    957 A.2d at 653\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

If defense counsel is unsure of whether verdicts are legally inconsistent, defense counsel may request a brief pause in the proceedings or recess, prior to the finality of the verdicts, during which defense counsel may evaluate the verdicts and arrive at a determination as to whether they are legally inconsistent. As such, trial courts should allow a brief pause in the proceedings or, if necessary, a recess to give defense counsel time to determine whether to lodge any objection as to legally inconsistent verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   A defendant has not only an opportunity, but in some cases an incentive, to object to inconsistent verdicts before the verdicts become final. Where a guilty verdict is inconsistent with a not-guilty verdict, the defendant might raise such an issue with the expectation that the trial court\n   will send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency, and in hopes that the jury may find the defendant not guilty of both charges.

We decline to follow\n   <em>\n    Louberti\n   </em>\n   , as the opinion offers no meaningful analysis as to the significance of a trial court's acceptance of a verdict, or, for that matter, the prohibition on double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Similarly, we decline to follow the Illinois appellate court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Ousley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=232%20Ill.%20Dec.%20184\">\n    232 Ill.Dec. 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=697%20N.E.2d%20926\">\n    697 N.E.2d at 930\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that legally inconsistent verdicts present plain error. Simply put, under Maryland case law, plain error review requires that all four of the\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   factors be satisfied before an appellate court may exercise plain error review. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694510\" index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/567/#p578\">\n    415 Md. at 578\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694510\" index=\"345\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/567/#p578\">\n    3 A.3d at 1216-17\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , this Court unequivocally\n   stated that plain error review requires the satisfaction of four prongs before the appellate court may resort to plain error review-namely, that there must be an error or defect that the defendant has not intentionally relinquished or abandoned, i.e., affirmatively waived; that the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute; that the error must have affected the defendant's substantial rights, which, in the ordinary case, means that the defendant must demonstrate that the error affected the outcome of the trial court proceedings; and that, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the appellate court has the discretion to remedy the error, and the appellate court should exercise that discretion only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694510\" index=\"346\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/567/#p578\">\n    415 Md. at 574\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694510\" index=\"347\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/567/#p578\">\n    3 A.3d at 1214\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010), this Court elaborated on the \"discretion\" prong of plain error review as follows: \"The few cases where we have exercised our discretion to review unpreserved issues are cases where prejudicial error was found and the failure to preserve the issue was not a matter of trial tactics.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Similarly, in\n   <em>\n    Conyers v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400101\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/525/#p563\">\n    345 Md. 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 563,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"400101\" index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/345/525/#p563\">\n    693 A.2d 781\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 799 (1997), this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n   [I]n the case of plain error, that is, error which vitally affects a defendant's right to a fair and impartial trial, we retain the discretion to provide appellate review, although the error was unobjected to. We have explained, however, that plain error review should only be undertaken when the error is compelling, extraordinary, exceptional or fundamental to assure the defendant of fair trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   (Citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In short, under\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   , plain error review is unavailable where a defendant fails to object as a matter of trial tactics.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   In this case, Givens has not requested plain error review, and has not argued that the failure to raise the issue before the verdicts became final and the circuit court discharged the jury was not a matter of trial tactics. Further, the error is neither clear nor obvious. It is mere speculation to posit that, in convicting Givens of felony murder, the jury erroneously intended to find conspiracy to commit robbery to be the requisite predicate offense. Givens did not object to the allegedly inconsistent verdicts while the jury was still present, and filed a motion to strike the convictions a little over an hour after the circuit court discharged the jury. If Givens had raised the issue of the allegedly inconsistent verdicts before the verdicts became final and the circuit court discharged the jury, the circuit court would have been able to send the jury back to resolve the alleged inconsistency. Under this scenario, Givens may have been convicted of a requisite predicate felony; thus, the existence of error is not clear and obvious. Although Givens has not sought plain error review and has not addressed any of the\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   factors-including whether the failure to raise the issue before the verdicts became final and\n   the circuit court discharged the jury was a matter of trial tactics-what is certain is that, in failing to raise the issue before the verdicts became final and the circuit court discharged the jury, Givens deprived the circuit court of an opportunity to have the jury resolve the alleged inconsistency and, thereby, avoided the possibility of being convicted of a requisite predicate felony. Under these circumstances, the error is not clear and obvious, and the four factors that are necessary for plain error review are not satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In contrast to Maryland, some States, such as Illinois, have a different standard\n   for plain error review. In Illinois, under Ill. Comp. Stat. Ann., S. Ct. Rule 615(a), plain errors or defects affecting substantial rights may be noticed although they were not brought to the attention of the trial court.\n   <em>\n    See also People v. Clark\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=401%20Ill.%20Dec.%20638\">\n    401 Ill.Dec. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20N.E.3d%201120\">\n    50 N.E.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1133 (2016) (\"The plain error doctrine is applicable when: (1) a clear or obvious error occurred and the evidence is so closely balanced that the error alone threatened to tip the scales of justice against the defendant, regardless of the seriousness of the error, or (2) a clear or obvious error occurred and that error is so serious that it affected the fairness of the defendant's trial and challenged the integrity of the judicial process, regardless of the closeness of the evidence.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)). In Illinois, the plain error doctrine may apply even where the seriousness of the error is not significant. By contrast, in Maryland, the plain error doctrine may apply only if the four factors that are set forth in\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   are satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Our conclusion is in conformity with\n   <em>\n    Dietz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597482\" index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1885/#p1891\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which the Supreme Court remarked: \"Given additional concerns in criminal cases, such as attachment of the double jeopardy bar, we do not address here whether it would be appropriate to recall a jury after discharge in a criminal case.\" (Citation omitted). Obviously, by the time that a trial court discharges a jury that has acquitted a defendant, a trial court has accepted the acquittal, and thus has made the acquittal final.\n   <em>\n    See Smith\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1981775\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/299/158/#p168\">\n    299 Md. at 168-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1981775\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/299/158/#p168\">\n    472 A.2d at 993\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By that time, a double jeopardy concern would arise if the trial court\n   recalled the jury. The holding in this case does not stand for the proposition that a trial court may discharge a jury that has acquitted a defendant of one charge and convicted the defendant of another charge, then later recall the jury to resolve an inconsistency between the acquittal and the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   We disagree with Givens's contention that, in the scenario that we described above, the defendant is forced to \"forfeit an acquittal.\" As explained above, the defendant is the only one who can choose to object to the inconsistent verdicts. When inconsistent verdicts are rendered, the trial court may not,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency, because it is the defendant who is entitled, should he or she so wish, to accept the benefit of the inconsistent acquittal. By the same token, the prosecutor may not ask to have the jury sent back to resolve the inconsistency, because it is the defendant, once again, who is entitled, should he or she so wish, to accept the benefit of the inconsistent acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   If the defendant chooses to object to the inconsistent verdicts, and the trial court sends the jury back to resolve the inconsistency, it is not a foregone conclusion that the jury will find the defendant guilty of both of the charges; to the contrary, the jury might acquit the defendant of both of the charges.\n   <em>\n    See Price\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3739686\" index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/405/10/#p29\">\n    405 Md. at 42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740013,3739686\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/619/\">\n    949 A.2d at 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Harrell, J., concurring) (\"The jury is free to resolve the inconsistency [ ] by returning verdict in the defendant's favor[.]\");\n   <em>\n    Tate II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    182 Md.App. at 134\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3837450\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/182/114/#p129\">\n    957 A.2d at 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The obvious cure for an inconsistency in verdicts would be to send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency: 'Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you can't have it both ways.

Indeed, the record reveals that Givens had ample opportunity to object before the verdicts became final and the jury was discharged. Immediately after the jury's foreperson stated the verdicts, the circuit court asked whether there were any requests. Givens's counsel's only response was to ask that the jury be polled. The courtroom clerk repeated the verdicts exactly as the jury's foreperson had stated them. The courtroom clerk polled the jury by asking the jury's foreperson \"Is this your verdict?\" and asking each other juror \"[I]s [the foreperson]'s verdict your verdict?\" Each of the twelve jurors separately responded affirmatively. The courtroom clerk properly hearkened the verdict, stating: \"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, h[e]arken to your verdict as the Court has recorded it.\" The courtroom clerk repeated the verdicts again, then asked: \"So say you\n   all?\" The jurors responded \"Yes.\" The circuit court thanked and discharged the jury. Immediately afterward, the circuit court, the prosecutor, and Givens's counsel discussed matters that were related to the sentencing proceeding, and the circuit court adjourned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Givens was convicted of the first-degree felony murder, and conspiracy to commit robbery with a dangerous weapon and conspiracy to commit robbery of each of the six victims. It would have been apparent that Givens had been convicted of first-degree felony murder, but had not been convicted of an underlying felony. Yet, it was not until after the\n   jury was discharged that Givens filed the motion to strike in the circuit court. By that time, with the jury discharged and the circuit court adjourned, it was too late for the circuit court to send the jury back to resolve the inconsistency in the verdicts-assuming that the circuit court agreed with Givens that there was an inconsistency in the verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   By filing the motion to strike after the verdicts became final and the circuit court discharged the jury, Givens deprived the circuit court of the opportunity to resolve any inconsistency in the verdicts. In doing so, the purpose of the preservation requirement-to give a trial court the opportunity to correct any error in the proceedings-was thwarted.\n   <em>\n    See Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337993\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/444/105/#p126\">\n    444 Md. at 126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4337993\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/444/105/#p126\">\n    118 A.3d at 937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Fairness and the orderly administration of justice [are] advanced by requiring [defense] counsel to bring the position of their client to the attention of the [trial] court at the trial so that the trial court can pass upon, and possibly correct[,] any errors in the proceedings.\" (Citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).

It is important to note that before the imposition of the sentence in this case, defense counsel filed a motion to strike the\n   felony murder verdict approximately one hour after the jury had been discharged on the grounds that the felony murder verdict was inconsistent with the not guilty verdicts.

The focus of the majority opinion in\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   was the intolerable nature of inconsistent verdicts, and notably because they were not allowed in civil cases, it would be a travesty to continue to allow inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Price\n   </em>\n   , 405 Md. at 22,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3740013,3739686\" index=\"407\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/949/619/\">\n    949 A.2d at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Even assuming the sufficiency of the evidence to convict for felony murder, here, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty as to any of the possible predicate offenses, namely, robbery, attempted robbery, and use of a handgun. Instead, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to a related misdemeanor offense of conspiracy to commit robbery. A verdict of guilty for conspiracy to commit robbery does not and cannot support a conviction for felony murder. Clearly, the verdicts entered and the subsequent convictions in this case did not result in a windfall to the defendant. Any windfall favored only the prosecution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-196\">\n   The verdict of guilty of felony murder was invalid the moment the jury announced it in open court. Such a verdict of guilty, under the circumstances, based upon no predicate felony offense or an improper predicate offense cannot stand and does not support a rational conclusion that the jury exercised leniency toward the defendant. The verdict of felony murder appears to rest upon the jury's erroneous belief that it could find Mr. Givens guilty of felony murder on the basis of a conspiracy to commit robbery. Thus, because Mr. Givens agreed to be involved in the events that led to the victim's death, the jury must have blamed him for the victim's death.

Even though appellate review under the plain error doctrine is rare, its application is justified under the facts of this case. At this stage of the process, only an appellate court can remedy the obvious and serious error in this case.

Because of our decision in\n   <em>\n    McNeal\n   </em>\n   , factually inconsistent verdicts in criminal cases are tolerated. To obtain a felony murder conviction, a verdict of guilty on the underlying felony is an essential ingredient of the crime of felony murder. A misdemeanor cannot be a substitute for the underlying felony under the felony murder doctrine. Second, the jury's legal error in rendering inconsistent verdicts of guilty of felony murder and not guilty as to any of the predicate offenses is obvious and not subject to any reasonable dispute. Third, the error affected Mr. Givens' substantial right to a fair trial based upon the law and the facts. In other words, the verdict and ultimate invalid conviction of felony-\n   murder affected the outcome of the court proceedings. Lastly, this Court has the discretion to remedy the error-discretion which ought to exercised-because the results \"seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of [the] judicial proceedings.\"\n   <em>\n    Rich\n   </em>\n   , 415 at 578,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694510\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/567/#p578\">\n    3 A.3d at 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   As stated previously, generally, if the jury returns a verdict that is defective in form or substance, the trial judge should not accept it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Heinze\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2242382\" index=\"431\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/184/613/#p615\">\n    184 Md. at 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20A.2d%20128\">\n    42 A.2d at 130\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, our case law provides that the trial judge has a duty to remedy the problem with regard to inconsistent verdicts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In the present case defense counsel did not bring the matter of the inconsistent verdicts to the attention of the trial judge until after the jury was discharged. The trial judge could have addressed the matter\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   before discharging the jury, but did not. Nonetheless, the issue was raised below and decided by the trial court when it denied defense counsel's motion to strike the felony murder guilty verdict. It seems to me that where the record shows plain error and prejudice to the defendant and the issue was raised below, we should review the court's acceptance of the legally inconsistent verdict, even if the issue was not raised timely. Accordingly, on the merits, I would hold that the trial court abused its discretion when it denied Mr. Givens' motion to strike the felony murder conviction. Thus, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   I respectfully dissent.
