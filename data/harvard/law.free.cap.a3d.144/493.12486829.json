On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court (1) abused its discretion when it denied his petition for certification to appeal and (2) improperly concluded that his criminal defense counsel (defense counsel), George Flores and William O'Connor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to immediately object or move for a mistrial after a state's witness testified that the petitioner had refused to speak to police.

The court denied the motion on the basis that, rather than immediately make that motion when the testimony was offered, defense counsel chose to cross-examine Bilbo on the topic. The court described this decision by defense counsel as \"a very sound and excellent tactical decision\" and \"very intelligent.\" Instead of granting a mistrial, the court gave a curative instruction to the jury and prohibited\n   the prosecutor from making any arguments regarding the petitioner's silence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The court provided the following curative instruction to the jury: \"The [petitioner] also has a constitutional right not to speak to police. And if you find that the [petitioner] chose not to speak to Detective Bilbo, you may not hold that against him in any way.\" The petitioner was found guilty on both counts.\n   <em>\n    State v.

Following conviction, defense counsel filed a motion for a new trial arguing, in part, that Bilbo's testimony was a prejudicial violation of the petitioner's right against self-incrimination under the fifth amendment to the United States constitution. The court denied this motion from the bench on September 2, 2008, without any oral argument from the parties. The petitioner subsequently was sentenced to a total effective sentence of fifty years incarceration.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20A.3d%201120\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   On direct appeal, this court affirmed the judgment of conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20A.3d%201120\">\n    8 A.3d 1120\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   On May 18, 2012, the petitioner filed his operative petition for a writ of habeas corpus, in which he alleged\n   that his defense counsel rendered ineffective assistance on several grounds,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   including by failing to object or move for a mistrial immediately after Bilbo testified that the petitioner had refused to speak to police, and then further compounding the error by raising the issue on cross-examination. He contended this deficiency fell below the range of competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill, violated his due process rights, and caused him prejudice because, if not for this failure, the outcome of his trial would have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Following a trial, the habeas court denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus by a memorandum of decision dated October 9, 2014. The habeas court made the following relevant findings. When Bilbo testified regarding the petitioner's silence, the defense team discussed how to respond. They determined that it was unlikely the court would grant a mistrial and that, even if such a ruling could be obtained, it would not serve their client's strong desire to proceed with trial. They concluded that the best response would be to cross-examine Bilbo on this issue and seek a curative jury instruction. This strategy also had the benefit, in their view, of undermining Bilbo's credibility and revealing his biases. The habeas court found this strategy to be \"eminently reasonable and not indicative of deficient performance,\" and that it \"effectively highlight[ed] [Bilbo's] bias.\" The court concluded that defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance and that the petitioner did not show that this strategy caused him prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The petitioner then filed a petition for certification to appeal, which alleged several grounds for appeal, including whether the habeas court improperly determined that defense counsel's strategy regarding Bilbo's\n   testimony did not constitute deficient performance. The court denied the petition for certification to appeal on October 16, 2014. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In this appeal, the petitioner contends that the habeas court abused its discretion in denying his petition for certification to appeal and in determining that defense counsel did not provide ineffective assistance by failing to move for a mistrial immediately or otherwise object when Bilbo\n   testified regarding the petitioner's silence.

The court based its holding in two considerations: First, it noted that silence in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings is insolubly ambiguous and consequently of little probative value. Second and more important, it observed that while it is true that the\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   warnings contain no express assurances that silence will carry no penalty, such assurance is implicit to any person who receives the warnings. In such circumstances, it would be fundamentally unfair and a deprivation of due process to allow the arrested person's silence to be used to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.... The point of the\n   <em>\n    Doyle\n   </em>\n   holding is that it is fundamentally unfair to promise an arrested person that his silence will not be used against\n   him and thereafter to breach that promise by using the silence to impeach his trial testimony....

As in\n   <em>\n    Lewis,\n   </em>\n   defense counsel in the present case did not immediately move for a mistrial or object to testimony regarding postarrest silence.

In both\n   <em>\n    Lewis\n   </em>\n   and the present case, the witness that raised the petitioner's postarrest silence was the lead police investigator.

Defense counsel sought a mistrial, albeit with some delay, and moved for a new trial after conviction. Both motions cited Bilbo's references to the petitioner's postarrest silence. Although the court did not provide its rationale for denying the motion for a new trial, it did explain that it was denying the motion for a mistrial, in part, because the cross-examination by defense counsel had adequately mitigated any potential prejudice. These motions led the court to prohibit the prosecutor from making any further comment or arguments based on the petitioner's silence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, defense counsel sought and obtained\n   a curative jury instruction directing the jury to draw no adverse inferences from the petitioner's silence because he was merely exercising his constitutional right not to speak to the police.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The petitioner has not met his burden of demonstrating that this issue is debatable among jurists of reason or that a court could resolve this issue in a different manner. We agree with the habeas court's determination that this performance did\n   not fall below an objective level of reasonableness. We need not reach the question of whether the petitioner suffered prejudice because the failure to prove either prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard is determinative of the petitioner's ineffective assistance of counsel claim.\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

He claimed that his defense counsel had performed deficiently because they had failed to prevent the state from violating the petitioner's due process rights by breaching this implied promise of the\n    <em>\n     Miranda\n    </em>\n    warning. Because the task before this court is to determine whether the habeas court abused its discretion in denying certification to appeal, we will consider only the grounds the petitioner actually presented to the habeas court.

We reject this contention. To begin with, our review of the record indicates that Attorney O'Connor's testimony may be more accurately characterized as stating that, with the benefit of hindsight, he now sees the situation differently and views the relative benefits of alternative trial strategies differently than he did at the time of trial. This does not indicate that Attorney O'Connor disagreed with the trial strategy at the time, and, even if he did, disagreement among defense counsel does not in itself render the strategy ultimately chosen to be unreasonable. Additionally, the import of Attorney O'Connor's testimony must be tempered by the Supreme Court's instruction that \"[a] fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel's perspective at the time.\"\n    <em>\n     Strickland v.
