Voegel, Robert Rothstein, and Joseph P. Cacciatore (collectively \"Guaranty Appellees\") and Fidelity National Title Insurance Company (\"Fidelity\"). After careful review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   LEM is the successor-in-interest of an entity that invested $3 million in a company holding real property in Reno, Nevada, under a preferred equity scheme. At all times relevant to this matter, Fidelity was a title insurance company registered to conduct business in Pennsylvania. Guaranty Appellees were based in Illinois and had the following roles. Guaranty National Title Company (\"Guaranty\") was a title assurance agent on behalf of Fidelity, as indicated in an Issuing Agent Agreement\n   (the \"IAA\") between the parties.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Robert J. Voegel executed the IAA in his role as president of Guaranty. Robert R. Rothstein, Esquire, was a senior vice president of Guaranty. Joseph P. Cacciatore and Voegel were members of an entity known as C &amp; V Investments, LLC (\"C &amp; V\"), a non-party to the instant action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In the Spring of 2007, C &amp; V loaned funds to Russell M. Meusy, II, a real estate investor, and his companies (collectively, the \"Meusy Interests\"). The funds were used to facilitate Meusy's purchase of a 234-unit property (the \"Property\"), located in Reno, Nevada. The loan transactions occurred in Illinois; none of the loans was recorded with any public agency. Closing on the Property occurred on May 11, 2007. Guaranty performed the duties of settlement agent. The closing papers prepared by Guaranty did not disclose that C &amp; V had loaned funds to the Meusy Interests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After closing on the Property, the Meusy Interests approached LEM to obtain additional funding. LEM reviewed the settlement papers prepared by Guaranty at the Property closing of May 11, 2007, and decided to provide funding to the Meusy Interests through a mezzanine loan. On June 29, 2007, LEM invested $3 million in a company known as Manzanita Gate Apartments Holdings, LLC (\"Manzanita Holdings\"), an entity formed by Meusy to act as the indirect owner of the Property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   LEM's $3 million investment in Manzanita Holdings provided the Meusy Interests with capital and allowed LEM to acquire a preferred equity stake in Manzanita Holdings. Pursuant to a closing escrow agreement, Guaranty performed the duties of escrow agent and closing officer to the $3 million mezzanine loan.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   During the closing, Guaranty did not disclose the existence of C &amp; V's prior unrecorded loans to the Meusy Interests. Shortly thereafter, the Meusy Interests defaulted on all their obligations, including payments on the C &amp; V loans and the mezzanine loan provided by LEM.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   LEM commenced the instant action in July 2007. After a long and convoluted procedural history, which included the filing of an amended complaint in January of 2011,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   LEM filed a motion for summary\n   judgment against Guaranty, Voegel, Rothstein and Cacciatore. This motion asserted that Guaranty, as the escrow agent to the mezzanine loan transaction, had a duty to disclose to LEM the existence of the unrecorded C &amp; V loans to the Meusy Interests. LEM asserted that if it had been informed of the existence of the C &amp; V loans, which it characterizes as \"usurious,\" it would have deemed an investment in Manzanita Holdings too risky to pursue. Thus, LEM argued that it would not have agreed to fund Manzanita Holdings and would not have suffered the loss of its investment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   LEM also filed a motion for summary judgment against Fidelity, as principal of Guaranty. LEM argued that Fidelity is liable for LEM's losses under a theory of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior,\n   </em>\n   based upon the terms of the IAA between Fidelity and Guaranty.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On July 21, 2014, Guaranty, Voegel, and Rothstein filed a cross-motion for summary judgment against LEM. On the same day, Fidelity and Cacciatore also filed respective cross-motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court denied LEM's summary judgment motion and granted each of Appellees' summary judgment motions in an order and memorandum dated November 6, 2014. LEM filed a timely notice of appeal, raising the following issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   Did [Guaranty Appellees], the title agent for the June 29, 2007 transaction between [LEM] and other entities for the purchase of a $3 million ownership interest in a business entity owning a property known as \"Manzanita Gate,\" have a duty to disclose to [LEM]\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   the fact that [Appellees] \"stood on both sides\" of the \"Manzanita Gate\" transaction, and the existence of over $6 million in unrecorded mortgages on the Manzanita Gate property, under settled Pennsylvania tort law setting forth a duty to disclose and precluding intentional concealment of those facts, such that both [Guaranty Appellees] and their principal Fidelity are now liable for their fraud in inducing [LEM] to consummate the Manzanita Gate transaction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   En Banc Brief of Appellants, at 2-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin by noting our standard and scope of review of an order granting summary judgment:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Our scope of review is plenary, and our standard of review is the same as that applied by the trial court. Our Supreme Court has stated the applicable standard of review as follows: An appellate court may reverse the entry of a summary judgment only where it finds that the lower court erred in concluding that the matter presented no genuine issue as to any material fact and that it is clear that the moving party was entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. In making this assessment, we view the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and all doubts as to the existence of a genuine issue of material fact must be resolved against the moving party. As our inquiry involves solely questions of law, our review is\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, our responsibility as an appellate court is to determine whether the record either establishes that the material facts are undisputed or contains insufficient evidence of facts to make out a prima facie cause of action, such that there is no issue to be decided by the fact-finder. If there is evidence that would allow a fact-finder to render a verdict in favor of the non-moving party, then summary judgment should be denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Reinoso v.

Whether a duty exists is a question of law, and the determination of \"whether there has been a neglect of such duty is generally for the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    Emerich v.

The trial court further determined that nothing within the agreement could be construed to affirmatively require Appellees to disclose unrecorded loans encumbering Manzanita Gate. Thus, the trial court concluded that Guaranty had no contractual duty to disclose the unrecorded C &amp; V loans to LEM. The trial court also determined that no duty of disclosure arose in tort under the circumstances. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As an initial matter, we note that LEM refers to Guaranty as a title agent providing LEM with \"title insurance protection\" in relation to the June 29, 2007 loan transaction in which LEM invested in Manzanita Holdings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   En Banc Brief of Appellants, at 10. However, the record reveals that Guaranty played no role as a title agent in the Manzanita Holdings mezzanine loan transaction. Rather, Guaranty's role was limited to performing escrow duties as provided in the closing escrow agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Significantly, LEM has assumed that the owner's title insurance policy provided LEM with title insurance coverage. Manzanita Gate Investments, LLC, was the owner of the property during the relevant time period and was the entity to which Ticor issued the title insurance policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   No evidence has been presented to demonstrate that either Manzanita Gate Apartments Holdings, LLC, the entity in which LEM invested, or LEM itself, had been named as an insured or third-party beneficiary\n   under the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hicks v. Saboe,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1817492\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/521/380/\">\n    521 Pa. 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1817492\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/521/380/\">\n    555 A.2d 1241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1243 (1989) (\"the duty of a title insurance company runs only to its insured, not to third parties who are not party to the contract\"). LEM also admits that it was not specifically insured as a preferred equity investor.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Jay J. Eisner Deposition, 11/12/13, at 52-54. Thus, LEM was not entitled to \"title insurance protection\" under the policy, even if Guaranty were acting as a title agent in the relevant transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Guaranty, as escrow agent, was merely responsible for performing administrative duties in the transaction in which LEM invested in Manzanita Gate Holdings. Indeed, \"[the escrow agent] under an escrow agreement is generally considered to be an agent (or trustee) for both parties-a special agency whose authority must be strictly construed, and who is bound by the terms of the escrow agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Janson v.

This agreement sets forth all the obligations of [Guaranty] with respect to any and all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder and no additional obligations of [Guaranty] shall be implied.\" Closing Escrow Agreement, at 5-6. Moreover, the date-down endorsement which Guaranty was obligated to provide under the escrow agreement\n   <em>\n    indicates that only items of record were to be disclosed.\n   </em>\n   Thus, Guaranty complied with respect to the plain meaning of the escrow agreement regarding required disclosure.

First, the parties agree to the terms of the underlying contract. Thereafter,\n   <em>\n    because\n   </em>\n   they have agreed to the underlying contract, they enter into a separate agreement with the escrow agent.

Thus, LEM's decision to invest $3 million in mezzanine loan funds in the Meusy Interests, which constitutes the \"underlying contract\" in this matter, was made independently from Guaranty and the other Appellees. It is only logical that Appellees would not have made representations to LEM regarding the mezzanine loan transaction since none of the Appellees was a party to that transaction. Indeed, LEM's amended complaint supports the conclusion that the Meusy Interests were responsible for LEM's agreement to the mezzanine loan terms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Amended Complaint, 1/14/11, at \u00b6 51 (stating Meusy Interests \"approached [LEM] to make a preferred equity investment in Manzanita Gate\"). Moreover, because LEM agreed to the underlying contract without Appellees' input, it cannot be said that LEM would not have done so \"but for\" representations or omissions made by the Guaranty Appellees.\n   <em>\n    Blumenstock, supra.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Additionally, none of the Restatement tort duties that LEM relies upon could have been triggered with regard to the mezzanine loan transaction since Guaranty was not a party to the transaction. Indeed, the Restatement duties to disclose or provide complete information under Sections 529, 550, and 551 apply only in the context of a\n   <em>\n    business transaction between the parties. See\n   </em>\n   nn. 9-11,\n   <em>\n    supra.\n   </em>\n   Here, Guaranty was a party only to the escrow and thus had no duties toward LEM in the mezzanine loan transaction. In the separate escrow agreement contract, to which Guaranty was a party, the agreement itself conclusively sets forth Guaranty's duties and must be strictly construed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Closing Escrow Agreement, at 6 (\"This Agreement sets forth all the obligations of Escrow Agent with respect to any and all matters pertinent to the escrow contemplated hereunder and no additional obligations of Escrow Agent shall be implied from the terms of this Agreement or any other Agreement.\");\n   <em>\n    Janson, supra.\n   </em>\n   Moreover, LEM has admitted that Guaranty performed its duties in relation to the escrow agreement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Transcript of Jon S.

No independent basis for liability on Fidelity's part exists.

Regardless of the reason the CPL was issued, the language on the face of the CPL indicates that it does not extend coverage to LEM under the circumstances. The CPL indicates that it applies \"[w]hen the insurance of [Fidelity] is specified for [the party's] protection\" where the party is \"the lessor or purchaser of an interest in land or a lender secured by a mortgage [or other security interest.]\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Closing Protection Letter. Here, no insurance policy was underwritten by Fidelity, Guaranty was not authorized by Fidelity to act as a title agent in Reno, Nevada, and LEM did not obtain a direct interest in the property. Additionally, we note that courts that have considered similar scenarios have determined that \"the issuance of a title insurance policy is generally necessary for liability to ensue under a closing protection letter.\"\n    <em>\n     National Mortgage Warehouse, LLC v.

The holding of\n    <em>\n     Mark Properties\n    </em>\n    requires an escrow agent to disclose in instances where evidence of substantial fraud exists; it is a narrow exception to Nevada's general rule that an escrow agent's duties are limited to the instructions contained in the escrow agreement. The facts involved an escrow agent who allegedly knew of a double escrow in which two business parties breached their fiduciary duties to two other business partners. A double escrow has been defined as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n    the broker or salesman purchases a principal's property in the first escrow, and sells it to a third party at a profit in a second escrow without a full disclosure to both the principal and the third party. The escrows close at the same time and the broker or salesman thereby uses the proceeds from the sale in the second escrow to purchase his principal's property. The broker or salesman receives a commission on the sale in the first escrow and a secret profit on the closing in the second escrow.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-57\">\n    <em>\n     Alley v.

Because the facts of\n    <em>\n     Mark Properties\n    </em>\n    involved a known breach of fiduciary duty between business partners, it is factually inapposite to the instant matter, which involves two separate closings between multiple different entities.
