KEVIN BROBSON.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Appellant Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Department of Transportation (DOT), appeals by permission from an interlocutory order of the Court of Common Pleas for the 26th Judicial District, Montour County Branch (trial court). The trial court denied DOT's motion for summary judgment, which was predicated on sovereign immunity. For the reasons set forth below, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On June 28, 1998, at approximately 3:00 a.m., Appellee John Manning (Manning) was driving his vehicle in the eastbound lane of Route 642 in West Hemlock Township, Montour County. (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 9a.) According to Manning, three deer jumped out onto the roadway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39a-40a.) In order to avoid hitting the deer, Manning initially applied his brakes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39a-40a.) When he realized, however, he would not be able to stop\n   his vehicle before hitting the deer, he swerved his vehicle off of the roadway. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39a-40a, 44a-45a.) After leaving the roadway, Manning's vehicle struck a drainage culvert, became airborne, and struck a tree. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9a, 39a-40a, 44a-45a.) Manning was ejected from his vehicle and sustained severe injuries. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9a, 40a, 45a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On June 28, 2000, Manning filed a complaint in the trial court against DOT and West Hemlock Township.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7a-14a.) In his complaint, Manning asserted that DOT was responsible for the maintenance of Route 642 in and around the drainage culvert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12a.) Manning further asserted that DOT was negligent by: (1) failing to maintain and control Route 642, including the drainage culvert, in a safe condition for ordinary travel; (2) failing to maintain the drainage culvert in a safe and reasonable manner; (3) failing to erect barriers, guards, reflectors, or similar devices for the protection of motorists in and around the area of the drainage culvert; (4) failing to post signs in the immediate area notifying motorists of the dangerous condition caused by the drainage culvert; and (5) failing to warn motorists of the dangerous condition caused by the drainage culvert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12a-13a.) DOT filed an answer and new matter, specifically denying Manning's allegations of negligence and asserting sovereign immunity as an affirmative defense. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 15a-23a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the parties engaged in discovery. Manning retained the services of a professional engineer, Bernard M. Telatovich, P.E., who prepared a report regarding the relationship between the accident and the condition and design of Route 642. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 53a-73a.) The report concluded that the roadside area traversed by Manning's vehicle and the concrete/stone headwall of the drainage culvert that Manning's vehicle struck \"posed hazards to any vehicle\n   <em>\n    leaving the roadway.\n   </em>\n   \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 60a (emphasis added).) The report also concluded that the side slope of the roadway, which was not considered traversable, and the concrete/stone headwall of the drainage culvert should not have been located within the \"clear zone.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The report further concluded that had the eastbound lane of the roadway been protected by a guiderail similar to the westbound lane, Manning's vehicle would not have encountered the hazardous slope or struck the hazardous concrete/stone headwall of the drainage culvert. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the conclusion of the discovery process, DOT moved for summary judgment. DOT alleged, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   10. [Manning's] Complaint alleges that on June 28, 1998[,] at approximately 3:00 a.m., [Manning] left the roadway and struck a drainage area on the south side of State Route 642[,] which caused [Manning's] automobile to strike a tree and eject [Manning] from the automobile.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   11.

[Manning] has failed to properly plead and develop facts through discovery to establish that any dangerous condition of the travel portion of State Route 642 caused [Manning] to leave the roadway; on the contrary, [Manning] has specifically plead [sic] that deer caused [him] to leave the roadway. Depo. John Manning 31:18-32:6 (June 23, 2004).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30a, 32a.) In his response to the motion, Manning admitted the principal components of DOT's allegations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   By order dated August 24, 2015, the trial court denied DOT's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Original Record (O.R.) at 50.) DOT sought permission from this Court to appeal the trial court's interlocutory order pursuant to 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 702(b). (R.R. 86a-93a.) We granted DOT permission to appeal to consider the following issue: \"Is [DOT] immune from a claim that it was negligent for arguably dangerous conditions of real estate located off the area of a roadway intended for normal travel.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 8522(b)(4) of the Judicial Code, 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(b)(4).\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 94a-95a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   DOT argues that Manning's claims do not fall within the \"real estate\" exception to sovereign immunity, because Manning's injuries were caused when he swerved his vehicle off of the roadway into an area not intended for vehicular traffic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response, Manning argues that his claims do fall within the \"real estate\" exception to sovereign immunity, because the definition of \"highway\" contained in 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1991 does not restrict the term to only the paved portion of the road. Manning maintains that, if the legislature intended to restrict the \"real estate\" exception to the paved portion of the road, the legislature could have used the more restrictive term \"roadway\" rather than the more expansive term \"highway.\" Manning further argues that the \"real estate\" exception should also apply because his injuries were caused by Commonwealth realty and DOT's affirmative act of placing and maintaining the drainage culvert in the \"clear zone\" of the highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Commonwealth agencies are generally immune from civil suit for tort liabilities unless the General Assembly waives sovereign immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 2310 ; and 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8521. Section 8522(a) of the Judicial Code (Code), 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8522(a), which is often referred to as the \"Sovereign Immunity Act,\" authorizes the imposition of liability against Commonwealth agencies for damages arising out of a negligent act where the damages would be recoverable under the common law or a statute creating a cause of action if the injury were caused by a person to whom the defense of sovereign immunity is not available. To meet the threshold requirement under Section 8522(a) of the Code, a plaintiff must prove the requisite elements of negligence: (1) the defendant's duty or obligation recognized by law; (2) a breach of that duty; (3) a causal connection between the defendant's conduct and the resulting injury; and (4) actual damages.\n   <em>\n    Talarico v.
