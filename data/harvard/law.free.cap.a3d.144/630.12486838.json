Ira Chase, Petitioner, presents the following questions for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1. Does reasonable suspicion that an individual is engaged in drug activity, by itself, constitute reasonable suspicion that the individual is armed and dangerous?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2. Under this Court's case law recognizing that a display of force by the police, such as placing a suspect in handcuffs, constitutes an arrest requiring probable cause absent reasonable suspicion that the suspect is armed and dangerous, was Petitioner under arrest when he and the co-occupant of Petitioner's Jeep Cherokee were removed from the Jeep and placed in handcuffs, where the police had reasonable suspicion that the two men were engaged in drug activity in the Jeep but lacked reasonable suspicion that they were armed and dangerous?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3. Assuming,\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   , that the police had reasonable suspicion to believe that Petitioner and his co-occupant were\n   armed and dangerous when they were removed from the Jeep and handcuffed, was that reasonable suspicion dispelled when the officers patted them down and found no weapons, thereby rendering their continued detention and questioning by the officers while awaiting the arrival of a drug sniffing dog an arrest, and not a mere detention, that was not supported by probable cause?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In 2013, Chase was indicted in the Circuit Court for Baltimore County, Maryland for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, manufacturing cocaine, possession of cocaine and possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana. He moved to suppress various pieces of evidence seized by Baltimore County police officers from his person, that being a motel key, and from the motel itself, to include narcotics and narcotics paraphernalia; he alleged that his detention in handcuffs while a car that he had been driving was searched constituted an unlawful arrest and the attendant seizure of the motel key and discovery of physical evidence in the\n   motel room were the fruits of that arrest. Judge Patrick Cavanaugh of the Circuit Court for Baltimore County denied Chase's motion to suppress, and Chase, thereafter, entered a conditional guilty plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of possession of cocaine with\n   intent to distribute. Judge Cavanaugh, in denying the motion to suppress, determined:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   Okay. It's a very interesting case. I'm familiar with all the cases you've handed up, Mr. Tompsett. The\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   case is of particular interest, it's one of Judge Moylan's shorter opinions. The man was stopped or he wasn't stopped, he's already parked under the policeman's observation when the other car pulls in. They're backed in next to each other, it's a high crime area. I'm familiar with the area. I don't know how many cases I've had from that side of town involving drugs. They're in the parking lot of the hotel, nobody gets out of the car, goes into a hotel, don't do anything except meet each other at a car. The furtive acts give me some concern because of the officer's safety. They see this going on inside the vehicle as they're approaching. The inconsistent stories, you know, one's watching the ballgame, the other one is going to Maryland Live Casino. I think that's what really triggered the call for the K-9 to come out and it was fairly quick after they were stopped. I believe the K-9 arrived within ten minutes of the police approaching the vehicle to begin with. I think it is a classic Terry case, (inaudible) to the high crime in the area, drugs, we know that guns are involved with drugs. So I can understand the concern for officers' safety. The dog alerts on the side of the vehicle that Mr. DeLillo just got out of and he's the one who later on states, you know, I came to buy an eight ball to get, got fourteen grams, got more than he came for. Certainly, got more than he came for when he got the cuffs on him. I believe I don't have any choice but to deny your Motion, Mr. Cardin. I think it's a good stop, it's a good search. I was concerned about the cuffs going on when they went on and the comments that were made by the two gentlemen were after they were read Miranda. They were Mirandized right away. I know you disagree with me, Mr. Davis, you've been sitting there shaking your head sideways since you came in the door today. The Motion to Suppress is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Chase appealed to the Court of Special Appeals, which, in a reported opinion,\n   <em>\n    Chase v.

So with the Defendant in his vehicle, as well as the Lexus pulling in and the driver of the Lexus getting out of his vehicle into the Defendant's vehicle, as well as the area that they're in, it's a known high drug area, they did not utilize any services of the Days Inn, which is where they were parked. We believed that there was\n   illegal drug activity taking place, or criminal activity at that matter.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detective Melnyk further related that after waiting a short period of time to see if any further activity occurred, he and Detective Young approached the Jeep, identified themselves as police officers and removed its occupants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: We waited a brief period to, to see if there was going to be any activity farther and there wasn't. At that point, we drove our vehicle, identified ourself as police, approached the vehicle and detained both occupants inside the white Jeep Cherokee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   STATE: And why did you detain those two subjects?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: Based on the reasonable suspicion that they were involved in illegal activity based on the totality of the circumstances, the location, the lack of activity involving the hotel room and the way they were parked, as well as the mannerisms that, from the driver entering the Grand Cherokee from the Lexus.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On cross-examination, Detective Melnyk testified in more detail about the furtive movements of the driver in reaching under his seat and putting his hand in his pocket which precipitated the removal of the driver, who turned out to be Chase, and his companion from the Jeep Cherokee and handcuffing them:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   MR.

CARDIN: All right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: The reason we take them out of the vehicle, Your Honor, is to prevent them from accessing any sort of weapons that could harm us. ... They were, they were asked to step from the vehicle at which point we placed them in handcuffs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   MR.

The passenger immediately put his hands in his pocket. At that point, for the safety of myself and Detective Young, they were requested to exit the vehicle and we put them in handcuffs just to make sure they didn't have any weapons and detaining them. They were not free to leave. The, the reason for the handcuffs were solely based on the safety of everybody involved, based on the furtive movements that we observed inside the vehicle as we were approaching the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Detective Melnyk continued his testimony, recounting the differing stories given by Chase and the other man and the detectives' decision to request that a K-9 unit come to the location:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   STATE: And starting with the individual who got out of his Lexus and into Mr. Chase's car, this Defendant's car, what,\n   if anything, did he tell you about what was going on there?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: He advised that he was meeting Phil and that him and Phil were going to a hotel room to watch the Oriole game.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   STATE: And did you speak to Mr. Chase?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   STATE: And what did Mr. Chase advise?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: Mr. Chase advised that he was going to meet his cousin and attend the Maryland Live Casino.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   STATE: Can you explain to the Court Mr. Chase's demeanor while you were speaking with him?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: He was, he was very irate with the police presence. He claimed that he had done nothing\n   wrong and I explained to him our observations which caused us to maintain the detention of the Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   STATE: So with the maintained detention and now these two different stories, what, if anything, did you do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: Based on reasonable suspicion, I notified via my police radio dispatch to start a K-9 to our location to further the investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Officer Bernardo Tubaya of the Baltimore City Police K-9 Unit also testified. He recounted that he was dispatched to the motel parking lot at 6:52 pm and arrived approximately eight minutes later. He also related that the police dog alerted to the presence of narcotics during the \"sniff\" of the Jeep Cherokee:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   STATE: And what type of response, if any, did your dog give for [the Jeep Cherokee]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   OFFICER TUBAYA: When he scanned the vehicle, he gave me indicators and he alerted to the passenger side door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   STATE: Okay and how does your dog alert?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   OFFICER TUBAYA: He, his breathing pattern changes, he stops, he looks at the door and he gives me a sit alert, in which he sits and looks at the door.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   STATE: Okay and he did all those things in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   OFFICER TUBAYA: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Detective Melnyk related that he subsequently performed a search incident to arrest, after the police dog had alerted, which produced a motel room key:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   STATE: And when the K-9 officer arrived, did you explain to him what was going on at the scene?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: I did. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   STATE: And did he use his dog?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: He did use his dog.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   STATE: And did his dog alert on either one of the vehicles?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: His dog alerted on the Jeep Cherokee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   STATE: And the Jeep Cherokee belonged to which Defendant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: Defendant Chase.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   STATE: Okay. When the dog alerted, what, if anything, did you and your partner do?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: We initially questioned the Defendant for illegal substances within his vehicle. At that point, he began to ignore our, our requests and stop talking to us, which at that point, it became an arrest.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   STATE: And did you search the Defendant incident to that arrest?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: I did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   STATE: And what, if anything, did you find?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   DETECTIVE MELNYK: We found some currency as well as a room key for the Days Inn.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Detective Melnyk related that he and Detective Young then applied for and obtained a search warrant for the room associated with the key found during the search of Chase's person; the subsequent search of the room uncovered 138 grams of cocaine and narcotics paraphernalia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Chase contends that he was subject to an unlawful arrest when he had been removed from the Jeep and handcuffed without the officers having a reasonable suspicion that he possessed a weapon, citing a footnote in\n   <em>\n    Dashiell v.

Chase asserts that Detective Melnyk offered no particularized facts in his testimony to support a belief that he was armed and dangerous and, therefore, lacked the reasonable suspicion necessary to lawfully detain him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State argues, conversely, the totality of the circumstances supported the officers' actions, as Detectives Melnyk and Young were patrolling an area known for illegal narcotic activity, observed Chase and his associate engaging in behavior indicative of illegal drug activity and observed movements by Chase and his companion that raised concern regarding the possibility that the individuals were armed, thereby compromising the safety of the officers.

Williamson had been seen leaving the house and was 20 to 30 feet away when he was detained by the police, placed in handcuffs\n   and brought back to the house.

The justification for the detention and return of Williamson to the house was his proximity to the house and concern for officer safety, for, as we stated, \"courts ... have evaluated off-premises detentions of occupants based upon their proximity to the location to be searched taking into consideration the law enforcement interests that were articulated to justify the detention.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852439\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/489/\">\n    398 Md. at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3852439\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/398/489/\">\n    921 A.2d at 234\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

After a confidential informant had provided information to police officers, they then observed Longshore meeting with people in a mall parking lot for several minutes. Longshore was later stopped by police as he was driving out of the mall.

Detectives Melnyk and Young had observed behavior by Chase and his companion in the Jeep consistent with the hiding of illegal drugs as well as\n   \"furtive\" movements that suggested weapons could have been secreted in the vehicle. We, again, emphasize concern for officer safety when weapons may be present may overcome concern about a limited\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   intrusion, such as asking Chase to get out of the Jeep.\n   Chase, however, also argues that even were there to have been reasonable suspicion to support his being asked by the officers to get out of the Jeep, his having been placed in handcuffs converted his detention from an investigatory stop into an arrest that required probable cause. Further, Chase asserts that his continued restraint in handcuffs amounted to an arrest after an unfruitful frisk of his person was completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   The State argues, conversely, that the use of handcuffs did not elevate Chase's detention to an arrest, because the officers's concern for safety had not dissipated because the Jeep had not been searched for weapons.

David S. then walked behind a building, reemerged displaying an object to another person, which David S. then tucked into his waistband; the officer believed the object to be a gun. The officer then chased David S., forced him to the ground, and handcuffed David S; cocaine was seized from David S.'s waistband.\n   After David S. was convicted, and the Court of Special Appeals had affirmed, we determined that the officer, based on the conduct he observed, had reasonable suspicion to believe that criminal activity was afoot and that David S. had a gun in his waistband. We opined that the use of handcuffs did not automatically elevate the investigatory\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop of David S. into an arrest as the officer possessed a reasonable belief that a threat to his safety existed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   One of our sister state courts also has had the opportunity to address the use of handcuffs during a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   stop.

The nature of Wells' suspected crime, trafficking narcotics, further justified Cronin's action. In Cronin's past experience as a member of the Lincoln/Lancaster County drug task force, he knew that narcotics users and traffickers often carry weapons. ... Based on Wells' furtive movements and his apparent attempt to conceal something, Cronin had an immediate need for action. It does not appear that Cronin could have made the stop and, at the same time, ensured his safety in a less threatening manner.
