Lodmell. On appeal, the defendant asserts that the trial court improperly: (1) applied General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to an agreement to arbitrate contained within a prenuptial agreement between the parties and limited arbitration to the sale of a jointly owned residential property (residence); (2) denied the defendant's request for leave to file an amended cross complaint to assert certain claims against the plaintiff in the dissolution action; and (3) confirmed the arbitration awards where the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority and the scope of the submission.

Specifically, the defendant asserts that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies only to an agreement to arbitrate that has been entered into after an action for dissolution has been filed. The defendant further claims that, even if \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to agreements to arbitrate contained in prenuptial agreements, the trial court improperly contravened the terms of the prenuptial agreement in the present case by limiting the scope of the arbitration. In response, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court properly applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to the agreement to arbitrate in the prenuptial agreement. The plaintiff further asserts that the trial court properly found, pursuant to \u00a7 46b-66 (c), that it would not be \" 'fair and equitable under the circumstances' \" to require the parties to arbitrate claims for damages that were not allowed by the prenuptial agreement.

We disagree. There is nothing in the plain language of the statute that indicates that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies only to an agreement to arbitrate that is entered into after an action for dissolution has been filed. To the contrary, the broad language of \u00a7 46b-66 (c)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   includes \"any agreement to arbitrate in an action for dissolution....\" Agreements to arbitrate contained in prenuptial agreements, like the agreement to arbitrate in the present case, are by definition agreements to arbitrate issues that would only arise once the parties are involved \"in an action for dissolution....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   If the legislature intended to exclude agreements to arbitrate that are contained within prenuptial agreements, it could have expressly done so. \"[I]t is a well settled principle of statutory construction that the legislature knows how to convey its intent expressly ... or to use broader or limiting terms when it chooses to do so.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Marchesi v.

Indeed, the legislature did use limiting language elsewhere in \u00a7 46b-66 (c), when it provided that \"such agreement and an arbitration pursuant to such agreement shall not include issues related to child support, visitation and custody.\" The use of such limiting language in other portions of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) is further indication that if the legislature had intended to exclude agreements to arbitrate contained in prenuptial agreements it could have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Furthermore, reading \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in relationship to the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part lends additional support to our understanding that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) covers all agreements to arbitrate controversies between parties to a marriage, regardless of when the parties entered into that agreement. \"In seeking to determine [the] meaning [of a statute, \u00a7 1-2z ] directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    People for Ethical Treatment of Animals, Inc. v.

Therefore, before chapter 909 can apply to an agreement to arbitrate between parties to a marriage, it must meet the requirements set forth in \u00a7 46b-66 (c). In turn, chapter 909 also explains what agreements to arbitrate are governed by its provisions. Specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 52-408 provides in relevant part: \"[A]n agreement in writing between two or more persons to submit to arbitration any controversy existing between them at the time of the agreement to submit, or an agreement in writing between the parties to a marriage to submit to arbitration any controversy between them with respect to the dissolution of their marriage, except issues related to child support, visitation and custody, shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\" In reading these two statutes together, \"[w]e are ... guided by the principle that the legislature is always presumed to have created a harmonious and consistent body of law.... [T]his tenet of statutory\n   construction ... requires us to read statutes together when they relate to the same subject matter.... Accordingly, [i]n determining the meaning of a statute ... we look not only at the provision at issue, but also to the broader statutory scheme to ensure the coherency of our construction.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Styslinger v. Brewster\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Park, LLC,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484925\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/257/#p317\">\n    321 Conn. 312\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 317,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12484925\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/138/257/#p317\">\n    138 A.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Accordingly, because these two statutes are designed to relate to the same subject matter, we read them to operate harmoniously. Indeed, it is important to note that the relevant provisions within \u00a7\u00a7 46b-66 (c) and 52-408 were both adopted by the legislature in 2005. See Public Acts 2005, No. 05-258, \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 2. Therefore, we conclude that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) explains that if a court finds an agreement to arbitrate fair and equitable, it will be subject to the provisions of chapter 909. In turn, \u00a7 52-408 includes agreements to arbitrate between parties to a marriage in those agreements to arbitrate that are governed by chapter 909, subject to the court's finding that the agreement to arbitrate is fair and equitable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reject the interpretation proposed by the defendant because it leads to absurd and unworkable results. \"It is axiomatic that [w]e must interpret the statute so that it does not lead to absurd or unworkable results.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Wilkins v.

Such a result is contrary to the public policy of this state regarding prenuptial agreements, which has been previously recognized by this court. \"[R]ecent statistics on divorce have forced people to deal with the reality that many marriages do not last a lifetime. As desirable as it may seem for couples to embark upon marriage in a state of optimism and hope, the reality is that many marriages end in divorce. There is a growing trend toward serial marriage; more people expect to have more than one spouse during their lifetime.... [B]oth the realities of our society and policy reasons favor judicial recognition of prenuptial agreements. Rather than inducing divorce, such agreements simply acknowledge its ordinariness. With divorce as likely an outcome of marriage as permanence, we see no logical or compelling reason why public policy should not allow two mature adults to handle their own financial affairs.... The reasoning that once found them contrary to public policy\n   has no place in today's matrimonial law.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bedrick v.

In light of this state's policy, which favors recognizing prenuptial agreements, it would not be reasonable to conclude that the legislature would have intended to exclude parties who enter into agreements to arbitrate contained within prenuptial agreements from the protections afforded by \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Moreover, the position advocated by the defendant and the concurring and dissenting opinion would allow parties that enter into an agreement to arbitrate one day prior to the filing of an action for dissolution of marriage to be subject to a different standard for enforcement of that agreement-namely, unconscionability and contractual defenses-while parties who enter into the same agreement one day after an action for dissolution has been filed receive the greater protections afforded by the standard of \"fair and equitable\" under \u00a7 46b-66 (c). It is not reasonable to think that the legislature intended to afford parties who agree to arbitrate controversies related to dissolution different protections based solely on when they entered into that agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Furthermore, the defendant's interpretation of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) is also inconsistent with prior judicial interpretations of the statute.

[The prenuptial agreement] ... specifically addresses arbitration. The only matter in dispute for arbitration is the sale of the [residence] ... and what procedures are to be followed, and what proceeds each party is entitled to from a sale.\" On the basis of this determination, the trial court submitted only that one issue to the arbitrator. Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a motion for articulation. In her motion for articulation, the plaintiff asked the following: \"Having found in pertinent part that: 'the only issue in dispute for arbitration is the sale of the [residence]' ... did the [trial] court conclude\n   based on its interpretation and construction of [the prenuptial] agreement ... that the relief 'fixed,' 'limited,' and agreed upon between these parties did not include damages?\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.) In framing this question, the plaintiff then quoted the following language from the prenuptial agreement: \"Whereas, the parties, to promote marital tranquility, desire to fix, limit, and determine by this [a]greement the interest, rights, and claims that may accrue to each of them in the property and estate of the other by reason of their marriage or in the event of marital difficulties herein referred to, and to accept the provisions of this [a]greement in lieu and in full discharge, settlement, and satisfaction, of any and all interests, rights, and claims that otherwise each might or could have under the law, in and to the property and estate of the other, both before and after the other's death....\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) In response to the plaintiff's question, the trial court answered as follows: \"Granted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In doing so, the trial court followed the requirements of \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Specifically, the trial court engaged in a thorough inquiry into the agreement of the parties. Indeed, in its memorandum of decision, the trial court explained that \"[t]he parties ... have agreed that the [prenuptial] agreement between them is in full force and effect.\" The trial court further explained that, on the basis of the prenuptial agreement, specifically the provision related to the sale of joint assets and the agreement to arbitrate, it was appropriate to submit the matter of the sale of the residence to the arbitrator. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court implicitly determined, in accordance with \u00a7 46b-66 (c), that applying the agreement to arbitrate to the sale of the residence was fair and equitable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   As the trial court explained in response to the plaintiff's motion for articulation, it had determined, after a thorough inquiry of the parties' agreement to arbitrate, that claims for damages arising out of the marriage were barred under the prenuptial agreement. We agree with the trial court's interpretation of the prenuptial agreement and, therefore, conclude that the trial court properly refused to submit any claims for damages to the arbitrator. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court properly applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to the facts of present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant next claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying his request for leave to file an amended answer and cross complaint. Specifically, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly denied his request for leave to file an amended cross complaint\n   in which he asserted eight claims that were not submitted to the arbitrator. In response, the plaintiff asserts that the trial court properly denied the defendant's motion for leave to file an amended answer and cross complaint. The plaintiff claims that the trial court properly precluded the defendant's request to raise claims for damages based on the law of the case because the trial court had previously determined that the prenuptial agreement barred claims for damages. The plaintiff further asserts that the trial court properly denied the defendant's request to amend because it was untimely and any amendment at that point would have been prejudicial to the plaintiff. We agree with the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On April 3, 2014, the defendant filed a request for leave to file an amended answer and cross complaint. The defendant asserted eight claims that he was not able to raise in the arbitration proceeding because they were not contained within the arbitration order entered by the trial court. In his proposed amended cross complaint,\n   the defendant sought to assert the following claims: (1) breach of contract; (2) civil theft; (3) conversion; (4) violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-250 et seq., which governs computer crimes; (5) breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing; (6) unjust enrichment; (7) intentional infliction of emotional distress; and (8) negligent infliction of emotional distress. The defendant sought compensatory damages; treble damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-564 ; double damages under General Statutes \u00a7 47a-46 ; treble damages under General Statutes \u00a7 52-570b (c) ; punitive damages; indemnification; and attorney's fees. The defendant also demanded a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The plaintiff objected to the defendant's request, claiming that it was barred by the trial court's memorandum of decision dated September 2, 2011, and the arbitration submission contained therein. The plaintiff also asserted that the trial court's articulation, in which the trial court clarified that it had previously determined that the prenuptial agreement barred any claims for damages related to the dissolution proceeding, should be determinative of any inquiry.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The trial court agreed with the plaintiff and, accordingly, denied the defendant's request for leave to file an amended answer and complaint. In doing so, the trial court explained that the \"ruling of September 2, 2011, as clarified [in the articulation of] November 16, 2011, is the law of the case.\" The trial court further explained that \"[i]nterspousal tort and contract claims\" are \"more appropriately pursued in a separate civil action.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We begin by setting forth the standard of review applicable to the defendant's claim. \"Our standard of review ... is well settled. While our courts have been liberal in permitting amendments ... this liberality has limitations. Amendments should be made seasonably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Factors to be considered in passing on a motion to amend are the length of the delay, fairness to the opposing parties and the negligence, if any, of the party offering the amendment.... The motion to amend is addressed to the trial court's discretion which may be exercised to restrain the amendment of pleadings so far as necessary to prevent unreasonable delay of the trial.... Whether to allow an amendment is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court. This court will not disturb a trial court's ruling on a proposed amendment unless there has been a clear abuse of that discretion.... It is [the] burden [of the party proposing the amendment] to demonstrate that the trial court clearly abused its discretion.... That an amendment would confuse the issues in the case\n   also supports a trial court's decision to deny permission to amend a complaint or special defense.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Travelers Casualty &amp; Surety Co. of America v.

First, the defendant's motion was filed approximately two and one-half years after the trial court had determined the issue to submit to the arbitrator, and more than one and one-half years after the parties' arbitration hearing. Second, the defendant's motion was filed approximately three months before the parties' dissolution trial. The defendant's cross complaint and the related defenses would have raised many complex issues, which would have required motions and discovery. Therefore, granting the defendant's request to amend at such a late stage would have significantly delayed the trial and prejudiced the plaintiff. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the defendant's request\n   to amend. See\n   <em>\n    Rizzuto v.

After considering the purposes of res judicata, we concluded that the doctrine should not require parties to bring tort actions based on claims that arise during a marriage in the dissolution proceeding and that 'because there are significant differences between a tort action and a dissolution action, the maintenance of a separate tort action will not subject the courts and the defendant to the type of piecemeal litigation that the doctrine was intended to prevent.' ...

Therefore, in the present case, the submission includes the prenuptial agreement and the trial court's memorandum of decision, which determined that \"[t]he only matter in dispute for arbitration is the sale of the [residence] ... and what procedures are to be followed, and what proceeds each party is entitled to from a sale.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The defendant first claims that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by awarding the plaintiff certain maintenance expenses and other costs associated with the residence from July, 2012 through November, 2012, plus interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of this claim. The parties were initially scheduled to proceed to arbitration on August 27, 2012. On June 25, 2012, the defendant filed a motion to suspend deadlines in the arbitration proceeding so that he could obtain new counsel. On June 29, 2012, the defendant's counsel filed a motion to withdraw as counsel and requested a four week continuance of all deadlines. On July 2, 2012, the arbitrator granted the defendant's request for counsel to withdraw and for a continuance pursuant to the following interim order: \"By granting the [defendant's] continuance, the [plaintiff] is further burdened by having to continue to incur [the] costs of maintaining the [residence]. Pursuant to the [prenuptial] [a]greement ... the parties agreed that\n   they would act in good faith and would deal '\n   <em>\n    fairly\n   </em>\n   toward the other pursuant to this agreement.' ... In order to ensure fairness to both parties with regard to the present dispute, which deals primarily with the sale of the [residence], the [defendant] shall take over the costs of maintaining the [residence] by paying the mortgage, [homeowners] insurance, real estate taxes, and external grounds maintenance.... [T]he [defendant] shall bear the costs of the maintenance of the [residence] as stated ... until either [residence] is sold or the arbitration hearing is completed, whichever occurs first.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis in original; footnote omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In August, 2012, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel, which the arbitrator granted. Specifically, the arbitrator ordered the defendant to provide \"full reimbursement\" to the plaintiff for the costs incurred in maintaining the residence since July 2, 2012. At the time of the arbitration hearing in October, 2012, the residence had not yet been sold. In November, 2012, the arbitrator issued the partial arbitration award, which confirmed her interim order and required the defendant to pay the\n   expenses for the residence from July, 2012 through October, 2012. In addition, the partial arbitration award ordered the defendant to pay $9649.02 in maintenance and costs for November, 2012. The partial arbitration award also ordered the defendant to pay statutory interest of 10 percent per annum on these sums beginning on the date of its issuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In her motion to compel, the plaintiff also sought attorney's fees pursuant to the prenuptial agreement. As grounds for the attorney's fees, the plaintiff asserted that the defendant had failed to comply with the partial arbitration award, requiring the plaintiff to file the motion to confirm. The arbitrator granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney's fees in the final arbitration award, requiring the defendant to pay $8403.75 plus interest of 10 percent per annum from the date of its issuance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The defendant asserts that the arbitrator acted beyond the scope of her authority in requiring the defendant to contribute to the maintenance of the residence from June, 2012 through November, 2012, and by awarding the plaintiff interest and attorney's fees. We disagree. As the arbitrator recognized, the prenuptial agreement provided that the parties would act in good faith and would deal \"\n   <em>\n    fairly\n   </em>\n   toward the other pursuant to this agreement.\" (Emphasis added.) The arbitrator interpreted this provision in the submission to authorize payment of expenses incurred by the plaintiff related to the residence caused by the delay of the arbitration hearing, which was requested by the defendant. As we have explained previously herein, \"[w]here the submission does not otherwise state, the [arbitrator is] empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the [arbitrator] was erroneous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Masters v.

Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by ordering the defendant to pay expenses relating to the maintenance of the residence for the period of time that the arbitration hearing was delayed at the defendant's request.\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The defendant also claims that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by awarding the plaintiff $45,000, which represents $3000 per month for the common household expenses for the fifteen months prior to the notice of separation, in the final arbitration award because \"the [defendant] had not contributed to the common household expenses pursuant to the [prenuptial] [a]greement.\" The prenuptial agreement provided that the parties were \"to contribute in mutually agreeable amounts\" to inter alia, the mortgage, property taxes, insurance and maintenance expenses of the residence. Although the defendant asserts that there was no such mutual agreement and that the plaintiff was solely responsible for all expenses associated with the residence, the defendant has not pointed to any evidence to call the arbitrator's conclusion to the contrary into question. The defendant also claims that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority in the final arbitration award because she required the defendant to pay the plaintiff $66,000 plus interest, representing $5500 per month for the twelve month period following the notice of separation. The defendant asserts that this portion of the final arbitration award is clearly erroneous, because he \"had already paid his [post separation] notice obligations,\" and falls outside the scope of the submission, because it does not concern\n   either the sale of, or proceeds from, the residence. We disagree with these claims of the defendant. First, as we have explained previously in this opinion, \"the [arbitrator is] empowered to decide factual and legal questions and an award cannot be vacated on the grounds that the construction placed upon the facts or the interpretation of the agreement by the arbitrators was erroneous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Masters v.

Second, we also conclude that the issue of whether the defendant satisfied his obligations to pay expenses on the residence is within the submission because it relates to \"what proceeds each party is entitled to from a sale.\" Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by ordering the defendant to pay expenses associated with the residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The defendant further claims that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by entering orders in the final arbitration award pertaining to the return of certain items of personal property to the defendant that were located at the residence and in the possession of the plaintiff. Specifically, the arbitrator proscribed certain times and terms for the return of the defendant's property. The defendant asserts that these limitations exceeded the scope of the arbitrator's authority because the prenuptial agreement provides that the parties have \" 'the sole and exclusive right at all times to manage and control [their] [s]eparate [p]roperty' \" and no provision of the submission gave the arbitrator the authority to place restrictions on the defendant's personal property. We disagree with the defendant's claim. The submission to the arbitrator clearly authorized the arbitrator to decide \"what procedures are to be followed\" for the sale of the residence. It is reasonable that removal and return of the defendant's personal\n   property from the residence is an important aspect of the procedures by which the sale will occur because the defendant's personal property would need to be removed prior to any sale. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the arbitrator exceeded the scope of her authority by addressing\n   the return of the defendant's personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court properly concluded that the arbitrator did not exceed the scope of her authority.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In this opinion ROGERS, C.J., and PALMER, McDONALD and VERTEFEUILLE, Js., concurred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   ZARELLA, J., with whom ROBINSON, J., joins, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   I join parts II and III of the majority opinion.

In response to the defendant's motions to stay judicial proceedings and to compel arbitration, and the motion in limine, pendente lite, for a \" 'thorough inquiry' \" of the arbitration agreement under \u00a7 46b-66 (c) filed by the plaintiff, Joan LaFrance, the trial court issued a memorandum of decision on September 2, 2011. In that memorandum of decision, the court observed that the dispute between the plaintiff and the defendant concerned what should be submitted to arbitration. The court stated: \"The\n   <em>\n    contract law\n   </em>\n   applies to agreements to arbitrate. In the event the parties cannot agree as to the issues to be submitted to the arbitrator, then the court is to make that determination.\" (Emphasis added.) Nowhere in this one page memorandum of decision does the court cite to \u00a7 46b-66 (c), conduct a \"thorough inquiry\" of the agreement, mention the words \"fair and equitable,\" or explain why it would be unfair or inequitable to arbitrate certain issues. Instead, applying contract law, the court concluded that, pursuant to the premarital agreement, only one matter was in dispute for arbitration, namely, the sale of the marital home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Further evidence that the trial court's memorandum of decision was based on its interpretation of the premarital agreement, rather than the application of\n   \u00a7 46b-66 (c), is the court's affirmative response to the plaintiff's motion for articulation, which asked: \"Having found in [relevant] part that ... the only issue in dispute for arbitration is the sale of the joint asset ... did the court conclude,\n   <em>\n    based on its interpretation and construction of this premarital agreement\n   </em>\n   ... that the relief fixed, limited, and agreed [on] between these parties did not include damages?\" (Citation omitted; emphasis altered; internal quotation marks omitted.) Then, in June, 2012, the defendant filed a motion for an order regarding arbitrability, which, in essence, sought to revisit the trial court's September 2, 2011 determination regarding arbitrability. Counsel for the defendant specifically argued, in light of a then recent decision from this court,\n   <em>\n    New Britain v. AFSCME, Council 4, Local 1186,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=304%20Conn.%20639\">\n    304 Conn. 639\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20143\">\n    43 A.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012), that the arbitrator, and not the court, should determine the issue of arbitrability. During oral argument on that motion, neither party made reference to \u00a7 46b-66 (c) or argued that the court should determine whether it is fair and equitable to arbitrate the defendant's additional claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   In an August 8, 2012 memorandum of decision, in which the court denied the defendant's motion for an order regarding arbitrability, the court relied on\n   <em>\n    New Britain v. AFSCME, Council 4, Local 1186,\n   </em>\n   supra, at 647-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20143\">\n    43 A.3d 143\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , reasoning that \"[i]t is well established that, absent the parties' contrary intent, it\n   is the court that has the primary authority to determine whether a particular dispute is arbitrable, not the arbitrators.... [W]hen deciding whether a party has agreed that an arbitrator should have the sole authority to decide arbitrability, we must not assume that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability unless there is clea[r] and unmistakabl[e] evidence that they did so.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The court, yet again, made no reference to \u00a7 46b-66 (c) or the \"fair and equitable\" standard. Thus, I conclude that the trial court never applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to the parties agreement to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Generally, because our review is limited to matters in the record, we will not address issues not decided by the trial court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Shelton v.

Because the applicability of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) raises a question of law, it would not be improper to consider that issue in the present case. Nevertheless, we need not consider the defendant's claim that the statute does not apply because, as I have noted, the trial court did not apply \u00a7 46b-66 (c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Although I need not consider whether \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to arbitration clauses contained in premarital agreements, I do so in response to the majority opinion. The applicability of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) raises a question of statutory interpretation over which this court's review\n   is plenary. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Smith,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20338\">\n    317 Conn. 338\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 346,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=118%20A.3d%2049\">\n    118 A.3d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z provides in relevant part that, when interpreting statutes, we shall first consider \"the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes....\" Extratextual evidence of legislative intent is considered only if, after attention has been given to the statute's text and relationship with other statutes, we determine that the statute in question is ambiguous or that a literal interpretation would lead to absurd or unworkable results. See General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z.\n   Section 46b-66(c) provides: \"The provisions of chapter 909 [concerning arbitration proceedings] shall be applicable to any agreement to arbitrate in an action for dissolution of marriage under this chapter, provided (1) an arbitration pursuant to such agreement may proceed only after the court has made a thorough inquiry and is satisfied that (A) each party entered into such agreement voluntarily and without coercion, and (B) such agreement is fair and equitable under the circumstances, and (2) such agreement and an arbitration pursuant to such agreement shall not include issues related to child support, visitation and custody. An arbitration award in such action shall be confirmed, modified or vacated in accordance with the provisions of chapter 909.\" The defendant claims that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies only to arbitration agreements entered into after a dissolution proceeding has commenced, arguing that the statute's language, \"in an action for dissolution of marriage,\" creates a temporal limitation to the statute's applicability. The plaintiff responds that the statute applies to arbitration clauses contained in premarital agreements, contending that the use of the phrase \"in an action for dissolution of marriage\" merely distinguishes the type of proceeding the statute applies to, namely, a dissolution action rather than a civil action. In addition, on the basis of the statute's prescription that \"an\n   arbitration pursuant to such agreement\n   <em>\n    may proceed only after\n   </em>\n   the court has made a thorough inquiry\"; (emphasis added) General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1) ; the plaintiff asserts that the statute is triggered by the commencement of arbitration regardless of when the agreement to arbitrate is made. The majority agrees that \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to arbitration agreements contained in premarital agreements because they \"are by definition agreements to arbitrate issues that would only arise once the parties are involved 'in an action for dissolution....' \" Part I A of the majority opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The text of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) does not support the plaintiff's or the majority's interpretation. The language in \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1), \"an arbitration pursuant to [an] agreement [to arbitrate]\n   <em>\n    may proceed only after\n   </em>\n   the court has made a thorough inquiry\"; (emphasis added); supports a temporal limitation to the application of the statute. If the parties agree to arbitrate after they institute a dissolution action, it makes sense that they would need the court's permission before proceeding to arbitration; after all, the court's jurisdiction has been invoked. On the other hand, if, as part of the premarital agreement, the parties agreed to arbitrate and, upon deciding to divorce, wish to go directly to arbitration, it makes little sense that they would first need to file an action with the Superior Court and seek that court's permission to arbitrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Moreover, when the relationship of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to other statutes is considered, only the defendant's reading is probable. Under the circumstances of the present case, there are two statutory schemes that relate to \u00a7 46b-66 (c), namely, chapter 909 of the General Statutes, comprising General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-408 through 52-424, and relating to arbitration proceedings, and the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-36a through 46b-36j.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Section 52-408 provides in relevant part that \"an agreement in writing between the parties to a marriage to submit to arbitration any controversy between them with respect to the dissolution of their marriage, except issues related to child support, visitation and custody,\n   <em>\n    shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable, except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   The emphasized language conflicts with the reading of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) that the plaintiff advocates and the majority adopts. If, as the plaintiff and the majority contend, \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to all agreements to arbitrate dissolution matters, despite when such agreements are entered into, then the test for enforceability prescribed in \u00a7 52-408 -general contract defenses-would be completely supplanted by the test set forth in \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1)(B) -fair and equitable. This construction of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) would, therefore, render \u00a7 52-408 void in part. Stated differently, an agreement to arbitrate that is enforceable under \u00a7 52-408 because the party challenging enforcement cannot establish a general contract defense, such as unconscionability, fraud, or duress, nonetheless may be unenforceable under \u00a7 46b-66 (c) if a trial court determines that the agreement is not fair and equitable. Conversely, any agreement enforceable under \u00a7 46b-66 (c) would also be enforceable under \u00a7 52-408 because, I presume, it would not be fair and equitable to enforce an agreement that is unconscionable or a product of fraud or duress. Thus, the majority's construction renders a portion of \u00a7 52-408 meaningless.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Well established principles of statutory interpretation, however, do not permit such a construction. First, this court is guided by the presumption that the legislature has enacted a harmonious and consistent body of law, and, accordingly, I must construe \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in a manner that ensures coherence within the broader statutory scheme. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Under such a construction, the standard for the enforceability of arbitration agreements set forth in \u00a7 52-408 would apply to, at the very least, agreements to arbitrate contained in premarital agreements, thereby retaining the validity of \u00a7 52-408. At the same time, \u00a7 46b-66 (c) will continue to have meaning as it will apply to agreements entered into after a dissolution proceeding has begun.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This construction also avoids the apparent conflict between the statutes regarding the standard for determining the enforceability of arbitration agreements in that it applies each\n   to factually distinct circumstances, which results in a coherent statutory scheme.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Furthermore, construing \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to apply to those arbitration agreements entered into after the commencement of a marital dissolution proceeding achieves harmony between \u00a7 46b-66 (c) and the Connecticut Premarital Agreement Act, specifically, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a)(2). Section 46b-36g (a) provides in relevant part: \"A premarital agreement or amendment shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that ... (2) [t]he agreement was unconscionable when it was executed or when enforcement is sought....\" Construing \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to apply to arbitration clauses in premarital agreements creates a conflict in the standard for determining enforceability by supplanting the unconscionability standard prescribed in \u00a7 46b-36g (a)(2) with the \"fair and equitable\" standard of \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1)(B).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   As I stated\n   previously, the legislature is presumed to have enacted harmonious statutory schemes, and this court must strive to construe statutes to avoid conflict.

Constructing \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to apply when arbitration agreements are entered into after a dissolution proceeding has commenced attains such a goal. Under such reading, the unconscionability standard of \u00a7 46b-36g (a)(2) will continue to apply to premarital agreements, and the fair and equitable standard of \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1)(B) will govern the\n   enforceability of agreements made during the course of the dissolution proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Instead of attempting to read \u00a7\u00a7 46b-66 (c) and 46b-36g (a) to be consistent, the majority relies on the canon of interpretation that directs courts to apply the more specific, rather than general, statutory provisions relating to a subject matter. See footnote 3 of the majority opinion. Generally, I agree with this principle of statutory construction, but only after it becomes clear that the statutes in question do not each have an exclusive area of operation or cannot be read in harmony. It is elementary that, when two or more statutory provisions are involved, this court will \"construe the [provisions], if possible, to avoid conflict between them.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Efstathiadis v.

Thus, because \u00a7\u00a7 46b-66 (c) and 46b-36g (a) can be read to avoid conflict, it is improper to resort to the canon on which the majority relies. The majority, in effect, rewrites the statute and allows a trial court to substitute its judgment regarding what is \"fair and equitable\" for what the legislature has required for the enforceability of a premarital agreement, namely, that such agreement is enforceable-and will not be second-guessed by the courts-unless the agreement was unconscionable at the time it was entered into or is unconscionable at the time enforcement is sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Interpreting \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to apply to agreements to arbitrate that are entered into after a dissolution proceeding\n   has commenced is consistent with the public policy of this state.

For example, prospective spouses may enter into a premarital agreement that provides for the division of property in the event of divorce, and further agree to arbitrate any controversy arising from such agreement. Under my reading of \u00a7 46b-66 (c), if the spouses decide to divorce, they could arbitrate their disagreements prior to filing for dissolution. After arbitration concludes, and the spouses have privately settled the distribution of property, they can file the dissolution action, asking the court to dissolve the marriage and to confirm the arbitration award. Under the majority's interpretation, however, the arbitration could not be commenced unless and until an action for dissolution has been filed and the trial court determines that it is fair and equitable\n   to arbitrate. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1) (\"an arbitration pursuant to [an] agreement [to arbitrate]\n   <em>\n    may proceed only after\n   </em>\n   the court has made a thorough inquiry and is satisfied that ... (B) such agreement is fair and equitable under the circumstances\" [emphasis added] ). Thus, even if the divorcing parties do not contest the enforceability of the premarital agreement or the arbitration clause, and desire to arbitrate their dispute, the trial court may disregard their will and determine if arbitration would be, in its view, unfair and inequitable. Thus, the majority's construction of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) is inconsistent with this state's public policy of encouraging the private settlement of disputes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Second, arbitration is an efficient and economical method for resolving disputes and, therefore, is a favored tool for dispute resolution.

Dept. of Children &amp; Families,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"152\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=317%20Conn.%20238\">\n    317 Conn. 238\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 249,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=117%20A.3d%20470\">\n    117 A.3d 470\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).

Under such a construction, divorcing spouses who wish to arbitrate their dispute may proceed to arbitration without the trial court's permission and, if they so desire, prior to the commencement of the dissolution action. Conversely, under the majority's interpretation, spouses who wish to proceed to arbitration will first be delayed by a need to file an action for dissolution and, then, will be further delayed while\n   awaiting the trial court's permission to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover,\n   spouses who submit to arbitration prior to filing a dissolution action may find their arbitration orders subsequently vacated by a trial court that concludes that it was not fair and equitable to arbitrate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Such a result is inconsistent with the well established principle that courts are not to second-guess the wisdom or fairness of premarital agreements into which prospective spouses voluntarily enter.

The need to first seek court permission prior to arbitrating or the risk of having an arbitration order vacated because the court does not think it was fair and equitable to arbitrate, despite the parties' intention to arbitrate, does not serve the goal of encouraging efficient and economical resolution of disputes. Moreover, construing \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to permit trial courts to prohibit spouses who wish to arbitrate from doing so, or to vacate an arbitration order that resulted from a consensual arbitration, leads to an absurd result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Third, applying a different standard to determine the enforceability of an arbitration agreement, depending on when the agreement was entered into, is consistent with our practice, and the policy set forth by the legislature, of affording greater deference to agreements reached before prospective spouses marry.

Under such circumstances, the court should more closely scrutinize the agreement to ensure that the spouses have dealt fairly with one another. The legislature has expressed its belief that premarital agreements and settlement agreements are not to be treated alike, enacting different standards regarding the enforceability of each agreement. Compare General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a)(2) (premarital agreement is enforceable unless it is unconscionable), with General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (a) (settlement agreement concerning alimony or division of property will be reviewed to determine if it is fair and equitable under circumstances).

First, neither this court nor the Appellate Court has ever addressed the question presented in the present case, namely, whether \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to an arbitration clause in a premarital agreement. Second, the scant cases concerning \u00a7 46b-66 (c) are significantly distinct from the present case because they either involved agreements to arbitrate entered into after a dissolution action had been filed; see\n   <em>\n    Weyher v.

We disagree. First, we conclude that the trial court did apply \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Specifically, the trial court's memorandum of decision dated September 2, 2011, arose from the plaintiff's motion in limine, pendente lite, dated April 11, 2011. In that motion, the plaintiff explicitly invoked \u00a7 46b-66 (c) and moved for the court to conduct a \" 'thorough inquiry' \" under that statute to determine which issues should be submitted to arbitration. Furthermore, during two days of oral argument on the motion, both the plaintiff's attorney and the defendant's attorney addressed the applicability of \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Indeed, the applicability of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) was at the forefront of the parties' oral arguments and the trial court's questioning. Indeed, the plaintiff's claim that the issues submitted to the arbitrator should be limited was based on \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Therefore, although the trial court does not explicitly cite \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in the memorandum of decision dated September 2, 2011, the fact that it limited the issues submitted to the arbitrator indicates that the trial court found \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applicable. In addition, in the memorandum of decision dated January 15, 2015, the trial court explicitly referenced that the plaintiff's motion in limine was filed under \u00a7 46b-66 (c) and that the trial court had considered \u00a7 46b-66 (c). Furthermore, neither party sought an articulation from the trial court on whether it applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c), and the defendant concedes that the trial court did apply the statute. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did apply \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in the present case. Second, contrary to the concurring and dissenting opinion, we conclude that a determination of whether \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies in the present case is necessary to the resolution of the claims on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    We recognize that General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36g (a) provides in relevant part that \"[a] premarital agreement ... shall not be enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought proves that ...

Therefore, we conclude that the general standard set forth in \u00a7 46b-36g governs whether a prenuptial agreement, as a whole, is enforceable. The enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate is, however, governed by the specific standard set forth in \u00a7 46b-66 (c), even if it is contained within a prenuptial agreement. Accordingly, although a prenuptial agreement is enforceable under \u00a7 46b-36g if the court is satisfied that it is not unconscionable, an arbitration provision contained within a prenuptial agreement is enforceable under \u00a7 46b-66 (c) only if the court finds that enforcement of the arbitration provision itself is fair and equitable under the circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that \u00a7 52-408 \"conflicts with the reading of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) that the plaintiff advocates and the majority adopts.\" Specifically, the concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that \"[i]f, as the plaintiff and the majority contend, \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies to all agreements to arbitrate dissolution matters, despite when such agreements are entered into, then the test for enforceability prescribed in \u00a7 52-408 -general contract defenses-would be completely supplanted by the test set forth in \u00a7 46b-66 (c)(1)(B) -fair and equitable.\" We disagree. Instead, as we explained previously in this opinion, \u00a7 46b-66 (c) governs the circumstances in which the provisions of chapter 909 of the General Statutes, including \u00a7 52-408, apply to agreements to arbitrate between parties to a marriage. Therefore, even if the \"fair and equitable\" standard of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) encompasses the test of \u00a7 52-408, it does not make the statutes inconsistent; instead it allows the two to operate harmoniously. Contrary to the concurring and dissenting opinion, the language in \u00a7 52-408 is not rendered meaningless, but is made consistent with \u00a7 46b-66 (c) by recognizing that agreements to arbitrate between parties to a marriage are subject to the provisions of chapter 909 if the court has determined that the agreement is fair and equitable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The concurring and dissenting opinion asserts that our interpretation of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) may interfere with the arbitration of disputes between parties to a marriage.

In discussing the September 2, 2011 memorandum of decision, the plaintiff's counsel stated: \"Your Honor undertook a review of the [premarital] agreement, reviewed the arbitration demand that was filed or attached to [the plaintiff's] motion in limine, pendente lite, and determined in Your Honor's September 2 [2011] ruling that the only matter in dispute for arbitration [was] the sale of the joint asset....\" Counsel continued: \"Your Honor has already undertaken\n    <em>\n     as a matter of contract interpretation\n    </em>\n    a review of the [premarital] agreement and has determined that it does not provide for damages claims to be asserted between the parties.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-103\">\n    The majority concludes to the contrary, reasoning that the September 2, 2011 memorandum of decision arose from the plaintiff's motion in limine, pendente lite, in which the plaintiff requested the court to conduct a \" 'thorough inquiry' \" of the arbitration agreement under \u00a7 46b-66 (c). It further reasons that arguments on that motion addressed the applicability of the statute. See footnote 2 of the majority opinion. By this logic, it is equally plausible that the court\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    apply the statute because the trial court also was considering the defendant's motions to stay judicial proceedings and to compel arbitration. In addition, the defendant argued that \u00a7 46b-66 (c)\n    <em>\n     did not\n    </em>\n    apply to the arbitration clause in the premarital agreement. In light of the defendant's motions and arguments, and the fact that the September 2, 2011 memorandum of decision does not cite \u00a7 46b-66 (c), mention a \"thorough inquiry,\" or use the words \"fair and equitable,\" it seems implausible-perhaps impossible-that the court applied the statute. Furthermore, the plaintiff agrees that the court did not apply the statute, despite her request that it do so. See footnote 1 of this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-104\">\n    The majority also asserts that the trial court's January 15, 2015 memorandum of decision, in which the court dissolved the marriage, referred to the plaintiff's motion in limine, pendente lite.

Judge Heller, however, does not conclude that Judge Malone in fact applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in response to such motion. In fact, after reviewing Judge Malone's September 2, 2011 memorandum of decision and subsequent articulation, Judge Heller concluded that Judge Malone \"confirmed that one party could not maintain a claim for damages against the other party\n    <em>\n     under the\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     premarital\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     agreement.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.) The majority also reasons that Judge Heller considered \u00a7 46b-66 (c) in reaching her January 15, 2015 decision. See footnote 2 of the majority opinion. Although that may be true, it seems irrelevant that the court considered the statute at that point, after arbitration was completed. First, the statute requires the inquiry to be made prior to the arbitration submission. Second, the error of which the defendant complained was that Judge Malone improperly limited the scope of arbitration by applying \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to the agreement to arbitrate between the plaintiff and the defendant. Thus, the fact that Judge Heller subsequently applied the statute has no bearing on the claimed error. Third, the purported application of the statute by Judge Heller came after the arbitration was completed, and, therefore, it could not be the application of the statute that improperly limited arbitration. Fourth, the fact that Judge Heller applied the statute likely indicates that she did not believe that Judge Malone conducted the inquiry required by \u00a7 46b-66 (c).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-105\">\n    Finally, the majority faults the parties for not seeking an articulation regarding whether the trial court applied \u00a7 46b-66 (c).

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5 (\"[i]f the [reviewing] court deems it necessary to the proper disposition of the cause, it may order a further articulation of the basis of the trial court's factual findings or decision\"); Practice Book \u00a7 61-10(b) (\"The failure of any party on appeal to seek articulation ... shall not be the sole ground upon which the [reviewing] court declines to review any issue or claim on appeal. If the court determines that articulation of the trial court decision is appropriate, it may ... order articulation by the trial court....\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-106\">\n    In reading \u00a7 46b-66 (c) to prescribe a condition precedent to chapter 909's application to arbitration agreements between parties to a marriage, the majority contends that it has \"harmoni[zed]\" the statutory scheme. Footnote 4 of the majority opinion. First, I note that this is an unlikely reading. As I already explained, \u00a7 52-408, the first section in chapter 909 of the General Statutes, provides for arbitration agreements between parties to a marriage, and it provides that such agreements \"shall be valid, irrevocable and enforceable,\n    <em>\n     except\n    </em>\n    when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity\n    <em>\n     for the avoidance of written contracts generally.\n    </em>\n    \" (Emphasis added.) The statute makes no reference to \u00a7 46b-66 (c), nor does it provide that arbitration agreements between parties to a marriage are valid except when they are not fair and equitable. Second, the majority contends that the avoidance clause of \u00a7 52-408, which provides for the enforceability of arbitration agreements \"except when there exists sufficient cause at law or in equity for the avoidance of written contracts generally,\" is not rendered meaningless by its reading of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) because it will apply to agreements that the court determines are \"fair and equitable.\" Footnote 4 of the majority opinion. By requiring arbitration agreements to clear the higher hurdle established by \u00a7 46b-66 (c) first, however, the majority has ensured that \u00a7 52-408 will apply only to agreements that will pass its enforcement test. Therefore, its reading has rendered \u00a7 52-408 meaningless.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    The question of what standard will apply to agreements falling between these two extremes, such as arbitration clauses contained in postnuptial agreements or agreements to arbitrate reached after the parties have decided to divorce but before an action for dissolution has been filed, is not before the court in the present case. Therefore, I do not resolve that question. I do note, however, that it is possible that arbitration clauses in postnuptial agreements will be governed by the standard, previously articulated by this court, that \"a court may enforce a postnuptial agreement only if it complies with applicable contract principles, and the terms of the agreement are both fair and equitable at the time of execution and not unconscionable at the time of dissolution.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Bedrick v.

In addition, agreements to arbitrate entered into after the parties have decided to dissolve their marriage but before either party has filed for dissolution may be settlement agreements governed by \u00a7 46b-66 (a).

See part I A of the majority opinion. I disagree. My reading ensures that the courts will not meddle in the parties' private resolution of their marital affairs. My understanding of the purpose of premarital agreements is to displace the discretion of the dissolution court by privately deciding issues of property distribution or alimony; see, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Hannon v. Hannon,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11580124\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/so-2d/740/1181/#p1187\">\n     740 So.2d 1181\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1187 (Fla.App.1999) (\"[a] primary purpose of [a premarital] agreement is to modify or shrink the general discretion of the dissolution of marriage judge in doing equity between the parties\"); and, therefore, a reading of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) that limits the dissolution court's ability to interfere with such agreements, it seems to me, makes them more, not less, desirable.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Because the majority's interpretation of \u00a7 46b-66 (c) has the potential to supersede the will of divorcing spouses, even when both spouses wish to arbitrate their disagreement, it reaches an absurd result.

The defendant filed his motions to stay judicial proceedings and to compel arbitration on April 6, 2011, and the plaintiff filed her motion in limine, pendente lite, requesting a thorough inquiry into the arbitration agreement, on April 12, 2011. The trial court, however, did not rule on these motions or submit the matter to arbitration until September 2, 2011. Moreover, the efficiency of arbitration was dwarfed by the need for the parties' attorneys to file motions and briefs and to appear for arguments on two separate dates.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    There exists a possible situation that is even more troubling. Prior to marrying, two spouses enter into a premarital agreement containing an arbitration clause. Subsequently, they decide to divorce. Before filing for dissolution, however, they agree to submit their property dispute to arbitration, and neither spouse thinks it is unfair or inequitable to do so. At the conclusion of the arbitration, one of the spouses is dissatisfied with the arbitrator's award and files an application with the Superior Court to vacate the order. Generally, it is difficult to vacate the order of an arbitrator. Section 52-418(a), a provision of chapter 909 of the General Statutes, provides: \"Upon the application of any party to an arbitration, the superior court ... shall make an order vacating the award if it finds any of the following defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption on the part of any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.\" According to the majority, however, before the court can apply chapter 909 to an agreement to arbitrate between parties to a marriage, the court must first determine that such agreement is fair and equitable. Thus, the dissatisfied spouse will first be allowed to argue that the agreement to arbitrate was unfair or inequitable, a standard that undoubtedly is easier to satisfy than the standard applicable to vacating an arbitration order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    In light of the different treatment afforded to premarital, postnuptial, and settlement agreements, the majority's contention that \"[i]t is not reasonable to think that the legislature intended to afford parties who agree to arbitrate controversies related to dissolution different protections based solely on when they entered into that agreement\" is contrary to reality and simply unwarranted. Part I A of the majority opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The majority also suggests that it is absurd to apply one standard to arbitration agreements entered into one day before the dissolution action is filed and a different standard to arbitration agreements entered into the day after the dissolution action is filed. See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=104%20A.3d%20727\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    It is unclear, however, what standard would apply to arbitration agreements that are entered into prior to the filing of a dissolution action but after the parties have already decided to divorce. It certainly would not be the unconscionability standard of \u00a7 46b-36g (a)(2) because such an agreement would not be a premarital agreement. See General Statutes \u00a7 46b-36b (1) (defining \"premarital agreement\" as \"an agreement between\n    <em>\n     prospective spouses\n    </em>\n    made\n    <em>\n     in contemplation\n    </em>\n    of marriage\" [emphasis added] ). It is possible that such agreements would be governed by \u00a7 46b-66 (a), which would require the court to consider whether the agreement is \"fair and equitable....\" General Statutes \u00a7 46b-66 (a). That question is not before the court in the present case, however, and, therefore, it would be inappropriate to decide it.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    The defendant does not argue on appeal that the trial court incorrectly determined that the parties did not agree to arbitrate arbitrability. Instead, he contends that the trial court improperly limited the scope of arbitration by applying \u00a7 46b-66 (c). In the alternative, the defendant argues that, if \u00a7 46b-66 (c) applies, the agreement was fair and equitable, and, when conducting a thorough inquiry under \u00a7 46b-66 (c), the court is not to consider the issues to be arbitrated. To the extent that the defendant's statement that \"[t]he [court,\n    <em>\n     Malone, J.\n    </em>\n    ] erred by contravening the terms of the parties' agreement and [by] concluding that, absent the parties' agreement, it would determine ... what issues would be submitted to arbitration\" was an attempt to claim that the trial court incorrectly concluded that it, rather than the arbitrator, was to determine arbitrability, he has not adequately briefed that claim. See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Electrical Contractors, Inc. v. Dept. of Education,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174278\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/402/#p444\">\n     303 Conn. 402\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 444,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"191\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20188\">\n     35 A.3d 188\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012) (\"[W]e are not obligated to consider issues that are not adequately briefed....

In addition, mere conclusory assertions regarding a claim, with no mention of relevant authority and minimal or no citations from the record, will not suffice.\" [Internal quotation marks omitted.] ). In his reply brief, the defendant does argue, in response to the plaintiff's argument to the contrary, that the parties agreed to arbitrate arbitrability. Nevertheless, his argument is styled as a retort to the plaintiff's contrary contention and is not a claim of trial court error.
