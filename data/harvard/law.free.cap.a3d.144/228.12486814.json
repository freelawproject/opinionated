Pa. Const. art. I, \u00a7 27. (Petition \u00b6 1.) Petitioners allege that by not developing and implementing a comprehensive plan to regulate CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   and GHGs in\n   light of the present and projected deleterious effects of global climate change, Respondents have not fulfilled their constitutional obligations to not infringe upon the rights granted to the people by the Constitution and have not adequately acted as trustees of the Commonwealth's public natural resources, including the atmosphere. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Executive Branch Respondents object to the Petition through 12 POs and the PUC Respondents filed an additional 7 POs.

When confronted with such allegations, the Supreme Court's discussion in\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    II\n   </em>\n   is helpful, where the Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   There can be no question that the Amendment itself declares and creates a public trust of public natural resources for the benefit of all the people (including future generations as yet unborn) and that the Commonwealth is made the trustee of said resources, commanded to conserve and maintain them.... But merely to assert that one has a common right to a protected value under the trusteeship of the State, and that the value is about to be invaded, creates no automatic right to relief. The [ERA] speaks in no such absolute terms.

Because it is the Commonwealth, not individual agencies or departments, that is the trustee of public natural resources under the ERA, and the Commonwealth is bound to perform a host of duties beyond implementation of the ERA, the ERA must be understood in the context of the structure of government and principles of separation of powers. In most instances, the balance between environmental and other societal concerns is primarily struck by the General Assembly, as the elected representatives of the people, through legislative action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Solid Wastes Mgmt.

Additionally, rising sea levels causes degradation of fresh groundwater supplies due to saltwater intrusion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   56. If the atmospheric concentration of CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   rises to 450 ppm[,] sea levels are expected to rise at least 6-8 meters.

Rising temperatures are degrading, diminishing, and depleting the water quality and quantity of streams, rivers, and wetlands leading to a decrease in biodiversity. Some wetlands may also disappear due to increased evaporation and transpiration and longer dry periods. Increased water temperatures will degrade, diminish, and deplete cold-water aquatic species like brook trout while leading to an increase in invasive species.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   58.

RESPONDENTS' POs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Executive Branch Respondents object to the Petition through 12 POs and the PUC Respondents assert an additional 7 POs. For the purpose of this opinion, we will merge duplicative POs and construe the POs as asserting 10 distinct objections that we have organized in the following manner for ease of discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Executive Branch Respondents first challenge this Court's jurisdiction on the basis that Petitioner Funk previously filed a rulemaking petition with the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) on September 5, 2013, that is nearly identical to the instant matter, which was denied and not subsequently appealed. (Executive Branch Respondents' POs (Exec. Branch POs) \u00b6 49.) Executive Branch Respondents contend that the current action is a collateral attack on the EQB ruling and that absent a timely appeal to this Court in its appellate jurisdiction, this Court lacks jurisdiction to entertain the Petition in its original jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 52-54, 115-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Respondents next allege that Petitioners lack standing to assert their claims because the harm they allegedly suffer is remote, speculative, and generalized, and the interest they assert does not surpass the common interest of all citizens who have a general interest in the government obeying the law. (PUC POs \u00b6\u00b6 39-43; Exec. Branch POs \u00b6\u00b6 131-33.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Third, Respondents assert that Petitioners cannot obtain mandamus relief as the Petition does not allege facts necessary to satisfy the required elements of mandamus\n   relief. (PUC POs \u00b6 51.) Central to Respondents' argument is an allegation that mandamus cannot be used to require the exercise of discretion in any particular way, and Respondents understand the Petition as demanding Respondents promulgate and implement regulations Petitioners think are necessary. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 53-58.) Respondents further argue that mandamus will not lie because alternative relief is available through a rulemaking petition to the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) or appeal of the previously rejected decision of the EQB. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 59; Exec. Branch POs \u00b6\u00b6 104-106.) Executive Branch Respondents also allege that mandamus relief is not appropriate when the writ will be futile, and here, requiring Respondents to act a particular way in isolation from global and national regulators would not remedy the harms alleged or lessen the threat of climate change. (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 110.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Fourth, the Executive Branch Respondents allege that the current action is barred by the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies and that Petitioners do not fall under a recognized exception to the doctrine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 87, 98-99.) Executive Branch Respondents allege that, with the exception of Petitioner Funk, no other Petitioner has filed a rulemaking petition, and that the EQB has the discretion to grant a subsequent petition from Petitioner Funk. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 89-91.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Fifth, both Respondents demur to the allegations in the Petition. Executive Branch Respondents, relying on the\n   <em>\n    Payne\n   </em>\n   test, contend that Petitioners have not alleged sufficient facts showing that Respondents did not comply with existing laws or regulations, did not make a reasonable effort to reduce CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   and GHG emissions, or that the harm of any decision outweighs the benefits derived from such decisions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 59-62.) Respondents further allege that the relief sought by Petitioners is already being carried out by Respondents through a variety of programs and strategies, including, but not limited to, the 2009 Climate Impacts Assessment Report and Climate Change Action Plan. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 64-66; PUC POs \u00b6\u00b6 90-100.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Respondents next allege that the Petition lacks specificity. PUC Respondents contend that the Petition does not allege any facts particular to the PUC Respondents, nor state within any specificity how the PUC Respondents actions or inactions were unlawful. (PUC POs \u00b6\u00b6 82-85.) Similarly, Executive Branch Respondents allege that the Petition \"do[es] not articulate the specific actions each of the Respondents are engaged in or how they injured [Petitioners].\" (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 142.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Seventh, Respondents contend that some of the Respondents are improper parties to the action. Executive Branch Respondents allege that Governor Tom Wolf, the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), the Department of Transportation, Department of Agriculture, the PUC, and Secretaries Dunn, Richards, and Redding, as well as Chairperson Brown, are not proper parties because their interests are fully represented by DEP and its Secretary, John Quigley,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   who also serves as Chair of the EQB. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 159-60.) Executive Branch Respondents argue that none of the above parties \"have statutory or regulatory authority to regulate CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   or GHGs as part of their official duties,\" and \"[t]o include them ... is unnecessary and duplicative.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 162.) The PUC Respondents echo the Executive Branch Respondents' allegations and contend that the PUC has no authority to regulate CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   or GHGs and that DEP, the EQB, and Secretary Quigley are the proper parties. (PUC POs \u00b6\u00b6 30-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Eighth, Respondents assert the affirmative defense of sovereign immunity. Citing to\n   <em>\n    Fawber v. Cohen,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1808560\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/516/352/\">\n    516 Pa. 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1808560\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/516/352/\">\n    532 A.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 433-34 (1987), Respondents allege that the doctrine of sovereign immunity bars suits that \"seek to\n   <em>\n    compel affirmative action on the part of state officials.\n   </em>\n   \" (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 121; PUC POs \u00b6 63 (emphasis in original).) According to the PUC's POs, because Petitioners seek an order requiring \"Respondents to promulgate regulations, adopt specific policies, and generally perform their duties in the way that Petitioners want,\" the Petition cannot clear the bar of sovereign immunity. (PUC POs \u00b6 65.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Ninth, Respondents allege that declaratory relief is improper because it would amount to \"advisory opinions which can have 'no practical effect on the parties.' \" (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 124 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Swift v. Dep't. of Transp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8364258\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/937/1162/#p1169\">\n    937 A.2d 1162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1169 (Pa.Cmwlth.2007) ).) Respondents allege that the declaratory relief sought would not tell Respondents what needs to be done to satisfy their trustee obligation because the Commonwealth is bound to both conserve public natural resources and do other things also for the benefit of the people. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 127.) According to the PUC, because Petitioners' claims for declaratory relief have no practical effect, they should \"fall along with the [mandamus] claim [these claims] serve[ ] to support.\" (PUC POs \u00b6 67-68 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Stackhouse v. Pa. State Police,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8984717\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/892/54/#p62\">\n    892 A.2d 54\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 62 (Pa.Cmwlth.2006) ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Finally, Respondents allege that the Petition asks this Court to decide a non-justiciable political question. (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 145; PUC POs \u00b6 70.) The PUC asserts that \"[t]he continuing development and implementation of [GHG] emission reduction strategies should remain with the executive agencies charged with those responsibilities under the law, as they possess the technical program expertise and scientific background necessary for such regulations.\" (PUC POs \u00b6 76.) According to the Executive Branch Respondents, \"[c]ourts do not possess the scientific and technological expertise to evaluate the current science and to make conclusions, which would amount to policy determinations, based on their evaluations and therefore cannot resolve the dispute in the way intended by [Petitioners].\" (Exec. Branch POs \u00b6 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In assessing the POs, we are mindful that \"this Court must accept as true all well-pleaded allegations of material facts in the [Petition], as well as all of the inferences reasonably deducible from those facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Funk v.

A PO will only be sustained where it \"appear[s] with certainty that the law will permit no recovery\" and \"[a]ny doubt must be resolved in favor of the non-moving party.\"\n   <em>\n    Guarrasi v.

Jurisdiction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Whether this Court has subject matter jurisdiction over a petition for review is a threshold matter that must be addressed prior to considering any of the issues asserted therein.\n   <em>\n    Borough of Olyphant v. Pa. Pub. Util. Comm'n,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9187972\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/861/377/\">\n    861 A.2d 377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 382 n. 10 (Pa.Cmwlth.2004). Executive Branch Respondents argue that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition because it is not vested\n   with authority to engage in rulemaking or to compel specific rulemaking. Executive Branch Respondents contend that \"this Court's original jurisdiction is limited to items that are\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   in its appellate jurisdiction.\" (Executive Branch Respondents' Brief (Exec. Branch Br.) at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Pa. Dept. of Aging v.

Thus, it is the Executive Branch Respondents' contention that because a petitioner may file a rulemaking petition with the EQB pursuant to Section 1920-A(h) of the Administrative Code of 1929\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and this Court has appellate jurisdiction over final orders of the EQB, this Court cannot exercise original jurisdiction over suits requesting rulemaking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Petitioners argue in response that their action asserts \"classic mandamus relief\" based on Respondents' failure to perform their duties mandated by the ERA, which is within this Court's jurisdiction. Petitioners assert that the Executive Branch Respondents' objection rests on an improper understanding of the relief sought. Petitioners contend that they do not request that this Court impose any specific regulatory regime; rather, they ask this Court to require Respondents to develop approaches in a manner determined by Respondents that will ensure that Petitioners' constitutional rights under the ERA are protected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Pursuant to Section 761(a)(1) of the Judicial Code, this Court has \"original jurisdiction of all civil actions or proceedings ... [a]gainst the Commonwealth government, including any officer thereof.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further Section 761(c) provides this Court with original jurisdiction \"in cases of mandamus and prohibition to ... other government units where such relief is ancillary to matters within its appellate jurisdiction.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(c). This Court's appellate jurisdiction is set forth in Section 763(a) of the Judicial Code, which provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Except as [not relevant here], the Commonwealth Court shall have exclusive jurisdiction of appeals from final orders of government agencies in the following cases:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (1) All appeals from Commonwealth agencies under Subchapter A of Chapter 7 of Title 2 (relating to judicial review of Commonwealth agency action) or otherwise and including appeals from the Board of Claims, the Environmental Hearing Board, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review and from any other Commonwealth agency having Statewide jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (2) All appeals jurisdiction of which is vested in the Commonwealth Court by any statute hereafter enacted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 763(a).

In short, the Commonwealth Court's original jurisdiction of actions against the Commonwealth is limited to those not within its\n   Section 763 appellate jurisdiction over appeals from Commonwealth agencies, whether directly under Section 763(a)(1) or (2), indirectly under Section 762(a)(3) or (4) or otherwise within its appellate jurisdiction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    Lindberg,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785899\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/503/423/\">\n    469 A.2d at 1015-16\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Whether we have jurisdiction over the instant action, therefore, turns on whether we would have appellate jurisdiction over the matter. While we agree that we would have appellate jurisdiction over a final order of the EQB denying a rulemaking petition pursuant to Section 1920-A(h) of the Administrative Code of 1929, and a final order of the Environmental Hearing Board (EHB) denying an appeal of a DEP decision to not submit a rulemaking petition to the EQB pursuant to Section 4 of the Environmental Hearing Board Act,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   we would not have appellate jurisdiction over the instant matter. According to DEP's regulations, a successful rulemaking petition must include either \"[s]uggested regulatory language if the petition requests that the EQB adopt or amend regulations,\" or \"[a] specific citation to the regulations to be repealed if the petition requests that the EQB repeal existing regulations.\" 25 Pa.Code \u00a7 23.1(a)(2). Petitioners would not be able to file a successful rulemaking petition based on the allegations before us because they do not seek the enactment of a specific regulation or repeal of an existing regulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, Petitioners ask that we order the EQB to enact whatever regulation EQB deems to be required to satisfy the ERA after conducting appropriate studies discovering what would be required to protect Petitioners' rights in light of the threat of climate change. The only court in which Petitioners could try to seek such a remedy, if one is available at all, is in this Court's original jurisdiction. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 761(b) (providing that the original jurisdiction of this Court \"shall be exclusive except as provided in [sections not relevant here]\"). We therefore overrule Executive Branch Respondents' preliminary objection alleging that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the Petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Standing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   We next address Respondents' challenge to Petitioners' standing, where Respondents contend that the Petition merely asserts generalized injuries and claims based upon remote and speculative allegations of harm. \"When determining whether [a party has] standing to challenge the legality of an action, it must be assumed that the action is in fact contrary to some rule of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Wm.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Ms. McIntyre also alleges that rising sea levels associated with climate change threaten to inundate her home town of Philadelphia with floodwaters, and that rising temperatures are associated with a reduction in snow that will limit her ability to go skiing in the Pocono Mountains and other locations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition to concern over the future impacts of climate change, Ms. McIntyre alleges that climate change is impacting her life and environment now in the following ways: \"[t]he increasingly hot summer temperatures have ma[d]e it hard for [her] to enjoy outdoor activities, such as riding bikes, hiking, and playing soccer\"; she likes to hike but her enjoyment of the forests is reduced by the prevalence of dangerous ticks and the disruption of wildlife caused by climate change; and the increasing frequency and destructiveness of storms poses an immediate threat to her safety, well-being, and ability to use and enjoy her property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10) Ms. McIntyre cites to examples where she has allegedly been threatened by extreme weather events caused by climate change: first, she has \"experienced tornadoes where she lives, which are not normal and have been linked to climate change,\" and second, she was involved in an incident during Hurricane Sandy in October of 2012 where she and her mother \"got stuck in floodwaters when a stream by her house overflowed its banks.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Further, Ms. McIntyre alleges that she, and the other minor Petitioners,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   represent the youngest living generation of Pennsylvania's public trust beneficiaries, and have a substantial, direct, and immediate interest in protecting the environment, their quality of life, and in ensuring that the climate remains stable enough to secure their constitutional rights to a livable future.

First, as to whether her interest is substantial, Ms. McIntyre avers that climate change and Respondents' failure to act appropriately to combat the climate crisis has diminished her ability to engage in activities she enjoys, threatens her safety, and raised concern over whether her health and enjoyment of the environment will be negatively diminished in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-10.) These allegations sound much like those asserted in\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township,\n   </em>\n   which were found to be beyond the abstract interest of the general public in ensuring obedience with the law. While many people like to hike and are impacted by severe weather, Ms. McIntyre's allegations that her ability to enjoy outdoor activity is diminished and that she has been harmed by floods linked to climate change have sufficiently distinguished her \"from those asserting only the common right of the entire public that the law be obeyed.\"\n   <em>\n    Wm. Penn Parking,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710363\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/464/168/\">\n    346 A.2d at 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Respondents distinguish\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township\n   </em>\n   and similar cases upon which Petitioners rely by arguing that those cases involve appeals of actions-permit decisions or legislation enactments-that resulted in harm to those persons, and not, as here, the harm based on Respondents' alleged failure to act that is generic and no different from the interests of the general public. Respondents are correct that, heretofore, we have not addressed a case where the alleged harm and violation of law is the government's failure to act. However, we see no reason to conclude that Ms. McIntyre's interest is less substantial than the interests of those in\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   solely because she is alleging harm caused by Respondents' failure to fulfill an allegedly mandatory duty instead of harm caused by an affirmative act. Instead of asserting a right to relief under the first provision of the ERA, Ms. McIntyre asserts a right to relief under the second provision of the ERA, which \"places an affirmative duty on the Commonwealth to 'prevent and remedy the degradation, diminution, or depletion of our public natural resources.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pa.

Respondents further argue that Ms. McIntyre has not connected these speculative impacts to any action by Respondents. However, Ms. McIntyre specifically alleges a causal connection by asserting that she is harmed by climate change and that Respondents have violated their duty to conserve and maintain the natural resources as required by the ERA. (Petition \u00b6\u00b6 90, 92.) Specifically, Ms. McIntyre alleges that \"[b]ecause of Respondents' failures to carry out their mandatory duties under [the ERA], dangerous levels of CO\n   <sub>\n    2\n   </sub>\n   and GHGs are occurring which have unreasonably contributed to the actual degradation of the air, water, and natural, historic, and esthetic values of the environment.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 92.) Ms. McIntyre has thus alleged a causal connection between the harm alleged and the alleged inaction of Respondents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Finally, as to whether Ms. McIntyre's interests are \"immediate,\" Respondents contend that the remote and speculative nature of Ms. McIntyre's claims are illustrated by Petitioners' factual allegations. PUC Respondents point to the numerous portions of the Petition discussing the \"expected\" impacts of climate change, and allegations that due to these impacts,\n   Petitioners \"could\" be harmed. Ms. McIntyre alleges that she and the other Petitioners are suffering harm based on the threat of climate change now, and the fact that many of the deleterious effects of climate change will allegedly occur in the coming decades does not render their interests remote. Like the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Robinson Township,\n   </em>\n   whom the Supreme Court concluded had immediate interests in the litigation based on allegations of\n   <strong>\n    likely harms,\n   </strong>\n   Ms. McIntyre alleges both present and likely future harms.

But, while the\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    test may have answered a call for guidance on substantive standards in this area of law and may be relatively easy to apply, the test poses difficulties both obvious and critical. First, the\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    test describes the Commonwealth's obligations-both as trustee and under the first clause of Section 27 -in much narrower terms than the constitutional provision.

And, finally, the Commonwealth Court's\n    <em>\n     Payne\n    </em>\n    decision and its progeny have the effect of minimizing the constitutional duties of executive agencies and the judicial branch, and circumscribing the abilities of these entities to carry out their constitutional duties independent of legislative control.
