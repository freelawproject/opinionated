Kenneth Hart (\"Hart\"), the defendant, was present throughout the two-day trial. On the second day of trial, after closing arguments and the administration of jury instructions, jury deliberations began at 7 p.m. After approximately three and a half hours of deliberation, the trial court received a jury note. The judge informed the prosecutor and defense counsel of the communication, and made arrangements for the sheriffs to bring Hart, who was in custody, to the courtroom. While they were waiting for Hart to arrive, defense counsel requested a \"preview\" of the content of the jury note. The note indicated that the jury was deadlocked on a particular count and asked for guidance. Shortly thereafter, the judge was informed that Hart had been transported to a hospital due to a medical emergency. After the judge discussed the note with the prosecutor and defense counsel, the court summoned the jury foreperson to discuss the nature of the deadlock. Although Hart was not present, and despite objections from defense counsel, the judge accepted a partial verdict from the jury. Hart was found guilty on three counts. The trial court then declared a mistrial on the perceived deadlocked count on the basis of manifest necessity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At a post-trial hearing, the trial court recognized its error in receiving the partial verdict in Hart's absence, and ordered a new trial for the counts on which Hart had been convicted. The trial judge concluded, however, that there was manifest necessity to declare a mistrial, and denied defense counsel's motion to dismiss the deadlocked count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons explained below, we disagree with the entry of a mistrial on the perceived deadlocked count. We hold that the trial court erred when it responded to the jury note without first conducting an adequate inquiry into the voluntariness of Hart's absence from the court proceedings. Furthermore,\n   the trial judge erred in prematurely declaring a mistrial-an extraordinary remedy-without first considering reasonable alternatives to the declaration, because Hart was involuntarily absent. These errors were not harmless, and resulted in prejudice to Hart. Because manifest necessity did not exist, under the unique facts of the case, a retrial on the particular count is barred on the grounds of double jeopardy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of a traffic stop, Hart was found to be in possession of controlled\n   dangerous substances, including heroin, cocaine, and phencyclidine (\"PCP\"). Hart was indicted on several counts, which resulted in a two-day jury trial. On May 19, 2014, the trial commenced in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After the State concluded its case-in-chief, Hart did not present any evidence, and rested his case. The trial court's instructions to the jury included the modified\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge on the jury's duty to deliberate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Four charges were submitted to the jury: Count 1: possession of heroin with intent to distribute; Count 2: possession of heroin; Count 3: possession of cocaine; Count 4: possession of PCP. At approximately 7 p.m., the jury began deliberations; a deputy sheriff took Hart into custody and escorted him to a holding area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   At 10:21 p.m., the trial court received a written note from the jury. The judge summoned the prosecutor and defense counsel, and arranged for Hart to be brought to the courtroom. After a period of time, the court was still waiting for Hart's arrival. While the bailiff contacted the sheriffs to ascertain Hart's whereabouts, the following conversation ensued between the trial judge, prosecutor and defense counsel:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   THE COURT: Do you want your client present when I tell you about the note?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I would love a preview first. I'll waive him for the preview.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   THE COURT: You'll what?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'll fill-I'll fill him in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   THE COURT: Okay, here's a copy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury note stated:\n   <strong>\n    \"After thorough deliberation the jury split on charge #1. No new information can help us reach consensus. What should we do?\"\n   </strong>\n   Meanwhile, continued efforts were made to have the sheriffs escort Hart to the courtroom. At approximately 10:48 p.m., the judge was informed that Hart was absent due to a medical emergency:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I'm informed, your honor, or the court has just-the courtroom has been informed at this late hour, 10:48 or so, that Mr. Hart is experiencing medical problems and is likely en route by ambulance to the hospital.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   THE COURT: Yes, we received a note from the jury at approximately 10:21 [p.m.,] which reads, \"After thorough deliberation the jury is split on charge number one. No new information can help us reach consensus. What should we do?\" While we were waiting for the sheriffs to bring the defendant and after repeated calls we just found out that there's a medical emergency. He's on his way to the hospital. What do you want to do about the note?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: This is certainly a situation of first impression for me. I have no information on his medical condition aside from a call from the sheriff's department saying he's en route with chest pains. Presumably he could be fine tomorrow morning. Maybe not. Maybe not at all. The jury has deliberated for nearly four hours, after two full days of trial. One of two things I would suggest at this point-I mean, I don't have Mr. Hart by my side, which makes\n   me apprehensive to make any moves on his behalf. But perhaps an inquiry as to how seriously they're deadlocked or-\n   THE COURT: Do you want me to bring the foreperson out and ask the foreperson?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that would at least give us some guidance, because my gut says ask them to come back in the morning and continue to deliberate, give them the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, find out what Mr. Hart's status is. I'd hate to-I don't think I'm in a position to request a mistrial without him by my side and without his input.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   THE COURT: Counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: They haven't been asked to continue to deliberate yet. I'll defer to the court as to what we do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   THE COURT: Well, I'll bring the foreperson out and ask him whether or not-if they can't come back tomorrow, you know, after having a good night's sleep, do they think that they can deliberate some more? Hi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   JUROR 132: Hi.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   THE COURT: You can-you can just stand right there. We received your note. And it indicates that no new information can help [the jury] reach consensus. But what I was wondering is-I mean, it's been a long day. Do you think that after going home and maybe getting a good night's rest and coming back tomorrow you can start deliberating again with a clearer head, or do you think it's no use?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   JUROR 132: We had a very good process in there. And there was (sic) a couple of times where we initially took a minute and everyone just thought and thought. We went around the room three times, we gave everyone a chance to talk, and then we all answered each other. We voted three times going around. And at the end, there was (sic) people in the room who said there was no information that could change their mind. If you want to know, I can tell you what the vote count was.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   THE COURT: No, not right now. But when you say information, are you saying information that could be gained from you all discussing it with each other or information that we could give?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   JUROR 132: I think either .... I think that there are people in the room who have unequivocal positions on each side. And they said there's nothing that could change their mind.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. And you don't think a good night's sleep would help. JUROR 132: No, I don't think so.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The judge then asked the prosecutor and defense counsel if they had any questions for the foreperson. Each replied in the negative, and the foreperson returned to the jury room. The following exchange then took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think the only thing that I am in a position to request at this moment is that they be excused for the night and read the\n    <em>\n     Allen\n    </em>\n    charge first thing in the morning, start deliberations again.\n   </strong>\n   If they pass a similar note suggesting that they're deadlocked, we can deal with it accordingly. But they haven't been read the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge. And most importantly\n   <strong>\n    I don't know what Mr. Hart's situation [is]. And without him to give me his input related to his desires, I would be I think delinquent in my duties if I requested a mistrial on his behalf.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your honor, I can just tell you from the State's perspective based on what I heard I don't think anything is going to change. The people who are set on their positions are going to, after coming back, anything actually\n   going to change materially to make the posture change (sic)-so the State is not interested in that. But I'll defer to-in terms of coming back and letting them get the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge and continue to deliberate, in light of what I heard. But I'll defer as to what ends up happening.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   THE COURT: Okay. With respect to what you're referring to, the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, basically that's already been given in the jury instruction-[a] jury's duty to deliberate. They've already got this. The foreperson came out. He indicated that, you know, they've taken breaks, they've gone over it, in response to my question, because the note wasn't clear where it says no new information could help. And the\n   response to my question was whether he was talking about information from us or information from the deliberations, and he said both. So based on his responses to my questions I'm not going to ask them to deliberate any further. I'm reluctant right now to say a mistrial as to charge number one, because I don't know what the verdict sheet says\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   .... But I don't see that there's anything that would prohibit me from declaring a mistrial after we see the verdict sheet, do you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I mean, I've stated my position. I think that they should be charged-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE COURT: No, I understand that. But I'm just asking you at this point.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [PROSECUTOR]: Your honor, I think we should look at the verdict sheet.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Mr. Hart is not even in the building.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    THE COURT: I understand that, but that's through no fault of the court. And we don't know what his circumstances are.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I agree with that, but I don't want to-I mean, there's only a couple of options. He's either legitimately experiencing medical issues, which I think in light of him proceeding through this whole trial-and seemingly the stresses would at some point manifest and come to a head, and that would be appropriate with the timing associated with this, or he's faking it which, you know, I don't put any stock in whatsoever. But I don't think he should be punished by virtue of the fact that he's fallen ill.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   THE COURT: I don't see this as punishment. What do you see as punishment for it? I don't understand what you're-\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Taking a partial verdict in his absence, not allowing him to consult with me about the issue of mistrial. Now I've stated my position. And that may or may not be his position, but we don't know his position.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   THE COURT: So are you suggesting that this could be open-ended? We've got a verdict on at least some of the counts, and I'm inclined to accept that and then based on the verdict sheet declare a mistrial on one and two or just-I don't know what it says. So let's bring the jury in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court summoned the jury and received a partial verdict. The jury announced it was unable to reach a verdict as to Count 1; however, Hart was found guilty on the remaining possession counts. The jury was then hearkened, polled, and dismissed. Thereafter, the judge declared a mistrial as to Count 1, the perceived deadlocked count.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Nearly three months after the jury returned a partial verdict, on August 18,\n   2014, Hart filed, through counsel, a Motion to Dismiss Enumerated Counts and Motion for New Trial. He moved to dismiss Count 1 on the grounds of double jeopardy. He argued that the mistrial was not supported by manifest necessity because either the jury was not truly deadlocked, or Hart was involuntarily absent; without manifest necessity, a retrial is barred. At a hearing, on August 22, 2014, the trial judge affirmed her finding of manifest necessity based on the jury deadlock, and denied the motion to dismiss Count 1. The Court did, however, recognize its error in accepting the partial verdict in Hart's absence, and granted a new trial for the three counts on which Hart had been convicted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   On August 26, 2014, Hart noted an interlocutory appeal to the Court of Special Appeals seeking review of the trial court's decision to deny Hart's motion to dismiss Count 1. Two days later, the trial court granted a stay of trial pending appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   On August 12, 2015, in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the trial court's denial of the motion to dismiss Count 1. It held, under Maryland Rule 4-231, that\n   Hart had a right to be present at the declaration of the mistrial on Count 1; Hart neither waived his right to be present nor consented to the declaration of the mistrial, and none of the exceptions under Rule 4-231(b) existed. The intermediate appellate court determined that due to Hart's involuntary absence, manifest necessity did not exist to declare a mistrial, and therefore, double jeopardy barred retrial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The State filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to answer the following questions, which we have rephrased:\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   1. Did Defendant have a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson, and, if so, was that right waived by defense counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   2. Did Defendant have a right to be present at the declaration of the mistrial? If so, was it harmless error for the court to declare a mistrial when Defendant was involuntarily absent?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   3. Assuming that the trial court committed reversible error in declaring a mistrial as to Count 1, is the appropriate remedy dismissal or retrial?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    State v. Hart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=445%20Md.%20487\">\n    445 Md. 487\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%2051\">\n    128 A.3d 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). For the reasons stated below, we shall hold that Hart had a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson. Defense counsel, however, in his client's absence, consented to a limited discussion between the court, the prosecutor, defense counsel\n   and the jury foreperson concerning the content of the jury note. Defense counsel did not waive Hart's right to be present for any other stage of the trial, and defense counsel's limited consent to an inquiry regarding the jury deadlock\n   cannot be deemed a waiver of Hart's right to be present for the trial court's ultimate response to the jury note. Accordingly, the trial judge erred in declaring a mistrial in Hart's involuntary absence without first continuing the case. The declaration was premature and manifest necessity did not exist, because the defendant was involuntarily absent, and the judge did not adopt any reasonable alternatives to the declaration. In the absence of manifest necessity, double jeopardy bars a retrial of Count 1. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   When a violation of a criminal defendant's right to be present is at issue, we apply the harmless error analysis.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [T]he harmless error principle is fully applicable to a defendant's right to be present during a stage of the trial. Prejudice will not be conclusively presumed. If the record demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt that the denial of the right could not have prejudiced the defendant, the error will not result in a reversal of his conviction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

Pursuant to Rule 4-231(c), waiver of a defendant's right to be present at a critical stage of trial may occur under the following conditions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   The right to be present ... is waived by a defendant:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   (1) who is voluntarily absent after the proceeding has commenced, whether or not informed by the court of the right to remain; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   (2) who engages in conduct that justifies exclusion from the courtroom; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   (3) who, personally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Additionally, as explained in the Committee note to Rule 4-231, \"[e]xcept when specifically covered by this Rule, the matter of presence of the defendant during any stage of the\n   proceedings is left to case law and the Rule is not intended to exhaust all situations.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   In the case\n   <em>\n    sub judice\n   </em>\n   , the first issue presented is whether Hart had a right to be present at the colloquy with the jury foreperson, and, if so, whether that right was waived. The State argues that the Court of Special Appeals erred in addressing this issue, because it was not preserved for appellate review. Maryland Rule 8-131(a) defines the scope of appellate review, and states, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   Ordinarily, the appellate court will not decide any other issue unless it plainly appears by the record to have been raised in or decided by the trial court, but the Court may decide such an issue if necessary or desirable to guide the trial court or to avoid the expense and delay of another appeal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The issue before the Court of Special Appeals was the propriety of the trial court's denial of Hart's motion to dismiss Count 1 on the grounds of double jeopardy. In its unreported opinion, the intermediate appellate court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   We hold that Hart had a right to be present when the trial court declared a mistrial on Count 1, and the declaration of a mistrial in his absence was in error. Because the entry of a mistrial in Hart's absence was erroneous in the first place, there could be no manifest necessity for declaration of the mistrial. As a result, retrial on that charge is barred by double jeopardy.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   As part of its analysis, the intermediate appellate court necessarily had to explore the circumstances surrounding the trial judge's decision to declare a mistrial. It determined that \"[d]ue to the factual nature of the inquiries surrounding the trial court's decision to declare a mistrial,\" the declaration of a mistrial was not purely legal in nature. Finding no evidence of waiver or an applicable exception to the right to be present, under Rule 4-231(b)(1),\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the intermediate appellate court held\n   that Hart's right to be present had been violated twice by the trial court-at the colloquy and at the declaration of the mistrial-when the judge proceeded in Hart's involuntary absence. To the extent that the issue regarding the propriety of the colloquy may have been unpreserved for appellate review, we hold that the Court of Special Appeals properly exercised its discretion to consider it. The colloquy was sufficiently interrelated with the issue concerning the declaration of the mistrial in Hart's absence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Unger v.

Defense counsel previewed the contents of the note, and, at 10:48 p.m., the trial judge stated on the record: \"While we were waiting for the sheriffs to bring the defendant and after repeated calls we just found out that there's a medical emergency.\" Without further inquiry into the voluntariness of Hart's absence, the judge turned to defense counsel, and stated: \"He's on his way to the hospital. What do you want to do about the note?\" Defense counsel expressed apprehension about proceeding without his client. Notwithstanding the reluctance, it was his suggestion to discuss the nature of the deadlock with the jury for the purpose of gathering information in order to formulate a proper response to the jury note, but reiterated that his ability to represent his client-by suggesting a proper response-was limited due to Hart's absence:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think that [the colloquy] would at least give us some guidance, because my gut says ask them to come back in the morning and continue to deliberate, give them the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge, find out what Mr. Hart's status is. I'd hate to-I don't think I'm in a position to request a mistrial without him by my side and without his input.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that the colloquy with the jury foreperson was a \"stage of the trial\" at\n   which Hart had a right to be present. We disagree, however, that Hart's right to be present for the colloquy was violated. Rule 4-231(c)(3) provides that the right to be present under subsection (a) is waived by a defendant who, \"personally or through counsel, agrees to or acquiesces in being absent.\" Here, defense counsel consented to Hart's absence from the colloquy for the limited purpose of obtaining information with regard to the extent of the jury's deadlock. The colloquy was factual in nature, and designed to explore the extent of the deadlock on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Clearly, defense counsel understood his limitations in proceeding without\n   his client's presence; thus, he requested that the scope of the inquiry with the foreperson be limited to exploring the nature of the impasse.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1969719\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/292/201/#p216\">\n    292 Md. at 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=438%20A.2d%201301\">\n    438 A.2d at 1310\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Where the right of confrontation is not implicated, and where there is involved no other right requiring intelligent and knowing action by the defendant himself for an effective waiver, a defendant will\n   <em>\n    ordinarily\n   </em>\n   be bound by the action or inaction of his attorney.\") (emphasis added). Hart was absent from the proceedings, and it is evident from the record that defense counsel did not have an opportunity to consult with Hart regarding the content of the jury note. Defense counsel stated explicitly that his ability to suggest an appropriate response to the jury note, and represent his client's interest, was hindered due to Hart's absence. He informed the trial judge: \"I don't have Mr. Hart by my side, which makes me apprehensive to make any moves on his behalf. But perhaps an inquiry as to how seriously they're deadlocked[.]\" Accordingly, defense counsel seized the opportunity to gather information about the jury note, and put himself in a position to confer with his client at a later time about the content of the note. Defense counsel did not request or consent, in his client's absence, to the trial court's answer to the jury communication, which was to deny a continuance, refuse to give an additional\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge after receiving notice of the impasse, accept a partial verdict, declare a mistrial on Count 1, and discharge the jury. Immediately following the colloquy, defense counsel made clear the scope of the waiver:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   [DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I think the only thing that I am in a position to request at this moment is that they be excused for the night and read the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge first thing in the morning, start deliberations again. If they pass a similar note suggesting that they're deadlocked, we can deal with it accordingly. But they haven't been read the\n   <em>\n    Allen\n   </em>\n   charge. And most importantly I don't know what Mr. Hart's situation [is]. And without him to give me his input related to his desires, I would be I think delinquent in my duties if I requested a mistrial on his behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Defense counsel objected to any further proceedings in Hart's involuntary absence, including the taking of a partial verdict and the declaration of a mistrial on Count 1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   In the past, \"we [have] warned courts against too hastily trying an absent criminal defendant, thus affecting 'a waiver of rights that are to be carefully safeguarded.' \"\n   <em>\n    Pinkney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537447\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/350/201/#p209\">\n    350 Md. at 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537483,1537447\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/711/205/\">\n    711 A.2d at 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Barnett v.

So based on\n   his responses to my questions I'm not going to ask them to deliberate any further[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The judge, however, failed to consider the propriety of proceeding\n   <em>\n    in absentia\n   </em>\n   , and the impact Hart's absence could have on the jury. In its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Due to the factual nature of the inquiries surrounding the trial court's decision to declare a mistrial, we hold that Rule 4-231 required Hart to be present. As Hart was involuntarily absent due to a medical condition, none of the exceptions to the Rule apply. The declaration of a mistrial in Hart's absence, therefore, was in error under Rule 4-231.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Although the violation of Rule 4-231(b) would be sufficient, our views are confirmed by the analogy to a defendant's right to be present when a verdict is received. A defendant's right to be present at a declaration of a mistrial is similar to the defendant's right to be present for the receipt of a verdict because, as the cases hold, the mere face-to-face contact with the defendant may cause some of the jurors to change their position:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   When a jury returns to the courtroom, faces the accused, and, typically, is\n   subject to a poll of the verdict, the psychological influence of the eye-to-eye contact between juror and defendant may be significant enough to cause a juror to change his or her mind when outside the pressure of the jury room.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   <em>\n    Kimes v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11935933\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/569/104/#p111\">\n    569 A.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 111 (D.C.1989). The same rationale applies to a mistrial, when the jurors, upon seeing the defendant in court, might change their prior \"unequivocal\" stances that led to the deadlock in the first place. Thus, we conclude that, in this instance, Hart's [right] to be present was violated by the trial court's order of a mistrial during his involuntary absence. Because of the importance the presence of the defendant may have in their minds of the jury, this error is not harmless.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   We agree with this rationale. The decision to declare a mistrial does not fall within an exception to the right to be present\n   under Rule 4-231(b). It is unclear whether any jurors would have changed their minds at the time they were summoned to the courtroom to enter a partial verdict had Hart been present.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   Critically, the judge and counsel were aware of the following: Hart's absence due to a medical emergency; Hart did not have the opportunity to waive his right to be present or to consult with defense counsel; and defense counsel could not request a mistrial in his client's absence. As discussed above, the trial judge did not inquire into the voluntariness of Hart's absence or determine whether the absence would be short or prolonged. Instead, the judge outright rejected defense counsel's reasonable request for a short continuance to ascertain Hart's status.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Granting a short continuance, however, was feasible and would have cured the problem associated with proceeding in Hart's absence. A continuance would have permitted the jury to adjourn for the evening, allowed time for defense counsel to ascertain Hart's status and confer with his client, and it would have ameliorated, among other things, the court's error in receiving a partial verdict in Hart's absence. Notably, the prosecutor did not object to defense counsel's request for additional deliberations (although he implied the effort ultimately may be futile). That these proceedings also occurred late in the evening, at nearly 11 p.m., following a two-day trial is also a relevant factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   By proceeding without Hart, the court denied the defendant an opportunity to object to the declaration of the mistrial. Defense counsel objected to any court action beyond fact gathering until he could assess Hart's status and consult with his client.
