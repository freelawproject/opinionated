On appeal, the defendant claims that the court erred by dismissing his motion to correct an illegal sentence after concluding that his sentence did not violate the eighth amendment to the United\n   States constitution, as explicated by\n   <em>\n    Miller v. Alabama,\n   </em>\n   --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407312\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/567/460/\">\n    183 L.Ed.2d 407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that the trial court improperly\n   determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant's motion, but correctly concluded that the defendant's federal and state constitutional rights have not been violated. As we explain, the defendant's sentence does not violate the constitutional sentencing parameters set forth in\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State v.

On March 26, 2014, the defendant's public\n   defender filed a motion to correct illegal disposition and a memorandum of law on behalf of the defendant. The defendant claimed that his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner because (1) he was not given an individualized sentencing hearing during which the court considered the mitigating factors of the defendant's youth, as required by\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

The court issued its memorandum of decision on July 23, 2014, dismissing the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   It determined that the defendant's sentence will expire when he is approximately forty-five years old. At that time in Connecticut,\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applied only to mandatory life without parole sentences.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court thus determined that \"the defendant is not entitled to\n   the relief sought, as it exceeds the jurisdiction of the court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In regard to the trial court's jurisdiction, the defendant's motion to correct contended that his sentence was imposed in an improper manner, namely, because it was imposed without following the procedures outlined in\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the defendant's claim was properly raised by a motion to correct pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Williams-Bey,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486827\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/467/\">\n    167 Conn.App. 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486827\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/467/\">\n    144 A.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Williams-Bey,\n   </em>\n   \"[t]he court's conclusion that it could not provide the defendant a remedy did not implicate the court's authority to determine whether the sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486827\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/467/\">\n    Id., at 761\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486827\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/144/467/\">\n    144 A.3d 467\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As in\n   <em>\n    Williams-Bey,\n   </em>\n   however, it is clear from the court's memorandum of decision that it considered the merits of the defendant's constitutional claims. We conclude that the court properly concluded that the defendant's sentence did not violate the eighth amendment or the constitution of Connecticut, albeit for a different reason. Accordingly, the proper disposition was for the court to deny, rather than to dismiss, the defendant's motion to correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant's constitutional claims are controlled by this court's recent decision in\n   <em>\n    State v.

The defendant in the present case was sentenced to thirty years imprisonment without the possibility of parole.
