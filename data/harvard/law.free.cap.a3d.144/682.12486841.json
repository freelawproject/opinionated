Code (1981, 2014 Repl. Vol., 2015 Cum. Supp.), \u00a7 14-410 of the Health Occupations Article (\"HO\") bars the admission of a Board of Physicians' consent order as evidence in a civil or criminal proceeding. Brenda Smith (\"Smith\") filed a workers' compensation claim seeking compensation benefits from Delaware North Companies and its insurer (collectively \"Delaware North\") for a full knee replacement. At issue was whether the injury Smith sustained at work caused her to need knee replacement surgery. During a jury trial in\n   the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Smith presented the expert testimony of Dr. Kevin McGovern. To impeach Dr. McGovern's credibility, Delaware North sought to admit a consent order that Dr. McGovern entered into with the Maryland Board of Physicians (\"the Board\"). Over a timely objection, the trial court admitted into evidence a portion of that consent order. We\n   conclude it was legal error to do so. HO \u00a7 14-410 serves generally as a statutory bar to the admission of a Board of Physicians' consent order into evidence in a civil or criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 7, 2012, Smith slipped on the floor in the course of her employment as a cook at Camden Yards. She landed on her left knee when she fell. A few weeks after the fall, Smith sought medical attention from Dr. Thomas Whitten. An MRI of her left knee revealed that she had torn the posterior horn of the medial meniscus\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that she had medial\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   compartment arthritis. Smith initially sought conservative treatment from Dr. Whitten in the form of cortisone shots. Dr. Whitten also recommended that Smith undergo an arthroscopic procedure. After Dr. Whitten's retirement, Smith transferred her care to Dr. Kenneth Tepper. Dr. Tepper recommended that Smith undergo unicompartmental knee arthroplasty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, Smith visited Dr. Mark Cohen at Maryland Orthropedics, P.A. on November 11, 2013. Dr. McGovern, another practitioner at Maryland Orthropedics, P.A. saw Smith on February 18, 2014. Both Dr. Cohen and Dr. McGovern recommended Smith undergo a full left knee replacement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 28, 2014, Smith filed a workers' compensation claim requesting an authorization for a total left knee replacement. The Workers' Compensation Commission denied her\n   claim after it held a hearing on April 4, 2014. Smith filed a petition for judicial review of the Workers' Compensation Commission's denial of her claim in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City and requested a jury trial. On November 24, 2014, Smith filed a \"Motion\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\" to prevent Delaware North from raising questions at trial about any professional disciplinary action taken against Dr. McGovern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith\n   also sought to exclude portions of Dr. McGovern's\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition where defense counsel inquired into the disciplinary charges against Dr. McGovern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   She argued in her motion that\n   HO \u00a7 14-410 \"expressly prohibits the introduction of such evidence in any collateral proceeding such as an appeal from a workers' compensation commission claim.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   On December 11, 2014, a jury trial was held in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City to answer the question of whether Smith's knee replacement surgery was\n   causally related to the accidental injury she suffered on September 7, 2012. Prior to jury selection, the trial judge heard the parties' arguments regarding Smith's \"Motion\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\" Smith argued that the admission of the consent order would violate HO \u00a7 14-410(a). The trial judge disagreed and stated, \"I do agree with [d]efense counsel that the stating (sic) of the consent order in effect is a stipulation of the parties that it's okay to be used.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   She explained, \"it's an exception to the medical review committee privilege\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   as we're referring to it.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Once the trial judge determined that the consent order was admissible, she provided Smith with an opportunity to argue whether the admission of the consent order was \"more substantially prejudicial than probative of the issue of whether Dr. McGovern is telling us facts that are relevant to Ms. Smith's case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Smith noted that even though Dr. McGovern was on probation pursuant to the consent order, his license to practice medicine was still in good standing and that Dr.\n   McGovern was still qualified to treat patients and offer expert testimony. Smith then argued that questioning on the disciplinary action would confuse and mislead the jury about the merits of the case, which involved the narrow issue of whether Smith's workplace injury caused her need for knee replacement surgery. Therefore, Smith contended that the probative value of the consent order and disciplinary action was substantially outweighed by their prejudicial effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial judge ruled that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   [i]t appears to this [c]ourt that the probative value of going into the disciplinary action against Dr. McGovern is outweighed by the prejudicial effect of the possible confusion of the jury. However, there's no question in my mind that the question about the status of his license, that should be asked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   Now, how far that question is allowed to go will depend on the answers Dr. McGovern gives. If I understand from the written submissions, Dr. McGovern's license is authorized only in the case that he obey the terms of the consent order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Thus, the trial judge granted, in part, Smith's \"Motion\n   <em>\n    In Limine\n   </em>\n   to Exclude Certain Testimony from Kevin McGovern, M.D.\" and excluded the portions of Dr. McGovern's\n   <em>\n    de bene esse\n   </em>\n   deposition that referenced the disciplinary charges against him. She, however, allowed \"the Defense to introduce the consent order showing that there are restrictions on [Dr. McGovern's] license.\" In response, Smith asked that the admission of the consent order \"be limited to the conclusions of law and the order that sets forth the conditions in [Dr. McGovern's] probation\" rather than the whole consent order which details the facts of each disciplinary charge against Dr. McGovern. The trial judge agreed with Smith and limited the submission of the\n   consent order to the last six pages, excluding the first seventeen pages of the order. The last six pages of the consent order begin with the Board's \"Conclusions of Law,\" which state:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Based on the foregoing Findings of Fact, the Board concludes as a matter of law that [Dr. McGovern's] actions and\n   inactions, as set forth above, constitute a failure to meet the appropriate standards for the delivery of quality medical care, in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(22) ; and a failure to keep adequate medical records, in violation of H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(40). The charges under H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(23), of willfully submitting false statements to collect fees for which services are not provided, and H.O. \u00a7 14-404(a)(19), of grossly overutilizing health care services, are dismissed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   These pages of the consent order also set forth the conditions of Dr. McGovern's two year probation\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and disclosed that the consent order \"is considered a PUBLIC DOCUMENT[.]\" The page that contains Dr. McGovern's signature is entitled, \"\n   <em>\n    CONSENT\n   </em>\n   \" and states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I, Kevin McGovern, M.D., acknowledge that I am represented by counsel and have consulted with counsel before entering into this Consent Order. By this Consent and for the purpose of resolving the issues raised by the Board, I agree and accept to be bound by the foregoing Consent Order and its conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   I acknowledge the validity of this Consent Order as if entered into after the conclusion of a formal evidentiary hearing in which I would have had the right to counsel, to confront witnesses, to give testimony, to call witnesses on my own behalf, and to all other substantive and procedural protections provided by law. I agree to forego my opportunity to challenge these allegations. I acknowledge the legal authority and jurisdiction of the Board to initiate these proceedings and to issue and enforce this Consent Order. I\n   affirm that I am waiving my right to appeal any adverse ruling of the Board that I might have filed after any such hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   I sign this Consent Order after having an opportunity to consult with counsel, voluntarily and without reservation, and I fully understand and comprehend the language, meaning and terms of the Consent Order.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the court addressed the parties' motions, a jury was selected and trial began. Smith was the first witness to testify. She testified on her own behalf as to the injuries she suffered and the recommendations of her doctors. Next, Smith presented expert witness testimony by playing a redacted version of Dr. McGovern's video deposition for the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dr. McGovern testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Now, you said you reviewed Dr. Cohen's notes prior to\n   your examination of Ms. Smith; is that correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Did you also look at his impression and his diagnosis of what her injury was?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Of course.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what was his diagnosis of her injury?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Aggravation of pre-existing medial compartment arthritis of her left knee related to the injury of September 7th, 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what were the-what was shown by the x-rays?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: That she had degenerative arthritis, severe in her left knee and moderate in her right knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what were the results of the-when you reviewed the MRI, what were the results of Ms. Smith's MRI?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Again, it showed degenerative changes and it showed a tear of her medial meniscus in her left knee .... The menisci, the medial and lateral meniscus, the medial is on the inner part of the joint, the lateral is on the outer part of the joint. The medial part is the part of your knee that would touch your other knee if you put your knees together .... In this case [,] there's a tear in the back portion of the meniscus, the posterior horn of the meniscus, which is the most common place for menisci to tear when they tear. The medial is the most common place for it to tear. The lateral meniscus on the outside of the knee doesn't tear nearly as frequently as does the one on the inner aspect of the knee. And most meniscal tears are caused by some sort of twisting injury to the knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And Ms. Brenda Smith, she would-had both of those positive showings on the MRI as far as her left knee is concerned?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: It showed that she had a tear of the posterior horn of her medial meniscus as well as arthritis in her knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And as far as the arthritis is concerned, the MRI classified that as-how did the MRI classify that arthritis in the findings? Would it be correct to say that they said mild degenerative arthritic changes?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Well, it says in the lateral meniscus-meniscus it shows mild degenerative change without definite tear. And then in the medial meniscus it shows mild degeneration of the meniscus. That is a little bit different than the arthritis itself. Again that's what they're talking about in the menisci being mildly degenerated. We know from the x-ray that she has fairly significant arthritis in her knee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Can someone have arthritis and not need a knee replacement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Oh absolutely. You're looking at one right now, I have arthritis in one of my knees and I don't need a knee replacement.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And can arthritis in someone's knee, can that be aggravated by a trauma?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And can you just explain to the ladies and gentlemen of the jury how a trauma could aggravate pre-existing arthritis ?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Well, in a simplistic way, it's possible that that could just be the straw that breaks the camel's back. At some point something happens that\n   makes a joint become painful and symptomatic. In this particular case the mostly (sic) likely scenario is that she had arthritis in her knee. She had mild degeneration of her menisci, but when she had the fall she ended up tearing her medial meniscus [as] the result of the fall. That tear then aggravates and inflames the joint and causes the knee to become symptomatic, the arthritis to become symptomatic. In a young healthy person with no arthritis you could go in there with the arthroscope and repair or remove the damaged meniscus, and the symptoms would go away. But unfortunately once the knee is arthritic, such as this one, then taking care of the meniscus, fixing it or removing it doesn't solve the problem. Because the arthritis, once it becomes inflamed and symptomatic, stays symptomatic. So she would need something more significant than an arthroscopy for a torn meniscus, she would need a knee replacement to make her symptoms go away.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what is your diagnosis as to after, you know, reviewing the history, reviewing the MRIs, looking at your notes, Dr. Cohen's notes, the x-rays, what is your diagnosis of what the cause of her current condition is and what's the cause of the need for the left knee replacement?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Well, it's my belief that she had arthritis in her knee that wasn't symptomatic before this injury. That\n   this injury caused her to tear her medial meniscus which caused an aggravation of her arthritis and has caused her to remain symptomatic as a result of that. The only solution for her problem as a result of this injury of September 7th, 2012 now is to have the knee replacement. Nothing less than that will work. She's already had conservative treatment. She's had Cortisone shots and gel injections into her knee of lubricants, called viscosupplementation, none of which have solved her problem and none of which probably would. And at this point a knee replacement is the only thing that would resolve her symptoms she now has as a result of her injury of September 2012.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And that opinion is-diagnosis is based within a reasonable degree of medical probability?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Yes or I would haven't (sic) said it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Did you have the opportunity to review a letter from Dr. Cohen dated January 21st, 2014?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: Yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: In that letter did Dr. Cohen detail his opinion of Ms. Smith's left knee condition in that letter?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: It did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what was his opinion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: The same as mine.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ***\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Now, Ms. Smith was also diagnosed or I should say seen by a Dr. Becker; are you familiar with Dr. Becker?\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: I know who Dr. Becker is, yes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And have you had a chance to look at his report and his addendum to his report?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: I have.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And what is your understanding of Dr. Becker's role in this case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Dr. McGovern]: He performed an independent medical evaluation for the defense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: And in reviewing his report is there anything significant that you disagree with?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [Plaintiff's Counsel]: I think we disagree on the fact that she needs a knee replacement as a result of her injury. We agree that she has arthritis that was aggravated by the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   On cross-examination, defense counsel asked, \"can you state to a reasonable degree of professional certainty whether or not Ms. Smith would have needed a knee replacement even if she hadn't slipped at work?\" Dr. McGovern responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   No, I can't say a hundred percent whether she would or wouldn't have. Again, she wasn't symptomatic before this injury. There's no way of knowing at what point she would or wouldn't become symptomatic in the future. There's a possibility she would have needed a knee replacement in the future with or without this injury, but I can't say when it would be or for sure it would be.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   After Dr. McGovern's deposition was played, the trial judge admitted into evidence Dr. McGovern's curriculum vitae. The defense presented the testimony of its expert witness, Dr. Larry Becker, via video deposition. Next, the court admitted into evidence Dr. Becker's curriculum vitae and the Workers' Compensation Commission's Order resulting from the administrative proceeding. The trial judge also granted, over Smith's objection, defense counsel's request to move into evidence the last six pages of the Board's consent order against Dr. McGovern.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The parties rested and the trial judge gave the jury a series of instructions on the law. After the jury instructions were given, the parties gave closing arguments. Defense counsel repeatedly mentioned the consent order in his closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Bringing up this whole aggravation argument is what's meant to confuse you, because they have to come up with something different than their expert .... [Smith's Counsel]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   would indicate that there's a piece of evidence [the consent order] that you'll review in conjunction with their expert from Dr. McGovern. Please read that document and decide whether you believe anything that individual told you today, because when he was asked about his medical license, he said everything was just fine. He wasn't truthful. He's on probation currently for ethical problems involved in workers' compensation claims and he's who they hired .... Dr. McGovern's disciplinary action, being on probation, I mean, look at the fine that was levied against him for unethical practices in workers' compensation claims, but yet you should believe him? His entire testimony should be disregarded .... Was Dr. McGovern's testimony consistent? Nope. The consent order shows the inconsistencies in his testimony about the status of his medical license. Whether the witness' testimony was contradicted by evidence. Once again, the order that you're going to read from the Maryland Board of Physicians completely contradicts and puts into question his truthfulness, his honesty, his integrity, his ethics. And they want you to believe this gentleman .... But just think in your own mind, would you or would you (sic) have a loved one go to a doctor for treatment that's been disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians, that's on probation for ethical problems, would you ever in your wildest dreams send your loved one to that provider? But yet they want you to rely upon him in this\n   claim. It's insulting to this entire system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   And for that reason I would ask on behalf of my client that you affirm the decision of the Commission, [and] check the box \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   During rebuttal, Smith's counsel attempted to respond to the statements made by defense counsel during his closing argument:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   Now, I realize that defense counsel has submitted into evidence a disciplinary action against Dr. McGovern and it's-he is on probation .... So you think to yourself, you say, all right, Dr. McGovern got disciplined, he must have done something wrong, he is on probation. Well, when\n   people are on probation, when they are being disciplined .... You make sure you tow the line, you make sure you don't get in trouble, because if you do, you're going to have to-have the consequences, and Dr. McGovern is in that exact situation right now. So he's not making any mistakes. He's following the book, he's following the rules, because he is on probation and that's something to take into consideration when you weigh his credibility.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   After jury deliberations, the jury returned and responded \"no\" to the question: \" 'Is Brenda Smith's knee replacement surgery causally related to the accidental injury suffered on September 7, 2012,' yes or no?\" Based on this jury verdict, the trial judge affirmed the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   On December 23, 2014, Smith filed a \"Motion for a New Trial.\" Initially, on April 1, 2015, another trial judge granted Smith's \"Motion for a New Trial\" but subsequently denied Smith's motion in an \"Order Correcting and Replacing the Court's Prior Order\" on June 24, 2015. The court explained that HO \u00a7 14-410(a) \"only applies to civil trials involving tort actions for medical malpractice and thus is inapplicable to this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Smith noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals on July 9, 2015.

The parties, however, offer competing interpretations of this statute.

As Smith argues, the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410(a) prevents the admission or discovery of, \"in a civil or criminal action[,] ... [t]he proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\" and the discovery of \"[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel.\" Smith is also\n   correct in her assertion that HO \u00a7 14-410 provides only two exceptions to this privilege. Pursuant to HO \u00a7 14-410(a) : \"The proceedings, records, or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\" and the discovery of \"[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\" may be used \"in a civil or criminal action\" if all parties to the Board proceeding or disciplinary panel\n   <em>\n    expressly stipulate and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    consent to its use\n   </em>\n   . HO \u00a7 14-410(b) provides a second exception: these privileged materials may also be used in \"a civil action brought by a party to a proceeding before the Board or a disciplinary panel who claims to be aggrieved by the decision of the Board or the disciplinary panel.\" The trial court's determination that \"the [signing] of the consent order in effect is a stipulation of the parties that it's okay to be used\" does not fall under either statutory exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Both Dr. McGovern and the Board signed the consent order and these signatures indicate the parties' agreement to the terms of the order. As the consent order notes, by agreeing to the terms of the order, a physician acknowledges that he freely agrees to be bound by the terms of the consent order and is aware that he waives certain rights by settling the charges against him without an evidentiary hearing. Nowhere on the page entitled \"\n   <em>\n    CONSENT\n   </em>\n   \" or anywhere else in the consent order does it state that agreeing to the terms of the consent order also indicates consent to its admissibility or discoverability \"in a civil or criminal action.\" HO \u00a7 14-410. The plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 requires \"the express stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding\" before any \"proceedings, records or files of the Board\" or \"[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\" can be admitted \"in a civil or criminal action.\" It is clear that Dr. McGovern's signature on the \"\n   <em>\n    CONSENT\n   </em>\n   \" page does not rise to the level of an \"express stipulation and consent\" to anything other than agreement to be bound by the terms of the consent order. Thus, we conclude that the trial judge erred in ruling that the signing of the consent order constituted an exception to the privilege provided under HO \u00a7 14-410.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   As noted above, there are only two exceptions to the privilege set forth under HO \u00a7 14-410. Contrary to Delaware North's characterization of the consent order as permissible impeachment evidence, HO \u00a7 14-410 does not contain an exception for the use of \"proceedings, records or files of the Board\" or \"[a]ny order passed by the Board or disciplinary panel\" to be used to impeach the credibility of a witness. To read in an impeachment exception would impermissibly \"reflect an intent not evidenced in the plain and unambiguous language of the statute\" and \"construe the statute with forced or subtle interpretations that ... extend its application.\"\n   <em>\n    Kushell v.

Therefore, we hold that the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 bars the admission of the consent order to impeach the credibility of a physician who is offering testimony as an expert witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    The Public Nature of the Consent Order\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Delaware North's contention that the consent order's classification as a public document removes it from the ambit of HO \u00a7 14-410 is also without merit. As previously discussed, HO \u00a7 14-410 provides two statutory exceptions. Neither of\n   these exceptions allows parties to a disciplinary proceeding of the Board to waive the protections provided under HO \u00a7 14-410 by signing a document containing a public document disclosure. Although HO \u00a7 14-410(a) allows privileged materials to be used if all parties to the Board proceeding or disciplinary panel expressly stipulate and consent to\n   <em>\n    its use\n   </em>\n   ,\n   contrary to Delaware North's belief, agreeing that a consent order is a public document does not amount to an express stipulation and consent as to the order's\n   <em>\n    use\n   </em>\n   at trial. To adopt Delaware North's view would invite a \"forced or subtle interpretation\" of the exception provided in HO \u00a7 14-410(a).\n   <em>\n    Fangman v.

In the consent order, the physician agreed to a three-month suspension followed by a five-year period of probation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The consent order also contained a provision providing that the consent order \"shall be a public document.\"\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    London\n   </em>\n   , 785 F.3d at 893. The physician's disability insurer then brought suit against the physician for misrepresentations he made on his insurance application regarding the disciplinary actions he faced. The Fourth Circuit reversed the magistrate judge's decision to admit the physician's consent order at trial. It explained that based on the plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410, \"solely by the 'express stipulation and consent of all parties to a proceeding before the Board' can a Board order be admitted into evidence in a civil proceeding like this one.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   It further concluded that the fact \"[t]he Consent Order states on its face that it 'shall be a public document' under the Maryland Public Information Act\" does not \"somehow render it admissible in a judicial proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Fourth Circuit elaborated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [The Maryland Public Information Act] \"allows generally for the inspection and receipt of copies of public records.\"\n   <em>\n    Waterkeeper Alliance, Inc. v.

But nothing in either the Public Information Act or Title 14 of\n   the Health Occupations Article requires that public documents be admissible in judicial proceedings.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <em>\n    Certain Underwriters at Lloyd's, London\n   </em>\n   , 785 F.3d at 893-94 (footnote omitted).

Although Delaware North does not contend that the public nature of a document removes it \"from the purview of the rules of evidence,\" its argument ignores the fact that HO \u00a7 14-410 explicitly governs the admissibility of Dr. McGovern's consent order.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Delaware North also argues that HO \u00a7 14-410 does not bar the admission of the consent order into evidence because HO \u00a7 14-411 permits the disclosure of a physician's general licensure information. It refers specifically to HO \u00a7 14-411(c), which states in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of: (1) General licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board, if the request for release complies with the criteria of \u00a7 4-333 of the General Provisions Article; ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   From this, Delaware North reasons that the trial court properly admitted the redacted consent order which it claims only disclosed the general licensure status of Dr. McGovern's medical license. Smith counters that HO \u00a7 14-411(c) is irrelevant and that HO \u00a7 14-411(c) does not override HO \u00a7 14-410. Smith further asserts that Delaware North's interpretation improperly makes the term \"disclosure\" synonymous with the term \"admission.\" The Board's disclosure of \"[g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information\" does not equate to the \"admission\" of the consent order. We agree with Smith that the issuance of the consent order itself does not constitute \"[g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information\" but rather, \"it is evidence of discipline.\" Delaware North's interpretation renders HO \u00a7 14-410 nugatory. Under Delaware North's interpretation, consent orders would be admissible\n   into evidence even though HO \u00a7 14-410(a)(2) plainly states: \"\n   <em>\n    Any order\n   </em>\n   passed by the Board or disciplinary panel is not admissible in evidence.\" (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   HO \u00a7 14-411(c)(1) provides: \"Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of ... [g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board.\" The request for the release of the \"[g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board\" must also \"compl[y] with the criteria of \u00a7 4-333 of the General Provisions Article [ (\"GP\").]\" GP \u00a7 4-333 is a provision within the Maryland Public Information Act (\"the MPIA\"). It sets forth the information a custodian of a public record may or may not disclose with regard to \"the licensing of an individual in an occupation or a profession.\" GP \u00a7 4-333.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   The ambiguity in the otherwise plain language of HO \u00a7 14-411(c) arises in the following language because it is unclear whether it governs only disclosure of records by the Board or disclosure of records by anyone who makes a proper request under the MPIA, including parties to a civil or criminal action: \"[n]othing in this section shall be construed to prevent or limit the disclosure of ... [g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the Board.\" When language is ambiguous \"we must look to other indicia to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly, including the relevant statute's legislative history, the context of the statute within the broader legislative scheme, and the relative rationality of competing constructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Twigg v.

The predecessor statute to HO \u00a7 14-411(c)(1) was HO \u00a7 14-510.1(c).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1991 Md. Laws, Chap. 55. HO \u00a7 14-510.1(c) was enacted by Chapter 237 of the Acts of 1990 via Senate Bill 138. The Senate Economic and Environmental Affairs Committee Bill Analysis on Senate Bill 138 (1990) (\"Bill Analysis\"), indicates that the bill:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   Authorizes\n   <em>\n    the Board\n   </em>\n   to disclose certain licensing information as provided in the State Government Article, including the name, address, business telephone number, educational and occupational background, and professional qualifications of a licensee, any orders and findings resulting from formal disciplinary actions against a licensee, and any evidence of financial responsibility of a licensee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   (emphasis added). The Bill Analysis further explains that \"[d]uring the 1989 revision of the Board's statute, a provision to permit the Board to release information in accordance with the State Government Article was inadvertently omitted.\" This reveals that the Legislature intended HO \u00a7 14-411(c) to apply to\n   <em>\n    the Board's\n   </em>\n   disclosure of \"[g]eneral licensure, certification, or registration information maintained by the board\" when the Board receives a request pursuant to the MPIA. HO \u00a7 14-411(c) does not, as Delaware North contends, apply to the disclosure of the items set forth in HO \u00a7 14-411(c) by parties in a civil or criminal action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   That HO \u00a7 14-411(c) applies only to\n   <em>\n    the Board's\n   </em>\n   disclosure of general licensure information comports with the principles of statutory construction because it allows HO \u00a7 14-411(c) and HO \u00a7 14-410 to be \"construed together and harmonized.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

Delaware North claims that even if the court erred in admitting the redacted consent order, the admission of the order did not impact the outcome of the trial or prejudice Smith. To support this theory, Delaware North states that \"the transcript shows that [the status of Dr. McGovern's medical license] was not even a fact focused on by either counsel for [Delaware North] or counsel for [Smith].\" It claims further\n   that there was ample evidence aside from the redacted consent order to support the jury's verdict such as \"the testimony of [Smith], the testimony of the physicians, and the evidentiary record.\" In response, Smith argues that the admission of the redacted consent order \"badly impacted the jury's consideration of Dr. McGovern's expert testimony.\" We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Smith notes as an alternative argument that the entire consent order should have been excluded under Md. Rule 5-403 because its prejudicial value outweighed its probative value. However, once the redacted consent order was admitted into evidence, defense counsel was free to comment on this evidence, and did, in fact, comment on this evidence at great length. As previously discussed, HO \u00a7 14-410 serves as a statutory bar to the admission of a consent order into evidence in any civil or criminal action. The trial court's admission of the consent order allowed the jury to consider evidence that the General Assembly explicitly precluded from consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Contrary to Delaware North's contention that the consent order was not \"even a fact focused on\" at trial, Smith points to the transcript, which reveals at least four instances where defense counsel emphasized the consent order against Dr. McGovern as a reason for disregarding Smith's theory of causation. First, defense counsel tells the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   Please read that document [the consent order] and decide whether you believe anything that individual told you today, because when he was asked about his medical license .... He wasn't truthful. He's on probation currently for ethical problems involved in workers' compensation claims and he's who [Smith] hired.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Moments later, defense counsel stated: \"Dr. McGovern's disciplinary action, being on probation, I mean, look at the fine that was levied against him for unethical practices in workers' compensation claims, but yet you should believe him? His entire testimony should be disregarded.\" The disciplinary charges against Dr. McGovern were rehashed when defense counsel told the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   The consent order shows the inconsistencies in his testimony about the status of his medical license. Whether the witness' testimony was contradicted by evidence. Once again, the order that you're going to read from the Maryland Board of Physicians completely contradicts and puts into question his truthfulness, his honesty, his integrity, his ethics.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Defense counsel concluded his closing argument by asking the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-138\">\n   [W]ould you have a loved one go to a doctor for treatment that's been disciplined by the Maryland Board of Physicians, that's on probation for ethical problems, would you ever in your wildest dreams send your loved one to that provider? But yet they want you to rely upon him in this claim. It's insulting to this entire system.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-139\">\n   And for\n   <em>\n    that reason\n   </em>\n   I would ask on behalf of my client that you affirm the decision of the Commission, check the box \"No.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Defense counsel not only emphasized the consent order and the underlying disciplinary\n   charges Dr. McGovern faced but asked the jury to affirm the decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission for \"that reason,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the fact that Dr. McGovern had been disciplined by the Board. It is more than probable that the jury considered this inadmissible evidence as a result of defense counsel's repeated mention of the consent order and urging of the jury to render a verdict based on the disciplinary action. Because there is a high probability that the jury considered legally inadmissible evidence in rendering its verdict, we conclude that the admission of the consent order was prejudicial to Smith.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The plain language of HO \u00a7 14-410 generally prohibits the admission of, in any \"civil or criminal action,\" the \"proceedings, records or files of the Board, a disciplinary panel, or any of its other investigatory bodies\" and \"[a]ny order passed by\n   the Board of disciplinary panel.\" HO \u00a7 14-410(a).

As Dr. McGovern's consent order notes, when a physician enters into a consent order with the Board, the physician waives his or her \"right to appeal any adverse ruling of the Board\" which a physician is generally entitled to after an evidentiary hearing. Pursuant to HO \u00a7 14-411.1, \"[a] description of any disciplinary action taken by the Board or a disciplinary panel against a licensee within the most recent 10-year period that includes a copy of the public order\" will be disclosed on the licensee's public individual profile maintained by the Board. Hence, any consent order is posted on a physician's public profile for 10 years.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    During Dr. McGovern's\n    <em>\n     de bene esse\n    </em>\n    deposition, defense counsel asked, \"what's the current status of your medical license in Maryland?\" Dr. McGovern responded, \"I have no restrictions on my license.\" The following line of questioning followed:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-152\">\n    [Defense Counsel]: Well, aren't you currently on probation?\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-153\">\n    [Plaintiff's Counsel]: Objection.
