The law now requires that juvenile offenders facing life without parole or its functional equivalent are entitled to individual consideration that takes into account the mitigating factors of their youth. This case concerns the important question of where such consideration must be given for juvenile offenders who were sentenced prior to the recent developments in the law. Must it be in the context of a resentencing proceeding, as the defendant claims? Or may it be in the setting of a parole hearing, as the state asserts? We conclude, for the reasons that follow, that a parole hearing provides the class of juveniles under consideration with a constitutionally adequate, pragmatic, and fair opportunity to gain consideration of the mitigating factors of their youth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The defendant, Tauren Williams-Bey, appeals from the trial court's dismissal of his motion to correct an illegal sentence. The defendant claims that the court erred by concluding that it did not have jurisdiction over his motion after determining that his sentence did not violate the eighth amendment to the United States constitution and article first, \u00a7\u00a7 8 and 9, of the constitution of Connecticut. We conclude that the trial court improperly determined that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the defendant's motion, but properly concluded that the defendant's federal and state constitutional rights have not been violated. The defendant's rights have not been violated because, as will be discussed, he will be entitled to have the mitigating factors of his youth considered at a parole hearing pursuant to a recently enacted Connecticut statute and a recently decided United States Supreme Court case. We affirm the conclusion of the trial court as to the defendant's\n   constitutional claims, albeit on alternative grounds. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v. Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"69216\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/242/389/#p395\">\n    242 Conn. 389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 395,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=699%20A.2d%20943\">\n    699 A.2d 943\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). The form of the judgment is improper and we remand the case with direction to render judgment denying the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State v.

On December 20, 1997, the defendant and two friends jumped out of a van and shot at the victim, killing him. At the time, the defendant was sixteen years old. The state charged the defendant with murder as an accessory, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54a and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8, and with conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54a and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48. On January 4, 2000, the defendant pleaded guilty to murder as an accessory in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 53a-54a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court accepted the parties' waiver of the presentence investigation report and continued the case for sentencing. On February 25, 2000, the court,\n   <em>\n    Clifford, J.,\n   </em>\n   sentenced the defendant to thirty-five years in prison. At the time of sentencing, the crime of which the defendant was convicted made him ineligible for parole. General Statutes (Rev. to 1997) \u00a7 54-125a (b)(1). If he were to serve the full sentence, the defendant would not be released until he is fifty-two years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence on December 16, 2013, asserting that his sentence violated the eighth amendment as explicated in\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    v.

In reaching this conclusion we address (1) the recent changes in the law regarding juvenile sentencing, (2) the trial court's jurisdiction over the motion to correct, (3) whether, assuming the defendant's thirty-five year without parole sentence violated the constitutional principles defined in\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   his eligibility for parole under \u00a7 54-125a (f), rather than resentencing, is a constitutionally adequate remedy under the eighth amendment to the United States constitution; and (4) whether parole eligibility, rather than resentencing, is a constitutionally adequate remedy under the constitution of Connecticut.

The eighth amendment of the United\n   States constitution provides: \"Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\" This provision is applicable to the states through the due process clause of the fourteenth amendment.

This public act was our legislature's direct response to\n   <em>\n    Miller, Graham, Riley,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano.\n   </em>\n   See, e.g., 58 S. Proc., Pt. 8, 2015 Sess., p. 2644, remarks of Senator John A. Kissel. It provides parole eligibility for juveniles sentenced to greater than ten years incarceration prior to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and\n   also provides\n   prospective sentencing procedures that bring Connecticut into compliance with the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   going forward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under\n   \u00a7 54-125a (f), a juvenile offender serving a sentence of greater than ten\n   years incarceration on or after October 1, 2015, will be parole eligible. If the sentence is fifty years incarceration or less, the juvenile becomes parole eligible after serving 60 percent of his or her sentence, or twelve years, whichever is greater. If the sentence is greater than fifty years, the juvenile offender becomes parole eligible after serving thirty years. The statute also requires the parole board to consider whether \"\n   <em>\n    such person has demonstrated substantial rehabilitation since the date such crime or crimes were committed considering such person's character, background and history, as demonstrated by factors, including, but not limited to ... the age and circumstances of such person as of the date of the commission of the crime or crimes, whether such person has demonstrated remorse and increased maturity since the date of the commission of the crime or crimes ... obstacles that such person may have faced as a child or youth in the adult correctional system, the opportunities for rehabilitation in the adult correctional system and the overall degree of such person's rehabilitation considering the nature and circumstances of the crime or crimes.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a (f)(4)(C). These criteria substantially encompass the mitigating factors of youth referenced in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Riley.\n   </em>\n   See footnote 4 of this opinion. Furthermore, the statute ensures that indigent juvenile offenders will have the right to counsel in obtaining, in the terminology of\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release.\"\n   <em>\n    Graham v.

Overall, the legislature not only gave\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive application, but also effectively eliminated life without the\n   possibility of parole, even as a discretionary sentence, for juvenile offenders in Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Also of great significance is the fact that the United States Supreme Court has substantially refined its holding in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   since our Supreme Court decided\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

The court also recognized that the substantive rule in\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   had procedural components regarding the factors that the judicial authority must consider. It stated that \"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   requires [the judicial authority] to consider a juvenile offender's youth and attendant characteristics before determining that life without parole is a proportionate sentence.\" Id. The court noted that \"[t]he foundation stone for\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   ' s analysis was [the] Court's line of precedent holding certain punishments disproportionate when applied to juveniles.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 732. The court reiterated that because of children's decreased culpability and greater ability to reform,\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   recognized that the distinctive attributes of youth diminish the penological justifications for imposing life without parole on juvenile offenders.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 733. \"\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   then, did more than require [the judicial authority] to consider a juvenile offender's youth before imposing life without parole; it established that the penological justifications for life without parole collapse in light of the distinctive attributes of youth.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 734.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The United States Supreme Court, however, also recognized in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   the practical limitations in remedying sentences that violated\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   upon its retroactive application. Juvenile offenders whose sentences violate\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   upon retroactive application did not have the opportunity to demonstrate the mitigating factors of youth at the time of sentencing. The court emphasized that this violation of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   could be remedied by affording those juvenile offenders parole eligibility, thus providing, in the context of\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   a meaningful \"opportunity for release....\" Id., at 736. The court also emphasized that \"[g]iving\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   retroactive effect ... does not require States to relitigate sentences, let alone convictions, in every case where a juvenile offender received mandatory life without parole.\n   <em>\n    A State may remedy a Miller violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\n   </em>\n   See, e.g.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Wyo.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%206-10-301\">\n    Wyo.

Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity-and who have since matured-will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Extending parole eligibility to juvenile offenders does not impose an onerous burden on the States, nor\n   does it disturb the finality of state convictions. Those prisoners who have shown an inability to reform will continue to serve life sentences.\n   <em>\n    The opportunity for release\n   </em>\n   will\n   be afforded to those who demonstrate the truth of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's central intuition-that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

Because the motion to correct\n   challenged the manner in which the sentence was imposed, the defendant's claim was properly raised by a motion to correct pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 43-22.

The court, though, had to have recognized that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's retroactive application would potentially affect thousands of cases across several states and that the logical extension of its holding would require state legislatures and courts to fashion a constitutionally adequate remedy for sentences that violated\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   It thus is illogical to categorize\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   applies retroactively as the holding of the court, but its pronouncement of a constitutionally adequate remedy in light of\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   's retroactive application as not being germane to that holding, and, thus, mere dicta. We do not believe that the United States Supreme Court would so glibly identify a constitutionally adequate remedy under the eighth amendment. Moreover, as noted, the court in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   stated unequivocally that \"[a] State may remedy a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation by permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole, rather than by resentencing them.\"\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

We conclude that parole eligibility is an adequate remedy for sentences that violated\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   as applied retroactively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Nevertheless, the defendant suggests that this court cannot follow\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   regarding parole eligibility as a constitutionally adequate remedy for a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation because, in doing so, we would implicitly be overruling our own Supreme Court. The defendant argues that because\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   treated the claims raised under\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   as distinct claims, we are required to reject\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   to the extent that it concludes that providing a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release\" under\n   <em>\n    Graham,\n   </em>\n   in this case parole eligibility, will remedy a\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violation. He thus asserts that he is constitutionally entitled to be resentenced\n   like the defendants in\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano.\n   </em>\n   We find this argument to be convoluted and reject it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Although our Supreme Court remanded\n   <em>\n    Riley\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   for resentencing pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Miller,\n   </em>\n   at the time it did so,\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   had not yet been decided.

That our Supreme Court has expanded upon\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   in previous cases does not provide, in and of itself, a principled reason for us to further expand the requirements of that case under the state constitution in the present case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Our Supreme Court has had no occasion to consider the remedy of parole eligibility because \u00a7 54-125a (f) had not yet been enacted. As we have noted, we consider it significant that our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   stated that it expected our legislature to enact an appropriate remedy to respond to the requirements of\n   <em>\n    Graham, Miller, Riley,\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Casiano.\n   </em>\n   The legislature has since implemented a remedy. Thus, we believe that our Supreme Court's precedent weighs against expanding the state constitution to require resentencing.

First, the parole ineligibility period of 63.75 years exceeds what our legislature in General Statutes \u00a7 53a-35b has defined as a life sentence (sixty years), and what our Supreme Court concluded in\n   <em>\n    Casiano\n   </em>\n   was a de facto life sentence for juvenile offenders (fifty years). Section 54-125a (f) provides a maximum parole ineligibility period of thirty years for a juvenile offender. Thus, assuming a juvenile offender was sentenced just before the age of eighteen to a term of years sentence exceeding fifty years, that juvenile offender would be parole eligible, at the latest, when he or she is approximately forty-eight years of age. This is far different from\n   <em>\n    Zarate,\n   </em>\n   in which the defendant was sentenced pursuant to a pre-\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   state statute under which he would not be parole eligible until he was the age of approximately seventy-nine.

It was not until 1921 that Connecticut established by statute a juvenile justice system.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) This historical consideration, however, offers no insight into the specific question of whether the state constitution mandates the resentencing of juvenile offenders whose sentences violate\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   upon retroactive application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The sixth\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   factor involves consideration of the contemporary understandings of applicable economic and sociological norms. In regard to sociological considerations, the laws of Connecticut have changed in several areas throughout our state's history to provide special protections to juveniles. Section 54-125a (f) specifically confers special protection on juveniles, as it applies only to those who were under the age of eighteen at the time they committed their offenses. This factor does not support the defendant's assertion that the remedy the statute provides is not constitutionally adequate; it was specifically enacted by the legislature to respond to\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Graham\n   </em>\n   by providing\n   increased parole eligibility to juvenile offenders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Because of the unique circumstances of this case, we also note the practical challenges that would be inherent in requiring resentencing in these circumstances. Section 54-91g provides an extensive list of factors that sentencing courts must consider post-\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   when a juvenile offender is convicted of a class A or B felony. This section mandates consideration of \"the defendant's age at the time of the offense, the hallmark features of adolescence, and any scientific and psychological evidence showing the differences between a child's brain development and an adult's\n   brain development....\" General Statutes \u00a7 54-91g (a)(1). Furthermore, the statute ensures that the sentencing court will have this information before it prior to sentencing, as the statute prohibits the waiver of any presentence investigation or report. General Statutes \u00a7 54-91g (b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   In the present case, as a practical matter, it would be exceedingly difficult for a sentencing court to retroactively make the determinations required by \u00a7 54-91g. The defendant waived the presentence investigation and there was no consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   factors, as\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   would not be decided for another twelve years. In light of our legislature enacting \u00a7 54-125a (f), we have significant concerns as to whether trial courts are the proper forum in which to provide the defendant and others in his position with a \"meaningful opportunity to obtain release....\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

For example, in the present case, a resentencing court would be called on to determine, without the benefit of a presentence investigation conducted at the time of the defendant's conviction, what the defendant's character was sixteen years ago when he was sentenced. Without such information, the court would likely need to principally rely upon the defendant's subsequent rehabilitation or lack thereof since his sentencing. This situation would arise in other cases where juvenile offenders were sentenced several years or decades prior to\n   <em>\n    Miller.\n   </em>\n   Resentencing in such cases would be cumbersome and would in reality be more\n   akin to a parole hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   We\n   note that the trial court recognized at oral argument on the defendant's motion\n   that the defendant had presented documentation demonstrating his efforts at rehabilitation. Whether the defendant has sufficiently rehabilitated himself to safely rejoin society, however, is precisely the determination that the parole board is statutorily designated to make. Moreover, a new sentencing proceeding would impose emotional burdens on victims, who may have struggled to cope with tragic losses caused by a defendant's crimes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As the United States Supreme Court emphasized in\n   <em>\n    Montgomery,\n   </em>\n   the key focus in remedying retrospective\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   violations is providing juvenile offenders a meaningful opportunity for release in which they will be able to demonstrate the mitigating factors of youth and their greater ability for rehabilitation. See id., at 736 (majority). In this state, juvenile offenders sentenced to greater than ten years incarceration will have a meaningful opportunity for release in a parole hearing during which the parole board will be able to consider the mitigating factors of youth.

If the parameters of the resentencing extended to the offender's current maturity, rehabilitation, ability to function in society, etc; then, it would, actually, be a parole hearing without the benefit of a statutorily authorized, qualified, Board of [Pardon and] Parole.
