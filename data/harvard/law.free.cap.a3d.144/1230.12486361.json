Petitioners, United\n   Insurance Company of America and the Reliable Life Insurance Company, insurance providers in the State of Maryland, filed a declaratory action against Respondents, the Maryland Insurance Administration, et al., (\"MIA\") in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, challenging the retroactive enforcement of Md. Code (2011 Repl. Vol., 2015 Supp.) \u00a7 16-118 of the Insurance Article(\"Ins.\"). Section 16-118imposes a duty on an insurer who \"issues, delivers, or renews a policy of life insurance or an annuity contract ...\" in the State to \"perform a comparison of [their] in-force life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained assets accounts against the latest version of a death master file to identify any death benefit payments that may be due. ...\" on a regular or semi-annual basis. Ins. \u00a7 16-118(c)(1)-(2)(i). Prior to this legislation, insurers were under no obligation to research whether a policyholder had died, and the statute did not indicate whether its provisions apply retroactively to existing insurance policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The circuit court dismissed Petitioners' action based on the failure to exhaust administrative remedies afforded by the Insurance Article. In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Special Appeals agreed, and affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.\n   <em>\n    United Insurance Company of America et al. v. Maryland Insurance Administration et al\n   </em>\n   ., No. 0020, Sept. Term 2014,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205968833\">\n    2015 WL 5968833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Md.Ct.Spec.App. Oct. 14, 2015). Thereafter, we granted certiorari. For the reasons that follow, we shall affirm the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Petitioners' in-force life insurance policies\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Petitioners offer life insurance policies to lower income individuals and families in the State of Maryland. The policies are subject to extensive regulation by the MIA, the agency that administers and regulates the State's insurance market. As of December 2011, Petitioners retained a combined total of approximately 135,000 in-force policies in the State. The average\n   face value of the policies was $5,000, with average monthly premiums of approximately $7.00. Petitioners calculated premium rates through a process that relies upon actuarial assumptions of an insured's life expectancy, the timing and frequency of claims payments, the anticipated rate of return on invested assets, and financial projections concerning anticipated administrative costs incurred during the policy benefit period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The policies provided that insurance proceeds would be paid upon \"receipt of due proof of death\" of the insured. Specifically, United Insurance Company of America's policies defined \"due proof of death\" as \"a certified copy of the death certificate, a certified copy of a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the finding of death or any other proof satisfactory to [the insurer].\" Petitioners' premium rates reflected costs savings realized by placing the obligation on beneficiaries to provide proof of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    The enactment of \u00a7 16-118 of the Insurance Article\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Maryland Senate Bill 77 (2012) was passed by the General Assembly, signed into law as \u00a7 16-118 of the Insurance Article, and became effective on October 1, 2013. The bill was introduced in response to the growing concern of questionable and unfair settlement practices by major life insurance companies, which allegedly often led to \"unknowing beneficiaries of life insurance policies\" missing timely receipt of\n   the settlements owed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See Testimony of Senator Delores G. Kelley on Senate Bill 77-Life Insurance and Annuities-Unfair Claim Settlement Practices-Failure to Cross-Check Death Master File Before the Senate Finance Committee on January 26,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    2012\n   </em>\n   , 430th Sess. (2012). The relevant provisions of Ins. \u00a7 16-118provide:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Duty of insurer to perform comparison of life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained asset accounts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (c)(1) An insurer that issues, delivers, or renews a policy of life insurance or an annuity contract in the State shall perform a comparison of the insurer's in-force life insurance policies, annuity contracts, and retained asset accounts against the latest version of a death master file\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   to identify any death benefit payments that may be due under the policies, contracts, or retained asset accounts as a result of the death of an insured, annuitant, or retained asset account holder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) An insurer shall perform the comparison required under paragraph (1) of this subsection:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (i) at regular intervals, on at least a semiannual basis; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (ii) in good faith, using criteria reasonably designed to identify individuals whose death would require the payment of benefits by the insurer under a life insurance policy, annuity contract, or retained asset account.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (3) For a group life insurance policy, an insurer is not required to perform the comparison required under paragraph (1) of this subsection unless the insurer provides full record-keeping services to the group life insurance policy holder.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ins. \u00a7 16-118 (c)(1)-(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   If the comparison reveals a match in the Social Security Administration's Death Master File, an insurer is required to\n   1) \"conduct a good faith effort to confirm the death of the insured, annuitant, or retained asset account holder using other available records and information;\" 2) \"determine whether benefits are due under the applicable life insurance policy, annuity contract, or retained asset account;\" and 3) \"use good faith efforts to locate the beneficiary\" and \"provide to the beneficiary the appropriate claims forms and instructions necessary to make a claim[,]\" \"if benefits are due under the policy, contract, or retained asset account.\" Ins. \u00a7 16-118(d)(1)(i)-(iii)(1)-(2). The statute does not reflect whether insurers are required to perform the comparison for in-force policies prior to the statute's effective date.\n   Failure to comply with the requirements of Ins. \u00a7 16-118constitutes an \"unfair claim settlement practice[,]\" Ins. \u00a7 27-303(10), punishable by civil penalties up to $2,500 per violation, Ins. \u00a7 27-305(a)(1) or restitutionary penalties, Ins. \u00a7 27-305(c)(1). For violations of Ins. \u00a7 27-304 (unfair claim settlement practices committed with frequency), the Commissioner is authorized to revoke or suspend an insurer's license, Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 27-305(b); 4-113; issue cease and desist orders, Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 27-103; 4-114; or impose misdemeanor penalties, Ins. \u00a7 1-301.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Petitioners' challenge to Ins. \u00a7 16-118\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On February 28, 2013, Petitioners, through their representatives, attended a meeting with the then-Insurance Commissioner, Therese M. Goldsmith (\"Commissioner Goldsmith\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   who indicated her view that Ins. \u00a7 16-118applied to all in-force policies, including those in effect prior to the statute's effective date. Commissioner Goldsmith further advised that she would enforce the requirements of the statute against all of Petitioners' in-force policies. Thereafter, in July 2013, Petitioners filed a civil action against the MIA and Commissioner Goldsmith in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County, seeking a declaration that the statute was inapplicable to insurance policies issued prior to its effective date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Petitioners advanced the following grounds for relief: 1) the retroactive enforcement of the statute violated Articles 19\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and 24\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40\n   <sup>\n    6\n   </sup>\n   of the Maryland Constitution; 2) the retroactive enforcement of the statute abrogated their substantive contract rights in violation of those same provisions; and 3) the retroactive enforcement of the statute constituted an unconstitutional impairment of their contractual rights in violation of Article I, \u00a7 10\n   <sup>\n    7\n   </sup>\n   of the United States Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Petitioners sought a judgment declaring that the statute did not apply retroactively to their in-force policies as of the effective date, or alternatively, that retroactive enforcement of the statute would be void because it violated one or more constitutional provisions. The MIA filed a motion to dismiss, alleging that the Insurance Article provided administrative remedies that Petitioners were required to exhaust before seeking relief in the circuit court. In granting MIA's motion, the court held that the administrative remedy outlined in Ins. \u00a7 2-210\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   must be exhausted before Petitioners\n   pursued a\n   declaratory judgment, given the strong presumption that the available remedy was primary,\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., a remedy in which a claimant must first invoke and exhaust before seeking a judicial remedy, and the absence of factors weighing against that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The court further held that Petitioners' claim did not fall within the exception to the administrative exhaustion requirement, since the claim was not solely a constitutional challenge to the General Assembly's authority to enact retroactive legislation, but was also a challenge to the MIA's interpretation and application of the law regarding retroactivity. Thereafter, Petitioners noted a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In considering the factors enunciated in\n   <em>\n    Zappone v. Liberty Life Ins.

If applied to those policies, the [statute] would require [Petitioners] to assume substantial new obligations that were never contemplated or agreed to by [Petitioners], that are contrary to the long-standing allocation of rights and responsibilities under [Petitioners'] policies, and that undermine the actuarial and economic assumptions underlying those policies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   [Ins. \u00a7 16-118] imposes substantial new obligations on life insurers licensed to issue policies in the State, including in particular, the obligation to perform a [Social Security Death Master File] search for all in-force policies within six months of the [statute's] effective date, and to then confirm the insureds' deaths, determine whether benefits are payable, and locate beneficiaries.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   Failure to comply with any of the requirements of [Ins. \u00a7 16-118] constitutes an 'unfair claim settlement practice' under the Maryland Insurance Code Md.

As reflected in Petitioners' complaint, the Commissioner expressly declared that the MIA would enforce the requirements of Ins. \u00a7 16-118to all of Petitioners' in-force policies, including those policies issued prior to the statute's effective date. If Petitioners failed to comply with the requirements, they would be in violation of the statute and subject to civil or criminal penalties (\n   <em>\n    i.e\n   </em>\n   ., losses) for engaging in \"unfair claim settlement practices.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ins. \u00a7\u00a7 27-303(10); 27-305. Commissioner Goldsmith's statement constituted a threat to Petitioners because \"enforc[ing] the requirements of [Ins. \u00a7 16-118] against all of [Petitioners'] in-force policies, including those issued prior to the [statute's] effective date, ...\" would impose economic losses, or alternatively, civil or criminal penalties for non-compliance. Thus, by virtue of the Commissioner's \"threatened act,\" Petitioners are the \"person[s] aggrieved[,]\" who upon written demand, can pursue relief by requesting a hearing before the Commissioner. Ins. \u00a7 2-210(a)(2)(ii).\n   Accordingly, Petitioners' assertion that Commissioner Goldsmith's \"informal\" statement during a non-public meeting prior to the statute's effective date was not a threatened act within the meaning of Ins. \u00a7 2-210, is unavailing. As an initial matter, a \"threat\" contemplates impending action,\n   <em>\n    see supra\n   </em>\n   . Thus, the fact that the statement was made prior to the statute's effective date is of no consequence. Moreover, the context and location of Commissioner Goldsmith's statement is not dispositive, because it does not negate the impending effect, which, in our view, was intended to further the statute's purpose, and encourage Petitioners' compliance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Additionally, as the Court of Special Appeals observed, the fact that the Commissioner is authorized to review both \"acts\" and \"threatened acts,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Ins. \u00a7 2-210(a)(2)(ii), under the statute is particularly significant, because it reveals the General Assembly's intent to encompass imminent action, such as Commissioner Goldsmith's declaration that Ins. \u00a7 16-118would be enforced retroactively.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United Insurance\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%205968833\">\n    2015 WL 5968833\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We are similarly not persuaded by Petitioners' alternative argument concerning the scope of the remedy provided under Ins. \u00a7 2-210. Petitioners aver that assuming Commissioner Goldsmith's statement constituted a threat, administrative exhaustion was not required because they were entitled to request a hearing under Ins. \u00a7 2-210at their discretion, which provided the \"option,\" and not an \"obligation\" to pursue administrative relief or a declaratory judgment (emphasis omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   While the statute does not reflect that an aggrieved party\n   <em>\n    must\n   </em>\n   request a hearing, this does not mean that Ins. \u00a7 2-210is a concurrent remedy. Petitioners' focus on their right to \"make[ ] the election\" ignores long-standing Maryland precedent, which expressly provides that an administrative remedy is intended to be primary, unless the presumption is rebutted, or an aggrieved party's claim is exempt from administrative exhaustion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Zappone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267471\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/349/45/#p64\">\n    349 Md. at 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1267471\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/349/45/#p64\">\n    706 A.2d at 1070\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Prince George's County v.

On February 28, 2013, approximately seven months prior to the statute's effective date, Petitioners were advised of the MIA's plans for retroactive enforcement during a meeting with Commissioner Goldsmith and the Principal Counsel for the Office of the Attorney General.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Since the statute did not expressly or impliedly indicate whether it applied retroactively to Petitioners' in-force policies, they were not on notice of the enforcement until approximately seven months before compliance was required\n   <em>\n    .

Petitioners alleged:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   Applying the [statute's] requirements retroactively to the thousands of life insurance policies already in force on its effective date fundamentally restructures the terms of [Petitioners'] policies and the parties' long-settled understanding of their respective rights and obligations. [Petitioners'] existing life insurance policies were not priced to account for these new obligations or the assumption of these new costs and claim settlement procedures. Instead, the premium rates on [Petitioners'] in-force policies reflect their contractual expectations that a person seeking to claim benefits must furnish [Petitioners] with a claim and due proof of death and that, consequently, [Petitioners] do not have an obligation to proactively determine whether an insured is deceased or to incur administrative costs to search for proof of an insured's death or locate potential beneficiaries. The premiums also reflect the contractual expectation that [Petitioners] will retain and invest cash flows from the policies until either a claim is submitted or the insured reaches the mortality limiting age (typically, 99 years old). If the insured attains the mortality limiting age without a death claim being filed, the policy is deemed 'matured' and [Petitioners] are then obligated to pay the policy proceeds to the policy owner.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   [Petitioners] set premium rates when a policy is issued and are prohibited from adjusting premium rates on in-force policies to account for these new obligations and costs. As a consequence, retroactively applying [Ins. \u00a7 16-118] to in-force policies deprives [Petitioners] of essential contractual rights and forces them to assume duties and costs that were never part of the contractual relationship with their policy owners. Retroactive application of the [statute's] requirements would alter the economics of [Petitioners'] contractual relationships, increasing the costs of the overall administration of their insurance business and depriving [Petitioners] of related investment income that is critical to the financial health of the business and that facilitates the orderly payment of claims to all policyholders. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   However, given the narrow procedural issue before this Court, specifically, whether Petitioners must first exhaust administrative remedies before pursuing a declaratory judgment, and in light of our conclusion\n   <em>\n    infra\n   </em>\n   , that Petitioners' claim is within the MIA's expertise, we shall not engage in an assessment regarding the reasonable reliance and settled expectations of future interests or vested rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   <strong>\n    ii.
