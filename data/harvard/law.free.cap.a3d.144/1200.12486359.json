The answer to that particular question, however, does not resolve the matter at hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Rather, we must look to another aspect of the UPPA and, further, review once again advisory only instructions given at the time that they were mandated by Article 23 of the\n   Maryland Declaration of Rights. Today, we put to an end finally any question surrounding such instructions and the effect that they have upon an individual's criminal trial. We reaffirm our holding in\n   <em>\n    State v.

Such error, upon a proper petition for postconviction relief or motion to reopen a postconviction proceeding, entitles an individual to a new trial. We further hold that the Court of Special Appeals is statutorily authorized to review for an abuse of discretion a circuit court's denial of a motion to reopen and may remand the matter to the circuit court with instruction to award appropriate relief if the circuit court abused that discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Advisory only instructions have a tortured history in this State. They are derived from Article 23, which reads: \"In the trial of all criminal cases, the Jury shall be the Judges of Law, as well as of fact, except that the Court may pass upon the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a conviction.\" Based upon that constitutional mandate, we required judges under then-Maryland Rule 756b \"[i]n every case in which instructions are given to the jury [to] instruct the jury that they are the judges of the law and that the court's instructions are advisory only.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In 1980, in\n   <em>\n    Stevenson v.

The Court held that Article 23 was constitutional on its face, reasoning that Article 23 limited the jurors' role as judges of the law only with respect to \"disputes as to the substantive 'law of the crime.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 180,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=423%20A.2d%20558\">\n    423 A.2d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   Court reasoned that, because \"certain bedrock characteristics\" of a criminal trial, such as the presumption of innocence and the standard of proof, \"are not 'the law of the crime' \" they are likewise \"not advisory.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 91,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=437%20A.2d%20654\">\n    437 A.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   We were confronted again with a postconviction case concerning advisory only instructions in\n   <em>\n    State v.

On August 14, 2012, shortly after we had decided\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   , Respondent moved\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   to reopen his postconviction proceeding on the ground that the jurors at his criminal trial were given advisory only instructions in violation of his constitutional right to due process of law. Respondent argued that\n   those instructions were unconstitutional because the jury was not instructed to follow the court's explanation of the law and the court did not inform the jury of the binding nature of its instructions on the State's burden of proof or the presumption of innocence. The trial court instructed the jury, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Madam Foreman, Ladies and Gentlemen of the jury,\n   <em>\n    at this point in the proceedings I am required to advise you concerning the law in this case.\n    <strong>\n     I purposely use the term \"advise\" since in a criminal case, under Maryland law, you are the judges of both the law and the facts.\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   However, I wish foremost to impress upon you that you should not reach any conclusion from anything that I have said or may say from my tone of voice or manner in saying it, that I have an opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused. This decision is yours to make, solely, based upon the facts derived from the competent testimony which has been presented for your consideration\n   <em>\n    as applied to the law as you find it to be. In this regard, should court and counsel appear to differ as to [the] law which is applicable, you should apply the law as you find it to be, not as you think it should be.\n   </em>\n   And during this process you are not privileged to make new law.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   In arriving at your verdict,\n   <em>\n    you're advised\n   </em>\n   that in this State an accused is entitled throughout the entire proceedings to the presumption of innocence. The burden constantly rests upon the State to convince you beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty of every fact material to the guilt of the accused, including every circumstance that enters into [the] grade or the degree of the crime charged.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   <em>\n    You're further advised\n   </em>\n   that the burden is on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt not only that the offense was committed but also it was the defendant who is the person who committed these offenses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   .... And you must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the accuracy of the identification of the defendant before you may convict him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   To warrant a conviction in a criminal case, the charge must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. If you, the jury, consider all the evidence and entertain a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's participation in the crime, you\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   acquit him. Thus, a defendant is entitled to an acquittal if the alibi evidence taken into consideration with all of the other evidence in the case, raises a reasonable doubt of guilt.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Gentlemen, that concludes the\n   <em>\n    advisory instructions.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The State argued in response that the court's instructions were not advisory because\n   they did not permit the jury to disregard the law. The State asserted that the instructions given at Respondent's trial \"materially differed from the\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   Court's instructions\" because the court did not \"instruct the jury that the instructions were not binding upon them.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The circuit court denied Respondent's motion without a hearing. In the court's written order, the court stated that, \"[o]n November 5, 2012, D. Scott Whitney, Chief Attorney for the Office of the Public Defender delivered a copy of the transcript from the September 14 and 15, 1978 Jury Trial before Judge Childs.\" The circuit court then denied the motion, \"having read and considered Defendant's Motion, Amendments to Motion to Reopen Post Conviction Proceedings, Response and\n   <em>\n    transcript.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Respondent, now represented by the Office of the Public Defender, filed an application for leave to appeal. He argued that the circuit court abused its discretion by denying his motion to reopen because, similar to\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   , the \"clear message conveyed to the jury was that it was the ultimate arbiter of the law, despite what the judge said.\" The State reasserted that, unlike the instructions in\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   , \"the court's instructions to Adams-Bey's jury presented it with a clear role,\" and\n   therefore the instructions did not implicate Respondent's due process rights or warrant reopening his postconviction proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In an unreported two-page opinion, the Court of Special Appeals granted Respondent's application for leave to appeal and addressed the merits of his appeal. The Court, citing the pertinent portion of the trial court's instructions, recognized that the jurors in Respondent's trial received an advisory only instruction similar to that given in\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   . Noting Respondent's argument that the \"circuit court had abused its discretion in denying his motion,\" and that\n   <em>\n    Waine\n   </em>\n   had clarified that an advisory only instruction was structural error that \"mandated that the convictions be vacated,\" the Court \"reverse[d] the circuit court's order denying Adams-Bey's motion to reopen his post-conviction proceeding\" and remanded \"to reopen Adams-Bey's post-conviction proceeding to consider his\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   claim and, thereafter, to vacate Adams-Bey's convictions and award him a new trial.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   As noted at the outset of this opinion, we granted certiorari in this case to review the provisions of the UPPA that grant the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals their respective authority to decide a motion to reopen in the first instance and to review that decision on appeal.

Section 7-109 grants the Court of Special Appeals the authority to\n   <em>\n    reverse\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    remand\n   </em>\n   a circuit court's decision to deny a motion to reopen. That section therefore\n   provides the Court of Special Appeals the authority to determine that the circuit court had abused its discretion and to afford the appropriate relief. If our intermediate appellate court was powerless to grant relief when a circuit court abused its discretion, then, as Respondent argues, the \" 'interests of justice standard' and the right to appellate review are meaningless.\" Section 7-109 permits such meaningful review, and we hold that the Court of Special Appeals acted within its statutory authority under \u00a7 7-109 in reviewing the circuit court's decision for an abuse of discretion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   We also hold that the Court of Special Appeals concluded correctly that the circuit court abused its discretion in denying Respondent's motion to reopen.

Like in\n   <em>\n    Gray\n   </em>\n   , we can discern the circuit court's rationale for denying Respondent's motion to reopen. The basis of Respondent's motion was his\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   claim, and the briefs in support of each party were largely devoted to the question of whether the instructions given at Respondent's trial were sufficiently \"advisory\" to satisfy the \"interests of justice\" standard for reopening his postconviction proceeding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court considered both parties' arguments and \"read and considered\" the transcript of Respondent's jury trial, yet denied the motion nevertheless. Having read the transcript of Respondent's trial, including the jury instructions, the circuit court concluded necessarily that those instructions were not advisory and therefore\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   did not warrant reopening his postconviction proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The parties dispute whether the instructions given at Respondent's trial were sufficiently \"advisory\" to run afoul of due process.

Consequently, the latter portion of the\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   rule-that the jury is bound by the court's instructions on the law other than the substantive law of the crime-is necessary to render constitutional an advisory only instruction.

Thus, for example, in my view, where a trial court instructs a jury that the trial court's instructions on the law of the crime are \"advisory only,\" but that all of the trial court's other instructions are binding, such instructions would not be deemed \"advisory instructions\" of the type that\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   proscribes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Determining that instructions are indeed \"advisory instructions\" requires more than a determination that the instructions are \"similar\" to those in\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   . Here, the Court of Special Appeals was required to go further than simply stating that \"the trial court at Adams-Bey's 1978 trial gave a similar 'advisory only' jury instruction[.]\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   I do not disagree that\n   Md.

To reverse and remand to the circuit court for reopening and a new trial under CP \u00a7 7-109, however, an appellate court is required to determine that the jury instructions were indeed \"advisory instructions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Similarly, a trial court that is faced with a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding based on an\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   claim must evaluate whether the jury instructions were indeed \"advisory instructions,\" as defined by\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   . The Majority's use of the term \"necessarily,\" Maj. Op. at 706-07, 144 A.3d at 1210, does not mean that a trial court should automatically grant a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding based on an\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   claim-or, for that matter, grant such a petition because the jury instructions were \"similar\" to those that the trial court gave in\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   . Instead, a trial court, when faced with a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding-and the Court of Special Appeals, when faced with an application for leave to appeal from the denial of a petition to reopen a postconviction proceeding-must determine whether the jury was instructed that the trial court's instructions on matters other than the law of the crime, such as the State's burden of proof and the presumption of innocence, were \"advisory.\" Here, however, in its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals did not make such a determination. The Majority affirms the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals only after analyzing the instant jury instructions and determining that they were indeed \"advisory.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maj. Op. at 706-07, 144 A.3d at 1210. From my perspective, though, although the Majority determines that the instructions in this case were \"advisory instructions,\" the Majority opinion is not clear that, going forward, trial and appellate courts must engage in a similar determination that alleged advisory instructions are indeed \"advisory instructions\" before granting relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   What is clear is that, when confronted with\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   claims, trial courts and the Court of Special Appeals must review the jury instructions and determine whether they were indeed \"advisory instructions\" that\n   <em>\n    Unger\n   </em>\n   proscribes.
