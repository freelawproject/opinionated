That type of savings clause, often referred to as an \"interpretive aide savings clause\", restricts actions taken by the personal representative that could reduce\n   the tax benefit of the marital deduction and\n   assists with the interpretation and explanation of the testator's intent with respect to preventing adverse tax consequences.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Eugene Lyle Stoler,\n   <em>\n    Savings Clauses\n   </em>\n   , The CPA Journal, 25 (April 1999); Charles A.

Plan. 72\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). The interpretive aide savings clause \"attempts to elucidate the testator's or grantor's prevailing intentions with regard to securing the marital deduction,\" Redd at 72, and is \"a provision that takes away a power or changes a provision that is expressly given elsewhere in the instrument and is, therefore, in direct conflict with that other express power or provision.\" Stoler at 25;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   William Parsons,\n   <em>\n    Lifetime and Testamentary Estate Planning\n   </em>\n   , 74 (9th ed. 1983). The interpretive aide savings clause, therefore, can express the testator's intent that any authority granted to the personal representative is void should it reduce the efficacy of the marital deduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Internal Revenue Service has recognized the validity of an interpretive aide savings clause in Rev. Rul. 75-440 (1975). Addressed in Revenue Ruling 75-440 was a situation in which a will provided for both a marital trust and a residuary trust and granted authority to the trustees to invest trust principal in non-income producing life insurance. The will also included a savings clause that stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   Notwithstanding anything herein contained to the contrary, any power, duty, or discretionary authority granted to my Fiduciary hereunder shall be absolutely void to the extent that either the right to exercise or the exercise thereof, shall in any way affect, jeopardize or cause my estate to lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded my estate by the Marital Deduction under either Federal or State Laws.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. Since life insurance policies are not income producing property and often require that premiums be paid, a beneficiary of a marital trust that owned such property would not be entitled to all of the income, thereby eviscerating the marital deduction.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The trusts in question permitted such investment, and the question was whether that permission applied to the marital trust and, therefore, disqualified it from inclusion\n   in the marital deduction. The Revenue Ruling concluded, however, that the interpretive aide savings clause in the will was helpful to interpret the testator's intent not to authorize the trustees to invest marital trust assets in non-income producing life insurance in order to qualify for the marital deduction:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The savings clause is not a savings clause in the strict sense of the term, but is an aid in determining the testator's intent; that is, the existence of a savings clause that would 'void' a disqualifying power given to the trustees of the marital deduction trust is relevant here only because it helps indicate the testator's intent not to give those trustees a disqualifying power.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

In September of 2014, Mrs. Clancy petitioned in the Orphans' Court for a Declaratory Judgment in which she sought a determination that the Family Trust was not obligated to pay any estate taxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   A hearing as to the construction and interpretation of the Will and the Second\n   Codicil was held in December of 2014 before Chief Judge Lewyn Scott Garrett of the Orphans' Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Judge Garrett, thereafter, issued a Memorandum and Order in which he determined that the resolution of the issue was dependent upon whether the Savings Clause in ITEM TWELVETH, as amended by the Second Codicil, prohibited the personal representative from requiring that the Family Trust contribute to the payment of estate taxes. Judge Garrett determined that the Savings Clause in the Will, as amended by the Second Codicil, constituted a \"valid interpretive aid savings clause\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   In my view, the Savings Clause is a valid interpretive aid savings clause. The Savings Clause is applicable to the entire will and is not dependent on a court ruling or IRS determination. Instead, it is a clear expression of the testator's intent to have the Family Trust qualify for the marital deduction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   He noted that, generally, there are two types of savings clauses designed to preserve the marital deduction, (1) \"condition subsequent\" savings clauses; and (2) \"interpretive aid\" savings clauses, and that an interpretive aid savings clause was \"designed to stand on its own with the purpose\n   of clarifying the testator's intent in the event of a perceived ambiguity or contradiction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Judge Garrett concluded, as a result of the singular focus of the Second Codicil on qualifying the Family Trust for the marital deduction, that the Savings Clause reflected Mr. Clancy's predominant intent that the Family Trust be free of any Federal estate tax liability:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   In exercise of our jurisdiction to construe a will, incidental to the administration of the Estate, this Court finds that the Will restricts the [Personal Representative] from requiring the Family Trust to contribute to the payment of estate taxes. Although the Tax Clause and division of the residuary trusts provide some evidence that the Testator intended the Family Trust to share in the estate tax liability with the Older Children's Trust, this Court finds the express language\n   of the Savings Clause as the clearest and the predominant evidence of the Testator's intent, which can only be achieved if the Family Trust is free of estate tax liability. This court also finds that the plain language of the Savings Clause, which prevents the [Personal Representative] from taking any action that would prevent the Family Trust from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction, necessarily includes restricting the payment of estate taxes as each payment of estate tax causes a recalculation of the estate tax and a loss of the marital deduction. ... Furthermore, this court finds that the overwhelming purpose of the Second Codicil is to qualify the Family Trust for the marital deduction and reduce the overall estate tax liability. This Court is also bound by the rule, where if there is a conflict between a will and a codicil, \"the codicil as the last expression of the testator's will and intention must be given effect.\"\n   <em>\n    Wiesenfeld v.

In\n   <em>\n    Posner\n   </em>\n   , the surviving spouse, who had received the benefit of a marital deduction for federal estate tax purposes for property conveyed to her when her husband subsequently died, having disinherited two of her three children. The two children, then, disputed the efficacy of their disinheritance in the mother's will and sought to \"resurrect\" their father's will, which had divided his residuary estate among the three children.

It refers only to the Federal estate tax marital deduction.

In order to qualify the Family Trust for the QTIP election, Mr. Clancy directed that Mrs. Clancy had a qualifying income interest for life, that she was entitled to all of the income from the property payable annually, that no person had the power to appoint any part of the property to anyone other than her as well as that Mrs. Clancy was provided with the power to request distribution of corpus from the trustee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   We agree with the Older Children that it is clear that a testator could direct that the burden of inheritance taxes could be placed on legatees who otherwise would not have to pay such taxes,\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   as well as payment of estate taxes on the marital\n   share,\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   as the Older Children have asserted.\n   Mr. Clancy,\n   however, in his estate documents did not burden the marital share with payment of federal estate taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Moreover, were the Family Trust to bear the burden of federal estate taxes, at the time of Mr. Clancy's death, the corpus of that trust would be subject to imposition of federal estate taxes twice, at the time of Mr. Clancy's death as well as when Mrs. Clancy died. The establishment of the QTIP Trust in Mr. Clancy's Will insures that the Younger Child will have to pay estate taxes when Mrs. Clancy dies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=26%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202044\">\n    26 U.S.C. \u00a7 2044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Certainly, as each party agrees, Mr. Clancy intended to minimize the impact of federal estate taxes in the entirety of his Will, an intent that would be eviscerated by double taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Finally, the Older Children question having the burden of federal estate taxation being placed on them, to the benefit of Mrs. Clancy. Mr. Clancy, however, clearly intended, by the establishment of the QTIP Trust, to benefit Mrs. Clancy to the detriment of the Younger Child, whose remainder could be diminished by Mrs. Clancy's invasion of corpus for need. As a\n   result, all of Mr. Clancy's children are burdened for the benefit of Mrs. Clancy and to avoid federal estate tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In conclusion, we hold that the property conveyed in the Family Trust as identified in Mr. Clancy's Will and Second Codicil cannot be burdened by the payment of federal estate taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE ORPHANS' COURT AFFIRMED; COSTS IN THIS COURT TO BE PAID BY APPELLANTS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Barbera, C.J., Greene and McDonald, JJ., dissent\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Dissenting Opinion by McDonald, J., which Barbera, C.J., and Greene, J., join\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   The Majority opinion appears to be based on the premise that the pre-eminent value for any testator is the avoidance of taxes. Perhaps there are people like that. If so, one would expect them to have bought a Yugo years ago and scrupulously maintained it to minimize and thereafter avoid the automobile excise tax.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In fact, while paying no more taxes than necessary is significant, most people have other values that also inform important decisions for their lives-and for their heirs. In the purchase of a car, for example, interests in function, reliability, comfort, and safety may dissuade a person from purchasing the cheapest-and least taxed-car, although that may mean paying more in tax. So also is the case in devising an estate plan. As this Court has observed, \"[m]inimizing estate and\n   inheritance taxes for beneficiaries ... may not always be the ultimate driving force behind the testator's decisions regarding the provisions contained in his or her will.\"\n   <em>\n    Noble v.

In the view of Mr. Clancy's Personal Representative,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   that amendment had the effect of achieving a significant reduction in tax liability (from $26 million to $15.7 million) while retaining the equal distribution (50% - 50%) of the residual of the estate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The reading of the will urged by Mrs. Clancy would achieve a smaller additional tax reduction (from $15.7 million to $11.8 million), but would cast aside the plan for equal distributions from the residual despite the fact that the language of the will directing equal distributions was not amended-and skew the distributions from the residual in her favor (63% - 37%).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The Majority opinion opts for Mrs. Clancy's interpretation of the will-an interpretation in which an amended savings clause is construed to contradict basic terms of the original will that remained unchanged. However, we ordinarily read provisions of\n   wills to be consistent unless there is no way to do so. In my view, the savings clause can be read consistently\n   with the original will to achieve the tax savings for which codicil was intended without discarding the basic estate plan.

There appears to be no dispute among the parties that, in directing how estate taxes are to be paid, Mr. Clancy opted out of the apportionment statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The will then provides that \"one-half of the remainder of my residuary estate shall be paid over and distributed to my trustee as [the Family Trust]\" and \"the other one-half of the remainder of my residuary estate shall be\" paid over and distributed to the trustee as the Older Children's Trusts.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (Item Sixth (B), (C)). Unlike the provision concerning the part of the estate (the Marital Share) used to fund the Marital Trust, the parts of the estate used to fund the Family Trust and the Older Children's Trusts are not to be \"set apart\" before the payment of taxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The will also contained a Savings Clause to ensure that the Marital Share would qualify for the marital deduction when estate taxes are computed. It explicitly limited the Personal Representative's or trustees' authority to do anything that would prevent the estate \"from receiving the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . (Item Twelveth (D)).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   The Second Codicil\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   amended the will in several respects to allow the Family Trust to qualify for the marital deduction when estate taxes are computed. For example, that codicil eliminated a provision of the will that terminated Mrs. Clancy's\n   interest if she remarried and also eliminated a provision of the will that allowed the trustee discretion to use the funds in the Family Trust for the benefit of the minor child during Mrs. Clancy's lifetime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at 593-95, 144 A.3d at 812-13 (amendments of Item Eighth). Consistent with those amendments, the Second Codicil also amended the Savings Clause to ensure that the Family Trust, like the Marital\n   Share, would qualify for the deduction when taxes are computed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, with respect to the\n   <em>\n    payment\n   </em>\n   of taxes, the Second Codicil did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   amend Item Third to provide that the Family Trust was to be set apart before the payment of taxes. Thus, the plain meaning of the text of the will, as amended by the Second Codicil, requires that the Marital Share and the funds intended for the Family Trust both qualify for the marital deduction when taxes are computed; however, the Marital Share is \"set apart\" from the funds used to pay those taxes while the one-half of the residuary estate used to fund the Family Trust is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   <em>\n    Reconciling the Will and Second Codicil\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   In short, the will provides that the Family Trust and the Older Children's Trusts receive equal shares of the residual of the estate after payment of taxes. The Second Codicil provides that the estate should receive the benefit of the marital deduction with respect to both the Marital Share and the Family Trust in the computation of estate tax liability. If these two provisions can be reconciled, then ordinary principles of will construction require that we read them to be consistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   As an initial matter, we ought to expect that these two provisions can be reconciled. While the operative language in the amended Savings Clause comes from the Second Codicil, the original will contained nearly identical language. Here, there is no evidence of a textual conflict. All that the Savings Clause requires-both before and after its amendment by the Second Codicil-is that the estate \"receiv[e] the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth.\" In order to receive the benefit of the marital deduction, the estate's personal representative must file the appropriate form so as to qualify for QTIP treatment the property in which Mrs. Clancy will have a terminable interest-as relevant here, the Family Trust-and not exercise the various discretionary powers authorized under the will (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Item Thirteenth) in a way that would undermine that election. Thus, the Savings Clause can be read to require merely that the Personal Representative fill out the appropriate form and abide by the other changes to the Family Trust to qualify the Family Trust for QTIP treatment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Doing so in no way conflicts with paying the taxes out of the residual before the Family Trust and Older Children's Trusts are funded and thereby maintaining the equal distributions specified in the will.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <em>\n    The Majority Opinion's Approach\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   In adopting Mrs. Clancy's preferred interpretation the Majority opinion finds an \"apparent conflict\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   and resolves it by\n   holding that the Second Codicil \"trumps\" the specific directions in the will (in Item Third) concerning the payment of\n   taxes, even though the Second Codicil made no change to those directions. Majority op. at 599-600, 144 A.3d at 815-16. In my view, the Majority opinion is mistaken and there is no need to resort to such radical surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   The reasoning of the Majority opinion appears to be that the Savings Clause, by itself, mandates that the residual estate be distributed so as to obtain the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   marital deduction with respect to the Family Trust, despite the fact that Item Third prescribes such treatment only for the Marital Share. This entails \"setting apart\" one-half of the residual destined for the Family Trust\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the payment of taxes, with the result that the half of the residual devoted to the Older Children's Trusts absorbs all of the responsibility for payment of taxes. Thus, an amendment of the will that on its face affected only the\n   <em>\n    computation\n   </em>\n   of taxes is being construed to alter the directions in the will for the\n   <em>\n    payment\n   </em>\n   of taxes and radically changes the relative distributions to the beneficiaries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   In essence, the Majority opinion, without explanation, reads the Second Codicil as expressing Mr. Clancy's intent that the distribution of his estate maximize the marital deduction at all costs. There is simply no basis for this interpretation. The Second Codicil provides that the estate must receive \"the benefit of the marital deduction as hereinbefore set forth,\" not \"the benefit of the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   marital deduction,\" so the text provides no support to the Majority opinion's reading. As justification for its interpretation, the Majority opinion relies on a case in which the will specifically provided that it was to preserve \"the\n   <em>\n    maximum\n   </em>\n   marital deduction.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Majority op. at 599-600, 144 A.3d at 816 citing\n   <em>\n    Northeastern Pennsylvania Nat.

Majority op. at 601-02, 144 A.3d at 816-17. But that appears likely to happen any time a testator\n   opts out of the apportionment statute and elects to allocate the payment of some part of the tax to assets that could otherwise fund a distribution that would qualify for the marital deduction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is telling that the testator here referred to the Marital Share being \"set apart\" before the payment of taxes, but did not use that language in relation to the funds intended for the Family Trust-nor amend Item Sixth in that respect as part of the Second Codicil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n   Mrs. Clancy's interpretation-adopted by the Majority opinion-would skew the distribution of the residual estate significantly in her favor contrary to basic provisions of the will while reducing the estate's tax liability somewhat more than what it would otherwise be. It does so by interpreting the Savings Clause to effect a radical change in the estate plan without any explicit direction to do so. The Personal Representative's construction of the will and codicil would treat the Savings Clause for what it is-a savings clause-and maintain the equal distribution of the residual specified in the will, both originally and as amended, while achieving the significantly reduced tax liability that is the evident aim of the Second Codicil.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Even assuming that the Second Codicil\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   mean what the Majority opinion reads it to mean-which is far from clear-we ordinarily resolve textual ambiguities in favor of consistency, not inconsistency. Where there are two possible interpretations of a provision of a codicil, one which conflicts with the original will and one which does not, our precedents favor adoption of the interpretation that does not conflict. Thus, even if the Second Codicil were ambiguous, it ought to be interpreted to be consistent with the original will rather than to contradict it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   Chief Judge Barbera and Judge Greene have advised that they join this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-171\">\n    <em>\n     Gregory v.

But if that were true, then there would be no conflict, and that provision of the original will concerning payment of taxes from the residual after the Marital Share is set aside should remain operative.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-256\">\n    The Majority opinion also cites an IRS revenue ruling that is similarly distinguishable from this case.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Majority op. at 600-01, 144 A.3d at 816-17 (citing Rev. Rul. 75-440 (1975) ). That ruling concerned a will that directed the creation of a trust in an amount equal to the \"maximum marital deduction\" and gave further detailed directions as to the computation of that amount to ensure that the maximum amount was transferred to the trust. Consistent with those provisions, a savings clause in the will limited any action by the testator's Fiduciary that would \"lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded my estate by the Marital Deduction.\" By contrast, the Savings Clause in Mr. Clancy's will does not contain language concerning the maximum marital deduction or the loss of \"any part\" of the marital deduction.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-257\">\n    It is true, as the Majority opinion observes (Majority op. at 582-84, 144 A.3d at 805-06) that federal law has been amended over the years to remove a statutory cap on the maximum marital deduction. Of course, that does not mean there is no longer a \"maximum\" deduction for particular circumstances.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-258\">\n    For example, in\n    <em>\n     Estate of Fine v.

A savings clause limited the authority of the executor to do anything that would \"lose all or any part of the tax benefit afforded by the marital deduction.\" The Tax Court construed the will to provide for payment of taxes out of funds that could otherwise have funded the widow's share and therefore would have qualified for the marital deduction. The court also noted that the testator contemplated such a result in opting out of the state apportionment statute.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
