Barclay &amp; Stubbs, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757677\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/804/#p812\">\n    225 Conn. 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 812,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20A.2d%20729\">\n    626 A.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) (\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   ). We are now called upon to decide whether that power extends to the summary enforcement of agreements reached both outside the framework of and before the start of the litigation in which enforcement is sought.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The self-represented plaintiff, former teacher Samuel da Silva Matos, appeals from the judgment of the trial court summarily enforcing the Release and Separation Agreement he signed in 2012,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   upon resigning his position with the defendant Board of Education of the Town of Windham (board). As part of the Release and Separation Agreement, the plaintiff waived his right to sue the defendant board and its superintendent, defendant Ana Ortiz.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the plaintiff sued the defendants two years\n   later, the court treated that contract, for\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   purposes, as an agreement to settle pending litigation. The court therefore held a hearing, found that the contract was unambiguous and enforceable, and rendered judgment against the plaintiff, ending the litigation while it was still at the pleading stage. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   does not countenance such a result. Rather, a settlement agreement is summarily enforceable under\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   as an agreement to settle litigation only if the parties reached the agreement\n   <em>\n    after commencing the relevant litigation.\n   </em>\n   Because the Release and Separation Agreement here fails that test, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings according to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts, as found by the court or otherwise undisputed, are relevant here. The defendants hired the plaintiff in September, 2001, and assigned him teaching duties at the Windham Middle School. During the plaintiff's time at the middle school, he was a member of the local teachers union, the Windham Federation of Teachers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On November 11, 2011, the defendants received a report from the assistant principal of the middle school that the plaintiff had touched a student on the face, making her uncomfortable. The matter was referred to the Department of Children and Families (department) for investigation, and the defendants simultaneously conducted an internal investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On January 10, 2012, a department worker filed a report substantiating the allegations against the plaintiff for emotional neglect and recommending that he be\n   placed on the department's child abuse and neglect central registry. Ultimately, more than one year later on March 12, 2013, a department hearing officer rejected that finding and recommendation. The hearing officer determined that the student had not been credible, that the evidence had not supported a finding that the plaintiff had touched her inappropriately, and that any possible violation by the plaintiff of the principal's directive not to touch students\n   <em>\n    at all\n   </em>\n   was a matter for the plaintiff's employer, not the department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 28, 2012, on the basis of the initial, January, 2012 report substantiating the allegations against the plaintiff and on the defendants' internal investigation into the plaintiff's alleged violation of the principal's directive that he not touch students at all, the defendants notified the plaintiff that they were commencing termination proceedings against him under General Statutes \u00a7 10-151(d), the Teacher Tenure Act. On March 2, the plaintiff's union appointed attorney, Brian A. Doyle, asked the defendants for a statement of reasons why they had commenced termination proceedings against the plaintiff. The defendants sent such a statement to Doyle on March 12, 2012. In response to the statement of reasons, on March 15, 2012, the plaintiff requested a formal hearing before an impartial hearing officer, pursuant to \u00a7 10-151(d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Ten days later, on March 25, 2012, the defendants' attorney sent Doyle a document entitled \"RELEASE AND SEPARATION AGREEMENT.\" The Release and Separation Agreement proposed a settlement of the defendants' termination proceeding against the plaintiff on the following terms: the plaintiff would resign immediately from his teaching position, effective June 30, 2012; he would have no teaching duties for the remainder of the school year; and he would never seek to work for the defendants again. The Release and Separation Agreement also included a lengthy release, providing\n   that the plaintiff would \"voluntarily [release] and forever [discharge] the Board, all of the Board's past, present and future members, employees, agents, attorneys, insurers, representatives, and any person acting on behalf of or in concert with any of them (collectively, Releasees), from any and all claims, demands, obligations, liabilities, causes of action, known or unknown, asserted and unasserted, and any claim for costs, attorney's fees, expenses or any form of damages whatsoever (including but not limited to liquidated and/or punitive damages, compensatory damages and/or damages for emotional distress)\n   which [the plaintiff] has or may have against the Releasees arising out of or in any way connected with [the plaintiff's] employment or separation from employment....\" The preface similarly stated that the plaintiff and the defendants \"wish[ed] to resolve, compromise and finally settle ... any and all claims and potential claims [the plaintiff] may have related to his employment with the Board or separation from that employment....\" A separate clause provided that the plaintiff would retain his right to file a complaint with the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or the Connecticut Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities, but he would waive \"the right to recover any damages or other relief in any claim or suit brought by or through\" those agencies. Nowhere did the document specify any pending lawsuit that the plaintiff was withdrawing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In exchange, the Release and Separation Agreement provided that the defendants would put the plaintiff on a paid leave of absence for the last three months of the 2011-2012 school year, until June 30, 2012; would remove all documents referencing the plaintiff's proposed termination from his personnel file; and would\n   not discuss the circumstances of the plaintiff's departure with prospective employers, if the plaintiff sought work elsewhere. On March 30, 2012, during a one-on-one meeting with Doyle at his law firm office, and after being advised to do so, the plaintiff signed the Release and Separation Agreement. It is unclear from the record if the plaintiff ever personally met with the defendants to discuss the Release and Separation Agreement before signing it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is undisputed that the plaintiff had no claims pending against the defendants in any court when he signed the Release and Separation Agreement. Nor is there any evidence that he had commenced any administrative actions against the defendants. The evidence before the court contained no indication that, when the plaintiff signed the Release and Separation Agreement, he was considering filing such claims, had investigated the facts underlying such claims, or had consulted with an attorney as to the legal merit of such claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two years later, on January 22, 2014, the plaintiff filed the present action\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   against the defendants, alleging that the defendants had forced him to resign from his job as a teacher through a four year campaign of harassment. The defendants filed two motions in response: (1) a motion to dismiss three of the five counts of the complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) the \"Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement\" that is the subject of this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The second motion asked the court to enforce summarily the provision of the Release and Separation Agreement in which the plaintiff had agreed to release the defendants\n   from any liability for the events surrounding his resignation. As authority for their motion, the defendants relied on\n   <em>\n    Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership v. Barclay &amp; Stubbs, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757677\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/804/#p812\">\n    225 Conn. at 812\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20A.2d%20729\">\n    626 A.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , in which our Supreme Court held that, where a party conceded that it had entered into an unambiguous, enforceable agreement to settle a pending case, but then reneged on that settlement agreement, the court could summarily enforce the agreement by rendering judgment upon it in the settled case in accordance with the settlement terms. The defendants here asked the trial court to hold an evidentiary \"\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   hearing\" to decide whether summary enforcement of the Release and Separation Agreement was appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Soon after the defendants filed these motions, the court scheduled a hearing for March 31, 2014. One week before the hearing, the defendants moved to continue the \"[e]videntiary [h]earing\" on their motion to enforce the Release and Separation Agreement because two witnesses would not be available to testify. The court granted that motion on the day it was filed and set a new hearing date of April 14, 2014, ordering that: \"All matters scheduled for March 31 are continued to short calendar of April 14, 2014.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   A few days after the court postponed the hearing, the plaintiff filed a \"Motion in Limine\" seeking to preclude any evidence of the Release and Separation Agreement and asking the court to \"assist the plaintiff in his endeavor to get at all the material facts [of] this case via the discovery proceedings of the trial.\" The plaintiff noted that the contract posed a potential \"impasse\" for his lawsuit against the defendants, and that he \"d[id] not wish to be outmaneuvered by the defendant and her counsel until he ha[d] been given a\n   full opportunity to present his case before the court.\" The plaintiff also filed numerous objections to the defendants' motion to enforce the contract, alleging that there had been bad faith, undue influence, duress, misrepresentation, unconscionability, and a lack of meeting of the minds. The court did not rule on the plaintiff's motion in limine or any other objections before the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On the day of the hearing, April 14, 2014, the court turned initially to the defendants' motion to enforce the Release and Separation Agreement. The defendants called two witnesses on that motion, the plaintiff and Doyle. The plaintiff testified that he had signed the Release and Separation Agreement on March 30, 2012, and that the defendants' exhibit one was that contract. The court thus admitted the Release and Separation Agreement into evidence. Doyle testified to the same effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The plaintiff also testified, in response to questioning by the defendants' counsel, that Doyle had not explained the contract to him, that Doyle had showed the contract to him only briefly, and that he did not receive a copy of the contract until two months after he signed it. At the end of direct examination, the court asked the plaintiff if there was \"anything [he] wish[ed] to add\" to the testimony he had already given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff then gave a synopsis of the testimony he wished to give and the court asked follow-up questions. At one point, the plaintiff began to discuss his underlying claims against the defendants, but the court stopped him, noting that the hearing was only about \"whether or not this separation agreement can be enforced....\" At another point, the plaintiff asked \"to get [his] notes\" on the \"whole subject of contracts\" and began to discuss two legal doctrines-misrepresentation and unconscionability-but was cut off again,\n   the\n   court observing: \"If you had signed [the Release and Separation Agreement] without benefit of counsel, that may be a subject area in which the court would take some testimony or look into. But you signed this with an attorney representing you.\" The court noted, however, that the plaintiff \"ha [d] the right to put on any-any-we're holding an evidentiary hearing-any other documents that you think are relevant.\" The plaintiff did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendants next called Doyle to the witness stand. Before Doyle testified, the plaintiff raised his motion in limine seeking to preclude evidence of the Release and Separation Agreement. The court stated that the plaintiff's motion seemed \"to be obviated by the fact that we're here today doing an evidentiary hearing.\" The court then told the plaintiff that because he had testified already about Doyle's failure to explain the Release and Separation Agreement to him, the plaintiff \"may in fact have waived some of-some or all of [his] attorney-client privilege....\" The court then asked the plaintiff to clarify if he was waiving his attorney-client privilege. The plaintiff replied, \"Yes, I'll waive [it].\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On direct examination, Doyle contradicted much of the plaintiff's testimony. He testified that the plaintiff had given him permission to discuss settlement with the defendants; that he had \"gone back and forth\" with the defendants' attorney; that he had discussed each offer with the plaintiff; that he had given the plaintiff a copy of the Release and Separation Agreement at the meeting where the plaintiff signed it; that he had explained each paragraph to the plaintiff, including that one of the provisions was \"a general release and that you can't sue, period\"; that the plaintiff had no questions at that time; and that the plaintiff did not ask for any more time to review the Release and Separation Agreement before signing it. Doyle reiterated and\n   expanded on this testimony when the plaintiff cross-examined him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   After the defendants rested, the court asked the plaintiff if he had any witnesses he wished to call. The plaintiff replied, \"No, I do not, sir.\" The court then advised\n   the parties that, if \"[a]nybody ... wishes to submit anything further,\" the defendants had until April 24, 2014, and the plaintiff had until May 7, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   After the hearing, the plaintiff filed numerous additional objections to the defendants' motion to enforce the Release and Separation Agreement. Although the plaintiff conceded that the contract was unambiguous, he argued that when he signed it he did not know what it said and was acting under duress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The plaintiff also asked the court to begin subpoenaing witnesses on his underlying claim that the defendants had harassed him into resigning. He argued that the testimony elicited by the defendants at the April 14, 2014 hearing had been \"unreliable and damaging,\" and that the court should \"refrain from ruling on the [defendants' motion] until future testimony [was] presented\" on his underlying claims. \"Otherwise,\" he argued, \"per terms of the Release and Separation [A]greement, the [p]laintiff would be denied his day in court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On May 16, 2014, the court granted the defendants' \"Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement.\" The court began its memorandum of decision by noting that it had \"conducted an\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   hearing on the matter on April 14, 2014.\" After setting forth the relevant law, the court then found that \"[i]t is clear from the testimony presented and evidence received that the parties, at the time they entered into the agreement, were in accord with the terms of the settlement as well as with regard to the terms of the agreement. The entire agreement was clear and unambiguous, and was explained in depth and detail to the plaintiff by his attorney.\" The court held that the \"settlement agreement must be enforced,\" and did so by rendering judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff appealed to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argues that our Supreme Court's holding in\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   does not control this case and that the trial court erred in summarily enforcing the Release and Separation Agreement pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Audubon.\n   </em>\n   We agree.\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   involved an agreement, reached in the midst of litigation, to settle a pending case.\n   <em>\n    Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership v. Barclay &amp; Stubbs, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"757677\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/225/804/#p812\">\n    225 Conn. at 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=626%20A.2d%20729\">\n    626 A.2d 729\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, by contrast, the defendants sought to use that doctrine to enforce summarily a preemptive release signed before the present litigation began. We conclude that\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   does not extend so far. Rather, it permits summary enforcement only if the settlement agreement at issue was reached after the relevant litigation commenced. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the trial court and remand the case for further proceedings according to law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At the outset, the defendants argue that the issue of whether\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   extends to the summary enforcement of agreements reached outside the framework of and before the start of the relevant litigation is not properly before us. The defendants argue that the plaintiff did not raise this issue before the trial court or on appeal, and that no exceptional circumstance exists to justify a departure from the \"general rule that unpreserved claims will not be reviewed.\" See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v. Brown &amp; Brown of Connecticut, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20123\">\n    311 Conn. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 161,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The defendants are correct that the plaintiff did not specifically object to the use of summary enforcement, rather\n   than summary judgment, as the procedural vessel to dispose of his case. His primary and supplemental appellate briefs focus on the substantive issue of whether the Release and Separation Agreement can be enforced at all, not on the procedural issue of how it could be enforced. Accordingly, we agree with the defendants that the issue is unpreserved and was not raised by the plaintiff on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v.

Here, we conclude that each element is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   First, after discussing the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   issue extensively at oral argument, we also ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The issue has been briefed and argued, and all parties had an opportunity to be heard.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Second, the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   issue is a pure question of law that requires no additional fact-finding. See\n   <em>\n    Ayantola v. Board of Trustees of Technical Colleges,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4065594\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/116/531/#p538\">\n    116 Conn.App. 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 538,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=976%20A.2d%20784\">\n    976 A.2d 784\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) (\"a\n   question of law is [a]n issue to be decided by the judge, concerning the application or interpretation of the law\" [emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted] ). The question here concerns the scope of a common-law doctrine and the relevant facts are undisputed, to wit, the Release and Separation Agreement was reached during the defendants' termination proceeding against the plaintiff pursuant to \u00a7 10-151(d), but two years before the plaintiff brought this action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Third, the answer to the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   issue is so obvious as to be not debatable. We acknowledge that the court in\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   did not expressly answer the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   It held only that, in one particular circumstance, summary enforcement was appropriate; it did not purport to define that power's outer limits. See\n   <em>\n    Audubon Parking Associates Ltd. Partnership v.

Nevertheless, in light of the two decades since\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   during which courts have applied\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   only to agreements reached in the midst of litigation, and in light of the underlying rationale of\n   <em>\n    Audubon,\n   </em>\n   it is obvious that one such limit is that\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   does not apply to agreements reached before and outside the framework of the litigation in which enforcement is sought. See part I B 1 c of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Fourth, leaving the judgment intact would work a manifest injustice. The rule of\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   effects a delicate balance between concerns of judicial economy on the one hand and a party's constitutional rights to a jury and to a trial on the other hand.

To use the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   power outside of its proper context is to deny a party these fundamental rights and would work a manifest injustice. Because all four requirements are met, we conclude that the challenged judgment must be reversed under the plain error doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, even if the plain error doctrine did not apply, review would still be proper in the exercise of this court's supervisory powers. Our Supreme Court has laid out a four part test for determining whether sua sponte review of an unpreserved claim pursuant to the court's supervisory powers is proper.\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v.

The four requirements for review are: (1) the record must be adequate for review; (2) all parties must have had an opportunity to be heard on the issue; (3) there must be no unfair prejudice to any party; and (4) something more, such\n   as (a) neither party objects to review, (b) the party pressing the claim cannot prevail, (c) the claim is of a public character, (d) the claim arose from an intervening change in the law, (e) the claim arose from a newly established, undisputed fact on which both parties rely, (f) by addressing the claim, the court avoids a constitutional question, (g) the claim is an alternative basis to affirm an evidentiary ruling, (h) the claim involves judicial bias, or (i) other exceptional circumstances; id., at 155-61,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; \"in which the interests of justice, fairness, integrity of the courts and consistency of the law significantly outweigh the interest in enforcing procedural rules governing the preservation of claims.\" Id., at 160,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   the 'something more' was threefold: (1) in light of the \"obvious similarity between [the] theories\"; id., at 170,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; underlying both one of the preserved claims and the unpreserved claim, the Appellate Court reasonably-albeit mistakenly-could have believed that the trial court\n   <em>\n    had\n   </em>\n   ruled on the unpreserved claim, which would have mooted the appeal, thereby implicating the Appellate Court's subject matter jurisdiction; (2) the unpreserved claim was likely to arise on remand and so addressing it promoted judicial economy; and (3) the Appellate Court's failure to raise the issue sua sponte could have led to inconsistency or confusion in the case law.

With respect to the third factor, our Supreme Court noted: \"Although it may be improper for the reviewing court to raise an issue sua sponte when the parties' misunderstanding of the law relates to an issue that is tangential to or distinct from the claim that was raised on appeal, we have concluded that a reviewing court may raise the issue when the misunderstanding is intertwined with the claim that was raised on appeal and could lead to problematic or inconsistent precedent.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 172 n. 43,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To start, we conclude that here, the three preliminary requirements are met. First, the record is adequate for review. The unpreserved issue is a pure question of law and the relevant facts are undisputed-i.e., the Release and Separation Agreement was reached during the defendants' termination proceeding against the plaintiff, pursuant to \u00a7 10-151(d), but two years before the plaintiff brought this action.

Second, all parties had an opportunity to be heard on the issue. After discussing this issue extensively at oral argument, we also ordered supplemental briefing. Third, there is no unfair prejudice to any party. The prejudice that the defendants identify in their supplemental brief is that, if the trial court's judgment in their favor is reversed, then they will be \"required to expend exorbitant sums of money to defend this matter\" instead of \"using [these] funds to educate children....\" That prejudice\n   stems not from the\n   <em>\n    timing\n   </em>\n   of when the issue was raised-which is the relevant question; see\n   <em>\n    Blumberg Associates Worldwide, Inc. v. Brown &amp; Brown of Connecticut, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20123\">\n    311 Conn. at 156-57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 156 n. 25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=84%20A.3d%20840\">\n    84 A.3d 840\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -but from the plaintiff's right to seek redress in the courts\n   <em>\n    at all.\n   </em>\n   See Conn. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10 (provision of state constitution granting access to courts).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We thus turn to the fourth requirement. We conclude that two factors counsel in favor of review. First, prior to the order for supplemental briefing, neither party\n   objected to review of this unpreserved issue. At oral argument, the defendants' counsel extensively discussed the merits of the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   issue and at no point objected that review was improper. In addition to her vigorous defense on the merits, the defendants' counsel specifically requested that this court order supplemental briefing on the issue:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Now, Your Honors, I would ask, you know, I'm not sure whether\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   has been applied to these circumstances.... I'm not sure that I actually cited to any cases where it was.... I certainly would like the opportunity to at least explore the issue and present the court with any ... cases ... where it possibly is.... I don't have the-those particular citations on hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   \"And if you're curious as to, you know, whether the-\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   even applies in this case, I would certainly ask, since that wasn't an issue that was even ever-that has not been presented at this time, I would certainly just request time to brief that issue for Your Honors before you make a determination on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   \"The Court: You briefed\n   <em>\n    Audubon,\n   </em>\n   didn't you?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: We briefed\n   <em>\n    Audubon,\n   </em>\n   but I did not brief, you know, [the plaintiff] never raised the issue that ... you know,\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   shouldn't be applied to this at all. I-I think that, for the defendants' sake, I-I think that they should have the right to at least brief the argument ... that ...\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   wouldn't apply in parallel litigation as opposed to within the same litigation. I-I think that's what I hear as your concerns....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   \"The Court: We'll certainly take that under consideration, counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   \"[The Defendants' Counsel]: Okay. Thank you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Six months after oral argument, we ordered supplemental briefing. The defendants now assert in their supplemental brief that they \"vehemently object\" to review of the\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   issue, that such review is improper, and that by raising the issue \"this court is doing nothing more than serving as an advocate for the [self-represented] plaintiff.\" We conclude that, having failed to object at oral argument and having themselves requested supplemental briefing, the defendants cannot now object that such briefing is improper.

It was the chief authority that the plaintiff cited in his primary\n   appellate brief. And it was the chief authority that the defendants relied on in their primary appellate brief. If we were to uphold the summary enforcement of the Release and Separation Agreement pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   in this case, it would improperly suggest to courts and attorneys alike that\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   extends far beyond its actual reach. Accordingly, we conclude that review is also proper to avoid such a result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We thus turn to the merits.

That initial invocation of the court's authority distinguishes an agreement to settle litigation-which may be summarily enforced by\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   motion-from a preemptive release of claims-which may be enforced through a motion for summary judgment or by presentation at trial as a special defense.

The defendants argue, however, that the Release and Separation Agreement did settle their administrative proceeding under \u00a7 10-151(d) to terminate the plaintiff's employment, and so the contract's provisions-including its\n   general release provision-were subject to\n   <em>\n    Audubon\n   </em>\n   -style summary enforcement.
