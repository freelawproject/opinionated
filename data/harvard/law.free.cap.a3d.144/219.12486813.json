FRIEDMAN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Elmer Dunbar and Linda Dunbar, his wife (Dunbar), appeal from the September 11, 2015, order of the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton County (trial court) denying and dismissing Dunbar's appeal from the decision of the Zoning Hearing Board (ZHB) of the City of Bethlehem (City), which granted William and Joan Tomino (Tomino) a special exception and a dimensional variance. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Tomino owns property on a 5,225-square-foot corner lot located at 1037 Main Street (Property) in the City. The Property is zoned RT High Density Residential District (RT) and is one block from Moravian College. Tomino operates a deli on the Property, which is a nonconforming use. The Property has had various nonconforming uses since 1926. The deli has been in operation since the ZHB approved a change in the use of the Property from an insurance office to a deli in April 1998.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ZHB Findings of Fact, No. 5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In October 2013, Tomino filed an application with the ZHB for a special exception to change the nonconforming deli use to a nonconforming restaurant use, as defined in the City's Zoning Ordinance (Ordinance). Tomino also requested a dimensional variance to expand the nonconforming restaurant from 540 square feet to 1,080 square feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On November 20, 2013, the ZHB held a hearing at which Tomino and numerous objectors appeared.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The ZHB found that \"[i]n the present zoning ordinance, 'delicatessen' is not a permitted use in and of itself; a delicatessen falls under the ambit of 'restaurant' in the new zoning code.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 6.) Unlike surrounding restaurants, the deli has limited hours of operation and delivery restrictions. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 7.) The deli is only 18 feet by 30 feet and has one refrigerated case for meats, one refrigerated case for drinks, and one preparation area.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Nos.9, 10.) The deli is take-out only, and there are no tables inside. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 11.) The ZHB found that the space is \"totally inadequate for preparation of food and storage of goods.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The ZHB further found that Tomino needs to expand the floor area to add tables and two handicap-accessible restrooms as required by Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2012101\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -12213. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 13.) Tomino plans to add: three tables\n   with four chairs at each table, a new door with a handicap-accessible ramp, new curbing to support the off-street parking lot, ventilation between Tomino's buildings, and two handicap-accessible bathrooms. Tomino also plans to renovate the exterior of the building and increase the hours of operation to 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m., seven days per week. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Nos. 13-15, 18, 20-21, 26.) The Property is within one block of Moravian College's dining hall and a 24-hour laundromat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Nos. 24-25.) There are also several other restaurants in the area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 28.) The deli has been operating at a financial loss since 2010, and Tomino seeks expansion for the survival of the business, as it is necessary for the reasonable use of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   Nos. 27, 30.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The ZHB determined that Tomino met the general requirements for a special exception to change from the nonconforming deli use to a nonconforming restaurant use. (ZHB Op. at 11-12.) The change is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the Ordinance; encourages the most appropriate use of the land; does not overcrowd the land; conserves the value of the land; benefits the neighborhood; does not increase traffic congestion; provides adequate light and air; and protects from fire, flood, and other dangers. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-14.) Further, the ZHB determined that the restaurant use is consistent with the character of the district, as there are other restaurants and businesses in the area. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.) The ZHB found that the restaurant use conforms with all applicable Ordinance requirements, except for the expansion beyond 50 percent, will not increase traffic, and has adequate off-street parking. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14-15.) Thus, the ZHB determined that Tomino met all the applicable criteria for a special exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   With regard to the dimensional variance to increase the restaurant's size beyond 50 percent, the ZHB determined that Tomino met all the applicable criteria for a variance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16, 22.) The ZHB also found that an unnecessary hardship would result if the dimensional variance were denied because, among other things, the building, which is a nonconforming structure with a nonconforming use, is \"completely inadequate to operate a restaurant use.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 3, 2014, the ZHB granted Tomino's request for a special exception and a variance. On January 30, 2014, Dunbar appealed to the trial court, and Tomino intervened. The trial court determined that the ZHB's conclusions are supported by the facts of record and that the ZHB did not err in granting Tomino a special exception and a variance. (Trial Ct. Op. at 5-7.) Dunbar now appeals to this court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Initially, Dunbar\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   contends that the trial court erred in determining that Tomino is entitled to a special exception to change the Property's current nonconforming deli use to a nonconforming restaurant use in the RT zoning district. Dunbar contends that Tomino failed to meet the conditions in article 1323.07 of the Ordinance. Dunbar states that the change in use will alter the character of\n   the neighborhood, is contrary to the public interest, and is unnecessary. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   A nonconforming use is:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   a use, whether of land or of structure, which does not comply with the applicable use provisions in a zoning ordinance or amendment heretofore or hereafter enacted, where such use was lawfully in existence prior to the enactment of such ordinance or amendment, or prior to the application of such ordinance or amendment to its location by reason of annexation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Section 107 of the Pennsylvania Municipalities Planning Code (MPC), Act of July 31, 1968, P.L. 744,\n   <em>\n    as amended,\n   </em>\n   53 P.S. \u00a7 10107. \"A special exception is not an exception to a zoning restriction, but a use that is expressly permitted.\"\n   <em>\n    Broussard v.

Further, Tomino presented the testimony of Pat Curullo, a licensed architect, who testified that the proposed plan does not overcrowd the land, meets the City's parking requirements, meets the City's requirements under the Ordinance, and results in a more aesthetic and attractive facility that operates more efficiently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Tomino testified that the proposed plan conserves the value of the land and buildings because without the change, the deli business will ultimately close. A more attractive building will also benefit the neighborhood. Further, the proposed plan does not increase the traffic congestion or the population. Tomino testified that the majority of his business is from Moravian College students, faculty and employees and people who live near the Property. Tomino also testified that there is more than adequate parking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Tomino's proposed plan provides for adequate light and air and secures safety from fire, flood, and other dangers. The proposed plan requires land development approval from the City, which includes meeting all existing building and fire codes. Further, the proposed plan requires Tomino to construct two handicap-accessible restrooms and an entranceway. Thus, the Property will be safer than it is now.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Property is in a medium- to high-density residential zoning district that has three restaurants and a cafeteria within close proximity. Thus, the ZHB found that the character of the district is suitable for another restaurant use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   We agree with the ZHB that the change from a deli use to a restaurant use is consistent with the spirit, purpose, and intent of the Ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   and is consistent with the most appropriate use of the land, in that the deli existed as a nonconforming use and will continue in a similar capacity as a restaurant use. A property owner has a constitutional right to continue a nonconforming use.\n   <em>\n    Richland Township v. Prodex, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   160 Pa.Cmwlth. 184,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1454613\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/160/184/#p767\">\n    634 A.2d 756\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 767 (1993). The lawful, nonconforming use establishes in the property owner a vested right that \"cannot be abrogated or destroyed unless it is a nuisance, or it is abandoned by the owner, or it is extinguished by eminent domain.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennridge Development Enterprises, Inc. v.

Tomino's property rights have not been abrogated, destroyed, extinguished by eminent domain, or abandoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Thus, Tomino has a constitutional right to continue the nonconforming use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   We agree with the ZHB that the proposed plan conforms with all applicable requirements of the Ordinance, except for the expansion beyond 50 percent, which is the subject of the dimensional variance request. No other zoning relief is requested or required. Thus, the ZHB correctly found that Tomino met the requirements in article 1325.07 of the Ordinance for a special exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because Tomino proved that the proposed use met the objective requirements of article 1323.07 of the Ordinance, the burden then shifted to Dunbar to demonstrate that the use will be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Broussard,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090071\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/764/#p769\">\n    831 A.2d at 772\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The objectors did not present any expert testimony. Because the evidence presented is only speculative, Dunbar failed to prove that the use will be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general welfare. Thus, the ZHB did not err in granting Tomino a special exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Next, Dunbar contends that the ZHB erred and abused its discretion in granting Tomino's request for a variance to increase the size of the proposed restaurant by 100 percent in violation of article 1323.04 of the Ordinance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Dunbar specifically contends that Tomino did not prove any hardship warranting a variance because the Property can continue to be used as a deli, the surrounding neighborhood will be greatly impacted by the expansion, the restaurant use is not a permitted use, and the expansion of the premises by 100 percent is unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To establish a right to a variance, the landowner must prove an unnecessary hardship by showing that: (1) there are unique physical circumstances or conditions of the property; (2) the property cannot be developed in strict conformity with the zoning ordinance and a variance is necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property; (3) the hardship is not self-inflicted; (4) granting the variance will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood or be detrimental to the public welfare; and (5) the variance sought is the minimum variance that will afford relief.
