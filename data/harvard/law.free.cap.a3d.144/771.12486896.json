On November 12, 2013, at approximately 2 a.m., Corporal William Daughters, a twenty-four-year veteran of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, and Officer Dan Kramer, a trainee, were on patrol. The officers were driving through a large apartment complex in Glen Burnie that contained over fifty buildings and had approximately one thousand residents. Corporal Daughters indicated that the complex was considered a high crime area, because, in the year that he had been patrolling that area, there had been a shooting, the recovery of handguns, multiple thefts from cars, and drug arrests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As the two officers entered the complex, they observed a vehicle stopping at a stop sign; the driver waited for the officers to cross the intersection before proceeding. As the officers drove through the complex, they observed an individual, later identified as Sellman, walk from a dark area on the side of one of the apartment buildings where there was no entry way towards an area lit by a street light. Corporal Daughters testified that \"it appeared we startled\n   him.\" The officer explained that Sellman \"came to an abrupt stop, and\n   then quickly, he started to turn to his right, but then stopped and then watched our car as it went by.\" Once the officers drove past him, Sellman continued on his way. Corporal Daughters observed Sellman through his rearview mirror, and saw him walk at a normal pace \"toward[s] the roadway and [he] walked toward[s] the parking area. There are cars parked along the shoulder on that roadway, and he appeared to be walking towards those cars.\" He noticed that the vehicle he had previously seen at the stop sign \"stopped in the roadway and then the person on foot[, Sellman,] got into the left rear door of the vehicle.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Corporal Daughters later testified: \"I just thought it appeared odd at that point, people out on foot and people-instead of everyone getting into a car in one location, picking somebody up around the corner ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The officers turned the patrol car around, and followed the vehicle. Upon noticing that the vehicle had a broken rear taillight and a broken tag light dangling by its wiring harness below the bumper, Corporal Daughters activated the emergency lights, and the driver immediately pulled over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The officers exited the patrol car, and approached the stopped vehicle from different sides. Corporal Daughters approached the driver's side and observed four occupants inside, including Sellman who was in the left-rear passenger seat.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Corporal Daughters explained to the driver, Samantha Gillespie,\n   why he had pulled her over, and requested her driver's license and vehicle registration. Gillespie explained that she was unsure where the registration was, because she was borrowing the car from a friend, however, she did provide her driver's license. When asked why she was in the neighborhood, Gillespie explained that she was there to pick up Andrea Queen, a resident who lived in a nearby apartment. Officer Kramer testified: \"The driver stated that they were taking her pregnant friend to go out and get some food [.]\" Queen was in the right-rear passenger seat opposite the driver. Corporal Daughters asked Queen if she had any identification. She responded no, but indicated that she lived in the complex. Corporal Daughters later testified that he had encountered Queen on a previous occasion, and had reason to believe she did not live at this particular complex.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that Sellman's behavior was unusual, because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   On my first approach to the vehicle up to the point where I had actually physically asked him questions, where he had to respond to me, Mr. Sellman was sitting completely rigid in his seat, he had\n   his hands on his knees and was looking straight ahead and never turned his head once.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The officers returned to the patrol car to conduct a warrant check on Gillespie, which came up negative. They also used the police database to access records from the Motor Vehicle Administration (\"MVA\") in order to check the status of the driver and the vehicle she was driving; the vehicle was not reported as being stolen. The officers exited the patrol car, and returned to the stopped vehicle. Gillespie was given a written warning and then Corporal Daughters asked her to exit the vehicle. He took her to the rear of the vehicle, identified the broken lights, and told her that they needed to be repaired. At this time, Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie whether she had anything illegal in the car, and she responded no. He asked for permission to search the vehicle. Gillespie\n   asked why, and Corporal Daughters explained \"we had some problems in the area with some thefts and some drugs, and that kind of thing.\" Both officers testified that Gillespie consented to the search.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Corporal Daughters then asked Gillespie if the left-rear passenger, Sellman, lived in the apartment complex. She stated yes, and that she had picked him up as well. Gillespie remained with Officer Kramer while Corporal Daughters returned to the stopped car. Corporal Daughters testified that \"because of the history surrounding the apartment complex, I wanted to identify everybody in the vehicle.\" He stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   I went back up to the vehicle [to obtain identification from the other occupants]. Again, at that point, I had a somewhat conflicting story about who lived in the apartment complex. The only one that stated they had, was the right-rear passenger, [Queen,] the female.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   When asked why this was conflicting, Corporal Daughters testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Because now, the driver was saying that the left-rear passenger[, Sellman,] also lived in the apartment complex, yet when I asked the group in the car when I first approached who lived in the apartment complex, the only one that said they did, was the right-rear passenger.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Prior to conducting the search, he asked the three passengers to identify themselves. The front-seat passenger, a male, provided identification. Corporal Daughters testified that Sellman \"kept looking straight ahead and never looked at me[,]\" however, \"[o]nce I actually asked him a question, he turned toward me and gave me the name and date of birth.\" Queen\n   also provided her name and date of birth. The officer then asked Sellman if he lived in the complex and Sellman replied that he did not, which conflicted with Gillespie's earlier statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Officer Kramer remained with Gillespie while Corporal Daughters returned to the patrol car to run warrant checks and a history on the three occupants, including the alias provided by Sellman: Marcus Neal Saunders, born July 12, 1982. While he was running a history on the names using the police database, Corporal Daughters contacted Corporal Miller\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and asked\n   him to come to the scene to assist, because there were four detainees-two men and two females-and two officers at the scene. He wanted the parking lot checked to see if any cars had been broken into. After running the warrant checks, \"[a]ll three came back with no warrants.\" However, \"the name Saunders had absolutely no record through [the] MVA, local arrest records, anything.\" He testified that this was unusual.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also testified that he was confident in the identity of the other three occupants, because two had provided identification, and he knew the third, Queen, from a previous encounter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Corporal Miller arrived shortly thereafter and exited his patrol car. Officer Kramer remained with Gillespie at the rear of the stopped vehicle while Corporal Miller approached the vehicle from the right side, and Corporal Daughters approached the vehicle from the left side. Corporal Daughters opened the left rear door, and again questioned Sellman about his name. Sellman replied that he had provided his correct name, and when the officer informed him that no records came up under that name, Sellman explained that \"he'[d] never had a driver's license, he'[d] never been arrested, [and] he'[d] never been in trouble.\" The officer then ordered Sellman out of the vehicle, and had him place his hands on the trunk of the\n   car. Corporal Daughters testified that he conducted the frisk, because:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   At that point, I had again conflicting stories about who had been picked up where, whether anybody at all lived in the apartment complex, if anybody, [and i]t was odd that they were driving through the parking lot, [and Gillespie informed me she was] picking people up on foot at that hour of the morning .... And before I continue any further, or continue to a search of the vehicle, which Ms. Gillespie allowed us to do, I wanted to make sure none of the passengers were carrying any weapons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   He testified that it was his intent to search the vehicle. At the suppression hearing, the State asked \"what is the normal course of procedure or the normal standard operating procedures\" prior to conducting a search of a vehicle. Corporal Daughters responded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   We will take the individuals out of a car ... have them step out, individually, and make sure that they're not carrying weapons or anything that can harm us ... once they're out of the car. And then once the car is clear, officers or an officer will stay with the passengers or driver, whoever the occupants of the vehicle are.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   He testified that he asked Sellman if he had any weapons on him and Sellman responded no. Then, Corporal Daughters frisked Sellman, pursuant to these standard operating procedures, and discovered a handgun in Sellman's waistband.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Prior to trial, Sellman moved to suppress the evidence obtained from the frisk. He argued that the frisk was unconstitutional, because the officers lacked a reasonable basis to believe Sellman was armed and dangerous. On April 2 and 22, 2014, a pre-trial suppression hearing took place in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County. Corporal Daughters testified for the State; Ms. Gillespie testified for the defense; Officer\n   Kramer testified as a rebuttal witness for the State in order to\n   corroborate Corporal Daughters' testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The motions judge denied the motion to suppress, and upheld the frisk of Sellman. The judge found the initial traffic stop was valid, because the vehicle had a broken taillight and tag light, and that Gillespie freely and voluntarily consented to the search the vehicle. She also found credible the officers' description of Sellman: \"[H]e appeared to be nervous, how he was rigid, how he was looking ahead.\" Lastly, the judge found that the pat down was valid. According to the suppression court, there was reasonable articulable suspicion to frisk Sellman, because the officers \"were outnumbered at that point in time; They were in a high-crime area [and] it was late at night; The Defendant had come from a dark area; His [rigid and nervous] behavior in the vehicle led to some suspicion on their part ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At trial, Sellman entered into a not guilty agreed statement of facts to the charges of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute and possession of a firearm during a drug trafficking crime. He was found guilty on both charges and was sentenced to a total of ten years in prison, the first five to be served without the possibility of parole.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Sellman appealed the constitutionality of the frisk to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, a divided panel of the intermediate appellate court affirmed the denial of the motion to suppress. It held, based on its review of the totality of the circumstances, that the facts created reasonable suspicion that Sellman was armed and dangerous, and that he had committed or was planning to commit a crime. Therefore, it reasoned, it was permissible for Corporal Daughters to frisk Sellman in the interest of officer safety. One judge dissented, and stated: \"It is painfully obvious that the officers frisked [ ] Sellman not because they were acting upon reasonable suspicion that he was armed and dangerous, but because they routinely conduct suspicionless searches of every passenger in every car they search.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sellman filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. We granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   to answer the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   1. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding the police had reasonable suspicion to believe Mr. Sellman was armed and dangerous, simply because he was stopped for generally suspicious conduct in a high crime area where thefts from cars had been reported at some unspecified time in the past?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   2. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in finding that the crime of theft from cars implies the use of a deadly weapon?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Sellman v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=446%20Md.%20218\">\n    446 Md. 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20A.3d%20507\">\n    130 A.3d 507\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). For the reasons stated below, we answer the questions in the affirmative. Accordingly, we hold that the evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment was inadmissible. Therefore, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   At issue is the propriety of the denial of a motion to suppress evidence obtained by way of a frisk. We have previously stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   When reviewing the disposition of a motion to suppress evidence alleged to have been seized in contravention of the Fourth Amendment ...., we view the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, and the inferences fairly deducible therefrom, in the light most favorable to the party that prevailed on the motion. The appellate court defers to the trial court's fact-finding at the suppression hearing, unless the trial court's\n   findings were clearly erroneous. Nevertheless, in resolving the ultimate question of whether the detention or attendant search of an individual's person or property violates the Fourth Amendment, we make our own independent constitutional appraisal by reviewing the law and applying it to the facts of the case. Thus, this Court considers the evidence adduced at the suppression hearing, construed in the light most favorable to the State as the prevailing party at the suppression hearing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 362, 987 A.2d at 80 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nathan v.

Sellman argues that the record is devoid of any facts indicating he was armed or dangerous, or linking him to the suspected crime of theft of property from cars. He contends that the intermediate appellate court erred in justifying the frisk based on a generalized concern about car break-ins occurring in the area where he was stopped, which falls short of reasonable suspicion. In his brief, Sellman argued: \"The [intermediate appellate] court relied on the purportedly violent nature of car break-ins, and the likelihood of weapon use, yet required no nexus between Mr. Sellman and that particular crime.\" He posits that to affirm the decision \"would allow police to automatically frisk anyone who is stopped on reasonable suspicion as long as it takes place in a high crime area where violent crimes occur.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Naturally, the State disputes Sellman's interpretation of Court of Special Appeals' unreported opinion, and argues that the frisk was justified by reasonable suspicion that Sellman was armed and dangerous. For support, the State cites to several cases, including cases from other jurisdictions, where factors, such as the time of night, a location in a high crime area, or a suspect's nervous behavior, supported a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk of a car occupant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    Fourth Amendment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution is applicable to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <em>\n    Holt v.

While the level of required suspicion is less than that required by the probable cause standard, reasonable suspicion nevertheless embraces something more than an inchoate and unparticularized suspicion or hunch. Second, a court's determination of whether a law enforcement officer acted with reasonable suspicion must be based on the totality of the circumstances. Thus, the court must ... not parse out each individual circumstance for separate consideration .... In making its assessment, the court should give due deference to the training and experience of the law enforcement officer who engaged the stop at issue. Such deference allows officers to draw on their own experience and specialized training to make inferences from and deductions about the cumulative information available to them that might well elude an untrained person.

Unlike other cases, which will be discussed below, there is an absence of additional circumstances connecting Sellman to the suspected criminal activity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We can deduce from the record that the scene where the traffic stop took place was one in which the officers were in control, and did not fear for their safety. Neither officer testified that they were concerned for their safety, and we cannot rationally infer from the facts on the record that a reasonably prudent officer would have had reasonable suspicion to believe that Sellman, or any of the occupants, was armed. Therefore, the officers did not need to frisk Sellman in order to protect themselves or bystanders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 368, 987 A.2d at 84 (stating that a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk \"is limited to a pat-down of the outer clothing\" and its purpose is \"not to discover evidence of a crime, but rather to protect the\n   police officer and bystanders from harm by checking for weapons[.]\") (citation omitted). Although the officers were initially outnumbered four to two, throughout the encounter, the occupants-two women and two men-were compliant and responsive to the officers' questions. During cross-examination, Corporal Daughters described Gillespie as \"talkative\" and \"friendly\" and her demeanor as \"[n]othing\n   out of the ordinary.\" There was no testimony that any of the occupants were acting hostile towards the officers. We also note that backup was immediately available upon request. Under the totality of the circumstances, it appears that the true purpose of requesting backup was to gather evidence of criminal activity rather than to alleviate any concerns of being outnumbered. Corporal Daughters testified that he requested an additional officer in order to have that officer check the parking lot for evidence of car break-ins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   When the officers first approached the vehicle, they used their flashlights to illuminate the interior and noticed nothing unusual inside. Their observations of Sellman, prior to and after he entered the vehicle, did not include testimony that he acted furtively, evasively, or that he appeared to be carrying a weapon. Furthermore, the officers were able to establish that none of the four occupants, including Sellman under the alias he provided, was named in an outstanding warrant. Importantly, the fact that no MVA records were found under the alias provided by Sellman is a factor to be considered,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   but Corporal Daughters never explained why he\n   was not satisfied with Sellman's explanation as to why the police database contained no records under his alias or how this fact contributed to his suspicion that Sellman was involved in car break-ins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the time of the frisk, the officers had no information that the individual identified as Saunders had a criminal record or was dangerous. Under the totality of the circumstances, the absence of MVA records, without more, does not provide the requisite reasonable suspicion. It is significant that Corporal Daughters identified several factors, but he failed to explain\n   <em>\n    why\n   </em>\n   they made him suspicious. When we view the facts through an objective lens, the facts are too weak, individually or in the aggregate, to establish reasonable suspicion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferris v.

Like\n   <em>\n    Crosby\n   </em>\n   , Corporal Daughters, in the instant case, did not explain why, based on his training and decades of experience, the conduct he observed made him suspicious that Sellman was involved in car break-ins and was likely to be armed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , we also held that a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk failed to pass constitutional muster. 412 Md. at 358, 987 A.2d at 78. There, an officer was patrolling a high crime area late at night and observed Bailey, the petitioner, standing in the shadows on the side of a house.\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 359, 987 A.2d at 78.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   When questioned by the officer about whether he lived at that location, Bailey did not respond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The officer testified that when he approached the petitioner, he observed that Bailey's hands were visible and that he had \"glossy eyes.\"\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 360, 987 A.2d at 79. The officer also detected the odor of ether.\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 359, 987 A.2d at 78. He testified that although the possession of ether is not unlawful, it is often associated with phencyclidine (\"PCP\").\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 359-60, 987 A.2d at 78-79. The officer then frisked Bailey and discovered contraband. We explained that, under\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   , the pat-down was invalid:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   At the suppression hearing, Officer Lewis indicated that he searched the petitioner to \"[c]heck for weapons,\" but did not provide any basis for his suspicion that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Officer Lewis did not testify as to any factors that would lead to a suspicion that the petitioner was carrying a weapon. Further, there are no objective factors in the record that indicate that the petitioner was armed and dangerous. Although the encounter took place at nighttime, the petitioner was alone and\n   the officer \"could visibly see his hands,\" which, presumably because the officer did not indicate otherwise, were empty. There is no indication in the record that the petitioner made any threatening movements, or any movements at all, nor is there any indication that Officer Lewis suspected that the petitioner was dealing drugs.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    Bailey\n   </em>\n   , 412 Md. at 368, 987 A.2d at 83. Similarly, in the instant case, Corporal Daughters failed to provide any basis to support his belief that Sellman was armed, and no objective factors could support such a conclusion. For example, the officer did not observe weapons, bulging pockets, or any furtive movements, such as attempts to reach for a concealed weapon. Additionally, the officers did not have information to suggest that Sellman had a history of prior dangerousness or any connection to criminal activity. As we stated above, the officers' observations of Sellman revealed innocent conduct, and the officers did not provide an objective reason to support their interpretation of that conduct: namely, that Sellman was\n   likely involved in criminal activity or was armed. Without additional circumstances to support the belief of reasonable suspicion, the frisk of Sellman is invalid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Another case in which we rejected the State's argument that reasonable suspicion existed is\n   <em>\n    Ransome\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739039\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/99/#p115\">\n    373 Md. at 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739039\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/99/#p115\">\n    816 A.2d at 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

As a matter of policy, we decline the opportunity to create a bright line rule, and we will not presume that when an officer has reasonable suspicion that an individual is involved with the crime of theft of property from cars, the officer may automatically infer that individual is also armed.

The resolution of this case does not augment or enhance existing stop-and-frisk case law. It demonstrates only a disagreement between the Majority and the Court of Special Appeals and the circuit court as to the analysis of the facts of the case under existing case law. I would hold that the circuit court and the Court of Special Appeals properly applied the law to the facts, and reached the correct result. Because the evaluation of any\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk-and, particularly this one-is fact-dependent, the facts underlying the case are set forth in detail below. As with the Majority opinion, the facts are derived from the suppression hearing that the circuit court conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Corporal William Daughters (\"Corporal Daughters\"), a twenty-four-year veteran of the Anne Arundel County Police Department, testified to the following sequence of events. On November 12, 2013, at approximately 1:49 a.m., Corporal Daughters and Officer Daniel Kramer (\"Officer Kramer\") (collectively, \"the\n   officers\"), a recruit trainee, were patrolling\n   the Villages at Marley Station apartment complex in Glen Burnie. Corporal Daughters testified that there had been multiple thefts from vehicles, drug arrests, illegal handgun possessions, and a shooting at the apartment complex. During the course of the patrol, Corporal Daughters observed Sellman emerge from a \"dark area on the side of\" an apartment building where there was no entrance. According to Corporal Daughters, Sellman came to an abrupt stop and seemed startled when he noticed the officers' marked law enforcement vehicle. Sellman quickly turned to the right and stopped again, watching the patrol vehicle as it passed. Sellman then resumed a normal pace and proceeded toward the roadway. Shortly thereafter, Corporal Daughters observed Sellman get into a vehicle that had pulled up next to Sellman on the roadway. The officers followed the vehicle and noticed that it had a broken rear-right tail light lens and that the tag light was hanging from a wire below the bumper. Corporal Daughters activated the patrol vehicle's emergency lights and pulled the vehicle over.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Corporal Daughters told the driver of the vehicle, Samantha Gillespie (\"Gillespie\"), that he had pulled her over due to the broken tail light lens and tag light. Upon shining his flashlight into the vehicle, Corporal Daughters noted a total of four individuals, including Sellman, who was seated in the left-rear passenger seat. Corporal Daughters asked if anyone in the vehicle lived in the Villages at Marley Station apartment complex, and only a female passenger, Andrea Queen (\"Queen\"), answered affirmatively. Sellman did not respond. Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie if there were \"any guns, bombs, weapons, dead bodies\" in the vehicle, and she answered \"no.\" Corporal Daughters then asked if they could search the vehicle, and, according to the officers, Gillespie answered, \"I don't care.\" As Corporal Daughters started to approach the vehicle, Gillespie asked, \"Why do you want to search the vehicle?\" Corporal Daughters responded that they \"had some problems in the area with some thefts and some drugs\" and Gillespie answered that she understood.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Before conducting the search, Corporal Daughters asked Gillespie whether Sellman also lived in the Villages at Marley Station apartment complex, and she answered affirmatively. Corporal Daughters testified that, because of the inconsistencies regarding who actually lived in the apartment complex and \"the history surrounding the apartment complex, [he] wanted to identify everyone in the vehicle.\" Corporal Daughters returned to the vehicle and asked for identification from the remaining three passengers. One male passenger, Donald Harris, had a State-issued identification card, but Queen said that she did not have identification. Corporal Daughters testified that, throughout the stop, Sellman sat rigidly in his seat and looked straight ahead. When Corporal Daughters asked for his information, Sellman turned toward Corporal Daughters and provided the name \"Marcus Neal Saunders\" and a date of birth of July 12, 1982. A warrant search of all of the passengers came up negative, but the officers could not find a \"Marcus Neal Saunders\" in the database.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   While the warrant checks were processing, Corporal Daughters requested that another officer, Officer Miller, join him and Officer Kramer at the stop. Corporal Daughters testified that he asked Officer Miller to come because there were four people in the car and only two officers. Additionally, Corporal Daughters testified that he wanted to check the parking lot where the vehicle had been to see if any vehicles had been broken into. Once Officer Miller arrived, he and Corporal Daughters\n   approached the vehicle, and Corporal Daughters asked Sellman whether he had given Corporal Daughters the correct name, explaining that \"something should come back\" when the officers put his name into their database. Sellman replied that he had provided the correct name and that he must not be showing up in the database because he had never been arrested and had never had a driver's license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Corporal Daughters asked Sellman to step out of the vehicle and place his hands on the trunk. During Corporal Daughters's testimony, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-114\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] ... [W]hat did you tell [Sellman]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-115\">\n   [CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] I had him step out of the vehicle and asked him to place his hands on the trunk of the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] And why did you do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   [CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] At that point, I had again conflicting stories about who had been picked up where, whether anybody at all lived in the apartment complex, if anybody. It was odd that they were driving through the parking lot, picking people up on foot at that hour of the morning.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   [PROSECUTOR:] Right.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   [CORPORAL DAUGHTERS:] And before I continue any further, or continue to a search of the vehicle, which Ms. Gillespie allowed us to do, I wanted to make sure none of the passengers were carrying any weapons.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Corporal Daughters testified that, as he conducted the\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk of Sellman, he felt the impression of a gun where Sellman's belt buckle would be. Corporal Daughters removed a semiautomatic handgun from Sellman's waistband. A subsequent search revealed drugs, including cocaine, on Sellman's person. Officer Kramer, who was no longer a law enforcement officer at the time of the hearing on the motion to suppress, testified at the hearing and concurred with Corporal Daughters's description of the events as they occurred on November 12, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   During the hearing on the motion to suppress, Gillespie disputed much of Corporal Daughters's testimony. Gillespie testified that the damage to the vehicle was barely visible and that the officers had to crouch down to show her what needed to be repaired. Gillespie characterized the Corporal Daughters's behavior toward the occupants of the vehicle as \"pretty mean[,]\" and she testified that she unequivocally told the officers \"no\" when they asked to search the vehicle. Gillespie also testified that warrant check took approximately twenty\n   minutes, which conflicted with Corporal Daughters's and Officer Kramer's testimony at the hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The circuit court found that the frisk of Sellman was valid for the following reasons: (1) the passengers in the car outnumbered the officers; (2) the stop occurred late at night in a high-crime area; (3) the officers observed Sellman coming from a dark area; (4) the officers became suspicious of Sellman based on his behavior in the vehicle; and (5) the officers \"had a reasonable articulable suspicion at that point to do the [frisk]\" of Sellman. Additionally, the circuit court found that the\n   length of the stop was valid because Gillespie consented.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Sellman noted an appeal, and in an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the circuit court's denial of the motion to suppress. Specifically, the Court of Special Appeals determined that Sellman's suspicious behavior, combined with his presence late at night in a high-crime area, was \"sufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion, in the eyes of an experienced law enforcement officer, that [Sellman] had committed or was planning to commit a crime.\" The Court of Special Appeals also remarked that Corporal Daughters's \"concern that [Sellman] had broken into cars supported a reasonable suspicion that he was armed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   In the instant case, I would hold that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that criminal activity may have been afoot and to believe that Sellman may have been armed and dangerous. In evaluating whether a frisk of an individual is warranted, the Court must balance \"the need to search (or seize) against the invasion which the search (or seizure) entails.\"\n   <em>\n    Terry v.

In so concluding, I would not grant greater weight to nervousness as a factor in a totality of the circumstances analysis than this Court has previously. Rather, consistent with prior holdings, I would note that nervousness alone is not dispositive in a determination of reasonable suspicion; however, persistent nervousness is a factor that this Court should consider as part of the totality of the circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See United States v.

Corporal Daughters testified that when the officers first observed Sellman step out from the shadows of the apartment complex, Sellman stopped, quickly changed course, and then stopped again after seeing the marked law enforcement vehicle. Sellman's reaction to the law enforcement vehicle was made more suspicious by his emergence from a dark area of the apartment complex where there was no entrance. As with many factors that the Court considers as part of the totality of the circumstances, an individual's presence in a dark area alone does not give rise to the suspicion that they are armed and dangerous.\n   <em>\n    See Bailey v.

This Court has, however, noted that it will consider such factors as part of the totality of the circumstances. Indeed, in\n   <em>\n    Ransome v.

Corporal Daughters testified that, throughout the course of the stop, Sellman sat \"completely rigid in his seat, he had his hands on his knees and was looking straight ahead and never turned his head once.\" Corporal Daughters indicated that this behavior was unusual. In assessing whether an individual's nervousness is beyond the usual level, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit has credited the opinion of the law enforcement officers who observed the nervous behavior.\n   <em>\n    See Simpson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3691276\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/609/1140/#p1148\">\n    609 F.3d at 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (The law enforcement officer \"did not merely assert that [the defendant] was nervous, he provided a basis for that conclusion-[the defendant] was shaking uncontrollably throughout the entire encounter, even when assured he would not get a ticket. ...

In this case, the circuit court found Corporal Daughters's testimony credible, and, as such, Corporal Daughters's characterization of Sellman's nervousness as unusual is a relevant factor to be considered in determining the existence of reasonable suspicion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Of particular significance in the present case is Sellman's provision of false identification to Corporal Daughters. Indeed, the circumstances of this case closely mirror those in cases in which other courts have determined reasonable suspicion existed based partially on the provision of false identification.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Here, when the officers ran the name and date of birth that Sellman provided through the database, no information came back, \"as if [the name] [did not] exist.\" I would agree with the United States Court of Appeals for the\n   Seventh Circuit that an individual's provision of false identification bears on considerations of officer safety.\n   <em>\n    See Richmond\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4205756\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/641/260/#p261\">\n    641 F.3d at 262\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The 'no record on file' report generated by the pseudonym indicated that [the defendant] might have been trying to hide information.\" (Citation omitted)).

Thus, the circumstances of the present case are distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   , as the defendant in\n   <em>\n    Powell\n   </em>\n   did not provide a false name to law enforcement officers, did not continue to insist that the name was accurate after a database search, and did not appear nervous before and during the course of the stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   In its unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals explained that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that Sellman was involved with criminal activity:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   The totality of these circumstances, viewed in the light most favorable to the State, was sufficient to arouse reasonable suspicion, in the eyes of an experienced law enforcement\n   officer, that [Sellman] had committed or was planning to commit a crime.

I would conclude that this case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Simpler\n   </em>\n   . As discussed above, theft from a vehicle, unlike underage drinking, may involve the use of instruments that could present a danger to law enforcement officers. Additionally, other courts have held that suspicion of a theft crime may justify a\n   <em>\n    Terry\n   </em>\n   frisk if the officer believes that his or her safety may be at risk in apprehending the individual.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Op. at 544-46, 144 A.3d at 781-83. Here, a concern about theft from cars was but one aspect of a myriad of\n   factors giving rise to reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot and that Sellman was potentially armed and dangerous. As recognized by the Majority, Sellman was observed coming from a dark area on the side of the apartment building where there was no entrance; the apartment building was in a high-crime area; Sellman behaved nervously upon seeing a law enforcement vehicle and was picked up at a location around the corner, separately from the other occupants of the vehicle; during the stop, Sellman appeared nervous in the vehicle, looking straight ahead and never looking at Corporal Daughters; Corporal Daughters received information from Gillespie that Sellman lived in the apartment complex, while Sellman did not respond; and Sellman\n   provided a false name, \"Marcus Neal Saunders,\" for which there was no information or Motor Vehicle Administration record. Corporal Daughters's testimony was that, after gaining consent to search the vehicle, he decided to frisk Sellman based on the responses of the occupants in the car and the circumstances that he had observed. Although Corporal Daughters, indeed, testified that, prior to searching the vehicle, he wanted to be sure that no one in the car was armed, the record establishes that he did not testify that this was the sole or primary basis for frisking Sellman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   At its core, the Majority opinion states that the law enforcement officers' observations of Sellman \"revealed innocent conduct\" and that the officers did not have \"an objective reason to support\" the suspicion that Sellman was involved in criminal activity or was armed. Maj. Op. at 550-51, 144 A.3d at 786. To be sure, each factor observed by the officers-for example, nervousness, coming from a dark area, being in a high-crime area late at night, and Gillespie's statement that Sellman lived at the apartment complex, coupled with Sellman's failure to respond when Daughters asked if anyone in the vehicle lived at the apartment complex-does not constitute a crime in and of itself. It has never been required that reasonable suspicion be based on the observation of actual criminal activity. The entire underpinning of reasonable suspicion is that there are a totality of circumstances sufficient to give rise to the belief that criminal activity is afoot and an individual is armed and dangerous. In my view, such was the case here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Although the need to protect citizens from unwarranted stops and frisks is of critical importance to the credibility of law enforcement and, ultimately, to the safety of the community, properly applying the law to the facts and evaluating the existence of reasonable suspicion are equally important.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   In sum, viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the State, I would conclude that, under the totality of the circumstances, the evidence is sufficient to establish that Corporal Daughters had reasonable articulable suspicion to believe that criminal activity was afoot and that Sellman presented a\n   danger to the officers at the time of the frisk.

But concerning crime in the apartment complex, the record reflects that Corporal Daughters was asked: \"[S]tarting on November 12 were there any problems in that area, up to that-leading up to the November 12[?]\" To this question, Corporal Daughters responded that there had been multiple thefts from automobiles, shootings, handguns recovered, and drug busts in the apartment complex.
