Mass. Oct. 23, 2018). Both Plaintiffs and the Government have moved for summary judgment on whether mandatory detention of the class members under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) for over six months violates the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause or the Eighth Amendment Excessive Bail Clause. After hearing, the Court\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 453) and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWS IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIES IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   the Government's motion for summary judgment (Docket No. 455).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In summary, the Court holds and declares as follows: First, as the Government agrees, mandatory detention without a bond hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) violates due process when an noncitizen's individual circumstances render the detention unreasonably prolonged in relation to its purpose in ensuring the removal of deportable noncitizens with criminal records. Second, the determination of whether mandatory detention without a bond hearing has become unreasonably prolonged is a fact-specific analysis. The most important factor in determining whether detention has become unreasonably prolonged is the length of the detention. The Court rejects Plaintiffs' request that the Court impose a bright-line six-month rule on the ground that it is unsupported by the record and the caselaw. Third, in the unusual instances when mandatory, categorical detention lasts for more than one year during agency removal proceedings, excluding any dilatory tactics attributable to the noncitizen, the delay is likely to be unreasonable. This one-year period reflects the Government's own regulations and policies, which aim to complete removal proceedings in no more than nine months, and statistics showing that most removal proceedings take less than one year. However, detention of under a year may be unreasonably prolonged if the matter just lingers on the immigration court or Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") docket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Fourth, a noncitizen subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing under \u00a7 1226(c) must bring a habeas petition in federal court to challenge his detention as\n   unreasonably prolonged. If the court agrees, the individual is entitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge at which the Government bears the burden of proving that he is either dangerous by clear and convincing evidence or a risk of flight by a preponderance of the evidence. If the Government demonstrates that the individual is dangerous or a risk of flight, for example if he has a serious criminal record, he is not entitled to release. Fifth, in making its release determination, the immigration court may not impose excessive bail, must evaluate the individual's ability to pay in setting bond, and must consider alternative conditions of release such as GPS monitoring that reasonably assure the safety of the community and the individual's future appearances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Court assumes familiarity with the complex procedural posture of this case from its October 23, 2018 memorandum and order and only briefly summarizes the relevant background.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205269992\">\n    2018 WL 5269992\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1-3.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 1, 2013, Plaintiff Mark Anthony Reid filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus and complaint for injunctive relief that raised statutory and constitutional claims challenging mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c).

The court evaluated two approaches to implementing this reasonableness requirement: an automatic bond hearing once mandatory detention exceeds six months (\"six-month rule\") or a bond hearing only when mandatory detention has become unreasonable as analyzed on a case-by-case basis (\"individualized reasonableness rule\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324218\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/275/#p282\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4324218\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/991/275/#p282\">\n    at 279-82\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Disagreeing with the district court, however, the First Circuit held that Supreme Court\n   precedent required it to adopt the individualized reasonableness rule.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 495-98. It instructed district courts evaluating the reasonableness of \u00a7 1226(c) detention without a bond hearing to \"examine the presumptions upon which [mandatory detention] was based (such as brevity and removability)\" and consider \"the total length of the detention; the foreseeability of proceedings concluding in the near future ...; the period of the detention compared to the criminal sentence; the promptness (or delay) of the immigration authorities or the detainee; and the likelihood that the proceedings will culminate in a final removal order.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 500. Based on this holding, the First Circuit vacated the grant of summary judgment to Plaintiffs on the class claims.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 501. Since its decision raised questions as to the continued propriety of class certification, the court declined to address Plaintiffs' cross-appeal challenging the district court's holding that due process does not require the Government to bear the burden of proof at a bond hearing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   The court noted, however, that Plaintiffs raised \"a bevy of weighty constitutional arguments\" concerning the procedural protections required at a bond hearing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Two months later, the Supreme Court granted certiorari in\n   <em>\n    Jennings v.

Periods of detention directly attributable to an alien's dilatory tactics should not count in determining whether detention has exceeded the one-year mark. The Court also does not exclude the possibility that an alien's individual circumstances would render mandatory detention of less than one year unreasonable if the Government unreasonably delays or the case languishes on a docket. The one-year period simply recognizes that, based on EOIR's own goals and statistics, the agency should reasonably be able to complete removal proceedings for most aliens within one year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The Court's refusal to import the six-month rule from\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   into the context of mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) does not prevent the adoption of a presumption that mandatory detention exceeding one year is unreasonable. As noted above, the six-month rule in\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   provided a metric to determine how long toward an unforeseeable endpoint (the possible execution of a final removal order) could be considered reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252713\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/486/#p494\">\n    819 F.3d at 496\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Under\n   <em>\n    Zadvydas\n   </em>\n   , an alien subject to a final order of removal cannot challenge his detention until the six-month period has elapsed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    533 U.S. at 701\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9313599\" index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/533/678/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 2491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, an alien subject to mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) may bring an individual habeas petition at any point. The one-year presumption simply acknowledges that, given EOIR's own goals and statistics, detention for longer than a year is likely to be unreasonably prolonged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Once an alien's mandatory detention has become unreasonably prolonged in violation of due process, he is entitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge, not immediate release. At the bond hearing, an immigration judge will assess the alien's dangerousness and risk of flight. The Court recognizes the Government's concern about the extensive criminal records of many members of the class and emphasizes that an immigration judge is under no obligation to release a criminal alien deemed to be dangerous or a risk of flight under the burden and standard of proof described below. Indeed, when Judge Ponsor's 2014 injunction was in effect, more than half of the class members were denied bond. Aliens convicted of certain relatively minor, nonviolent offenses (like simple drug possession or gambling), however, are subject to mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c), and just under half of the class members granted bond hearings were released on supervision or offered bond. Already tasked with holding bond hearings for aliens detained under \u00a7 1226(a), immigration judges are capable of determining which criminal aliens are dangerous or risks of flight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Reasonableness Hearings or Individual Habeas Petitions?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As an alternative to the six-month rule, Plaintiffs argue that due process requires a \"reasonableness hearing\" before the immigration\n   court for any criminal alien detained under \u00a7 1226(c) for more than six months at which the Government must bear the burden of showing that the alien's continued categorical detention remains reasonable. If the immigration court determines that mandatory detention has become unreasonable, Plaintiffs submit, it must hold a bond hearing. Plaintiffs' suggestion for reasonableness hearings before the immigration court is derived from a footnote in the First Circuit's withdrawn opinion in this case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Reid\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4252713\" index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/819/486/#p494\">\n    819 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   502 n.5 (\"[W]e have no occasion to consider here whether another petitioner might be able to challenge the individualized reasonableness of his continued categorical detention before the immigration courts rather than the federal courts.\"). The Government responds that the proper mechanism for a criminal alien to challenge his mandatory detention as unreasonable is via an individual habeas petition in federal court. I agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The Government argues that providing every alien detained under \u00a7 1226(c) for six months with a reasonableness hearing would overwhelm the already overburdened immigration courts. Moreover, the Government raises a more fundamental concern: the immigration court's lack of jurisdiction to adjudicate the constitutional question of when mandatory detention under \u00a7 1226(c) becomes unreasonable. Administrative agencies generally do not adjudicate questions concerning the constitutionality of congressional statutes.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

As discussed above, due process requires certain procedural protections at bond hearings. In the absence of an injunction, class members risk irreparable harm from the loss of their liberty.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ferrara v.

Supp. 2d 351\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (D. Mass. 2005) (\"Obviously, the loss of liberty is a ... severe form of irreparable injury.\"). Since this injunction does not require bond hearings for each class member, it imposes minimal burden on the Government. Finally, the public interest supports requiring the Government to obey the Constitution in its administration of immigration detention.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Preminger v.

In opposing an injunction, the Government again emphasizes its concerns about criminal aliens' dangerousness and flight risk, but the procedural protections mandated by due process simply ensure that the Government detains only aliens who are in fact dangerous or flight risks. Plaintiffs have therefore met the four prerequisites for a permanent injunction ordering certain procedural protections at their bond hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 453), and the Government's motion for summary judgment is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   (Docket No. 455).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The Court denies Plaintiffs' request for a permanent injunction ordering the Government to provide class members with bond or reasonableness hearings. The Court also denies Plaintiffs' request for a declaratory judgment insofar as they seek a declaration that due process requires an automatic bond hearing or reasonableness hearing for all criminal aliens detained under \u00a7 1226(c) for more than six months.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DECLARATORY JUDGMENT\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Court declares that mandatory detention without a bond hearing under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"294\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201226\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) violates due process when the detention becomes unreasonably prolonged in relation to its purpose in ensuring the removal of deportable criminal aliens. The most important factor in determining the reasonableness of a criminal alien's mandatory detention is the length of the detention. Mandatory detention without a bond hearing is likely to be unreasonable if it lasts for more than one year, excluding any delays due to the alien's dilatory tactics. A criminal alien subject to mandatory detention without a bond hearing under \u00a7 1226(c) must bring a habeas petition in federal court to challenge his detention as unreasonably prolonged. If the court agrees, the alien is entitled to a bond hearing before an immigration judge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     PERMANENT INJUNCTION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For any bond hearing held for a class member, the Court orders that the immigration court require the Government to prove that the alien is either dangerous by clear and convincing evidence or a risk of flight by a preponderance of the evidence.
