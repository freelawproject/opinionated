For the reasons explained below, the Court will grant summary judgment in favor of defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The pleadings in this case chronicle a disturbing saga of a dangerous attraction between a young woman with a prior history of emotional problems and a very troubled, possessive, and ultimately abusive young man. Plaintiff maintains that the school fell short of its statutory obligation as an educational institution to protect her from sexual harassment, and she submits that GW was negligent in performing the duties it owed her as a student when it dealt with her reports about VT. But she has proven neither, and there is no cause of action available to her based on a contract theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   With respect to Count One, the Title IX count, the Court finds that at certain points in the chronology, the school was on notice that VT's abuse of plaintiff was based on his hostility towards her as a woman and therefore, the statutory obligations were triggered. But GW was not deliberately indifferent to plaintiff's plight when it responded to the information with which it was provided, and it did not violate the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   With respect to Count Two, the breach of contract claim, the Court finds that even if the contract between VT and GW was intended to benefit the plaintiff, plaintiff as a third-party beneficiary cannot sue the University for breach since it was the promisee, and not the promisor, in the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As for negligence, plaintiff's claims fail in the absence of any expert testimony to define the nature of the duty GW owed plaintiff as its student and what the reasonable exercise of professional judgment would have called for under the complicated set of circumstances here. Plaintiff, who suffered from serious mental health problems before she arrived on campus, has also failed to provide any expert testimony on the issue of causation, and there is no evidence tying the emotional consequences she has suffered to GW's conduct, as opposed to the abuse perpetrated by VT or other contributing factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Finally, plaintiff has failed to establish the necessary predicates for a negligent\n   supervision claim: a duty on the part of GW, the employer, that arises from a source other than a statute, and a showing that the employee himself engaged in tortious behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   As the hearing in the case made clear, plaintiff simply cannot place her finger on the specifics of when and how GW dropped the ball in her case. Notwithstanding the evidence of their apparent immaturity and mental health issues, plaintiff and VT were legally adults when they stepped under the University's umbrella, and given overlapping statutory obligations and privacy requirements that constrain educational institutions, the school could not do more at various critical junctures without plaintiff's consent. Also, the school owed certain duties to VT, and there were points where it may have been bound to take his rights as an accused into account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   More important, at the end of the day, the University's conduct can only be measured against what it knew at any given time. Thus, one cannot ignore the fact that GW's ability to carry out its obligations in this case was complicated by the many occasions in which plaintiff misrepresented or failed to disclose critical information about her ongoing contacts with VT. Indeed, it appears that GW's efforts were often undermined by plaintiff's unfortunate and repeated decisions to welcome VT back into her life - both online and in person. Counsel for plaintiff posited at oral argument that a more vigorous approach by the school under the specific auspices of Title IX could have made a difference, since skilled counseling might have enabled plaintiff to separate herself from the cycle of attraction, manipulation, and abuse sooner. It may very well be that the contacts plaintiff reinitiated were more of a symptom than a cause of the abuse she suffered, but there is no question that throughout this period, the University repeatedly offered to provide her with the counseling she sorely needed, and it offered her access to additional resources and tools to enforce a separation from VT, but she declined to accept that assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Court is not suggesting in any way that this survivor is to blame for her own ordeal. But the case is here for decision because plaintiff has taken on the burden of proving that the University was responsible for the emotional distress she suffered in the wake of this relationship. The school is to be judged based on the known circumstances, and when one considers the circumstances known to the school at the time of plaintiff's reports, it is apparent that the situation was never cut and dried, and it did not then and does not now lend itself to easy solutions. The Court is not empowered - and it lacks the expertise in any event - to decide whether as a matter of sound educational policy or mental health practice, the school could or should have taken a different step, or adopted a preferable course of action, at any particular time. The Court is required to apply the applicable legal standards, which establish a very high bar for plaintiff to satisfy in order to obtain the monetary damages she seeks. A review of the entire record - which necessarily will be set out in great detail below - makes it clear that plaintiff has not met that burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the autumn of 2010, Ricca Prasad entered George Washington University as an undergraduate student.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [Dkt. # 81] (\"Pl.'s SOF\") \u00b6 1; Def.'s Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [Dkt. # 60-5] (\"Def.'s SOF\") \u00b6 1.

Plaintiff has presented ample evidence that would enable a rational juror could find that she was subjected to \"severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive\" sexual harassment, and that the school had actual knowledge of his conduct.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , Incident Report of Jan. 17, 2012, Pl.'s Ex. 6, at AA0000601-624 (forwarding sexually threatening emails that VT had sent to plaintiff and her friends from London); Email of Apr. 24, 2013 from Pl. to Slifka, Pl.'s Ex. 26, at AA0000765-68 (forwarding screen shots of sexually harassing messages from VT to plaintiff); Email of May 3, 2013 from Pl. to Slifka, Pl.'s Ex. 7, at AA0000579-81 (forwarding sexually harassing emails from VT to plaintiff);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Emails of Apr. 1, 2013 among Esquivel, Lico, Goretsky, Miller, and Slifka, Pl.'s Ex. 47, at AA0010492-3 (stating that Lico was going to contact Deputy Title IX Coordinator Pereira given \"that there may be a sexual assault history here\").\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The avalanche of sexually explicit insults and threats in this case is easily distinguished from the \"mere name-calling\" described in the\n    <em>\n     Davis\n    </em>\n    opinion, and defendant's somewhat dismissive characterization of the multitude of disturbing communications cannot be squared with the tone and content of the communications themselves. Viewing this evidence in the light most favorable to plaintiff, the Court finds that a rational trier of fact could decide that VT's intimidating and demeaning communications, the stalking, and the assaultive behavior were all motivated by hostility towards plaintiff's gender, that the harassment was severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive, and that the University knew about it, giving rise to obligations under Title IX.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    But this does not end the inquiry.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    <strong>\n     B.

While the record shows VT violated the order and that plaintiff may not have welcomed all of his communications during this time, Pl.'s SODF \u00b6 11, there is no evidence that she ever reported his violations to GW, and there is evidence that she resumed consensual communications while the NCO was in place.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11133593\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/629/#p650\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    (\"Ms. Prasad does not dispute that on August 26, 2012 she emailed VT to ask him where he was, or that she met with him later that day near the GW campus.\").

At that time, there was no reason for Slifka to assume that his warning to VT would go unheeded, because GW had never been informed that VT had violated the first NCO, and this was the first time plaintiff complained that VT was violating the second one.

GW's response after VT was suspended was not clearly unreasonable.\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-158\">\n    Plaintiff also faults the school for its handling of VT after it ordered his suspension. The evidence shows that VT continued to contact and harass plaintiff in violation of the NCO, and plaintiff describes the school's attempts to stop him from communicating with her as inadequate. But the evidence also establishes that she repeatedly declined to seek a civil protection order, and that she opened the door to VT's renewed communications with her.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    In July 2013, after plaintiff had left campus for the summer and VT had left for good, plaintiff informed the school that VT was still communicating with her. In response, GW issued an order that VT would be arrested if he was found on University property. Interdepartmental Mem. of Jul. 29, 2013, Pl.'s Ex. 81, at AA0001115. Combs again gave plaintiff information about how to obtain a Civil Protection Order, which would give plaintiff broader protection, and plaintiff again failed to pursue that option.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Email of Jul. 23, 2013 from Combs to Pl., Pl.'s Ex. 79, at ID 000138;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Email of Jul. 29, 2013 from Pl. to Combs, Pl.'s Ex. 79, at ID000139 (\"I don't really care about the protection order.\"). She subsequently reported additional violations of the NCO, but she repeatedly told Combs that she was not looking to take action. Email of Jan. 24, 2014 from Pl. to Combs, Pl.'s Ex. 100, at AA0007828.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-160\">\n    Plaintiff identifies Combs' failure to provide her with Title IX resources in August of 2013 - when plaintiff first revealed the sexual assaults that had taken place two years earlier - as a key instance of GW's failure to fulfill its statutory responsibilities and a basis for the issuance of judgment in her favor. In assessing this contention, the Court notes at the outset that plaintiff told Combs she could not disseminate the information, and honoring plaintiff's wishes to keep the students' prior history confidential can hardly constitute deliberate indifference.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roe v.

Also, there is conflicting evidence on the question of whether Combs told plaintiff about GW's Title IX resources at that time or not.\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    Combs Dep. at 303:4-305:21 (stating she told plaintiff about the University's Title IX resources at the meeting when plaintiff reported the assaults)\n    <em>\n     with\n    </em>\n    Prasad Dep. at 278:13-281:16 (testifying that she never individually received Title IX information until late spring 2015). But the Court holds that this dispute of fact is immaterial: even if plaintiff is correct that she was not specifically directed to Title IX resources in a meeting with a GW counselor until 2015, the undisputed evidence shows that GW's response to VT's harassment during this time was not clearly unreasonable.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-161\">\n    First, there is no basis to believe that providing plaintiff with Title IX resources\n    in particular would have changed VT's behavior. Indeed, her only suggestion is that it would have changed\n    <em>\n     her\n    </em>\n    behavior. \"[H]ad Miss Prasad been referred to the Title IX office in the first place\n    <em>\n     it is quite possible\n    </em>\n    that she could have turned to them and to counseling to help navigate the situation that she found herself in.\" Dec. 11, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 7, 14 (emphasis added). But as counsel's choice of language reflects, this is entirely speculative, particularly given that plaintiff received counseling and therapy throughout much of her time at GW.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 33, 43, 74, 158-59, 161, 167, 171, 179; Pl.'s SODF \u00b6 73; Prasad Dep. at 242:8-246:3. The assertion also assumes that plaintiff would have been willing to work with a Title IX counselor - an assumption that is undermined by her insistence that Combs not report or otherwise share the information about the earlier sexual assaults.\n    <em>\n     See also\n    </em>\n    Email of Jan. 23, 2015 from Pl. to C.

The University sought to prevent VT's ongoing harassment of plaintiff (and its own staff) by using the disciplinary tools available to it, and encouraging plaintiff to secure protections available to her.

R. Evid. 702, to explain what that duty consists of and how the institution's judgment should reasonably have been exercised in these circumstances. While the Court is not announcing a blanket rule that an expert must testify in every case involving an academic institution, it finds in its discretion that plaintiff could not meet her burden to establish the standard of care, or that the standard was breached in this instance, given the absence of any expert guidance on how reputable universities typically address the extremely difficult circumstances with which GW was faced in this case, and how they should balance the multiple - and potentially conflicting - interests of the individuals involved and the layers of statutory and common law obligations running to both the victim and the accused.

But this superficial overview does not give the jury any standard to apply, and it is simply an invitation to apply a strict liability theory that would be inconsistent with law.

It is overly simplistic for the plaintiff to insist that the average juror could simply hear the evidence in this record and apply his or her common sense: would even a thoughtful and dispassionate juror necessarily know what level of response was appropriate at any particular point in this chronology, particularly given how much information about what was actually going on was withheld? What is the standard of care for protecting a victim who refuses to abide by a No Contact Order herself, or who insists that it be lifted?

What are the limits on a school's ability to separate and counsel young people who are its students but who are also legally adults? At what point and to what extent could the school address the fact that both of these students appear to have struggled with significant mental health issues? Was the university permitted to consider, or inquire into, plaintiff's previous psychiatric history? Or VT's? What about whether he had any prior record of assaultive or stalking behavior? Where and when do the constitutional rights of an accused fit in?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-220\">\n    Plaintiff submits that GW's alleged failure to enforce the April 1, 2013 No Contact\n    Order was a breach of duty that caused harm to the plaintiff, Dec. 11, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 68; but what are the steps that a reasonably prudent institution would take to enforce an NCO, particularly after the student is no longer enrolled?

And defendant argues, based on\n    <em>\n     Islar\n    </em>\n    , that a plaintiff advancing this claim must demonstrate that the\n    <em>\n     employee's\n    </em>\n    conduct was\n    <em>\n     itself\n    </em>\n    actionable as a common law tort.

The first is an October 2011 email about another student's experience with the school's response to student-on-student verbal abuse. [redacted].

The parent was unhappy with the school's handling of conditions that had been imposed on a student in a disciplinary hearing, which the parent complained led to his daughter seeing the student at a fraternity house from which he was barred.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12271490\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/217/261/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    In response to the email, Slifka wrote to the parent to apologize, said the school temporarily modified the conditions to allow the student temporary access to a particular building, that the modification should have been communicated to the victim, but that the modification did not allow the assailant to be at the fraternity house in any event. Email of Oct. 3, 2013 from Slifka, Def.'s Ex. 80, at AA0013768-69.

The declarant complains about how the University handled the matter from the outset, but she also states that she initially declined to press charges. [redacted] (stating she did not name her assailant in her initial report and that GWPD advised her that it would not take any action unless she added his name to the report). She also complains about the procedures involved in the disciplinary proceeding after she decided to name her assailant, and the school's handling of the matter after the hearing.\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 3(d), 4. While the declaration presents a number of complaints about the school's handling of the matter, its only mention of Slifka is that the declarant used a phone in his office to call into the disciplinary hearing rather than have to appear in person in the same room as her assailant: \"Mr. Slifka facilitated my calling in to deliver my testimony, and at no point did he explain to me my rights as a complainant during the hearing.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 4(a).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-246\">\n    While these emails and the declaration present some evidence that various officials at GW were put on notice of the authors' dissatisfaction with its performance and procedures for addressing sexual assaults, none of them show that Slifka \"behaved in a dangerous or otherwise incompetent manner.\"\n    <em>\n     Beyene v.

Pl.'s Opp. at 43, citing Emails of Jul. 24, 2013, Pl.'s Ex. 80, at AA0010685-86. But a reading of the full email exchange does not support plaintiff's argument. On July 24, 2013, after VT's suspension, GWPD Chief Kevin Hay wrote Slifka and GWPD Captain Mark Balazik about VT:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n    Based on his gross misconduct ignoring the no contact order and his history. I believe [O]SRR needs to take more affirmative action with this case ... When you see the evidence collected in the case ..., we should talk about additional sanctions.

In the same email, Hay asked Balazik to confirm VT was barred from campus, and Balazik responded:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-250\">\n    I spoke with Gabe on Friday regarding this matter because I was aware that [VT] was suspended from GW this past semester\n    <em>\n     but has not been barred from campus.\n    </em>\n    Usually suspended students are automatically barred at the request of SRR, however an exception was made by OGC in this matter sin[c]e [VT] had only a couple of classes left for his degree and they wanted him to complete his degree requirements online.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-251\">\n    When I spoke with Gabe, I asked him to revisit the matter with Toi Carter at OGC since he has no intention of following GW's requirements.

First, a reading of Balazik's entire email makes clear that Balazik was referring to\n    <em>\n     VT's\n    </em>\n    having \"no intention of following GW's requirements,\" not\n    <em>\n     Slifka\n    </em>\n    , as plaintiff represents.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Pl.'s Opp. at 43 (quoting the email as: \"[w]hen I spoke with Gabe [Slifka], I asked him to revisit the matter with Toi Carter at OGC since he [Slifka] has no intention of following GWs requirements\"). Balazik wanted Slifka to ask the Office of General Counsel to remove the exception that allowed VT on campus since\n    <em>\n     VT\n    </em>\n    had no intention of following's GW's requirements and\n    <em>\n     VT\n    </em>\n    was suspected of placing food orders to GW officials. Thus, the email exchange does not show that Slifka was engaged in any tortious conduct, but rather that various offices within GW, including OSRR, GWPD, and OGC, were involved in determining how to address VT's ongoing harassment of both plaintiff and its own staff. And the record shows that shortly after this email exchange, Slifka issued an order barring VT from University property. Interdepartmental Mem. of Jul. 29, 2013, Pl.'s Ex. 81, at AA0001115.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    Indeed, as the office responsible for carrying out the University's disciplinary decisions, Slifka Dep. at 35:15-16 (\"[T]he University investigates.

[T]here's a lot of complaints that come into the discipline system. We are not the most popular people on campus, as you can imagine.\"). Despite this, discovery in this case uncovered no complaints aside from the two emails cited by plaintiff concerning the handling of Title IX matters by Slifka, who had worked at GW since 2006.

GW notes that plaintiff excelled academically, Def.'s Mem. at 29, completing her undergraduate study in three years and earning a master's degree in two years, both with highest honors. Pl.'s SOF \u00b6 1; Pl.'s Ex. 1. But this is largely a testament to her own perseverance and commitment, and the Court is not persuaded that plaintiff's case necessarily fails because she was successful academically. The more relevant point is that plaintiff came forward with very little\n     <em>\n      evidence\n     </em>\n     that her education was interrupted or compromised. There was some testimony in her deposition that she missed some classes in the spring of 2013, and she attributes those occurrences to mental health issues. Prasad Dep. at 226:18-227:4. Also, counsel stated at the hearing that over time, plaintiff became less involved in extracurricular activities than she had been at the start of her college career. Dec. 18, 2018 Hr'g Tr. at 45-46. But plaintiff did not introduce records of any hospitalization or ongoing treatment that led to, for example, prolonged absences, incompletes, or temporary withdrawal from school for any period of time. The only other possible educational deprivation plaintiff identified was the fact that she decided to complete the fall 2014 semester of the second year of her master's program from Florida instead of staying on campus. But by that point, VT was no longer a GW student, and plaintiff did return in the spring. Thus, to the extent this is a separate element of a Title IX claim, the evidence is weak, and it does not undermine the conclusion that judgment should be entered in favor of the defendant.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"28\">\n    <p id=\"p-289\">\n     [redacted]\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"29\">\n    <p id=\"p-290\">\n     Plaintiff also argues that she accepted the benefit of the contract because she relied on it when she dropped her Civil Protection Order against VT, giving her a cause of action for a breach of contract claim.

While the Court finds the non-binding district court opinion to be well-reasoned and instructive, the court in that case found expert testimony to be required in the unique context of police custodial interrogation and the proximate causation of medical injuries, and it did not purport to lay down a general rule for negligence claims.\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4266144\" index=\"209\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/146/190/#p194\">\n      146 F.

Pl.'s Opp. at 31-40. But the\n     <em>\n      Hedgepeth\n     </em>\n     opinion does not stand for the proposition that no expert is ever required; the court stated, \"[w]hether the defendant breached [its] obligations is to be determined by reference to the specific terms of the undertaking agreed upon by the parties or, otherwise, by an objective standard of reasonableness applicable to the underlying relationship or undertaking.\"\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280234\" index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/22/789/#p810\">\n      22 A.3d at 811\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Here, even if one were to conclude that GW assumed the responsibility for protecting plaintiff from VT during those time periods when she did not ask it to stand down, there is no clear evidence in the record of \"the specific terms of the undertaking agreed upon by the parties,\" and the University's conduct can only be measured against \"an objective standard of reasonableness applicable to the underlying relationship.\"\n     <em>\n      <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7280234\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/22/789/#p810\">\n       Id.\n      </extracted-citation>\n     </em>\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"33\">\n    <p id=\"p-294\">\n     <em>\n      See also\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Messina v.
