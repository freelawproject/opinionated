Vicarious Assault and Battery (Count XXII)\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Plaintiff alleges that Defendant Cruz failed to provide for his safety and is therefore vicariously liable for the subsequent assault and battery by fellow inmates. Under Massachusetts law, \"the guiding principle used in deciding cases involving an assertion of vicarious liability\" is \"the right to control the physical conduct of the other.\"\n    <em>\n     Hohenleitner v. Quorum Health Resources, Inc.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"993907\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/435/424/#p436\">\n     435 Mass. 424\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 436,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=758%20N.E.2d%20616\">\n     758 N.E.2d 616\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2001). Here, the doctrine is inapposite as Defendant Cruz had no right to control the physical conduct of Plaintiff's fellow inmates.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      Conclusion\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-65\">\n    For the reasons stated above, Defendant Cruz's motion (Docket No. 52) is\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       granted\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    in part and\n    <em>\n     <strong>\n      <em>\n       denied\n      </em>\n     </strong>\n    </em>\n    in part. Accordingly,\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n    (1) Insofar as Plaintiff's claims are against Defendant Cruz in his official capacity, they are dismissed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n    (2) Plaintiff has failed to plausibly demonstrate entitlement to equitable relief.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n    (3) Count XXII is dismissed.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n    (4) Count I is dismissed insofar as it is based on Defendant Cruz's failure to prevent Defendant Bradley from informing the Boston Globe that Plaintiff acted as an informant.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n    (5) Counts I (subject to (4)), VII, VIII, IX, and XXVII survive this motion.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-71\">\n    <strong>\n     SO ORDERED\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <footnote label=\"2\">\n    <p id=\"p-75\">\n     Plaintiff's claim appears to be under state law but whether construed under state or federal law, it will survive. Federal law similarly prohibits a prisoner from bringing a federal civil action \"for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.\" 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(e). Because Plaintiff has plausibly alleged objective symptomology, his claim would also satisfy the federal threshold.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
