Menzel filed a First Amended Answer and Counterclaims (FAAC) that raises several affirmative defenses to FSS's complaint and seeks relief against FSS for copyright infringement and violation of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Before me are FSS's Motion to Dismiss Menzel's amended counterclaims and a Motion to Strike most of Menzel's affirmative defenses. Menzel has not stated a claim for contributory negligence because he did not identify a third party infringer, and has not stated a DMCA claim because he did not describe which photographs had copyright management information (CMI) removed or what the removed CMI was. He has leave to amend those claims. Otherwise, FSS's motions are denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Peter Menzel is a resident of Napa and a photographer.

FSS denied the allegations, contending that Menzel's claims were time-barred, that the doctrine of fair use protected FSS's use of the photographs, and that FSS had no intention of infringing Menzel's copyrights.

This CMI, Menzel claims, was \"in the form of metadata or visible text attribution,\" which he alleges accompanied the photographs on his website.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%206267876\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , pg. 9 \u00b6 9.

MTD 14. It points out that the images reproduced by Menzel in Exhibit A of the FAAC [Dkt. No. 21] do not themselves include any obvious CMI and there is no evidence that any textual credit was removed. MTD 15. It contends that because Menzel does not specify which photographs had CMI removed or altered and does not describe what specific CMI he employed in each medium, Menzel's allegations are insufficient.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   14-15.

Oppo. 7-8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   I agree that because Menzel has merely alleged that his photographs \"were altered to remove certain of [his] copyright management information\" without providing any facts to identify which photographs had CMI removed or to describe what the removed or altered CMI was, he has not sufficiently stated a claim under Section 1202(b)(1) with respect to \"removal,\" much less with respect to distribution under (b)(2) and (b)(3). Regarding distribution, Menzel simply reiterates the legal standard and alleges no facts in support. FAAC, pg. 12-13 \u00b6\u00b6 27-28. Without identifying what CMI FSS allegedly distributed or how that was distributed, and without identifying what CMI was removed prior to distribution and how that distribution was accomplished by defendants, Menzel has likewise failed to state a claim under Section 1202(b)(2) and (b)(3).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Motion to Dismiss is GRANTED on the DMCA claim.

MOTION TO STRIKE AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   FSS also moves to strike ten of Menzel's twelve affirmative defenses, arguing that they are redundant, impertinent, or lack sufficient facts in support. It does not move to strike Menzel's first and tenth affirmative defenses for failure to state a claim and improper request for attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Motions to strike affirmative defenses seldom simplify litigation, and this one is no exception. Menzel has alleged enough facts in the FAAC to support the defenses of \"Acted in Good Faith\" and \"Acts of Third Parties.\" FSS's argument that certain of the affirmative defenses are duplicative of each other (\"Unclean Hands,\" \"Failure to Mitigate,\" \"Acts and Omissions,\" \"Consent,\" \"Lack of Injury or Damages,\" and \"Unjust Enrichment,\" MTS 5-7) may ultimately prove to be true, but their assertion does not add complexity to this action and will not require FSS to incur additional time or expend additional money to defend this action.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arnett v.

Finally, the defenses of \"Contributory/Comparative Negligence and Assumption of Risk\" and \"No Wrongful Act,\" (MTS 6-7) might be relevant to defeat FSS's claim for attorneys' fees. Oppo. to MTS 5-6 [Dkt. No. 24].

Menzel did not unreasonably delay in bringing his claims as a matter of law. He sufficiently states a copyright claim for direct infringement, but fails to plead a contributory infringement claim and is given leave to amend that claim. FSS's fair use defense cannot be resolved as a matter of law on this record. Menzel fails to state a claim under the DMCA, but is given leave to amend.

Mot. to Dismiss (MTD) 2 n.1 [Dkt. No. 22]; Compl. Ex. 1 (Post). Under the \"incorporation by reference\" doctrine, a court may \"consider materials incorporated into the complaint or matters of public record,\" including \"documents in situations where the complaint necessarily relies upon a document or the contents of the document are alleged in a complaint, the document's authenticity is not in question and there are no disputed issues as to the document's relevance.\"\n    <em>\n     Coto Settlement v.

Because Menzel repeatedly refers to the Post and includes its web address in his counterclaims (FAAC, pg. 10 n.1), and in opposition does not oppose the request or dispute that Exhibit 1 to FSS's Complaint is a true and correct copy of the Post, this request is GRANTED.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    FSS also seeks judicial notice of other information, including the fact that the Post included a hyperlink to the amazon.com page where\n    <em>\n     Hungry Planet\n    </em>\n    could be purchased (MTD 2 n.2), as well as the fact that when a reader clicks on the photographs in the Post as it appeared on the InfoWars site, the reader was \"taken\" to the naturalsociety.com website \"where the images are stored.\" MTD 3 &amp; n.4.
