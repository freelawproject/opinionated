DAVILA, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court is a Motion to Compel Arbitration and to Dismiss filed by Defendant Tractor Supply Company (\"TSC\"). Plaintiff Debra Sweeney filed a class action complaint against TSC, her former employer, in Santa Clara Superior Court, and TSC subsequently removed the litigation to federal court. Sweeney seeks to represent a class of similarly situated individuals harmed by TSC's alleged failure include their nondiscretionary bonuses in its calculation of their overtime pay. Under Civil Local Rule 7-1(b), the Court finds this motion suitable for consideration without oral argument. Having considered the Parties' papers, the Court grants the motion to compel, and grants in part and denies in part the motion to dismiss. The action is stayed pending the arbitration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Sweeney worked as an hourly, non-exempt employee at a TSC store in Santa Clara County from around early April 2017 until late June 2018. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 7-8. TSC is a retailer of farm and ranch equipment, livestock and pet products, home improvement tools, and sporting goods. Compl. \u00b6 10. She, like other non-exempt employees, routinely received nondiscretionary remuneration, including Store Bonuses, in addition to her hourly wage. Compl. \u00b6 24. She alleges that her overtime rate of pay did not include her Store Bonuses with her hourly wage in its calculations, and that her wage statements inaccurately identified her overtime pay rate, and gross and net wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The omission of the Store Bonuses, she alleges, deprived her of the actual rate of overtime pay due to her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   She further alleges that when her employment ended, TSC failed to pay her overtime wage that it owed her.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   When Sweeney began working at TSC, she completed its onboarding process, which included filling out and executing a\n   number of forms through a computerized, interactive system.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 15 (\"Williamson Decl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 4, 7. Sweeney, like other new hires, was able to pause the onboarding process by logging out and then logging back in to resume the process at a later time.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10. This process included reviewing and agreeing to TSC's California Arbitration Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4; Williamson Decl. Ex. D (the \"Agreement\"). The interactive system presented the Agreement to Sweeney in a text box with a bar to scroll through its 17 paragraphs. Williamson Decl. \u00b6 8. At the bottom of the text box, she was presented with the following: \"By clicking 'I Agree' below and entering the last 4 digits of my Social Security Number, and clicking 'Submit,' I am electronically signing and agreeing to the Arbitration Agreement, and agree that my electronic signature is as valid as my hand-written signature.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Agreement was \"a mandatory term of continued employment,\"\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , she had to accept the Agreement to work for TSC. Agreement \u00b6 16. The onboarding system did not allow prospective employees, like Sweeney, to comment on or negotiate the terms of the Agreement. Williamson Decl. Ex. C. On March 11, 2017, Sweeney assented to the Agreement by clicking \"I Agree,\" and entering her name, the last four digits of her Social Security Number and the date. Williamson Decl. \u00b6 9. Sweeney does not dispute that she executed the Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The Agreement provides that \"any and all claims or disputes\" between TSC and its employees are subject to arbitration. Agreement \u00b6 1. It specifically covers \"claims for wages, overtime, bonuses, or other compensation due.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Arbitration under the Agreement will be administered by an agency agreed upon by the parties, or, if they cannot agree, then by National Arbitration and Mediation (\"NAM\"), and it will be governed by NAM's Employment Rules and Procedures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 3. The agreement later states that \"[a]propriate limitations on discovery and any rights to additional discovery shall be governed by the Rules of JAMS or the rules of the administering agency selected by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. It specifically provides that parties may subpoena witnesses and documents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Agreement states in bold text, \"The parties hereto acknowledge that, by entering into this Agreement, they are waiving their rights to a judicial forum for the determination of any covered Claims or disputes.\" Agreement. \u00b6 17. Under the Agreement, \"[t]he Arbitrator shall be an attorney or former judge with substantial experience in deciding employment disputes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4. The arbitrator has \"the sole and exclusive authority to resolve all Claims between Employer and Employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. Substantively, arbitrations will be governed by the state and/or federal law that would apply to a judicial action in same state where the arbitration takes place.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator is able to award any type of legal or equitable relief that would be available in court, including punitive damages if/when appropriate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The arbitrator is required to provide a \"reasoned, written decision and award\" that includes the findings and conclusions providing the bases for the award.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14. The decision and award are subject to \"confirmation, correction, or vacation\" as per the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   TSC agrees to pay the costs of the arbitration.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 15. TSC may \"modif[y] or terminate[ ]\" the Agreement \"upon thirty (30) days written notice to Employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16. \"Any modifications or termination shall be prospective only and shall not apply to any claims that have accrued, are pending in arbitration, or of which the Employer has been given notice by Employee\n   prior to the effective date of the modification or termination.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Motion to Compel Arbitration\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sweeney does not contest that she signed the Agreement or that her claims lay within the scope of the Agreement. Rather, she challenges the Agreement itself, contending that (1) it is not valid because TSC did not sign it, (2) that it is procedurally unconscionable, and (3) that it is substantively unconscionable because it is ambiguous as to the rules that govern discovery, it does not provide for sufficient discovery and it is not bilateral.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Thus, her argument goes, if\n   she sought to sue TSC, TSC could argue that it is not bound by the Agreement. Sweeney provides no legal authority supporting her position. The Agreement sufficiently indicates TSC's intent to be bound. The Agreement is provided to job applicants through an email from the address \"Tractor Supply Company Talent Acquisition.\" Ex.

The Court now turns to whether the Agreement is substantively unconscionable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. Substantive Unconscionability\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Sweeney raises three arguments that the Agreement is substantively unconscionable: (1) that the Agreement is ambiguous as to the rules that govern discovery, (2) that it does not provide for adequate discovery, and (3) that it is not bilateral. The Court first considers her arguments\n   regarding discovery. She contends that the Agreement contradicts itself because it provides in one paragraph that the \"arbitration shall be administered by National Arbitration and Mediation (NAM) and shall be governed by NAM's Employment Rules and Procedures, unless those Rules conflict with the terms of this Agreement, in which case the terms of this Agreement shall control.\" Agreement \u00b6 3. But, later it provides that \"[a]ppropriate limitations on discovery and any rights to additional discovery shall be governed by the Rules of JAMS or the rules of the administering agency selected by the parties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Sweeney says that the JAMS discovery rules allow for each side to take a single deposition of the opposing party, but the NAM rules allow for three depositions.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   JAMS Rule 17(b)\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   NAM Employment Rules &amp; Procedures No. 11(B)(ii). She contends that this purported ambiguity is analogous to\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   , where the California Court of Appeal considered an arbitration agreement that selected a set of arbitration rules that were subject to change, and \"it [was] unclear whether an arbitration would be conducted under the [selected] rules as of the time of contracting, or at the time of arbitration.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2226042\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/113/1402/\">\n    113 Cal. App. 4th at 1407\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20418\">\n    7 Cal.Rptr.3d 418\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   Court found that this ambiguity supported a finding of unconscionability because \"[b]efore the main battle commenced in arbitration, there would be a preliminary fight over which set of arbitration rules governed-something which, at the very least, would add to the customer's legal expense.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   is off point. There, the California Court of Appeal found the arbitration contract to be\n   <em>\n    procedurally\n   </em>\n   unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=7%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20418\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Sweeney does not argue that the NAM and JAMS rules are inconstant as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Harper\n   </em>\n   . Rather, she says that the Agreement itself is ambiguous as to which rules control. But the Agreement is not ambiguous. Paragraph 3 provides that the arbitration shall be \"administered by an administering agency agreed upon by the parties.\" Agreement \u00b6 3. This provision aligns with Paragraph 8 which notes that the parties may \"select[ ]\" the agency to administer the arbitration and then apply the discovery rules of that agency.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 8. Only if the parties fail to agree on an administering agency will NAM administer the arbitration and apply the NAM Employment Rules and Procedures-\"unless those Rules conflict with the terms of [the] Agreement, in which case the terms of [the] Agreement shall control.\" Agreement \u00b6 3. By the terms of Paragraph 8, the Agreement selects the JAMS rules for discovery. Thus, Paragraph 3 and Paragraph 8 do not conflict, so there is no ambiguity. The Court finds that the Agreement is not substantively unconscionable for this reason.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Sweeney further argues that the JAMS Rule 17(b) is substantively unconscionable for failing to provide adequate discovery. The Rule provides: \"Each Party may take one deposition of an opposing Party or of one individual under the control of the opposing Party.... The necessity of additional depositions shall be determined by the Arbitrator based upon the reasonable need for the requested information, the availability of other discovery options and the burdensomeness of the request on the opposing Parties and the witness.\" JAMS Rule 17(b). Sweeney argues that this unconscionably restricts her to a single deposition even though TSC, as her employer, will have more information regarding its policies and procedures than she. However, this Court, like other courts that have considered JAMS Rule 17(b) finds that it does not limit her to one deposition. Rather, it provides that each\n   party may take at least one deposition while allowing the arbitrator to order additional depositions.\n   <em>\n    Sanchez v.

Under California law, an arbitration agreement must exhibit a \"modicum of bilaterality\" so that it is not \"unfairly one sided.\"\n   <em>\n    Armendariz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1180100\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/24/83/#p114\">\n    24 Cal. 4th at 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20745\">\n    99 Cal.Rptr.2d 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20P.3d%20669\">\n    6 P.3d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Sweeney challenges the amendment provision, which states that the Agreement \"may be modified or terminated by Employer upon thirty (30) days written notice to Employee. Any modifications or termination shall be prospective only and shall not apply to any claims that have accrued, are pending in arbitration, or of which the Employer has been given notice by Employee prior to the effective date of the modification or termination.\" Agreement \u00b6 16. This provision of unilateral power to the employer is analogous to the modification provision at issue in\n   <em>\n    Ingle v. Circuit City Stores, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140488\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1165/\">\n    328 F.3d 1165\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2003). The Ninth Circuit found that provision to be substantively unconscionable, reasoning that \"[a]lthough the agreement requires [the defendant] to provide exiguous notice to its employees of termination or any modification, such notice is trivial when there is no meaningful opportunity to negotiate the terms of the agreement.... [The defendant] proscribes an employee's ability to consider and negotiate the terms of her contract.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140488\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9140488\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/328/1165/\">\n    at 1179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The same reasoning applies here where TSC is obligated to provide its employees with notice of a modification, but its employees are powerless to halt or influence such a modification. The Court finds the modification provision of the Agreement to be unconscionable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Prasad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204599645\">\n    2018 WL 4599645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   But, that does not mean that the entire Agreement is unenforceable. Rather, under California law, a court \"may refuse to enforce the contract, or it may enforce the remainder of the contract without the unconscionable clause, or it may so limit the application of any unconscionable clause as to avoid any unconscionable result.\"\n   <em>\n    Prasad\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204599645\">\n    2018 WL 4599645\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *11 (quoting\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201670.5\">\n    Cal.
