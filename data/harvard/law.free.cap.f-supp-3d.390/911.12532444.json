[Dkt. #46]. In that Motion, the defendant contended that the plaintiff had avoided compliance with discovery obligations and that even after a settlement conference on May 1, 2019 at which the plaintiff had been ordered to produce certain documents, the materials were not forthcoming. It was also contended that the plaintiff's counsel was unresponsive to inquiries about discovery. Although the plaintiff's counsel denied any impropriety, the motion was granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The Motion for Reconsideration strenuously argues that the plaintiff and his counsel were, in fact, responsive, and that the plaintiff, himself, responded as best he could given the claimed imperfect state of his memory. The Motion for Reconsideration, as amplified by the oral argument\n   this morning, argued that the court should vacate the Order of July 16, 2019 and require that the $600 paid to reimburse the defendant for the costs it incurred in making the Motion to Compel be refunded. A number of reasons were offered in the Motion (and again at the hearing this morning) for any alleged failings that occurred in discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Among them are: plaintiff's counsel merged his practice with another Firm on January 1, 2017. But he concedes that was well over a year before he filed this case. The Motion also notes the paralegal's retirement, but concedes that he stayed on to train his replacement. It also refers to a friend to whom he had hoped to refer some of his cases, but who suffered a heart attack on June 11, 2019. But that was after the materials properly sought by the defendant should have been produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Also, the Motion states that social media had been slow in responding to the subpoenas; that the plaintiff insisted he could not recall the names of any of the defendant's employees that he allegedly called about his leave. He further claimed could not remember his daughter's phone number, and he claimed he lost his tax records, but did not promptly sign the requested authorization to enable the IRS to release copies of those records, etc. But, of course, \"unfortunately... saying so doesn't make it so....\"\n   <em>\n    United States v. 5443 Suffield Terrace, Skokie, Ill.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3682630\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/607/504/#p510\">\n    607 F.3d 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 510 (7th Cir.2010).\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Madlock v.

The parties continued to disagree about whether that occurred in a timely way and whether the plaintiff's counsel was responsive to inquiries and objections from the defendant. The arguments at this morning's hearing on the plaintiff's Motion to Reconsider did not convince either plaintiff's lawyer or defendant's lawyer that their positions on timeliness and responsiveness in discovery were incorrect. Each maintained the rightness of their position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   What is certain, however, is that nowhere in the 15-page Motion for Reconsideration is there citation to any authority regarding the principles governing Motions for Reconsideration. A Motion for Reconsideration serves a limited function.

While it is not counsel's fault that the plaintiff claimed an inability to recall the names of the people he talked to on the phone or to remember his daughter's phone number, or to recall any of the names of anyone he spoke to about a job or to supposedly having lost his tax records - as the plaintiff contended - it most assuredly is his lawyer's responsibility to promptly communicate difficulties to opposing counsel and to be responsive and timely in responding to legitimate inquiries from defense counsel about these claimed inabilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   What is certain, however, is that for whatever reason the diligence and timeliness that should have been exhibited in this case was not always in evidence. The plaintiff's insistence that defense counsel were not always punctual may have some validity. But that is not the matter that is before me and, in any event, it is not an excuse for behavior that is questionable. If plaintiff's counsel had issues with the defendant's discovery production, the remedy was a Local Rule 37.2 conference, followed by, if necessary, a motion to compel. The appropriate course of action most assuredly was not to ignore the matter. \"Litigants...cannot ignore legitimate discovery requests....\n   <em>\n    McDonald v.

As Judge Easterbrook tells us: \" 'The great operative principle of Rule 37[ ] is that the loser pays.' ...

I certainly never held, nor did I contemplate that any evidence would be excluded at trial. That was not what the motion requested; nor was it the relief granted. In any event, exclusion of evidence is rarely a concomitant of a successful Motion to Compel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The answer to the difficulties which led to the Motion to Compel is for lawyers to as promptly as possible communicate with opposing counsel and at least explain why an inquiry cannot be answered immediately and to explain the difficulties in fully responding.
