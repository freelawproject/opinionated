She also claims Dealogic terminated her because she became pregnant and discriminated against her on the basis of gender by requiring her to sign a noncompetition agreement as a condition of her severance package. Finally, she alleges that she endured a hostile work environment due to her gender.

She has worked in sales and marketing since graduating from college. In 2015, two business contacts asked her to work as a sales executive at their new company, A2 Access. They had developed a platform for private equity firms and wanted Dexter to help build relationships with firms around Boston. She accepted the offer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Before Dexter began the job, A2 Access was acquired by Dealogic, a London-based company offering a financial markets platform to financial firms. On September 28, 2015, Dexter agreed to become a sales executive in Dealogic's Boston office. Her employment with Dealogic was at will. She began the position in January 2016. Around this time, certain unspecified senior executives at Dealogic questioned her hiring, as well as that of another Boston-based female sales executive, saying that they were likely to \"get married, have kids and leave the Company.\" Dkt. No. 22 \u00b6\u00b6 18-19 (\"FAC\"). The complaint does not explain how or when Dexter learned of this comment but notes that the other female sales executive informed human resources about it when she left the company.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During her orientation, Dexter realized the product she would be promoting was not as complete as Dealogic had told her when they were discussing her potential employment. Nevertheless, she pitched the product to investment institutions in Boston throughout 2016. She made some sales, but Dealogic was unable to deliver a product that performed as promised. Customers therefore began to cancel their orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 17, 2016, Dexter met with Teri Hawksworth, Dealogic's global head of sales and coverage. Hawksworth asked Dexter why she was unable to \"land big investors\" in the Boston area. FAC \u00b6 30. Dexter explained that the ongoing problems with the product were hurting its marketability and sales. Hawksworth had not previously been aware of these problems. Two days later, John Dunchick, Dealogic's chief business development officer, learned of Dexter's meeting with Hawksworth and admonished Dexter that \"it was bad for [her] career to highlight product concerns to senior executives.\" FAC \u00b6\u00b6 31-32 (alteration in original). Still, Dexter earned an overall score of 3.2 out of 5.0 in her January 2017 annual performance review, which was considered \"Solid Performance: good work, meeting expectations.\" FAC \u00b6 33. She received a number of positive comments, including that her \"work this year [was] going to pay off.\" FAC \u00b6 34.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Throughout 2017, while Dexter refused to misrepresent the capabilities of the company's product to prospective clients, she frequently observed other Dealogic\n   personnel making false statements about the product's functionality. For example, Dunchick and Michael Muniz, the global head of sales and account management, provided false information about nonexisting product capabilities during a sales pitch to one of Dexter's business contacts in April 2017. Dexter threatened to report them to senior executives but did not do so. Shortly thereafter, Hawksworth and Muniz told Dexter she was being reassigned from her sales executive position to an account management role. The new position involved lower pay and a different bonus structure based strictly on her ability to retain clients. Hawksworth explained that the company thought her strong business relationships would allow her to better retain clients in this new role. Dexter continued to feel uncomfortable with Dealogic's misleading statements about its product and made repeated attempts to raise the issue with management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In August 2017, Dealogic held a number of meetings to address its product issues. Afterwards, two sales executives who had spoken up about their concerns with the product were placed on performance improvement plans. Senior executives prohibited account managers from interacting with high risk clients to avoid communications that might trigger those clients to terminate their contracts with Dealogic. Despite her concerns about this new policy, Dexter received a 3.1 out of 5.0 in her January 2018 annual performance review, again showing \"Solid Performance: good work, meeting expectations.\" FAC \u00b6 45. Because of her strong client retention rate, she earned a $12,500 bonus for fiscal year 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dexter learned in November 2017 that she was pregnant with her first child. In February 2018, she told Greg Young, the head of onboarding and her former manager, about her pregnancy. He reassured her she had continued job security with Dealogic. She told her other colleagues about her pregnancy the next month. Shortly thereafter, on March 21, 2018, Dunchick and Brianna Markey, the head of human resources, informed her she was being terminated as part of a reduction in force and there were no other positions available for her. Dexter alleges that Dealogic planned to rebrand the account management position with a new title and hire younger men who did not know about the product problems and would not leave to have children. Dealogic offered Dexter a severance package conditioned on her execution of a one-year noncompetition agreement. She rejected the severance package because of this condition. Two of Dexter's male colleagues who were let go around the same time, including Young, were not required to sign noncompetition agreements in exchange for severance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   After receiving authorization from the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, Dexter filed suit against Dealogic in state court on February 11, 2019. Dealogic removed the suit to federal court on the basis of diversity jurisdiction. On May 15, 2019, Dexter filed an amended complaint narrowing her causes of action to six: retaliation (Count I), gender and pregnancy discrimination and hostile work environment in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B, \u00a7 4 (Count II), wrongful termination (Count III), breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing (Count IV), breach of oral contract/promissory estoppel (Count V), and civil conspiracy (Count VI). Dealogic has moved to dismiss the amended complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   When faced with a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), a court must\n   set aside any statements that are merely conclusory and examine only the pleader's factual allegations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

In support of the first theory, Dexter alleges she received positive performance reviews for two years and then was terminated shortly after informing her colleagues she was pregnant. She also claims Dealogic management questioned the employment of young women who might become pregnant and planned to hire men to fill the rebranded sales roles. These factual allegations raise a plausible inference that Dealogic terminated her because of her gender and pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dealogic points out that Dexter does not specifically plead that any decisionmaker involved in her termination knew she was pregnant. A plaintiff need not, however, \"allege every fact necessary to win at trial,\" as long as \"the allegations of the complaint make the claim as a whole at least plausible.\"\n   <em>\n    Garayalde-Rijos v. Municipality of Carolina\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4180220\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/747/15/#p24\">\n    747 F.3d 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24 (1st Cir. 2014) (quotations omitted). Dexter's allegation that she told her colleagues about her pregnancy shortly before her termination supports a plausible inference that the decisionmakers knew of her pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dealogic also argues that Dexter alleges elsewhere in her complaint that she was terminated for raising her product and marketing concerns, not because of gender or pregnancy discrimination. This discrepancy does not justify dismissal of her adequately pleaded discrimination claim because a \"plaintiff may present as many claims ... as [she] has, even if they are inconsistent with each other.\"\n   <em>\n    McGrath v. Town of Sandwich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4342207\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/169/251/#p256\">\n    169 F. Supp. 3d 251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 256 (D. Mass. 2015) (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(d)(3) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In support of her second theory, Dexter alleges that, while she was required to sign a noncompetition agreement as a condition of her severance package, two male colleagues who were let go around the same time were not. A requirement to sign a noncompetition agreement affects the terms of employment between an employer and employee and would be material to a reasonable employee. This theory therefore adequately alleges an adverse employment action to support a claim of gender and pregnancy discrimination. And the fact that two male colleagues did not have to sign a noncompetition agreement renders plausible the inference that Dealogic imposed this requirement on Dexter due to her gender and pregnancy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dealogic asks the Court to ignore the allegations about the noncompetition agreement because the draft severance agreement Dexter attached to her complaint appears to waive Dealogic's right to enforce her \"non-competition obligations as set forth in Dealogic Standard Non-Competition Agreement.\" Dkt. No. 22-6 \u00b6 10. Dealogic points out that this term contradicts Dexter's allegation that the noncompetition agreement was a requirement of her acceptance of the severance package.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clorox Co. P.R. v. Proctor &amp; Gamble Commercial Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11226645\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/228/24/#p32\">\n    228 F.3d 24\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"It is a well-settled rule that when a written instrument contradicts\n   allegations in the complaint to which it is attached, the exhibit trumps the allegations.\" (quotation omitted)). While the exhibit does appear to contradict her allegations, Dexter claims someone in human resources told her she had to sign a noncompetition agreement as a condition of her severance. The record is unclear on this point, and the Court cannot resolve this factual dispute on a motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

This claim fails for two reasons. First, while she alleges a number of independent incidents throughout her employment (including the comment that the company should not hire young women, Dunchick telling her she should not highlight product concerns to senior executives, her demotion to the account management role, and her termination), she does not plead any facts that suggest that the various executives responsible for these incidents acted pursuant to any agreement Parallel unlawful activity does not constitute a conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Grant v. John Hancock Mut. Life Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9396084\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/183/344/#p363\">\n    183 F. Supp. 2d 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363 (D. Mass. 2002).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Second, Dexter fails to allege that the unified actions of the Dealogic executives allowed them to exert a coercive power over her that they would not have had as individuals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carroll v.

Dexter's complaint suggests that all of the executives whose behavior she complains about were her superiors. They therefore all had coercive power over her already, and any agreement to act in unison would not have increased this power. For both reasons, Count VI is dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ORDER\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Dealogic's motion to dismiss (Docket No. 23) is\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     ALLOWED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DENIED IN PART\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .
