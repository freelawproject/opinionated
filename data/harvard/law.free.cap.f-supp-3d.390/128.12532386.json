After the Commission was disbanded, the Court denied Defendants' request for reconsideration of the preliminary injunction. The Court also found that Defendants were not entitled to a stay of the Court's preliminary injunction pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendants then complied in part with the Court's preliminary injunction compelling production of certain documents. A number of sticking points remained. Defendants raised certain categories of documents to which they did not consider that Plaintiff was entitled under the Court's orders. Disputes about most of those categories have since been resolved. One of the lingering issues is whether Defendants must produce certain emails about potential Commission members.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   When that issue ripened, the Court determined on January 28, 2019, that Plaintiff was entitled to these emails to vindicate rights that flowed from the Court's earlier decisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, ECF No. 64, at 3. The Court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    \"Emails discussing potential Commission members (e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Vaughn\n    </em>\n    Index entry Nos. 361, 167)\"\n   </em>\n   : As Plaintiff observes, discussions concerning additional Commission members took place while he was a commissioner, involved one or more other commissioners, and did not solicit his input. [Pl.'s Resp. to Defs.' Notice of Categories of Withheld Docs., ECF No. 59,] at 4.

That harm would also, arguably, be significant. These emails contain frank comments-not all of which are positive-about the qualifications and viewpoints of potential Democratic appointees to the Commission. The individuals involved are conveying sensitive advice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Court finds sufficient evidence of irreparable harm that this factor weighs modestly in Defendants' favor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Harm to Plaintiff of a Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Plaintiff has already received reams of documents and responded publicly to them. Discussions about potential Commission members are not as central to Plaintiff's rights under\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   as other documents that he already has received. As the Court previously noted, \"[p]roduction of this quasi-procedural category of documents\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   illuminate ways in which Plaintiff's substantive contributions were inhibited at the time, and he could respond accordingly after the fact.\" Order, ECF No. 64, at 3 (emphasis added). In other words, the production of these documents\n   <em>\n    might not\n   </em>\n   have that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Moreover, Plaintiff's efforts to participate in a national debate were furthered by his dissemination, already, of his \"preliminary findings\" upon review of the Commission documents.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Letter from Secretary Dunlap to Vice President Pence &amp; Secretary Kobach (Aug. 3, 2018), http://paceidocs.sosonline.org/PDF/Dunlap% 20PACEI% 20Docs% 20Findings% 20letter% 20-% 20FINAL.080318.pdf, cited in Defs.' Mot. at 4. These communications about potential Commission members would appear to facilitate only a modest post-script to that assessment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The harm to Plaintiff of awaiting the Court of Appeals' decision is accordingly rather limited. Defendants have the better argument as to this factor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Public Interest in Granting a Stay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Previously the Court recognized the public interest in \"efficient resolution of litigation concerning the now-defunct Commission.\"\n   <em>\n    Dunlap II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526124\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/70/\">\n    319 F. Supp. 3d at 109\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That public interest has been furthered by the Court's document disclosure orders thus far. Defendants have, to their credit, now complied with most of the disclosure obligations reflected in these orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The public also has an interest in ensuring that government materials are kept confidential when necessary. The parties are litigating an aspect of that issue at present before this Court, and that motion practice will be unaffected by the stay. The Court of Appeals will weigh in further on the issue of this confidentiality through the presently pending appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, privacy issues are at stake. A minor premise of the Court's prior denial of a stay was that this case appeared to lack privacy equities analogous to certain Supreme Court precedent.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12526124\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/319/70/\">\n    319 F.

Now, however, the Court observes that there are certain people named in these emails who are not themselves communicating. The Court has mentioned that comments about these individuals are frank. Only one of those people, Judge Alan King, was ultimately appointed to the Commission. Judge King and the other individuals may have a privacy interest that would be affected by disclosure of these communications. That is true even if material were redacted. To borrow terminology from the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\") context, much of the releasable material is not \"reasonably segregable\" from the material that would give away their identities.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n    5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mead Data Cent., Inc. v.

Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of withholding the emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Plaintiff counters with a recent FOIA case in this jurisdiction. Judge Amy Berman Jackson ordered the government to release the names of individuals in an email chain concerning potential appointees to the Commission. Notice of Suppl. Auth., ECF No. 72 (discussing\n   <em>\n    Campaign Legal Ctr. v. U.S. Dep't of Justice\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n    373 F. Supp. 3d 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.D.C. 2019) ). The government had previously released several of the names on the grounds that those individuals' \"heightened degree of 'engagement' with the government\"-by authoring or forwarding the email-\"reduced their privacy interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Campaign Legal Ctr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n    373 F.

The remaining names consisted of a recipient of an email in the thread; someone else who was copied on that email and characterized as sharing the author's concerns about pending appointments; and a third person identified as an expert on voter fraud matters.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n    at 166-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Applying the balancing test under FOIA Exemption 6, and recognizing the \"strong presumption in favor of disclosure,\" Judge Jackson found that the public interest in identifying each individual who was connected to the appointment process outweighed these three individuals' respective privacy interests.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12530822\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/373/160/\">\n    at 171-73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Ass'n of Home Builders v.

Cir. 2002) ) (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the remaining names needed to be released. As in this case, the government appealed Judge Jackson's order too, although the docket shows that the government most recently moved to dismiss that appeal. The expected appellate decision in this case will presumably address this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   On balance, the public interest considerations tilt in favor of a stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Court finds that each factor weighs at least modestly in favor of a stay.

Those exceptional circumstances are present here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Whereas before, Defendants had not produced any documents in this litigation, they have since produced many. Of the documents that remain withheld, the emails about potential Commission members raise putative separation of powers issues. The Court of Appeals will presumably address those issues in the pending appeal, and this Court too will address them, in part, during other proceedings in this case that will continue in parallel. Once these emails are produced to Plaintiff-and almost inevitably disseminated more broadly-there is no going back. And these emails would contribute only marginally to Plaintiff's inability to vindicate his\n   <em>\n    Cummock\n   </em>\n   rights; he would not suffer much prejudice from his inability to obtain access to these emails sooner. This is a close call, but Defendants have persuaded the Court to stay their obligation to produce the emails at issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   One recent development warrants brief closing remarks. The Court's review of the emails submitted\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   and the appointments timeline shows that J. Christian Adams and Hans A. von Spakovsky were in communication with OVP personnel before they were publicly named and later formally appointed to the Commission.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , 2d Decl. of Philip C. Droege, ECF No. 79-1, at 2-3. Kris Kobach too was in communication before he was formally appointed to the Commission, although he had previously been publicly named its Vice-Chair.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722825\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/248/#p254\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Only Judge King was appointed out of the batch of Democratic candidates that these individuals were discussing. But because the Court of Appeals is presently considering the Court's Order to produce these emails, the Court shall not address any further the implications of this new information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
