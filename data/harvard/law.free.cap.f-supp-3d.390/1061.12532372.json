GILLIAM, JR., United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In this case, a coalition of thirteen states and the District of Columbia (collectively, \"States\" or \"Plaintiff States\") brought challenges to interim final rules and final rules (collectively, the \"Rules\") promulgated by federal agencies that create religious and moral exemptions to the contraceptive mandate contained within the Affordable Care Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Second Amended Complaint, Dkt.

No. 234. A few weeks later, the Court allowed Oregon to join the multi-state coalition, Dkt. No. 274, and now Oregon seeks to expand the geographic scope of the preliminary injunction to prevent the Rules from being implemented in Oregon pending a resolution on the merits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Motion for Preliminary Injunction (\"Mot.\"), Dkt. No. 312. The Court finds that the requested extension is warranted and therefore\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Oregon's motion for a preliminary injunction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court recounted the extensive statutory, regulatory, and judicial background to this case in its January 13, 2019 order granting Plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and incorporates that summary by reference here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234 at 2-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Since the Court granted preliminary relief in the Plaintiff States, Oregon filed its complaint-in-intervention, alleging the injuries that it predicts the state (and its citizens) will sustain if the Rules were to be implemented in Oregon.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 287 (\"Compl.\"). Oregon alleges that if the Rules go into effect, women who lose their entitlement to free contraceptives will turn to Oregon's ContraceptiveCare and Reproductive Health Equity Act programs, thereby increasing costs to the state.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Declaration of Helene Rimberg (\"Rimberg Decl.\"), Dkt. No. 211 \u00b6 7. And Oregon predicts that some women who lose contraceptive coverage because of the Rules may forgo contraceptive use entirely and unintentionally become pregnant, which could impose costs on the state's Medicaid program. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 22-23;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rimberg Decl. \u00b6 7-9. Oregon alleges that it expects at least one in-state employer-Hobby Lobby, which has five stores in Oregon-to invoke the exemption if it goes into effect. Compl. \u00b6 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In its motion, Oregon concedes that granting an injunction would not have any immediate effect because Federal Defendants are currently enjoined from implementing the Rules nationwide based on the district court's order in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528861\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/791/#p835\">\n    351 F. Supp. 3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 835 (E.D. Pa. 2019). However, Oregon contends that because the\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   injunction is \"subject to appellate review and attack for its scope,\" there is an \"imminent risk that the nationwide injunction could be lifted and thousands of Oregonian women left without contraceptive coverage.\" Mot. at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Federal Defendants and Defendant-Intervenors March for Life opposed the extension of the preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. Nos. 361 (\"Fed. Opp.\"), 359 (\"March Opp.\"). Oregon replied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 365 (\"Reply\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Alternatively, an injunction may issue where \"the likelihood of success is\n   such that serious questions going to the merits were raised and the balance of hardships tips sharply in [the plaintiff's] favor,\" provided that the plaintiff can also demonstrate the other two Winter factors.\n   <em>\n    All. for the Wild Rockies v.

Under either standard, the plaintiff bears the burden of making a clear showing that it is entitled to this extraordinary remedy.\n   <em>\n    Earth Island Inst. v. Carlton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052382\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/626/462/#p469\">\n    626 F.3d 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 469 (9th Cir. 2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    III. DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The Court previously concluded that the Plaintiff States were entitled to a preliminary injunction because they had shown that: they were likely to succeed (or had at least raised serious questions going to the merits) on their claim that the Rules violated the Affordable Care Act, they would suffer irreparable harm absent preliminary relief, the balance of hardships tipped sharply in their favor, and the public interest favored injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234 at 21. Because the Court finds that there have not been any subsequent developments that would alter its analysis as to the likelihood of success, balance of the hardships, and public interest factors, the Court incorporates by reference its prior discussion of these factors.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-39, 40-42.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   That leaves irreparable harm. Oregon contends that \"[i]f the nationwide injunction is lifted, the Rules will inflict irreparable harm.\" Mot. at 28. According to Oregon, the Rules will likely cause unintended pregnancies to rise and women to turn to state family planning programs, imposing unrecoverable costs on the state.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 28-30. Federal Defendants respond that Oregon has not established irreparable injury because of the pre-existing nationwide injunction and its delay in moving for a preliminary injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. Opp. at 11-13. The Court considers each of Federal Defendants' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Nationwide Injunction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Federal Defendants contend that this Court should not \"enter a duplicative injunction\" with the one issued by the district court in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   . Fed. Opp. at 11. Federal Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    Hawai'i v. Trump\n   </em>\n   , in which a district court granted the government's motion for an emergency stay pending an appeal in a similar case in the same circuit and noted that a parallel \"nationwide injunction already provides [Hawai'i] with the comprehensive relief it seeks in this lawsuit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268497\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/233/850/#p853\">\n    233 F. Supp. 3d 850\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 853 (D. Haw. 2017). However, this example is belied by the fact that the district court later issued a preliminary injunction that overlapped with one issued by a Maryland district court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Trump\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12266996\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/265/1140/#p1146\">\n    265 F. Supp. 3d 1140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1146 (D. Haw. 2017).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, overlapping injunctions appear to be a common outcome of parallel litigation, rather than a reason for the Court to pass on exercising its duty to determine whether litigants are entitled to relief. For example, in recent litigation challenging the Secretary of Commerce's decision to add a citizenship question to the census, three district courts issued parallel injunctions against the policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    New York v. United States Dep't of Commerce\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528852\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/351/502/#p677\">\n    351 F.

Supp. 3d 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 755 (D. Md. 2019). The Court concludes that the existence of another injunction-particularly one in a different circuit that could be overturned or limited at any time-does not negate Oregon's claimed irreparable harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Federal Defendants also assert that because Oregon's asserted injury \"is expressly contingent on a future event,\" it is \"not an imminent, irreparable injury.\" Fed. Opp. at 11. Federal Defendants cite to\n   <em>\n    In re Excel Innovations, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , in which the Ninth Circuit noted that \"[s]peculative injury cannot be the basis for a finding of irreparable harm.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5452145,5526775\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/1086/\">\n    502 F.3d 1086\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1098 (9th Cir. 2007). There, the Ninth Circuit overturned the bankruptcy court's preliminary injunction staying arbitration proceedings between two non-bankrupt parties, partly because the lower court had speculated when it cited the potential for inconsistent judgments as a basis for the injunction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5452145,5526775\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/1086/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5452145,5526775\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/502/1086/\">\n    at 1089, 1098\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But Oregon's asserted injury, although contingent on the nationwide injunction in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   being dissolved, is not speculative. For the same reasons as the Court found in its order granting preliminary relief to the Plaintiff States, Oregon is likely to suffer irreparable harm if the Rules go into effect.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234 at 39;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    California v. Azar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12519575\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/911/558/#p571\">\n    911 F.3d 558\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 571 (9th Cir. 2018) (holding for standing purposes that the States \"show, with reasonable probability, that the [interim final rules] will first lead to women losing employer-sponsored contraceptive coverage, which will then result in economic harm to the states\"). And Oregon's injury is sufficiently imminent because though the Rules are currently enjoined, the Third Circuit could alter the injunction at any moment. By way of example, the Ninth Circuit has upheld preliminary relief to preserve the status quo where defendants could terminate an agreement with 60-days' notice, which would result in the plaintiffs suffering \"irreparable harm before a trial on the merits could be held.\"\n   <em>\n    Boardman v. Pac. Seafood Grp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054859\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/822/1011/#p1023\">\n    822 F.3d 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1023 (9th Cir. 2016) (citing\n   <em>\n    Winter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    555 U.S. at 22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3679402\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/555/7/#p22\">\n    129 S.Ct. 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). Were Oregon to no longer be covered by the\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   injunction, it could sustain irreparable harm immediately, before the Court could decide the merits of its claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Accordingly, because of the routine basis upon which federal courts grant parallel injunctions and the immediacy of the harm were the nationwide injunction to be lifted, the Court finds that these arguments do not preclude granting a preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

The Final Rules were promulgated on November 15, 2018, and were slated to take effect on January 14, 2019.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 234 at 13. Oregon moved to intervene on January 7, Dkt. No. 210, requested joinder in the motion for preliminary injunction on February 21 (which the Court denied as procedurally improper), Dkt. No. 288, and moved for a preliminary injunction on April 30, Dkt. No. 312. To be sure, Oregon's challenge to the Rules has not been as swift as those of the Plaintiff States. But this slower pace is at least somewhat explained by the\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   injunction, which has prevented Oregon from suffering any harm from the Rules. Oregon partially explains the timing of its motion by noting that the Third Circuit recently heard oral arguments in\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania\n   </em>\n   , which creates a \"renewed risk of irreparable harm.\" Reply at 8. And Oregon has requested expedited consideration of its motion, which supports its argument that preliminary relief is needed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. No. 353. In sum, although Oregon has not prosecuted this case as quickly as the Plaintiff States, it also has not slept on its rights, and the Court would be loath to deny relief solely on the basis of a few months' delay, particularly given the overlapping injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.
