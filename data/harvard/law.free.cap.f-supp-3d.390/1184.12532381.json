[Doc. # 129.] On October 12, 2018, Forouzan filed an application to the Clerk to tax costs against Defendant BMW of North America, LLC (\"BMW\") in the amount of $41,089.23. [Doc. # 133.] On January 28, 2019, the Clerk issued a Bill of Costs in the amount of $19,953.99. [Doc. # 159.] The Clerk subtracted $3,942.80 for court reporter's transcripts because they are \"not taxable pursuant to L.R. 53-3.4 unless approved by the court or stipulated by counsel in writing before the cost is incurred.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Clerk also subtracted $4,766.94 because \"expediting fees and expert fees are not taxable pursuant to L.R. 54-3.5.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Lastly, the Clerk subtracted $12,410.50 because \"expert fees, mediation fees, and fees for filing and serving pleadings [are] not within the scope of taxable other costs pursuant to L.R. 54-3.212.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On February 4, 2019, Plaintiff filed a Motion to Retax Costs pursuant to Local Rule 54-8.

What Costs and Expenses are Recoverable Under Section 1794(d)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiff argues that, under section 1794(d), he should recover expenses related to the following items, which the Clerk subtracted from the Bill of Costs: (1) court reporter's transcripts, (2) \"expert and expedited transcripts,\" and (3) \"other expenses,\" including expert fees, mediation fees, and fees for \"filing and serving pleadings.\" Mot. at 8-9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   While the Clerk correctly concluded that Local Rule 54-3.4 prohibits recovery for court reporter's transcripts without a court order to that effect, California law provides that prevailing plaintiffs can recover those expenses under section 1794(d).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Warren v.

Fees relating to filing court documents and developing and presenting expert opinions at trial are also\n   reasonably incurred. Given that the Legislature's intent in including the costs and expenses provision was to \"open the litigation process to everyone\" by allowing prevailing plaintiffs to litigate without bearing their own costs, section 1794 also likely anticipated allowing plaintiffs to recover for mediation fees and expert fees.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20295\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Moreover, Defendant makes no argument as to why Plaintiff may not recover those expenses under California law-it argues only that the Court should disregard California law entirely because federal law controls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   While the reasonableness of incurring mediation and expert fees during this litigation is self-evident, the same cannot be said for incurring fees for expedited transcripts. Since Plaintiff has not justified the reasonableness of those fees, the Court shall not disturb the Clerk's decision not to award expenses for expedited transcripts. Based on a review of Plaintiff's submissions, however, it is not entirely clear to the Court what percentage of the $4,766.94 that the Clerk \"disallowed\" for \"expert and expedited transcripts\" pertains to which category of expense. The Court shall therefore permit Plaintiff to recover half of that amount, or $2,383.47. Plaintiff shall also recover the $12,410.50 that the Clerk subtracted for expert fees, mediation fees, and fees for filing and serving pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In light of the foregoing, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion to Retax Costs. Plaintiff shall recover from Defendant $18,751.77-the full amount that the Clerk disallowed minus $2,383.47 associated with expedited transcripts. Plaintiff shall also recover the $19,953.99 that the Clerk initially taxed, for total costs and expenses in the amount of $38,705.76.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    IT IS SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    The\n    <em>\n     Clausen\n    </em>\n    court also reasoned that the costs recovery analysis under the Oil Spill Act was a question of substantive law because the statute defined damages to include \"costs of any kind,\" and because measuring damages is traditionally a question of state substantive law.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20295\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    at 1065-66 (citing\n    <em>\n     Barbier v.

That rationale does not apply here, however, because the Song-Beverly Act does not require courts to award costs as a subset of damages. Rather, it permits prevailing buyers to recover costs and expenses as a part of their overall \"judgment,\" a term that section 1794 uses separately from \"damages.\"\n    <em>\n     Compare\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201794\">\n     Cal.
