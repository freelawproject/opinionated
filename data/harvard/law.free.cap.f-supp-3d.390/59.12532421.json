The complaint alleges that \"the [DOC was] well aware of its obligations under the [FMLA] and willfully and intentionally refused said obligations.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 13. It further alleges that, after Murphy and his doctor filed his April 2 leave request, he and his wife inquired as to the status of the request \"on several occasions,\" but the DOC never responded to these inquires.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 12-13.

The allegations that the DOC ignored multiple inquiries about Murphy's April request from multiple persons over the course of several months, and that the DOC then decided intentionally to terminate Murphy in retaliation, suffice to allege willful disregard of the FMLA. Hence, Murphy is entitled to a three-year limitations period as to the April interference and retaliation claims, and they are timely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   However, Murphy has not adequately pled that the DOC willfully denied his June 22 FMLA request.

Unlike with the April request, then, there is no allegation that the DOC ignored inquiries about the request for months. The facts as alleged therefore do not support a claim that the DOC's failure to respond to the June 22 request constituted willful interference. Murphy is therefore entitled only to a two-year limitations period on his June 22 interference claim.

And Murphy alleged no additional facts to establish that the DOC interfered with his rights as to that request. While it is possible that an unreasonable delay in responding to a leave request violates the DCFMLA, that theory fails as to the June claim for the same reason it failed in the ADA discussion above: as a matter of law, a two-day delay cannot constitute an unreasonable delay or constructive interference. Hence, the Court will dismiss the June DCFMLA claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Unlike the timely interference claims, the limitations period is not tolled as to the retaliation claim because, for the reasons already discussed in the ADA retaliation section, Murphy failed adequately to raise this claim in his EEOC/OHR charge.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   EEOC Charge at 1 (alleging \"retaliation\" only with respect to Murphy's wife's involvement in the sexual harassment lawsuit).

The Court finds that he has. Participating in or assisting with a Title VII proceeding \"in any manner\" is a protected activity. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). Here, Murphy has alleged that his wife \"testified in a deposition as a key witness against the [DOC] in a well-known [Title VII] lawsuit ... focused on the improper conduct of [his] immediate supervisor,\" Major Pettiford. Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 17-18. He has further alleged that he \"clear[ly] support[ed] ... his wife's participation\" in that suit, that Pettiford \"knew that [he] supported\" his wife's participation, and that \"Major Pettiford [therefore] perceived [him] as a participant in the [proceeding].\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 18-19.

Moreover, the District has offered no persuasive reason to doubt Murphy's allegation that Pettiford perceived him as a participant in the proceeding against him.

Supp. 3d 573\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 579 (D. Md. 2016) (\"Although a retaliation claim may lie in the case of 'third-party retaliation,' the cases that have allowed such claims involved [circumstances] where both the person filing the discrimination complaint and the person adversely affected were employees or former employees of the same company.\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    In\n    <em>\n     Fogleman v. Mercy Hospital\n    </em>\n    , the Third Circuit was construing the ADA's requirement that employers not \"\n    <em>\n     discriminate\n    </em>\n    against any\n    <em>\n     individual\n    </em>\n    because such individual has [engaged in protected activity].\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9510452\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/283/561/#p571\">\n     283 F.3d 561\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 571 (3d Cir. 2002) (quoting\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2012203\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a) ).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"10\">\n   <p id=\"p-77\">\n    The District does not dispute that Murphy has adequately alleged the other elements of a\n    <em>\n     prima facie\n    </em>\n    retaliation claim-namely, that Murphy suffered a materially adverse action by his employer, and that a causal link connects that adverse action to the statutorily protected activity.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    The Court does not accept, however, the District's argument for why this theory is inapplicable. The District contends that, under\n    <em>\n     Millstein v. Henske\n    </em>\n    , courts do not recognize a third-party reprisal theory for DCHRA retaliation claims.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11778798\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/722/850/\">\n     722 A.2d 850\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.C. 1999). This contention is inaccurate. The\n    <em>\n     Millstein\n    </em>\n    court rejected a third-party reprisal theory because the relationship between the plaintiff and the employee who had performed protected activity was a \"bare relationship of co-employees\": there was no reason to think that adverse action against the plaintiff could constitute retaliation against someone to whom she bore a purely professional relationship.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11778798\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/722/850/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11778798\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/722/850/\">\n     at 854-55\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . That case is inapposite here, wherein the relevant relationship is between a husband and wife.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
