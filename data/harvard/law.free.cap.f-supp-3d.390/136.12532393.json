Sullivan, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Plaintiff Sebastian Phillips (\"Mr. Phillips\"), a Naval Architect, and his architecture and engineering firm, Plaintiff Marine Design Dynamics, Inc. (\"MDD\"), allege that they have been effectively debarred from future government contracts with the United States Department of the Navy since 2011. Plaintiffs sued the Secretary of the Navy, the Chief and Deputy Chief of Naval Operations, and four officials of the Naval Sea Systems Command (\"NAVSEA\") and Operational Logistics Integration Program (\"OPLOG\") (collectively, the \"Federal Defendants\"). Plaintiffs contend that the Federal Defendants violated the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution by blacklisting MDD from government contracting without due process. The Federal Defendants deny these allegations, listing several contracts and government work awarded by the Navy to MDD as proof against any alleged\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   debarment. Plaintiffs do not dispute that MDD received more than $14 million in contracts, purchase orders, delivery orders, and funding modifications between 2011 and 2016. Rather, Plaintiffs argue that they were\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   debarred from competing for OPLOG work and Military Sealift Command (\"MSC\") work. Plaintiffs also assert common-law tort claims against four former MDD employees and two Navy officials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pending before the Court are the parties' motions: (1) the Federal Defendants' Renewed Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, for Summary Judgment as to Counts I, II, and IX; (2) Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count I; (3) the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment as to Counts VI and VIII against Defendant Matthew Miller (\"Mr. Miller\"); and (4) Plaintiffs' Motion for Entry of Order for Summary Judgment. Upon careful consideration of the parties' submissions, the applicable law, and the entire record, the Court concludes that: (1) Plaintiffs have not met the high standard of proving\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   debarment, and Defendants Charles Traugh (\"Mr. Traugh\") and Michael Bosworth (\"Mr. Bosworth\") are entitled to qualified immunity; (2) Plaintiffs' tort claims against Defendant William Robinson (\"Mr. Robinson\") and Mr. Traugh fall under the Federal Tort Claims Act; (3) Plaintiffs have not met their burden of demonstrating that Mr. Robinson and Mr. Traugh were acting outside the scope of\n   their employment; thus, the United States will be substituted as the defendant as to the tort claims asserted against Mr. Traugh and Mr. Robinson pursuant to the Westfall Act; (4) the United States has not waived its sovereign immunity for the tort claims against Mr. Robinson and Mr. Traugh; (5) the undisputed facts demonstrate that Mr. Miller did not breach his fiduciary duty owed to MDD; and (6) Plaintiffs' civil conspiracy claim as to Defendant Miller fails as a matter of law. Accordingly, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   the Federal Defendants' Renewed Motion to Dismiss, or in the alternative, for Summary Judgment as to Counts I, II, and IX, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Partial Summary Judgment as to Count I. The Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES AS MOOT\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Entry of Order for Summary Judgment. Finally, the Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendant Miller's Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counts VI and VIII, and\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment as to Counts VI and VIII.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.
