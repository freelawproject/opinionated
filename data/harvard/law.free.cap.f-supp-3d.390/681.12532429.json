Ex.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A. As confirmed by the Government's witness, retired immigration official Michael Toms (\"Toms\"), the filing of an I-130 does not itself grant an alien any legal status. Further proceedings are required before that can happen. A stamp on the I-130 indicates that it was \"approved\" by immigration officials on August 6, 1998. ECF No. 11-2; Def. Ex. A. Toms testified that the notation \"approved\" means only that immigration officials confirmed the existence of a relationship between Segura and the individual who filed the I-130 (his mother). Toms testified that, following such an approval, the alien would then be interviewed by immigration officials and would have to apply for an adjustment of his immigration status. The record shows that those steps did not happen in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On January 6, 2001, Segura, then 19, was arrested in California and charged by information with four separate counts of engaging in \"unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor...15 years old, [ ] who was more than three years younger than said person, in violation of [California] Penal Code Section 261.5(c), a felony.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gov't Ex. 1.

Second, Toms testified that he served the 2001 Final Order on Segura in person, which is reflected on the Certificate of Service, and gave a copy of this document to Segura. Gov't Ex. 3(a). That copy, however, had not yet been signed by the authorized INS signatory in Fresno. Third, Toms faxed the 2001 Final Order (with the completed Certificate of Service) to the authorized INS official in Fresno. Gov't Ex. 3(b).

Thus, the argument goes, because the underlying deportation is void, there is no need for Segura to satisfy the Section 1326(d) requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Recently, a nearly-identical argument was rejected in\n   <em>\n    Gonzalez-Ferretiz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%20943388\">\n    2019 WL 943388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , *5-6. Segura cites the same cases cited by Gonzalez-Ferretiz in support of his argument. Like Gonzalez-Ferretiz, Segura has not cited a single case that supports his argument in a Section 1326 prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 11 at 6-9. That is, he has not cited any authority involving a prosecution under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201326\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   whereby a defendant was permitted to challenge the classification of the predicate offense underlying his removal other than pursuant to the requirements of Section 1326(d). Instead, like Gonzalez-Ferretiz, Segura cites several appellate decisions wherein courts have found that the Board of Immigration Appeals lacked jurisdiction to order an alien's removal where an immigration judge had not ordered removal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rhodes-Bradford v.

Those decisions did not arise in the context of a Section 1326 prosecution. Moreover, in the Section 1326 context, it appears that courts address arguments about whether a predicate offense was an \"aggravated felony\" under the Section 1326(d) requirements.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    United States v.

However, counsel later took the view that there was no administrative remedy for which Segura qualified. Thus, the argument goes, Section 1326(d)(1) is inapplicable because there was nothing that Segura could have exhausted. The Government does not specify which administrative remedies were available to Segura, but does not concede that there were no administrative remedies for him to pursue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Etienne v.

And, notably, the alien in\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   had indicated on his I-851 form that he wished to challenge his deportation (although he did not specifically state that he believed that his conviction was not an \"aggravated felony\"),\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p90\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500482\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/81/#p90\">\n    at 137-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , while Segura clearly indicated that he did not wish to contest removal on any grounds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Ex. 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Notwithstanding these differences, the Court is constrained to apply the holding of\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   that, in expedited removal proceedings involving the I-851 form (as here), an alien need not have raised a legal challenge to the expedited removal in order to satisfy an administrative exhaustion requirement because there was no available administrative remedy. That holding applies equally to the administrative exhaustion requirement of Section 1326(d)(1).

Segura has identified no similar statutory right to relief that was available and about which he was not advised. And, indeed, he was advised of, and waived, the right of judicial review. Instead, his argument is that he was deprived of judicial review because he was not informed that, on judicial review, he could challenge whether his underlying conviction was for an \"aggravated felony.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   , Judge Brinkema rejected a similar argument based on\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   in the context of an alien who signed a \"Stipulated Request for Order and Waiver of Hearing\" and then argued in his later Section 1326 prosecution that his waiver was not knowing and voluntary. 355 F. Supp. 3d at 432-33, 440-41 &amp; n.18. As Judge Brinkema noted, \"whereas the noncitizens in\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   were deprived of critical information related to affirmative rights they held under the INA, defendant here had no affirmative right to a hearing to be held within a given time.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 440 n.18.

While the I-851 form does not state that the alien may challenge the \"aggravated felony\" determination, it does not tell the alien he may not challenge that determination either. Segura waived his statutory right to judicial review, and\n   <em>\n    Mendoza-Lopez\n   </em>\n   does not establish that such a waiver was not considered and intelligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Segura also relies on\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   to argue that, because the I-851 form did not inform him that he could challenge the legal basis of his deportation, \"[a]ny purported waiver of appeal, or failure to appeal or exhaust administrative remedies is therefore not knowing and intelligent.\" ECF No. 13 at 20.\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   does not control the analysis here. As discussed above,\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   arose in a different context and notably involved an alien who affirmatively chose to challenge his removal.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4089375\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/813/135/\">\n    813 F.3d at 137-38\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That is not the case here. And, as the Court reads\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   , its application in the Section 1326 context is limited to, at most, the exhaustion of administrative remedies prong of Section 1326(d)(1), not to the judicial review prong of Section 1326(d)(2).\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   dealt with the Court of Appeals' jurisdiction to hear an appeal of the alien's expedited deportation (including the \"aggravated felony\" determination)\n   <em>\n    at the time he was being deported\n   </em>\n   , and did not purport to establish the principle for\n   which Segura argues.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The foregoing authorities and the record in this case make clear that Segura made a considered and intelligent waiver of his right to judicial review. First, Segura acknowledges that, at the time in issue, he spoke and understood English, so there is no language issue in this case. Second, retired immigration officer Toms testified that his practice was to read and review the I-851 form with the alien before having him sign it. He testified that this practice included the waiver portion of the form; if the alien indicated that he did not wish to fight deportation after Toms read the form, Toms would mark the form accordingly. In other words, Toms' testimony establishes that Segura's waiver was made after an explanation by Toms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Third, Segura's argument that he was deprived of judicial review because he was not informed of a specific matter that he could appeal (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   that he could challenge the \"aggravated felony\" determination) does not comport with how courts typically advise defendants of appellate rights. Courts do not inform defendants of each aspect of their case that they may appeal. Even where a specific right of appeal is affirmatively defined (which the one Segura seeks is not), a court's failure to advise a defendant about that right is not necessarily fatal.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Peguero v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132788\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/23/#p24\">\n    526 U.S. 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 24-28,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132788\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/23/#p24\">\n    119 S.Ct. 961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11132788\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/526/23/#p24\">\n    143 L.Ed.2d 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (failure to advise defendant of right to appeal sentence as required by Fed. R. Crim. P. 32 did not permit collateral relief where defendant \"had full knowledge of his right to appeal\"). Absent authority to the contrary (which Segura has not provided), the Court will not adopt a rule that immigration officials must explain every theory that might be presented on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Lastly, Segura has presented no evidence that he would have sought judicial review in 2001 if he had been advised that he could challenge the \"aggravated felony\" determination. Unlike the alien in\n   <em>\n    Etienne\n   </em>\n   , Segura did not indicate in any way that he wanted to fight deportation. Only now, when he is called to account for his illegal re-entry, does Segura argue that he was deprived of judicial review. And, his position is based solely on an argument made by counsel. Argument of counsel is not evidence and there is no evidence that supports Segura's position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Segura has not established that his 2001 expedited removal proceeding improperly deprived him of judicial review. Thus, he fails Section 1326(d)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    (3) Fundamental Unfairness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Nor has Segura established that the 2001 removal order was fundamentally unfair. To satisfy Section 1326(d)(3), Segura \"must show that (1) his due process rights were violated by defects in his underlying deportation proceeding, and (2) he suffered prejudice as a result of the defects.\"\n   <em>\n    El Shami\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n    434 F.3d at 664\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Taking the second argument first (service of the 2001 Final Order), Toms testified in great detail about the steps that his office took in 2001 to serve Final Orders, like the one at issue in this case. Although he testified that he was not aware of whether there was a record of whether the 2001 Final Order (with the approving official's signature) was served on Segura, he did testify that a copy of the 2001 Final Order would have been given to Segura, based on his practice at the time. Based on Toms' testimony (and the complete lack of any contrary evidence from Segura), the Court finds that Segura received signed and unsigned copies of the 2001 Final Order. Segura does not argue that this alleged due process violation prejudiced him.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lopez-Collazo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4322479\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/824/453/#p459\">\n    824 F.3d at 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The defendant's burden is to show that actual prejudice\n   <em>\n    resulted from\n   </em>\n   the due process violation at issue.\") (emphasis in original).
