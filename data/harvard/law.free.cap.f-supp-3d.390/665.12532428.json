(ECF No. 12.)

On January 14, 2014, Symantec answered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (ECF No. 20.)

On March 5, 2014, the Court issued a scheduling and pretrial order, which scheduled the trial for January 5-16, 2015. (ECF No. 54.) On March 17, 2014, following a joint request from Columbia and Symantec, the Court entered an order setting the deadlines to file infringement and invalidity contentions. (ECF No. 56.) In that order, the Court ordered Symantec to provide Columbia \"a list of\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   prior art on which it relies and a complete and detailed explanation of what it alleges the prior art shows and how that prior art invalidates the claims asserted by plaintiff.\" (Mar. 17, 2014 Order \u00b6 5 (emphasis added), ECF No. 56.) On May 12, 2014, Symantec served this list-its invalidity contentions-on Columbia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its invalidity contentions, Symantec identified dozens of prior art that allegedly\n   rendered both the 115 and 322 patents invalid, including 10 patents, 43 printed publications, and the systems DIDUCE and ReVirt.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   7-8.) With regard to the DIDUCE and ReVirt systems, Symantec included two articles-a 2002 article by Sudheendra Hangal and a 2002 article by George Dunlap-and source code publicly available on the Internet.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On October 7, 2014, following briefing and a hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court issued a Claim Construction Order. (ECF No. 123.) Columbia then filed a Motion for Clarification of Claim Construction Order (the \"Motion for Clarification\"). (ECF No. 128.) Specifically, Columbia asked that the Court clarify the meanings of the phrase \"probabilistic model of normal computer system usage\" as used in the 084 Patent and the 306 Patent, and the word \"anomalous\" as used in the 115 Patent and the 322 Patent. (Mem. Supp. Mot. Clarification 2-3, ECF No. 129.) On October 23, 2014, the Court issued its Clarified Claim Construction Order. (ECF No. 146.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ten days later, based on the Court's 2014 Clarified Claim Construction Order, Columbia and Symantec jointly moved the Court to issue final judgment pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 54(b)\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   as to Columbia's first through sixth claims for relief and staying the case as to its seventh through eleventh claims. (Jt. Mot. Entry Final J. 1-2, ECF No. 148.) The parties specifically asked the Court to enter \"judgment of non-infringement on all asserted claims and [to] find[ ] ... invalidity for indefiniteness of claims 1 and 16 of the [ ]544 [P]atent.\"\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Columbia Univ.\n   </em>\n   , 811 F.3d at 1362. On November 4, 2014, the Court entered the partial final judgment requested by Columbia and Symantec. (ECF No. 150.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     First Appeal to the Federal Circuit: Claim Construction Orders\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Approximately one week later, having seemingly lost its case in this Court, Columbia filed its Notice of Appeal to the Federal Circuit and appealed the Court's November 4, 2014 Partial Final Judgment Order, (ECF Nos. 150, 151), the Court's original Claim Construction Order, (ECF No. 123), and the Court's Clarified Claim Construction Order, (ECF No. 146). (Notice Appeal 1, ECF No. 152.) In a 2016 opinion, the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed and remanded in part, the Court's claim construction orders.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Columbia Univ.\n   </em>\n   , 811 F.3d at 1371. Specifically, the Federal Circuit upheld the judgment of non-infringement as to the 544, 907, 084, and 306 patents.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1366-67, 1369. With regard to the 115 and 322 patents, the Federal Circuit vacated the Court's clarified construction of the term \"anomalous,\" reversed the Court's judgment as to those two patents, and remanded\n   for proceedings consistent with the Federal Circuit's opinion.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1370-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This appellate process left only Columbia's causes of action as to the 115 and 322 patents pending in this district court. Columbia's seventh through eleventh claims for relief that concern Symantec's 643 Patent, stayed by the Court in 2014, also remain pending before the Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C.\n    <em>\n     The\n     <em>\n      Inter Partes Review\n     </em>\n     Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On December 5, 2014, after the Court issued its partial final judgment order and while the Federal Circuit considered Columbia's appeal from that order, Symantec (which prevailed below) filed petitions with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (\"PTAB\") of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\"PTO\") requesting, in relevant part,\n   <em>\n    inter partes review\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   of the 115 and 322 patents at issue in the litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Notice Pets.\n   <em>\n    Inter Partes Review\n   </em>\n   1, ECF No. 158.) Thus, two avenues of additional proceedings-one started by each party-commenced at approximately the same time. As did this Court's 2014 Claim Construction Orders, Symantec's\n   <em>\n    inter partes review\n   </em>\n   proceedings reached the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit's\n   <em>\n    inter partes review\n   </em>\n   decision, however, took two years longer than its order discussing this Court's 2014 Claim Construction Orders.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Trs. of Columbia Univ. in the City of New York v.

Specifically, in its petition seeking\n   <em>\n    inter partes review\n   </em>\n   of the 115 Patent, Symantec asserted only three grounds of invalidity. (Mem. Supp. Summ. J. Mot. 9, ECF No. 199.) Similarly, in its petition relating to the 322 Patent, Symantec asserted only two grounds of invalidity.

As to the merits, the Court concludes that the plain language of\n    <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20315\">\n     35 U.S.C. \u00a7 315\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (e)(2) unambiguously estops Symantec from asserting as grounds of invalidity those dozens of additional grounds presented in its invalidity contentions which Symantec chose not to raise in its petitions for\n    <em>\n     inter partes review.\n    </em>\n    Contrary to Symantec's argument otherwise, the Federal Circuit's decision in\n    <em>\n     Shaw\n    </em>\n    does not preclude this result. Rather, the purpose of\n    <em>\n     inter partes review\n    </em>\n    and fundamental principles of fairness nearly compel it. For these reasons, the Court will grant the Partial Summary Judgment Motion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    <strong>\n     A.\n     <em>\n      No Genuine Dispute of Material Fact Exists\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    Symantec seemingly attempts to preclude summary judgment by arguing that a genuine dispute of material fact exists. Specifically, in a single sentence Symantec asserts, that it \"disputes that source code is a 'printed publication,\" ' such that it could be raised during\n    <em>\n     inter partes review.\n    </em>\n    (Resp. Summ. J. Mot. 3.) This one sentence assertion does not create a dispute of material fact that would prevent the Court from granting summary judgment for two reasons: first, it fails to satisfy Local Rule 56(B) or Fourth Circuit precedent; and, even were the Court to consider the merits of this argument, it would likely fail.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    E.D.

Summ. J. Mot. 3.) In accordance with Local Rule of Civil Procedure 56(B) and the Fourth Circuit's holding in\n    <em>\n     Bouchat\n    </em>\n    , the Court finds that this single, unsupported sentence does not suffice to raise an issue of disputed material fact.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    E.D.
