Plaintiff El Paso Natural Gas Company, LLC, whose predecessors operated the mines in the 1950s and 1960s, brings claims against Defendants United States of America, the Department of the Interior (\"DOI\"), the Bureau of Indian Affairs (\"BIA\"), the United States Geological Survey (\"USGS\"), and the Department of Energy (\"DOE\") (collectively, the \"United States\") for cost recovery and contribution. Doc. 55 \u00b6\u00b6 1-2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The United States asserts a CERCLA counterclaim against El Paso for contribution. Docs. 53, 66.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   El Paso stipulates that it was an operator of the Mine Sites for purposes of CERCLA liability (Doc. 108), and the Court previously held that the United States is liable as an owner of the land where the mines are located (Doc. 135). The parties assert additional grounds for CERCLA liability against each other and ask the Court to make an equitable allocation of past and future response costs under CERCLA \u00a7 113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The Court held an eight-day bench trial in February and March, 2019. Each side presented many witnesses, live or by deposition, and hundreds of exhibits. The parties also submitted extensive proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, as well as post-trial briefing on specific issues addressed in this order. For reasons set forth below, the Court will allocate 65% of past and future response costs to El Paso and 35% of such costs to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Findings of Fact.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This order sets forth the Court's findings of fact and conclusions of law under Rule 52 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The Court provides some citations to the record, but the citations should not be regarded as the sole basis for the Court's ruling. The Court's findings and conclusions are based on all of the testimony and exhibits admitted in evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   El Paso is the corporate successor of Arrowhead Uranium Company (\"Arrowhead\"), Rare Metals Corporation of America (\"Rare Metals\"), and El Paso Natural Gas Company. Doc. 159 at 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Arrowhead and Rare Metals mined uranium at the Mine Sites. Arrowhead was one of the original uranium mining companies in the Cameron region of Northern Arizona, operating from 1952 to 1954. Ex. 28 at 7-8. Rare Metals was formed in 1954 to prospect, explore, and acquire properties containing uranium deposits and other valuable minerals. Rare Metals acquired Arrowhead in December 1954 and took over its uranium mining operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1040-44. Rare Metals also engaged in uranium exploration and development in Utah, New Mexico, California, and other locations. Exs. 1041 at 7; 1042 at 6, 8; 1043 at 5-7, 9. Rare Metals merged with El Paso in 1962. Ex. 1056. El Paso also takes responsibility for the mining activities of Cameron Mining Company at several of the Mine Sites. Doc. 159 at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The land where the Mine Sites are located is owned by the United States in trust for the Navajo Nation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   25 U.S.C. \u00a7 640d-9(a) ; Doc. 159 at 7. The DOI and the BIA, as part of their tribal trust responsibilities, oversaw some aspects of the mining permits and leases for the Nation. Doc. 159 at 8; Ex. 12 at 2. The USGS, which is part of the DOI, collects, analyzes, monitors, and provides information about natural resources. Docs. 1 \u00b6 19; 23 \u00b6 19. DOE is the successor agency to the former Atomic Energy Commission (\"AEC\"). Doc. 23 \u00b6 20. After World War II, the AEC was responsible for creating and managing a program to procure uranium for nuclear weapons, known as the Domestic Uranium Procurement Program (\"DUPP\"). Ex. 74 at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Cold War and the Domestic Uranium Industry.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The United States' use of atomic bombs in Japan both hastened the end of World War II and sparked the Cold War with the\n   Soviet Union. Both nations aggressively developed nuclear weapons. Obtaining uranium, a naturally occurring metal that was an indispensable component of such weapons, became a driving objective of the United States' national defense effort. Doc. 158 \u00b6 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 1946, Congress passed the Atomic Energy Act, which formed the AEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20Stat.%20755\">\n    60 Stat. 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Act also established the DUPP, a program for \"the production, ownership, and use of fissionable material to assure the common defense and security and to insure the broadest possible mining of the fields.\" Ex. 74 at 6. Viewing foreign sources of uranium as unreliable, the United States sought, through the DUPP, to locate and develop domestic sources using a combination of government-led exploration and private enterprise incentives. Tr. at 94-95. At the time, the federal government was the only authorized purchaser of uranium in the United States. Atomic Energy Act of 1946 \u00a7 5(2); Ex. 74 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Between 1948 and 1956, the AEC published nine circulars offering guaranteed minimum prices and bonus payments for uranium ore (the \"Circulars\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 41. Circulars 3, 4, 5, and 6 applied to uranium mining on the Colorado Plateau, a geographic area encompassing some 140,000 square miles in Arizona, Utah, Colorado, and New Mexico. Ex. 1002; Doc. 159 at 7. Circular 3 guaranteed, for three years, a minimum price and \"development allowance\" of fifty cents per pound for uranium ore of .15% grade or more. Ex. 41 at 3-4;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9 (Circular 5 Revised). Circular 4 established a haulage allowance of six cents per mile for the first 100 miles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Circular 5 also guaranteed a minimum price and expanded the development allowance to ore with uranium concentrations as low as .10%.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6. Circular 6 created an additional bonus for the production of uranium ore from new domestic mines.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 13-14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The AEC assisted the young domestic uranium industry by conducting geologic surveys, furnishing free testing and assaying services, and agreeing to purchase uranium ore. Ex. 25 at 13. The AEC established ore-buying stations in uranium-producing areas.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The AEC's assistance programs included research and development that led to improvement in milling processes and other mining-related innovations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Chenoweth Depo.

Ex. 25 at 14. The program involved temporary withdrawal of some 700 square miles of public domain land for exploration, geologic studies, drilling, examination of samples, and airborne reconnaissance.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The AEC employed a contractor, Walker Lybarger, to use a bulldozer to uncover any uranium outcrops that were discovered. Chenoweth Depo. Jan. 15, 2014, at 103.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ore found on AEC land was leased to private parties directly through the AEC in return for a royalty on ore production. Ex. 25 at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Chenoweth Depo. Jan. 15, 2014, at 79-82. The AEC also undertook an access road program under which the AEC, the Bureau of Public Roads, and various state agencies improved over 1,200 miles of roads in Arizona and other states to facilitate\n   uranium exploration and mine development. Ex. 25 at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In July 1952, Charles Steen, an independent prospector, found uranium on the Colorado Plateau south of Moab, Utah.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 56-57, 1600. Steen made over a million dollars on the ore deposit, and his success motivated many others to pursue uranium mining, launching a gold-rush-like interest in prospecting for uranium. Tr. at 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Uranium Mining on the Navajo Reservation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Because the 19 Mine Sites are all located on the Navajo Reservation, both the Navajo Nation and the federal government were involved in transactions affecting the sites. Generally, four permits or leases are required for uranium mining: (1) prospecting permits, (2) drilling and exploration permits, (3) mining permits, and (4) mining leases.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 31 at 10. As of 1951, the Navajo Nation did not require a separate drilling and exploration permit (Ex. 1075) and required only non-Navajos to apply for prospecting permits (Ex. 31 at 10). In 1953, the Nation's mining regulations were updated to require drilling and exploration permits. Ex. 1078. The new regulations also required any prospector, Navajo or non-Navajo, to apply for a prospecting permit.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2. A non-Navajo permit holder could negotiate a mining lease with a tribal advisory committee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Permits were approved by the Navajo Tribal Council and the area director of the BIA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 160-61;\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Ex. 294A. All rents and royalties were paid to the United States Treasury for deposit exclusively in Navajo tribal funds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 203, 523. The permits contained provisions related to the trust oversight responsibilities of the DOI and required permittees to (1) \"conform to any and all regulations of the Secretary of the Interior\"; (2) receive approval from the Tribal Council and the Secretary of the Interior before assigning the permit; and (3) allow inspection of permitted premises and operations by BIA personnel. Ex. 294A at 3-4. These provisions and the DOI oversight of the leases were consistent with the DOI's trust duties over all reservation mining.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 162-63, 90 (the lease authorization requirement is consistent with all mining contracts on the Navajo reservation); Ex. 75 (example of a lease rejected by the BIA consistent with its tribal trust duty); Ex. 13 (delegating approval of leases to the Secretary of the Interior because it was in a better position to make profitable lease arrangements for tribes);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Navajo Tribe of Indians v.

The Mine Sites.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In 1952, Charles Huskon, a Navajo prospector who worked for AEC contractor Walker Lybarger, discovered a natural uranium outcrop that would later become Huskon 1. Ex. 28 at 6. In July 1952, Huskon and his son left the contractor to work for Arrowhead.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504381\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cl-ct/9/227/#p232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In August and September, 1952, Huskon received mining permits for Huskon 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, and assigned them to Arrowhead. Ex. 294D. In Apr. 1953, the BIA approved a mining permit for Huskon 9, 10, and 11, which Huskon also assigned to Arrowhead. Ex. 24 at 53. Huskon 12, 14, and 17 were surveyed and located in December 1953 and January 1954 (Tr. at 525-27; Ex. 1023),\n   but permits were not obtained until March 1954 (Ex. 294D).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Rare Metals acquired Arrowhead in December 1954 and took over all of its uranium mining operations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1040-44. In 1955, mining permits for Ramco 20, 21, and 22 were issued to Navajo prospectors and assigned to Rare Metals. Ex. 294D. These sites were converted to mining leases in 1959.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Ramco 24 was permitted by a Navajo prospector in 1957 and assigned to Rare Metals.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504381\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cl-ct/9/227/#p232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In 1959, Rare Metals allowed Cameron Mining Company, an independent contractor, to perform mining operations at sites where Rare Metals had ceased operations. Doc. 159 at 8; Tr. at 499-500. These included Huskon 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 11, 12, and 17, and Ramco 20, 21, and 22. Exs. 28 at 13; 1165; 1166; Prince Depo. Oct. 9, 1996, at 88-89. Rare Metals relinquished its rights to Ramco 24 in 1958, and its rights to the remaining Mine Sites during the first half of the 1960s.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 294D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    E. Three Mining Phases.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   At trial and in their briefs, the parties focused on three phases of mine operations: exploration, mining, and reclamation. The Court makes the following findings of fact with respect to each phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Exploration.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   During exploration, an ore deposit is located through prospecting, confirmed, and uncovered to determine its \"dimension, grade, and continuity.\" Tr. at 216. Common exploration methods in the 1950s included drilling and rim stripping. Tr. at 282. El Paso concedes that there is no evidence the United States ever conducted exploration activities at the Ramco sites (Tr. at 62), and El Paso does not seek contribution for exploratory drilling that occurred at any of the Huskon mines (Tr. at 17). During trial, El Paso also stated that it would assume responsibility for all exploration activities at Huskon 5, 6, and 9. Tr. at 348-49. This order, therefore, focuses on exploration at Huskon 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 17. El Paso claims that the United States engaged in rim stripping at each of these sites. The United States disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rim stripping occurs when a bulldozer excavates soil, referred to as \"overburden,\" from the top of an ore deposit to expose the mineralized zone.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 350. During a 45-day period between December 19, 1953 and February 3, 1954, the AEC conducted rim stripping in the Cameron area. Exs. 58; 91 at 2; 129 at 20; 1258. According to a report prepared in 1955 by David Hinckley, an AEC geologist (the \"Hinckley Report\"), the AEC stripped approximately 45,000 linear feet of soil in the Cameron area during this 45-day window, exposing portions of 15 uranium outcrops. Ex. 129 at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Exploratory trenches made during rim stripping can still be seen at many of the Mine Sites today. Some of the trenches are visible in aerial photographs of the sites taken in 1954, and even more are apparent in aerial photographs taken in 1992. The question is who made the trenches.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   AEC and its contractors used a Caterpillar D7 bulldozer for rim stripping - an 11-ton machine that cut a 29-foot-wide swath with its front blade.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 330-31; Ex. 129 at 20. Arrowhead did not own a machine of this size, but instead used a much smaller Allis Chalmers HD5 front-end loader for work at the Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 320-22, 441;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Maloney Depo. at 117. After it purchased Arrowhead in December 1954, Rare Metals also used D7 bulldozers, as well as larger D8s, for work at the Huskon Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 542, 551 (Mr. Beahm testifying that there is no dispute that Rare Metals bulldozers were used at the Huskon mines), 1306 (1992\n   aerial photos suggest that more rim stripping occurred after 1954); Exs. 130 at 6; 1160 (1957 contract with Rare Metals for contractor stripping of overburden);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Chenoweth Depo. Apr. 24, 2014, at 26 (more exploration by private parties after 1956 than by the AEC before 1956).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   El Paso's mining expert, Douglas Beahm, reviewed historical documents regarding the DUPP and historical aerial photographs. Tr. at 311. He visited the Mine Sites six times.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3504381\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cl-ct/9/227/#p232\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On the basis of his investigation, Mr. Beahm testified that the AEC performed rim stripping at Huskon 1-12, 14, and 17. Tr. at 349.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   He testified to measuring a total of 30.2 acres (or 45,362 linear feet) of exploration disturbance at these Huskon sites. Tr. at 358-59. He noted that trenches he observed generally were 29-feet wide, corresponding to the size of a D7 blade, and that his estimated 45,362 linear feet of trenching aligns with the 45,000 linear feet of AEC rim stripping described in the 1955 Hinckley Report - rim stripping performed by the AEC during the 45-day window in 1953 and 1954. Tr. at 358;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 129 at 20. Mr. Beahm concludes that all of the AEC's rim stripping in the Cameron area was performed at the Huskon Mine Sites, and constitutes the only rim stripping that occurred at those sites. El Paso also presented an undated internal corporate memorandum which stated that the AEC bulldozed trenches on Huskon 1-11, 12, 14, and 17, and that the company did \"[l]ittle bulldozer work ... except to strip off overburden.\" Ex. 119;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 366-67.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   If Mr. Beahm is correct in his conclusion that some 45,000 feet of trenching was done by the AEC at the Mines Sites during the 45-day period described by Hinkley, the trenching would have occurred before the 1954 aerial photos were taken in February 1954 and presumably would be visible in those photos. But the government's aerial photography expert, Mary Sitton, testified that only 13,589 linear feet of rim stripping can be seen within the Mine Sites' boundaries in the 1954 aerial photographs, with approximately 3,000 linear feet outside of the boundaries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1116.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   She identified many trenches visible at the sites today that cannot be seen in the 1954 aerial photographs. She also noted that the 1955 Hinckley Report attributes the 45,000 linear feet of rim stripping not to the Mine Sites specifically, but to the general Cameron area, which includes scores of mine sites, and that Rare Metals had heavy bulldozers at the Mine Sites in early 1955 and thereafter - machines capable of creating the trenches observed on the ground today. This evidence persuasively suggests that the trenches at Huskon 1-12, 14, and 17 were not all made by the AEC during a single 45-day period in late 1953 and early 1954.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Court finds Ms. Sitton's testimony about the aerial photographs to be more credible than Mr. Beahm's. She has significantly more aerial photography training and expertise than he does, and she obtained\n   aerial photographs from the National Archives and Records Administration, the USGS, and the University of Arizona. Tr. at 1075. Unlike Mr. Beahm, she reviewed the historical aerial photos through a stereoscope, which allowed her to examine them in 3D. Tr. at 1076. The Court does not find credible Mr. Beahm's assertion that virtually all of the trenches seen on the ground today were present in 1954 but do not appear in the 1954 aerial photographs because they were obscured by shadows or lack of contrast.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The evidence also shows that Arrowhead conducted rim stripping. Mr. Beahm testified that Arrowhead was unable to rim strip by bulldozer because it owned only the HD5 front-end loader, which was incapable of creating the wide trenches observed at the 19 Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 320-22, 441;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Maloney Depo. at 117. And records do indicate that Arrowhead was primarily a hand-digging operation before it was acquired by Rare Metals.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 323. Further, Dozing with an HD5 front-end loader would require multiple passes to create a trench as wide as a D7's, would create several separate waste piles, and would not create uniform windrows as observed on the side of trenches at the Mine Sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   But the United States presented evidence that Arrowhead did conduct rim stripping with its HD5 at some of the Mine Sites. Arrowhead cofounder George Morehouse stated that he would \"strip down with the dozer, actually [he would use] the front end loader as a dozer.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 69 at 9;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1196-97. Expense and production reports for the Huskon sites, before the 45-day AEC exploration window, also indicate that rim stripping was performed by Arrowhead at the Huskon sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1139 (report for Huskon 1 for October 24, 1952 to March 31, 1953, stating cubic yards for stripping); 1106 at 6 (indicating that overburden was stripped by an ACD5, which is the Allis Chalmers HD5 dozer);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1199.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Based on all the evidence, the Court makes several findings regarding the parties' involvement in the exploration phase.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   First, El Paso was directly involved in exploration. It has assumed responsibility for all exploration activities at the Ramco sites and Huskon 5, 6, and 9, as well as all exploratory drilling. The evidence described above shows that Arrowhead engaged in rim stripping, and Arrowhead had mining permits at Huskon 1-11 before February 1954.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 294D. The parties agree that Arrowhead had the authority to mine or explore as a result of those permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1623. In fact, Arrowhead delivered its first uranium ore shipment from Huskon 1 in October 1952, well before the 45-day window when the United States conducted rim stripping activities in the Cameron area.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 28 at 7-8. The Court finds it likely that the rim stripping at Huskon 1-11 was conducted by Arrowhead in conjunction with its mining activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1099 (noting that exploration and mining occurred at the same time), 1228 (stripping is done at the mines after mining started).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Second, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the United States engaged in exploration activities at Huskon 12, 14, and 17. Arrowhead did not receive a permit to mine these sites until March 1954, and yet Ms. Sitton and Mr. Beahm each found disturbances on these sites in the 1954 aerial photos that predate the permits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 294D. For Huskon 14 and 17, Ms. Sitton noted several linear excavations on the 1954 aerials.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1354; 1356.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   El Paso asserts that Arrowhead could not have created these disturbances without a mining permit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1623. Prior to approval of the survey of the mining claims, Arrowhead had no privileges at Huskon 12, 14, and 17.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 369. El Paso argues that the United States did have permission from the Navajo Nation to prospect and explore on the lands in question before the February 1954 aerials were taken. Tr. at 341-43; Exs. 58; 1258. The United States appears to argue that because Arrowhead had a prospecting permit, and because it surveyed and plotted Huskon 12, 14, and 17 in December of 1953 and January 1954, Arrowhead had authority to conduct exploration activities on those Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1621. The United States asserts that because the Navajo Nation did not utilize exploration and drilling permits at the time, the prospecting permit gave Arrowhead authority to conduct these exploration activities.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1623. Further, the United States argues that the minimal level of activity identified by Ms. Sitton would be consistent with staking a mine claim. Tr. at 1622.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   As already noted, the Navajo Nation initially did not require exploration or drilling permits. Tr. at 896, 1255; Exs. 1075; 1078. Miners applied for a prospecting permit and then for a mining permit. Ex. 1075. In December 1953, the Nation updated its regulations, requiring miners to seek first a prospecting permit, then an exploration permit, and then a mining permit. Tr. at 896; Ex. 1078. Mr. Beahm testified that the mining permit was necessary for miners to conduct exploration activities like those seen clearly at Huskon 14 and 17, and that likely occurred at Huskon 12 (Tr. at 117), and the United States failed to present any testimony that supports its theory that a prospecting permit prior to 1953 would allow Arrowhead to conduct exploration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, the fact that the disturbances in question were labeled as linear excavations or seemed to be made by heavy equipment indicates that these disturbances were not made in the normal course of staking a claim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Trial Tr at 1176 (only use a simple compass and steel chain for staking claims). Because the trenches and disturbances at Huskon 12, 14, and 17 were made at a time when Arrowhead likely did not have authority to do the work, and were made by heavy equipment of the kind operated by the AEC contractor, the Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the United States conducted rim stripping at these sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Third, the Court does not find, as El Paso suggests, that the AEC conducted most of the exploration activities at the Mine Sites. Mr. Beahm relied heavily on current site visits where he assumed that bulldozer-sized trenches visible on the\n   ground were made by the AEC during the 45-day window in late 1953 and early 1954. But this view disregards the fact that the disturbances could have been made at any time during the years of mining by El Paso, including after 1954 when Rare Metals brought its own D7 and D8 bulldozers to the Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 390; Ex. 1158. Mr. Beahm also relied on historical documents noting that the AEC conducted rim stripping in the Cameron area, but these documents refer to the entire Cameron area, which contained approximately 100 mines. Tr. at 1147 (Ms. Sitton testifying that she noted other activity in the Cameron area), 1112-14 (discussing mapping anomalies that included linear excavations in the Cameron area outside the Mine Sites), 1114-15 (Ms. Sitton testifying that the 45,000 linear feet does not cover just the 19 Mine Sites);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1363. And Mr. Beahm's assertion that he measured approximately 45,000 linear feet of trenching, which matched the Hinckley Report on AEC activity, is less credible than Ms. Sitton's testimony that most of this trenching does not appear in the 1954 aerial photographs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In summary, although the Court finds that both El Paso and the United States engaged in exploration activities at the Mine Sites, the Court does not find that all or even a majority of it was performed by the United States. The evidence does not enable the Court to precisely determine the parties' respective exploration activities at the sites, but this is not an impediment to an overall allocation because the exploration phase is a relatively minor portion of the relevant activity in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Fla. 2004) (holding that the manual detailing contractors' inspection and quality control responsibilities did not amount to direction of waste disposal practices).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   El Paso argues that the United States exercised control of the Mine Sites through the AEC and the DUPP by (1) creating the domestic market for uranium ore; (2) exercising authority over the possession, transport, and delivery of the ore; (3) acting as the sole purchaser of the ore; (4) controlling El Paso's profits by controlling ore prices, bonuses, and allowances; and (5) setting the ore-grade cut-off, which determined what level of uranium-bearing materials necessarily would be left at the Mine Sites. Doc. 187 at 6. The Court agrees that the United States influenced the operations of El Paso and other uranium mining companies in the 1950s and 1960s. The DUPP was created to foster development of domestic uranium mines, the AEC actively promoted mining on the Colorado Plateau and in the Cameron area, the government regulated the acquisition and handling of uranium ore and was the sole purchaser of the ore for many years, and the AEC exercised some financial control over the uranium market through the Circulars. But El Paso was not conscripted into the uranium business, and the government did not tell it how to operate its mines or dispose of its waste. El Paso stayed in the business and expanded its operations as long as they were profitable and left the business when they were not. El Paso decided who to hire, how much to pay them, what equipment to use, how much money to invest, where to mine, how to mine, how to dispose of waste, and how long to operate. El Paso excavated the ore, created waste piles, and built the mill that had the effects of increasing the profitability of mining in the Cameron area and promoting the development and expansion of the Mine Sites and other mines. El Paso continued to mine and process uranium at the mill after the United States allowed private party purchases of uranium and announced its stretch-out program, and continued to process ore until the supply was exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 1240 at 2. Given these facts, the Court cannot conclude that the influence exercised by the United States over uranium mining and markets rose to the level of \"manag[ing], direct[ing], or conduct[ing] operations specifically related to pollution,\" as required for CERCLA operator liability.\n   <em>\n    Bestfoods\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p66\">\n    524 U.S. at 66-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11181373\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/524/51/#p66\">\n    118 S.Ct. 1876\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   This is true even when the Court considers the most direct influence the government exerted on contamination-creating activities - the Circular's establishment of a .10% grade cut-off. While it is true that this cut-off resulted in less concentrated uranium-bearing materials being left as waste at the sites, some cut-off level was required. El Paso cannot plausibly argue that no cut-off level should have been established - that even the most minute concentrations of uranium in soil or rock should have been purchased and milled on behalf of the government. This fact is best demonstrated by El Paso's own .20% cut-off at the Tuba City mill. This level resulted\n   not only in ore below .10% being left at the Mine Sites, but also in ore below .20% being left there. El Paso's cut-off produced the same on-site contamination as the Circular, and more. The Court cannot conclude that the Circular's cut-off level constituted sufficient managing, directing, or conducting of pollution-creating operations to give rise to operator liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Other cases which have considered comparable levels of government influence have reached the same conclusion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

As discussed above, a division of the Navajo Nation - the NAML - created the reclamation's guiding specifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 198; Sassaman Depo. at 29-30, 35, 56, 74-76; Martinez Depo. at 34-35. Once the plans were submitted for the SMCRA grant, the OSM provided oversight to ensure that the plans were being performed pursuant to the grant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martinez Depo. at 20-21. But management of the day-to-day reclamation activities and handling of all reclamation subcontracts was performed by the Nation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 517-18. The OSM employees responsible for overseeing the reclamation testified that their job was to make sure the site existed, ensure that the work followed the Nation's reclamations standards, and give suggestions where appropriate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Martinez Depo. 34-36, 40, 41-43; Sassaman Depo. 33-35, 106. The OSM employees were conscious of the fact that the Navajo Nation was an independent sovereign that should be granted special deference. Sassaman Depo. at 126-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   El Paso's own expert, Mr. Beahm, acknowledged that the Navajo Nation took the lead on reclamation. The Nation conducted an inventory of the Mine Sites in the 1980s and decided in the early 1990s to reclaim 17 of the 19 sites (Tr. at 511); performed the assessments for the reclamation projects (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 516); developed the technical specifications for the projects (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); selected the contractors who would do the work (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ); and performed the day-to-day management of the projects (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 517-18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   El Paso argues that various federal government agencies participated in planning the reclamation project.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 516-17. But this was due to the overlap between\n   the EPA's authority to prioritize hazardous waste sites and the NAML's authority to reclaim sites that present public health hazards. El Paso points to a letter from the EPA to the DOI regarding a meeting among several federal agencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 198. But the letter indicates that the NAML should continue to reclaim sites under SMCRA and develop reclamation standards in conjunction with the Navajo Superfund Program (\"NSP\").\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Meanwhile, the NSP should continue working with the EPA to identify sites that are not eligible for SMCRA funding.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Ex. 201 (letter stating that the NAML should continue reclamation and SMCRA clean-up will be the most appropriate funding source). Thus, the cooperation identified by El Paso resulted in substantial deference to tribal environmental agencies and does not indicate that the federal government exercised control over reclamation at the Mine Sites.

Arranger Liability.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   El Paso argues that the United States was an arranger during all three phases of mining.

Both are based on essentially the same government activity. As a result, although the two forms of CERCLA liability differ, the Court's ruling on arranger liability largely tracks its ruling on operator liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Exploration Phase.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   El Paso argues that the AEC arranged for its primary contractor to perform rim stripping at the mine sites. Doc. 187 at 5. The Court has already held that the United States is an operator for purposes of the exploration activities at Huskon 12, 14, and 17. The Court concludes that government arranger liability has not been proved for the other Mine Sites, for reasons explained above, and that imposing arranger liability for Huskon 12, 14, and 17 would not change the Court's equitable allocation in this case. As a result, the Court need not decide whether United States is an arranger for these three sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Mining Phase.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   El Paso argues that the United States was an arranger during the mining phase because of the Circulars' ore grade cut-off level. Doc. 187 at 7. El Paso asserts that this level shows the United States intended mine operators to separate and leave behind low-grade uranium-bearing materials.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The Court agrees that the United States knew low-grade uranium-bearing material would be left at the Mine Sites, although, as noted above, such a result was likely an inevitable result of any mining process. But as the Supreme Court has made clear, knowledge is not enough. The party must \"take[ ] intentional steps to dispose of a hazardous substance.\"\n   <em>\n    Burlington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653258\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/599/#p611\">\n    556 U.S. at 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653258\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/599/#p611\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1870\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The evidence does not show that the United States took intentional steps to dispose of waste at the Mine Sites during the mining phase. As already discussed, El Paso decided what equipment to use, where to mine, how to mine, how to dispose of waste, and how long to operate the mines. El Paso excavated the ore at the Mine Sites and created the waste piles. The government's cut-off levels may have influenced what waste was left behind, just as El Paso's higher mill cut-off level did, but such influence does not amount to intentional action to dispose of hazardous materials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Reclamation Phase.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   El Paso asserts that federal agencies took a leading role in establishing the reclamation strategy and approving grant applications, reclamation plans, and the comingling of waste from mines operated by third parties. Doc. 187 at 13. According to El Paso, these actions were intentional steps to arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances that resulted from dispersal of waste piles, disturbance of native uranium-bearing material, and the import of uranium-bearing material to the Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653258\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/599/#p611\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   As explained above, however, the Court does not find that the United States controlled the reclamation work or set the reclamation standards.

In addressing the United States' arranger liability in light of these facts, the Ninth Circuit considered four circuit court decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   One of the cases found arranger liability where the party owned hazardous chemicals, arranged for their blending by another company, and knew that the blending process generated and disposed of hazardous waste.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

El Paso's Proposed Allocation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   El Paso suggests that the Court allocate responsibility for all past and future response costs by (1) creating three categories or buckets, one for exploration, one for mining, and one for reclamation; (2) assigning a percentage of overall site responsibility to each of these three buckets based on the volume of soil moved during each phase; (3) allocating the portion within each bucket between El Paso and the United States; and (4) adding the percentage allocated to each party in each of the three buckets to arrive at the overall allocation. Using this model, El Paso's proposed allocation assigns 86.77% of the liability for the Mine Sites to the United States, and 13.23% to El Paso. The Court disagrees both with the percentage of site responsibility El Paso assigns to each of\n   its proposed buckets and with its suggested allocation within each bucket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   <strong>\n    1. El Paso's Percentage Division Among Buckets.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   El Paso's three-bucket approach was developed by its allocation expert, David Batson. He allocated a percentage of overall site responsibility to each bucket by adopting Mr. Beahm's estimates of the amount of soil moved during each of the three phases of mining. Tr. at 735-36. The Court finds this approach seriously flawed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   During the exploration phase, Mr. Beahm estimated that 132,000 cubic yards of soil was moved, amounting to about 7% of all soil moved during the exploration, mining, and reclamation phases. Mr. Batson therefore assigned 7% of the overall responsibility for response costs to the exploration bucket. Mr. Beahm reached this 7% calculation by relying on the 45,000 linear feet of trenching he attributes to the 45-day AEC exploration window. As explained above, however, the Court cannot accept Mr. Beahm's conclusion that 45,000 feet of trenching was done at the Mine Sites in late 1953 and early 1954 when it is not shown on the 1954 aerial photographs, nor that all of it was done by the AEC. The Court has little confidence in Mr. Beahm's conclusion about the amount of soil moved during the exploration phase, and therefore in Mr. Batson's assignment of 7% of the overall site responsibility to the first bucket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   The size of the second bucket - 59% of overall site responsibility - is based on Mr. Beahm's calculation of the amount of soil moved and left at the site during the mining phase. He calculated that amount by estimating the volume of the mine pit at each site, subtracting from that volume the amount of ore sold from the site, and increasing the result by 20% to reflect the fact that soil expands after it is removed from the ground. Tr. at 418-19. But this calculation assumes that the only soil El Paso moved at the Mine Sites was the soil that came from within the walls of the pits as they appeared when Mr. Beahm visited the site decades later or in aerial photographs taken before reclamation by the Navajo Nation. The calculation fails to account for soil moved by El Paso at the Mine Sites to excavate overburden down to where the pit mining actually started; to clear ground for mine structures, ore piles, ore blending, and waste piles; to build ramps into and out of mine pits; and to build roads around and into the Mine Sites.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1500-01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   The amount assigned by El Paso to the third bucket - 34% - is based on Mr. Beahm's estimate of the amount of new soil moved during reclamation. Mr. Beahm noted that the volume of soil moved during reclamation was higher than his calculated volume for mining. Tr. at 413-17. He subtracted his mining volume from the reclamation volume and arrived at 643,308 cubic yards of soil that he claims was moved for the first time during reclamation. Tr. at 1396. He explains this additional soil movement by assuming that the Nation's reclamation contractors moved more soil than necessary when reclaiming waste piles. Tr. at 420. He asserts that they likely dug into the soft undisturbed dirt when moving the waste piles. Tr. at 477-78. He also notes that soil was brought from off-site to complete the reclamation. Tr. at 479-80. The Court views this reclamation calculation as unreliable because it relies on Mr. Beahm's mining volume, which the Court finds unreliable for reasons stated above. The Court also has difficulty with the implicit assumption that the movement of additional soil in reclamation was unnecessary - that reclamation could have been accomplished by moving no more soil than was originally disturbed during mining. No evidence was presented to support this assumption,\n   and yet it is the basis for the third bucket, which is a percentage of site costs independent of mining and exploration activities that El Paso claims should be assigned to somebody. If the movement of additional soil was a necessary part of reclaiming the Mine Sites, then it could be considered a product of mining and allocated in accordance with the mining allocation. The Court cannot agree that it should be treated as a separate percentage of the overall site costs to be allocated without regard to mining activities, as El Paso proposes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    2. El Paso's Allocation Within Each Bucket.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   The Court also disagrees with how El Paso's allocates responsibility within each bucket. The first bucket represents 7% of the overall response cost liability, and El Paso allocates 70% of it to the United States and 30% to itself. This allocation assumes that the AEC did all of the exploration at the 12 Huskon Mine Sites accounted for in this bucket and during the 45-day window. Tr. at 735.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   As noted above, the Court does not find this position credible. The Court finds that the United States engaged in exploration activities at Huskon 12, 14, and 17, considerably less than all of the exploration activities that occurred at the 12 Huskon Mine Sites in El Paso's proposed first bucket.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   For the second bucket - the mining phase - Mr. Batson starts with an allocation of two-thirds liability to the United States as landlord, active owner of the land, and arranger for the disposal of the hazardous substances, and one-third to El Paso as an operator that conducted mining activities. Tr. at 738. From this largely unexplained baseline, Mr. Batson considers the impact of four equitable factors: (1) the benefits received by each party, (2) the degree of knowledge regarding the risks of the contamination, (3) the degree of cooperation by the parties, and (4) the degree of control and care exercised by each party in relation to knowledge. Tr. at 739. Based on these factors, Mr. Batson recommends increasing the United States' share by ten percent (Tr. at 741), although he does not explain how he arrived at this specific amount. He also assigns the United States the orphan shares for Huskon 4, 5, 8, and 9. Tr. at 745. When all of his second-bucket allocation is completed, Mr. Batson assigns 81% of the second bucket to the United States and 19% to El Paso. Tr. at 746.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   The Court disagrees with Mr. Batson's baseline. The period represented by the second bucket was the primary waste-generating phase at the Mine Sites - years when the mines were in operation and creating waste piles. El Paso was the key actor in these operations. As will be clearer from the Court's allocation discussion below, the Court can see no justification for assigning the United States a supermajority of liability for mining operations El Paso performed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   In the third bucket, Mr. Batson assigns 100% of the liability to the United States as the only operator during the reclamation phase. Tr. at 746. His assessment is based on El Paso's view that the Nation's reclamation created additional waste by moving too much soil and by moving in radioactive material from off-site.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 860-61.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The Court's first disagreement is that the United States is not an operator during this phase, as explained above. The Court also finds that the reclamation projects most likely will decrease, rather than\n   increase, the ultimate clean-up costs at the Mine Sites. El Paso has evaluated possible remedies in draft RSEs and EE/CAs for Huskon 12 and 14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 677. These represent two of the most contaminated Mine Sites, and yet three of the four remedies proposed by El Paso involve no excavation of the mine pits where wastes were placed during reclamation. Nor does El Paso propose that entirely new caps be placed on the mounds now found where the mine pits once were located. Instead, El Paso proposes that it enhance and maintain the reclamation work performed by the NAML.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ex. 285 at 11-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Although the EPA has not responded to El Paso's proposal, it appears likely that El Paso will not be required to excavate the mine pits and move contaminated soil off-site to other locations, particularly given the arid and still-remote positions of the Mine Sites.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court finds it more likely that El Paso will be required to upgrade caps on the waste piles and improve storm-water run-off and erosion protection systems. It may also be required to address contamination in drainages and other areas that were not addressed in the reclamation work. If this is true, the excavation of waste piles and filling of mine pits performed by the Navajo Nation during reclamation most likely will have reduced, not increased, the response costs at the Mine Sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Mr. Werth, El Paso's remediation project manager, testified that the reclamation work will increase remediation costs, but the Court did not find this testimony credible. He suggested that areas on the Mine Sites with the highest gamma readings were in locations that have not been reclaimed, suggesting that reclamation lowered radiation levels. Tr. at 624-25. He testified that erosion of the reclamation mounds will increase remediation costs (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 621), but there is evidence that the mine sites were eroding prior to the reclamation work (Ex. 189). The Court cannot find that erosion of the capped waste mounds created during reclamation has caused more contamination than would have been caused by erosion of uncovered waste piles left at the sites by El Paso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Nor did El Paso persuasively show that reclamation made the sites worse by bringing in radioactive fill material from other sites. Mr. Beahm did testify that soil was brought from other locations to provide cover at the Mine Sites, and that some of these locations were other uranium mines. Tr. at 460-63, 516-17. But he did not testify that the material brought to the Mine Sites was contaminated. He noted that the radiation level used by the Nation in reclamation was 25 picocuries per gram, implying that materials near this level could have been imported for cover, but he did not testify that this actually occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11440109\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/302/928/#p945\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   El Paso provides a long string cite of various exhibits and deposition pages to support its position (Doc. 187 at 11-12), but none of the cited evidence shows that contaminated material was brought onto the Mine Sites during reclamation. To the contrary, at least one historical document states that the imported material was \"clean.\" Ex. 224. The Court accordingly does not find that reclamation made the sites more contaminated as El Paso asserts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   To summarize, the Court finds El Paso's proposed allocation to be quite unreliable - contrived to assign maximum responsibility to the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The United States' Proposed Allocation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   The government's allocation expert, Mr. Low, did not present a framework similar\n   to Mr. Batson's. He instead opined that the United States' trust ownership of the land should reduce the costs allocated to it. Tr. at 1298. And he emphasized involvement of the parties, benefits to the parties, and cooperation as the three main factors for the Court to consider. Tr. at 1302-08. Mr. Low opined that the equitable share for the United States in this case should not exceed 25%, but he did not fully explain how he applied his equitable factors to reach this proposed limit. The Court does not find his allocation analysis helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Court's Allocation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   In apportioning response costs among responsible parties, CERCLA requires only that the Court use \"such equitable factors as the court determines are appropriate.\" 42 U.S.C. 9613(f)(1). Courts often start allocation analysis with the Gore factors originally contained in a bill proposed by then-Congressman Al Gore.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. v.

These include (1) the ability of the parties to demonstrate that their contribution to a discharge, release or disposal of a hazardous waste can be distinguished; (2) the amount of the hazardous waste involved; (3) the degree of toxicity of the hazardous waste; (4) the degree of involvement by the parties in the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, or disposal of the hazardous waste; (5) the degree of care exercised by the parties with respect to the hazardous waste, taking into account the characteristics of such hazardous waste; and (6) the degree of cooperation by the parties with federal, state, or local officials to prevent any harm to the public health or the environment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    TDY Holdings, LLC v.

Courts also consider (1) the extent to which the clean-up costs are attributable to wastes for which a party is responsible; (2) the party's level of culpability; (3) the degree to which the party benefitted from disposal of the waste; and (4) the party's ability to pay its share of the costs.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Distinguishability of Each Party's Waste.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   There is only one type of waste at issue in this case - radioactive remnants of uranium mining. Both parties claim the other is partially responsible for this single form of waste. The Court cannot accept El Paso's three-bucket approach for reasons explained above, and finds no other reasonable basis for distinguishing one party's waste from the other's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Amount of Hazardous Waste.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-156\">\n   The Court cannot identify a volume of hazardous waste that can be neatly attributed to one party and not the other. The fight is over waste that has not been quantified. As noted, the Court does not agree with El Paso's attempt to estimate a soil volume attributable to each of the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Degree of Toxicity.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   With only one type of contaminant blended in the soil throughout the Mine Sites, this factor is not relevant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gavora, Inc. v. City of Fairbanks\n   </em>\n   , No. 4:15-cv-00015-SLG,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203161626\">\n    2017 WL 3161626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Alaska July 25, 2017) (noting that this factor is most relevant when there are two types of discharges by two distinct actors, and one is more toxic).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   <strong>\n    d. The Degree of Involvement.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   This is the most important factor in this case. El Paso, as the Mine Sites' operator, was the primary party responsible for the generation and disposal of waste at the sites. El Paso excavated uranium\n   ore in open pit mines, stockpiled ore on the property, and stockpiled waste on the property. El Paso also built and operated the Tuba City mill, which purchased uranium from its own mines and others in the area.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The United States did not directly oversee El Paso's mining operations or instruct it on where or how to dispose of waste. But the United States did own the land in trust for the Navajo Nation and was obligated to hold it for the best interests of the Nation. In this capacity, the United States reviewed and approved permits and leases, included various oversight powers in the permits and leases, advised the Nation on its uranium regulation activities, and collected rents and royalties for the Nation's benefit. The Court concludes that the United States should be assessed a 5% share for these ownership activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   But this assessment does not fully account for the government's substantial involvement in this case. The United States did much more than simply act in its trust capacity for the Nation's benefit. It created the DUPP to obtain uranium and further the national defense. It created the market for uranium by publishing the Circulars and establishing buying stations. It encouraged uranium mining throughout the United States and in the Cameron area by researching best exploration and mining practices and engaging in exploration and road-building. It was the only purchaser of uranium ore, and it reviewed and approved El Paso's construction and operation of the Tuba City mill. Charlie's Steen's million-dollar discovery may have sparked the uranium \"gold rush\" in the minds of the public (Tr. at 1600), but the United States played a primary role in the creation and growth of uranium mining in the 1950s, including at the Mine Sites.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   How, then, does the Court balance the parties' respective roles - El Paso's for-profit, on-the-ground, excavation and disposal of the uranium waste that must now be remediated, together with its operation of the mill that created a local uranium purchaser for its mines and others, versus the government's role in promoting, facilitating, and assisting in uranium mine development generally and its exploration of some of the Mine Sites?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   The Court begins by noting that El Paso was directly involved in every step of waste generation. With the exception of the relatively small orphan shares that will be assigned below, El Paso moved every cubic foot of radioactive soil that has created an environmental hazard at the sites. It opened the mines, hired the workers, acquired the machinery, excavated the soil, created the waste and ore piles, loaded the trucks, and blended the ore. It decided how long to operate each mine, how much soil to disturb, and, within the limits of the mines' capacities, how much ore to produce. It built and operated the mill that made the Cameron area mines, including its own mines, more profitable. It set the ore grade cut-off at the mill that determined what levels of waste would be left at mines. In short, El Paso was the principal actor, the primarily responsible party for generating the waste at issue in this case. El Paso was not dragooned by the United States into this activity. Like many others drawn to uranium mining in the 1950s and 1960s, it sought to make a profit and dutifully reported its mining profits to management and shareholders each year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   The United States, by contrast, was not an on-site actor in the waste generating or disposal activities. With the exception of some exploration work at Huskon 12, 14, and 17 in the early years, it had no direct involvement in the mining or waste generation. It did, to be sure, exert influence over those operations. It created financial incentives, promoted uranium mining on\n   the Colorado Plateau, approved construction of the mill, and purchased uranium ore and concentrate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Comparing these two parties, the Court concludes that El Paso was the primary actor but that the United States should bear some meaningful share of the responsibility. Therefore, in addition to the 5% that the Court has assigned the United States for its trust ownership of the land and the actions it took to oversee and approve permits and leases, the Court assigns 25% to the United States for creating the conditions and market that led to mining at the Mine Sites, and for its limited exploration at three sites. The Court assigns 70% to El Paso for its role as the primary generator of the contamination - an amount that will be adjusted slightly when the Court considers the relative benefits to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   <strong>\n    e. Degree of Cooperation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   This factor does not tip the balance either way. Both parties have been appropriately responsive to their environmental responsibilities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   El Paso left the Mine Sites exactly how the Navajo Nation and the United States requested. The government approved termination of the leases and returned El Paso's bonds.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 383; Ex. 172. Leases required El Paso to leave the Mine Sites timbered, which for pit mining meant leaving the pits open. In the years that followed, El Paso had no interest in or responsibility for the Mine Sites, nor has the United States produced evidence that El Paso was asked to participate in the reclamation. Since El Paso received a PRP notice from the EPA, it has been compliant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 610-11. El Paso appears to have done everything the EPA has asked, on schedules agreed to by the EPA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   El Paso asserts that the United States and the Navajo Nation left the Mine Sites unattended from 1962 to the 1990s, allowing erosion and other health hazards to continue and increase.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 746-47. But in response to concerns about public health and the state of the Mine Sites, the United States funded the Navajo Nation's reclamation through a SMCRA grant of $ 2.4 million. The reclamation significantly mitigated immediate health hazards and likely reduced not only the continuing spread of radioactive material through erosion, but also the ultimate remediation costs as noted above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   <strong>\n    f. The Degree of Care.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   There is no evidence El Paso mined inappropriately or disposed of waste outside of its lease provisions or the customs of the 1950s and 1960s. Similarly, there is no evidence that the United States acted irresponsibly in operating the DUPP or in its involvement with uranium mines. This factor does not affect the Court's allocation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Other Factors.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    a. The Relative Benefits to the Parties.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   Courts may consider both financial and non-monetary benefits when considering the degree to which parties benefited.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cadillac Fairview\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11452563\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/299/1019/\">\n    299 F.3d at 1026\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (World War II rubber production);\n   <em>\n    Shell Oil Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9411935\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/294/1045/\">\n    294 F.3d at 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (aviation gasoline as part of the war effort). The clear benefit to El Paso was the profits it received from the mining activities. Tr. at 1056-58; Exs. 1032-1056.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   For the United States, the benefit was of a different kind. The threat of nuclear war was real when the government started the DUPP. Uranium ore from the Colorado Plateau was considered vital to the Country's national security, and the federal government needed private companies with experience in mining. The Cold War effort ultimately succeeded; the United States obtained enough uranium and produced enough weapons to maintain security during the Cold War.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   In assessing the benefit to the United States from domestic uranium production, however, the Court cannot ignore the relatively small portion of government uranium needs that was filled by the Cameron area mines. In 1961, all of Arizona provided only 3.2% of the uranium ore produced in the United States (Ex. 1331), a percentage comparable to other years (Tr. at 918-19). Mr. Beahm testified that production from the Cameron mines was a \"tiny\" portion of domestic output. Tr. at 498;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Exs. 1072 at 8; 1330; 1331. Indeed, he testified that a single mine in Wyoming produced more uranium ore in one year than all of the mines in the Cameron area produced during their entire lives. Tr. at 497.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Thus, although the benefit to the United States from overall uranium procurement was substantial, the Mine Sites contributed only a small portion of that benefit. The Court will assign an additional 5% to the United States for this factor, raising its total allocation to 35%, with 65% for El Paso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Tuba City Mill Remediation.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   The United States asserts that it should be credited for money spent on the Tuba City mill remediation. The Court does not agree. As discussed above, when El Paso closed the mill it followed the procedures of the Arizona AEC and instructions from the BOM. When it enacted UMCTRA, Congress opted not to impose liability on mill operators and instead assumed responsibility for mills used in the uranium procurement program. Given this conscious choice by Congress, it would be improper to use CERCLA to shift mill clean-up costs to El Paso.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Degree of Knowledge and Risk.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Both parties knew of and understood the risks associated with uranium mining in the 1950s and 1960s. Both employed geologists and mining experts. The Court cannot conclude that one party had more knowledge than the other.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   <strong>\n    d. Orphan Share.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   The orphan shares in this case arise from the operations of defunct mining companies - Utco Uranium, Cameron Mining, B.C. Associates, Domino Company, and H.R. Rodgers. El Paso proposes that the Court assign nine sites to Rare Metals, where Rare Metals ceased operations prior to the ultimate closure of those sites, and the remaining sites to the United States because it owned the land and had more connections with the other orphan companies. Tr. at 744-45. But El Paso's proposed assignment of 100% of the remainder to the United States ignores El Paso's continued relationship with the mines through its operation of the Tuba City mill, which facilitated their mining and profited from their ore production.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1335-36, 1478. The Court concludes that a pro rata allocation of the orphan shares is more equitable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Supporting Case Law.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   The Court arrives at the 35%-65% allocation based on the factors considered above. The Court has also considered a number of other cases that have engaged in CERCLA allocations and finds that they support this division of responsibility.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Wash. Oct. 17, 2008), which concerned the relative CERCLA liabilities of the United States and two mining companies for an open pit uranium mine operated during the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s on land held in trust by the United States for the Spokane Indian Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *1.

The AEC engaged in exploratory drilling at the mine site, executed a series of small ore procurement contracts with the mining companies, performed geologic surveying, provided free testing and assaying, guaranteed minimum ore prices through the Circulars, and was the only purchaser of uranium when the mine was opened.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *8-9. As here, the companies elected to construct a mill for the uranium ore, and the AEC executed a contract for the production and sale of uranium concentrate.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *10. Once the mill was operational, the AEC inspected it regularly, and the USGS inspected the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13. The AEC entered into additional contracts with the mining companies, and DOI prepared and entered into renewed leases.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *13-14. The leases included obligations to the United States, not to the Spokane Tribe, allowed DOI to audit the mining companies' records, empowered DOI to suspend operations, and provided for payment of rents and royalties to the BIA for the benefit of the Tribe.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *14. Following a short closure of the mine while prices would not support a profitable operation, mining resumed and uranium was sold to various private electric utilities.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *16. Various federal agencies, including the BIA and USGS, resumed their inspections of the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The DOI approved revised royalty agreements between the mining companies and the Tribe, and the USGS was extensively involved in various reclamation and mitigation activities at the mine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *17-21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-190\">\n   In addition to this direct involvement with the mine and the mill, the\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   court found that the mine's \"uranium production provided the United States with a significant, material benefit by supplying uranium for the nation's nuclear weapon and energy needs during the Cold War.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *43. The\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   court also found that \"[w]ithout the encouragement and direct involvement of the United States, the Mine would not and could not have been developed in the 1950s and 60s.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-191\">\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   assigned one-third of the CERCLA liability to the United States and two-thirds to the mining companies. The district court found that the government knew of the inherent environmental problems associated with open pit mining and that uranium production provided the United States with a vital national benefit for the Cold War and commercial nuclear power. Additionally, the United States had authority to inspect the mining operations, monitor water quality, control rents and royalties, conduct audits, and set the amount of the reclamation bond.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *60-61.\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   assigned two-thirds of the CERCLA liability to the mining companies because they \"conducted the mining activities that have caused the environmental problems that are now being addressed by EPA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *61. The companies also \"sought to profit financially and did profit from the operation,\" and \"demonstrated [a] lack of care and recalcitrance in reclaiming the mine site.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   The Court finds that\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   corroborates the 35% allocation to the government in this case. On very similar facts, the\n   United States was assigned one-third of the CERCLA responsibility. Although it is true that the mining companies in\n   <em>\n    Newmont\n   </em>\n   were recalcitrant in their environmental responsibilities and El Paso is not, the United States also had greater involvement with the mine than here.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. at 1312 (Mr. Low testifying that there was much more government oversight at the Newmont mine).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-193\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

As noted above, the Court assigns 5% of the liability to the United States based solely on its role as owner of the land and the actions it took in that role - approving permits and leases, including various oversight powers in the permits and leases, advising on regulations, and collecting rents and royalties for the benefit of the Nation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The United States' operator liability arises from exploration actions of the AEC at the Mine Sites, not from its fiduciary land ownership, and therefore is not limited to trust assets by \u00a7 107(n).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 9607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (n)(2) (Section 107(n) \"does not apply to the extent that a person is liable under this chapter independently of the person's ownership of a vessel or facility as a fiduciary or actions taken in a fiduciary capacity.\"). The Court concludes that the 25% share allocated to the United States for its purposeful promotion of uranium mining in the 1950s, and the additional 5% allocated to it because of the benefits it received from uranium production during the Cold War, should be assigned to its operator liability, not its owner liability. The government's creation of the DUPP was not a result of its land ownership for the Navajo Nation. Rather, it was undertaken by the AEC for a very different purpose - enhancing national defense during the Cold War. It was motivated by the same forces that led the AEC to engage in the exploration activities that give rise to its operator liability in this case. Because the Court allocates this 30% share to the United States' operator liability, it is not subject to the limitation of \u00a7 107(n).\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%209607\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   The United States suggests that there are no assets available in trust to satisfy the portion allocated for owner liability. It cites the Indian Non-Intercourse Act as holding that all assets held in trust are inalienable. But the Act is limited to land: \"[n]o purchase, grant, lease, or other conveyance\n   <em>\n    of lands, or of any title or claim thereto\n   </em>\n   , from any Indian nation or tribe of Indians, shall be of any validity in law or equity, unless the same be made by treaty or convention entered into pursuant to the Constitution.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20177\">\n    25 U.S.C. \u00a7 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Doc. 187 at 14. El Paso asserts that \"the AEC acted in a capacity other than [as] a fiduciary during its mining activities at the Mine Sites[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20115.002\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   But \u00a7 107(n)(7)(A) has other requirements that El Paso does not address.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 107(n)(7)(A)(ii), (B)(ii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   El Paso also argues that \u00a7 107(n) does not apply because the United States does not fall within the \"safe harbor\" provision in \u00a7 107(n)(4)(H). Doc. 187 at 15. This\n   argument conflates \u00a7 107(n)(1) and \u00a7 107(n)(4), which are clearly different provisions with different purposes. El Paso cites no authority to suggest that a party which does not satisfy the safe harbor provision in \u00a7 107(n)(4)(H) cannot receive the benefits of \u00a7 107(n)(1), and the statute certainly does not say so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   In summary, \u00a7 107(n) has the following effect in this case: the 5% allocated to the United States for its ownership in trust of the Mine Sites, and for actions it took as the land owner and trustee, is recoverable only from trust assets. The 30% allocated to the United States as a CERCLA operator is not subject to this limitation and may be recovered from the United States Treasury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   <strong>\n    V.
