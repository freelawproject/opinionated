The parties do not dispute that the term \"Inventions\" includes software like CRR and that Zaccari's \"service\" refers to \"all times during [Zaccari's] employment or engagement as an independent contractor.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 1.1, 1.2;\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 5 (stating that Zaccari \"will not ... engage in any employment or business activity other than for the Company\" \"during the period of [his] [s]ervice\"). The Agreement further provides that assignment excludes \"Prior Inventions,\" which are in turn defined as inventions Zaccari made \"prior to the commencement\" of his employment that \"[he] both (a) may use in connection with [his] [s]ervice and (b) consider[s] to be [his] property ... that [he] wish[es] to have excluded from the scope of th[e] Agreement.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6 2.2. The Agreement continues that, \"[t]o preclude any possible uncertainty,\" Zaccari agrees to \"set forth on a Previous Inventions Disclosure Form ... a complete list\" of Prior Inventions, and that \"if, in the course of his [employment], [he] incorporate[s] a Prior Invention into a Company product, process[,] or machine, the Company is hereby granted ... [a] worldwide license ... to ... sell such Prior Invention.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    Finally, the contract states that \"[n]otwithstanding the foregoing,\n    <em>\n     [Zaccari] agree[s] that [he] will not incorporate, or permit to be incorporated, Prior Inventions in any Company Inventions without the prior written consent of an authorized officer of the Company\n    </em>\n    .\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    Zaccari argues that the foregoing provisions imply Apprio had a duty to \"provide[ ] 'prior written consent of an authorized officer of the Company' before directing Zaccari to give a copy of his software to [the government].\" Pl.'s Opp'n at 5 (quoting Agreement \u00b6 2.2);\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    Compl. \u00b6 39 (alleging that \"[d]espite [his] VBA software being a Prior Invention\" under the Agreement, \"an authorized officer of Apprio never provided prior written authorization to Zaccari to incorporate or permit the incorporation of either his VBA software or his CRR Software into any Apprio work product\"). Apprio responds that, even liberally construed, Zaccari has only identified contractual provisions that set forth his obligations\n    under the Agreement, not Apprio's.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Def.'s Mot. at 16-18.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The Court agrees with Apprio. The language of the Agreement unambiguously requires\n    <em>\n     Zaccari\n    </em>\n    to\n    <em>\n     obtain\n    </em>\n    prior consent from Apprio should he decide to incorporate a Prior Invention; it does not require\n    <em>\n     Apprio\n    </em>\n    to\n    <em>\n     provide\n    </em>\n    such consent to Zaccari. Indeed, the complaint itself states that \"\n    <em>\n     Zaccari\n    </em>\n    agreed that '[he] [would] not incorporate ... Prior Inventions ... without the prior written consent of an authorized offer of the Company.' \" Compl. \u00b6 10 (quoting Agreement \u00b6 2.2) (emphasis added). As Apprio points out, and as the language of the Agreement makes obvious, the purpose of the provision is to protect Apprio from precisely the type of suit that Zaccari now brings-\n    <em>\n     i.e.\n    </em>\n    , an employee's claim that an invention created during his service was in fact adapted from a prior invention he owns.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Apprio, Inc.'s Reply Mem. in Supp. of Def.'s Mot.

Before considering whether Zaccari has alleged sufficient facts to make out a claim, however, the Court must determine whether the claim is properly before this Court. Copyright claims against the government or against government contractors acting with the government's \"authorization\n    and consent\" must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201498\">\n     28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1498\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (b). No party disputes that Apprio is a government contractor. To determine whether Zaccari's infringement claim must be brought in the Court of Federal Claims, then, only one question remains: has Apprio \"establish[ed] that the [U.S.] government authorized or consented to the [government contractor's alleged] copyright infringement ...?\"\n    <em>\n     Auerbach v.

The government's unequivocal authorization and consent for the alleged infringement is sufficient to trigger section 1498(b).\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Auerbach\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4332008,1758467\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/829/175/\">\n     829 F.2d at 179-80\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (noting that for purposes of section 1498(b), \"express documentary evidence\" of the government's consent \"[o]bviously ... will do,\" and that \"the form of the [government's] consent\" may include \"retroactive consent\");\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Herbert v.

The complaint is devoid of factual allegations that, if true, would make out a claim for trade secret misappropriation under the DTSA. In fact, the only allegations even arguably relevant to trade secret misappropriation concern the government or DT, the other contractor-not Apprio. Zaccari alleges, for instance, that after developing the CRR software and demonstrating its capabilities for both Apprio and the government, \"Zaccari ... emailed a copy of his CRR Software application to [Beverly] Murray,\" DCMA's \"team leader for\n    <em>\n     BPR 1\n    </em>\n    ,\" \"and some other members\n    <em>\n     of the BPR 1 team\n    </em>\n    so that they could further evaluate it.\" Compl. \u00b6 16 (emphases added). Zaccari further alleges that he \"did not ... license or otherwise give permission for anyone on the\n    <em>\n     BPR 1 team\n    </em>\n    to do anything other than evaluate ... CRR,\" and that \"[u]pon observing [a DCMA employee] making visual modifications to ... his software code,\" he \"instructed her to stop\" doing so \"without his express, prior permission.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    (emphasis added). Zaccari also alleges that \"[t]he\n    <em>\n     BPR 1\n    </em>\n    team ... removed Zaccari's name as [CRR's] author ... and renamed the application\"; McNeil, a DCMA employee, \"collaborated with\n    <em>\n     DT\n    </em>\n    [ ] to copy Zaccari's CRR Software and prepare a derivative work that uses some or all of [his] source code\";\n    <em>\n     DCMA\n    </em>\n    estimated the derivative work would save the government millions of dollars; and \"\n    <em>\n     DCMA\n    </em>\n    ... shared copies of [CRR] with other DoD agencies.\"\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n    \u00b6\u00b6 19-21, 23 (emphases added).

Putting aside that Zaccari does not plausibly allege CRR was \"[un]related to [Apprio's] actual or anticipated business,\" this provision does not contain any contractual promise or obligation that Apprio allegedly failed to perform. Instead, it defines the boundary of\n     <em>\n      Apprio's\n     </em>\n     rights to Zaccari's inventions.
