Walter (\"Plaintiff\" or \"Walter\") was terminated from his position as an adjunct lecturer at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College (\"College\") after serving in the position for over nine years. Walter taught a variety of music courses to hundreds of students, including one called \"Private Vocal Lesson,\" which, as a matter of practical necessity and longstanding College practice was held off campus because in the College's view, the fees paid to adjunct professors were not enough to justify the expense of traveling to campus for private lessons. Walter, who suffered from chronic atrial fibrillation, held lessons at his apartment, which he shared with a female roommate. Walter's termination came after an allegation surfaced that he had engaged in sexually inappropriate conduct during a private vocal lesson in violation of the College's Policy on Sexual Misconduct (\"Policy\"). Prior to the single in-person meeting where Walter was made aware of the allegation, he received no information about the nature or subject of the meeting, and at no time was Walter informed that he faced termination. On January 26, 2016, two weeks after Walter's only in-person meeting, which he attended alone, without a Union representative as was his right pursuant to his Collective Bargaining Agreement (\"CBA\"), the College's Title IX coordinator, Defendant Rountree, issued a written report regarding the allegation. The next day Walter was terminated. Walter subsequently\n   contested his termination through a three-step grievance procedure pursuant to his CBA. The appeals were unsuccessful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Walter now brings procedural and substantive due process claims pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   against Queens College and various Queens College employees (together, \"Defendants\"). Specifically, Walter's procedural due process claims arise under two theories: (i) the College's Policy regarding sexual misconduct is vague as applied to his alleged conduct and failed to put Walter on notice that his alleged conduct constituted a Policy violation, and (ii) the Defendants failed to afford Walter constitutionally adequate pre- or post-deprivation process. Defendants move to dismiss the complaint against Queens College on the grounds of Eleventh Amendment immunity and against all Defendants for failure to state a claim. For the reasons that follow, Defendants' motion is granted with respect to Queens College and Walter's substantive due process claim and denied with respect to Walter's vagueness and pre-deprivation procedural due process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I. The College's Policy on Sexual Misconduct\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Policy on Sexual Misconduct states, in relevant part, \"[t]his policy prohibits sexual harassment, gender-based harassment and sexual violence\" and explains that \"[s]exual harassment includes unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, graphic and electronic communications or physical conduct that is sufficiently serious to adversely affect an individual's participation in employment, education or other CUNY activities.\" Defs.' Br., Ex. C, ECF No. 30-3.

At its core, the complaint alleges Defendants are constitutionally liable for employment-related actions that could just as well be imputed to a private employer.

However, the fact that the College is state-run is only a qualifier, it is not the institution's defining feature, and as a result, Walter's allegations do not rise to the level of \"uniquely governmental\" conduct.

Therefore, in a civil case, on a motion to dismiss, Walter's \"actual\" conduct for purposes of the Court's vagueness analysis is the conduct\n   <em>\n    as alleged in his complaint.\n   </em>\n   Accordingly, this Court accepts as true (i) that \"while sitting at his piano Walter began to wince and rub his neck, while verbalizing his pain and discomfort,\" (ii) that the student \"offered to use the same application of pressure points [she learned from her grandmother] to Walter's neck to provide relief,\" (iii) that the student then \"stood behind Walter and using the tips of her thumb and index fingers applied pressure to Walter's neck\" for approximately 30 seconds, (iv) that Walter asked the student to apply pressure once again at the end of the lesson \"for less than one minute,\" and (v) that as a result of this conduct, the College determined Walter violated the Policy on Sexual Misconduct and terminated him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   ii. Whether A Person of Ordinary Intelligence Would Have A Reasonable Opportunity to Know What Conduct the Policy Prohibits\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Walter states a plausible claim that a person of ordinary intelligence would not have a reasonable opportunity to understand that the College's Policy prohibits the voluntary and initially unsolicited application of therapeutic pressure to one's neck for less than a minute and that such conduct warrants termination. The cases cited by Defendants do not compel a contrary conclusion. Though the cases Defendants cite suggest schools enjoy wide latitude in fashioning disciplinary policies, at first blush rendering them virtually impenetrable to a vagueness challenge, these cases typically deal with the conduct of high school students, and the penalties are often some modest term of suspension. For example, in\n   <em>\n    Fraser\n   </em>\n   , a high school student was suspended for two days for violating the school's \"disruptive-conduct rule\" and making a sexually explicit speech during an assembly. The Supreme Court concluded that \"maintaining security and order in the schools requires a certain degree of flexibility in school disciplinary procedures\" and \"[g]iven the school's need to be able to impose disciplinary sanctions for a wide range of unanticipated conduct disruptive of the educational process, the school disciplinary rules need not be as detailed as a criminal code which imposes criminal sanctions.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211457\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/675/#p686\">\n    478 U.S. at 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211457\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/675/#p686\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On the one hand, there is a high school student (i) charged with violating a disciplinary policy prohibiting \"[c]onduct which materially and substantially interferes with the education process ... including the use of\n   <em>\n    obscene, profane\n   </em>\n   language and gestures\" (ii) by giving a speech referring to another student \"in terms of an\n   <em>\n    elaborate, graphic and explicit\n   </em>\n   sexual metaphor,\" (iii) who received a two-day suspension.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211457\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/675/#p686\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211457\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/675/#p686\">\n    . at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6211457\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/478/675/#p686\">\n    106 S.Ct. 3159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On the other hand, there is a professor of almost 10 years with an unblemished record (i) charged with violating a policy that prohibits \"unwelcome [physical] conduct of a sexual nature\" including \"inappropriate or unwelcome physical contact or suggestive body language\" (ii) for receiving a voluntary application of therapeutic neck pressure for less than one minute, (iii) who was terminated from his employment. As-applied vagueness challenges must be analyzed with respect to the specific conduct at issue, and thus the Court finds that the\n   deference conferred to the high school's disciplinary process in\n   <em>\n    Fraser\n   </em>\n   is not warranted here. At virtually every turn, the facts, policies and penalties are distinct between the two cases. Perhaps most significantly, Walter faced termination, not a two-day suspension. With a penalty that serious, even in the context of a school policy, greater clarity is necessary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Defendants also point to a single district court case in Colorado declining to find that a similar sexual misconduct policy was unconstitutionally vague.\n   <em>\n    Vanderhurst v.

The Policy prohibits unwelcome physical acts that are \"sexual\" in nature. A person of ordinary intelligence would plausibly be inclined to understand that where alleged conduct is undertaken for a medical or therapeutic purpose such conduct is decidedly not \"sexual\" in nature.

The Policy defines \"sexual activity,\" \"sexual harassment,\" \"sexual assault,\" \"sexual misconduct\" and \"sexual violence,\" but the Policy does not define the term \"sexual\" as a standalone term. Accordingly, the Title IX coordinator maintains discretion to imbue the term \"sexual\" with her own personal gloss, rather than some more objective, even if imperfect, standard. A sexual misconduct policy that leaves ambiguous whether physical touching for a medical or therapeutic purpose is, nevertheless, \"sexual,\" is a policy vulnerable to arbitrary enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Though the Court appreciates the need to craft statutes and policies with sufficient breadth so as not to \"convert the Constitution into an insuperable obstacle\" to school policymaking,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113626\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/61/#p65\">\n     id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3113626\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/486/61/#p65\">\n    . at 69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , without language appropriately cabining the term \"sexual,\" the scope and reach of the Policy is too nebulous and the Title IX coordinator's authority too unfettered. To be clear, there are circumstances in which whether or not conduct is \"sexual\" in nature cannot be disputed and indeed, the Policy's definition of \"sexual activity\" refers to some of this more explicit conduct. However, the gray areas, lacking an adequate definitional anchor, leave victims\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the accused most vulnerable to arbitrary and inconsistent enforcement, uncertain of when a school official may decide physical contact rises to the level of a Policy violation or should be dismissed as a mere \"misunderstanding.\" Given the facts pleaded in this complaint, a Policy on Sexual Misconduct without sufficient guidance on the word \"sexual\" as a standalone term leaves open the possibility that physical touching performed for a purported therapeutic purpose can result in termination without warning and thus encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement. Walter has pleaded facts sufficient to state a plausible claim that the Policy, as applied to the conduct alleged in the complaint, is vague because (i) it does not provide people of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to understand what conduct it prohibits and (ii) it authorizes or encourages arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <em>\n    c.

Walter cannot realistically be expected to develop an appropriate, albeit limited, response to charges of sexual misconduct that threaten his livelihood and professional standing at the precise moment he is finally notified of those charges.

Moreover, here, Walter faced termination whereas in\n   <em>\n    Zeyer\n   </em>\n   the Plaintiff faced a change in employment status, not outright termination.

A constitutionally appropriate limited opportunity to respond would provide Walter an explicit opportunity to supplement his responses following the meeting.

Indeed, allegations of sexual harassment must not be taken lightly and the Court does not quarrel with the College's well-intentioned efforts to enforce its Policy. But, even well-intentioned, aggressive enforcement must respect constitutional assurances of fairness and due process. Given the facts alleged in this case, and despite the limited process due in the public employment context and the flexibility typically afforded to school disciplinary policies, Walter has alleged plausible vagueness and pre-deprivation procedural due process claims and the case should proceed toward some appropriate resolution or a trial on the merits. Accordingly, Defendants' motion is granted with respect to Walter's substantive due process claim and denied with respect to Walter's vagueness and pre-deprivation procedural due process claims.
