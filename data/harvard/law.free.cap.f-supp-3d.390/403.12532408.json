The New York State Court of Appeals reviewed the [c]onstitutional implications of administrative searches in the landmark decision\n   <em>\n    People v. Keta\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   [which] held that in order to survive a constitutional\n   challenge, an administrative inspection program ... must be conducted pursuant to a comprehensive, systematic regulatory scheme. In addition, the type of business being inspected must [be] one that is closely regulated by the government, the government must have a substantial government interest in enforcing the administrative regulations, and, most importantly, any warrantless inspections must be necessary to further the objectives of the inspection program. The\n   <em>\n    Keta\n   </em>\n   court further stated that, administrative inspections should be designed to uncover administrative violations, not criminal activity....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   Thus, in order to [e]nsure that administrative searches of pawnbroker and second-hand dealer businesses conducted by this Department survive constitutional challenge, Department guidelines must [e]nsure that such searches are necessary to further the objective of enforcing the rules and regulations pertaining to such businesses. Members of the service may inspect the books and records of pawnbroker and second-hand dealer businesses, request to see required licenses, [and] demand to examine and seize stolen property. Such inspections should be conducted on a regular basis as part of an ongoing program to enforce licensing and record[-]keeping requirements.... Inspections or searches, conducted for the purpose of finding evidence of criminal activity must be conducted pursuant to a search warrant or exception to the search warrant requirement,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   [,] consent or plain view. In addition, when an administrative search of a pawnbroker or second-hand dealer's book or records indicates the presence [of] criminal activity, the premises should be secured and a search warrant obtained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   (Grasso Memo, Dkt. 45-2, at ECF\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   230 (emphasis omitted);\n   <em>\n    see also\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Code%20%C2%A7%2020-277\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at ECF 233-34 (enumerating eleven guidelines for police officers assigned to inspect pawnbroker and second-hand dealer businesses).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Facts\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. NYPD's Use of LeadsOnline\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   From 2010 to 2013, the NYPD provided pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers with two options as to the manner in which they could record and maintain required transactional information: (1) record the required information in log books provided by the NYPD; or (2) report and maintain the information electronically on LeadsOnline, the web-based electronic data transfer service engaged by the NYPD to serve as\n   the repository of electronic records. (Defendants' 56.1 Statement (\"Defs.' 56.1\"), Dkt. 44, \u00b6 19; Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 245-46; Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 319.) As the NYPD's \"Patrol Guide,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   promulgated on August 1, 2013 explains:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   All pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers are required to report on specified Department forms all articles pawned, purchased, or sold. Pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers participating in, and actively uploading transactions to, [LeadsOnline] are exempt from the requirement of manually filling out and preserving logs for inspection. By actively uploading their transactions on a daily basis, participating stores are allowing their records to be inspected via [LeadsOnline]. Stores are requested to upload the day's transactions by the close of business each day.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   (Patrol Guide, Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 241.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the passage of Local Law 149 in 2013, use of LeadsOnline became required for pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers. (\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-4, at ECF 351.) However, on October 10, 2014, the requirements established by Local Law 149 were temporarily suspended pending the outcome of litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 15, 2017, after the litigation had terminated, enforcement of Local Law 149 resumed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 321.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   When a pawnbroker or second-hand dealer uses LeadsOnline, the NYPD is able to review the required records and check recent items electronically without visiting the stores, and is also able to request \"holds\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   electronically. (Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6 21.) On the other hand, when a pawnbroker or second-hand dealer records the required information in log books instead of LeadsOnline, it is the NYPD's practice to periodically visit the premises to review the required records. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) The NYPD also visits the premises of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers not using LeadsOnline to investigate reported stolen property and, where necessary, request a hold on that property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Regardless of whether a pawnshop or second-hand dealer uses LeadsOnline, it is\n   the NYPD's practice to make unannounced visits to the premises of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers at random times.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   When asked at deposition what NYPD officers do in the course of these inspections, Sergeant Cecchini answered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   It depends, I would be given a list of tasks, you know, to see if [the pawnshops or second-hand dealers were] in accordance with the Leads[ ]Online books, if they, you know, mostly it's, you know, if they have the proper signage, if they are putting proper descriptions of items, serial numbers of phones, descriptive markings, if they're properly marking things, if they're taking pictures of the items and things of that nature are things we would inspect for....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   I, again, we had to look through an X amount of tickets per inspection and, again, we just tried to make sure that they were in accordance with the basic thing that would help us in solving crimes. We didn't really venture too far off into the, you know, obviously the admin guide from New York State and New York City for pawnbrokers is extensive, so we would try to keep our scope narrowly related to things that are, you know, applicable to, you know, crime victims and things of that nature....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   [W]e announced ourselves when we entered, there would be no, you know, we wouldn't give a phone call.

(Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6 37; Deposition of Linda Cabrera (\"Cabrera Dep.\"), Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 262, 265). Ms. Cabrera testified that, during the periods in which EZ Pawn was not using LeadsOnline, the number of NYPD visits to the Queens location increased to three or four per week. (Cabrera Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 265.) Meanwhile, Robert Santos, EZ Pawn regional manager, testified at deposition that he received calls from EZ Pawn store managers that led him to believe that \"as soon as [EZ Pawn] got off [LeadsOnline] it was just like, [the police] would come in more often, they would come in and try to intimidate the managers saying if you don't get this, if you don't get back [on] Leads[ ]Online, we're going to come back and arrest everyone.\" (Deposition of Robert Santos (\"Santos Dep.\"), Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 305, 307.) When asked about the questions local EZ Pawn managers asked him regarding these interactions with police, Mr. Santos explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   The questions would be more of like a frantic call like, what do I do, this guy, he's threatening to arrest me if I don't get back on Leads[ ]Online or if you don't show him something.

Because there remained an active warrant for Plaintiff Onwuakor's arrest (Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 47-3, at ECF 521-22), Bulzomi arrested Onwuakor on charges of \"improper pawnbroking record\" in violation of GBL \u00a7 43 and \"usurious loan by pawnbroker\" in violation of GBL \u00a7 46 (Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl.,\n   Dkt. 45-3, ECF 278-81; Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 317). Bulzomi stated at deposition that had there not been an arrest warrant for Onwuakor, he would have merely issued Onwuakor summonses for the GBL violations, rather than arrest him. (Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 47-3, at ECF 521-22.)

(Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 56-71.)

Rather, we conclude that, as in other situations of special need, where the privacy interests of the owners are weakened and the government interests in regulating particular business are concomitantly heightened, a warrantless inspection of commercial premises may well be reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-86\">\n   The warrantless inspection, however, even in the context of a pervasively regulated business, will be deemed to be reasonable only so long as three criteria are met. First, there must be a substantial government interest that informs the regulatory scheme pursuant to which the inspection is made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   Second, the warrantless inspections must be necessary to further the regulatory scheme....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   Finally, the statute's inspection program, in terms of the certainty and regularity of its application, must provide a constitutionally adequate substitute for a warrant. In other words, the regulatory statute must perform the two basic functions of a warrant: it must advise the owner of the commercial premises that the search is being made pursuant to the law and has a properly defined scope, and it must limit the discretion of the inspecting officers. To perform this first function, the statute must be sufficiently comprehensive and defined that the owner of commercial property cannot help but be aware that his property will be subject to periodic inspections undertaken for specific purposes. In addition, in defining how a statute limits the discretion of the inspectors, we have observed that it must be carefully limited in time, place, and scope.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   482 U.S. at 702-03,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6219117\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/482/691/\">\n    107 S.Ct. 2636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quotations and citations omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For the purposes of this Order, the Court assumes that pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers are closely regulated industries.

For example, the Grasso Memo instructs NYPD officers to refrain from selecting a \"business for inspection solely because there exists some suspicion that the business is engaged in criminal activity or solely for the purpose of enforcing the criminal law.\" (Grasso Memo, Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 233.) Moreover, the Grasso Memo instructs NYPD officers that administrative inspections of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers should \"be conducted on a regular basis as part of an ongoing program to enforce licensing and record keeping requirements.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 230.) Indeed, the Grasso Memo's explicit purpose is to ensure that inspections of pawnshops and second-hand dealers do not violate the New York and United States Constitutions. (\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   (\"[I]n order to [e]nsure that administrative searches of pawnbroker and second-hand dealer businesses conducted by this Department survive constitutional challenge, Department guidelines must [e]nsure that such searches are necessary to further the objective of enforcing the rules and regulations pertaining to such businesses.\").)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   However, at the summary judgment stage, the mere existence of the Grasso Memo does not provide a sufficient basis for finding in Defendants' favor. EZ Pawn has presented ample evidence to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether or not the Grasso Memo effectively circumscribed the discretion of NYPD officers' searches of EZ Pawn premises such that the regulatory regime to which EZ Pawn was subjected constituted an adequate substitute for a search warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Weinstock v.

Specifically, Plaintiffs have presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether or not the foregoing statutory and regulatory regime subjected EZ Pawn to unreasonable searches in the form of NYPD visits. Evidence adduced in discovery shows that the NYPD often made unannounced visits to EZ Pawn stores at random times. (Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 47-3, at ECF 493; Cecchini Dep., Dkt. 47-4, at ECF 592.) Ms. Cabrera testified that, during the time periods from 2009 to 2015 in which EZ Pawn was using LeadsOnline, NYPD officers came to the Queens location twice a week, and during the time periods in which EZ Pawn was not using LeadsOnline, the NYPD visits to the Queens location increased to three or four per week. (Cabrera Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 265.) Mr. Santos, regional manager of multiple EZ Pawn stores, testified that local managers like Ms. Cabrera contacted him regarding NYPD visits eight to ten times a week during the time periods in which EZ Pawn was not using LeadsOnline. (Santos Dep., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 308.) And Plaintiff Onwuakor testified that the\n   Brooklyn location received visits from NYPD officers approximately once every three weeks in 2015. (Defs.' 56.1, \u00b6 38; Onwuakor Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 273.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   During the course of these recurring, randomly timed, and unannounced visits, NYPD officers checked to confirm that the EZ Pawn store at issue had \"the proper signage, ... proper descriptions of items, [and] serial numbers of phones,\" and would check to ensure that the store was \"properly marking things, [that] they [were] taking pictures of the items and things of that nature.\" (Cecchini Dep., Dkt. 47-4, at ECF 589.) Deposition testimony indicates that harassing comments and threats of arrest frequently accompanied these visits. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Kaminsky Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 218; Santos Dep., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 307.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Accordingly, on the record before the Court, Plaintiff EZ Pawn has sufficiently demonstrated a Fourth Amendment violation based on NYPD visits to its stores to defend against Defendants' summary judgment motion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Los Angeles v.

An individual's interest in property includes \"not only the right to actual possession of a thing, but also the right to exclude others from possessing it, the right to use it and receive income from its use, the right to transmit it to another, and the right to sell, alienate, waste, or even destroy it.\"\n   <em>\n    Almeida v.

(Defs.' Br., Dkt. 46, at ECF 405.) According to Defendants, because the property at issue in this case \"was relinquished by an EZ Pawn customer in a pawn or sale transaction,\" EZ Pawn had no reasonable expectation of privacy in the items seized. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Court disagrees. \"[T]he pawnbroker, as pledgee, has a legitimate possessory interest in [its] property as against the rest of the world except the person having title to the property.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   <em>\n    G &amp; G Jewelry, Inc. v.

And because there is no evidence that EZ Pawn \"voluntarily abandon[ed] property\" to the NYPD, the Court cannot conclude that EZ Pawn \"forfeit[ed] any reasonable expectation of privacy that [it] might have had in\" the pledged items it received from customers.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

(Defs.' Br., Dkt. 46, at ECF 405.) This is incorrect. Plaintiffs presented the following evidence in discovery. Mr. Kaminsky indicated, via sworn affidavit, that during the events at issue in this case, EZ Pawn \"often got many [ ] notices from the police department with demands to 'Hold' or directives for Police Confiscation.\" (Pls.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 47-1, at ECF 425.) In deposition, Mr. Kaminsky explained that one of these holds was placed on a Rolex watch. (Kaminsky Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 218.) Additionally, Ms. Cabrera estimated in deposition that she had been asked to place a hold on items at the Queens location about six times since 2013. (Cabrera Dep., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 262, 264.) Moreover, there exists in the record an electronic summary of EZ Pawn holds and confiscations that were implemented by the NYPD from 2014 through 2015. (Ex. I, Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-2, at ECF 252-57.) Indeed, this summary comes from the NYPD's\n   <em>\n    own\n   </em>\n   records. The summary enumerates the many holds and confiscations-collectively in excess of thirty-that the NYPD placed on items in EZ Pawn stores in 2014 and 2015, and provides the specific dates on which these holds and confiscations were implemented. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This evidence suffices to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the NYPD's holds on and removal of various items from EZ Pawn stores constituted unreasonable seizures under the Fourth Amendment. Defendants note that the NYPD summary is \"devoid of information about the circumstances in which the holds were placed or items were seized from EZ Pawn stores,\" and \"the information on the only seizure identified by EZ Pawn was limited to identifying the item as a Rolex watch belonging to a customer and that it was wrongly seized.\" (Defs.' Reply Mem. of Law in Further Supp. of Summ. J., Dkt. 52, at ECF 1514.) It is true that a party opposing summary judgment \"may not rely on mere conclusory allegations nor speculation, but instead must offer some hard evidence showing that its version of the events is not wholly fanciful.\"\n   <em>\n    Golden Pac.

But the conclusory assertions made by Plaintiffs that Defendants insist the Court reject are\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   conclusions, not legal ones. And because Plaintiffs have referenced admissible evidence in support of their factual conclusions-including,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , deposition testimony from EZ Pawn employees and the NYPD's own summary of holds on and confiscations of EZ Pawn merchandise-the Court rejects Defendants' argument that Plaintiffs' evidence is insufficient at the summary judgment stage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    NetJets Aviation, Inc. v.

Defendants argue that they are entitled to summary judgment on this claim because it \"rests on conduct that does not violate the Constitution and the differing treatment was based on a material distinguishing factor, the use or non-use of LeadsOnline.\" (Defs.'

To demonstrate an official policy or custom, a plaintiff must show \"the existence of a formal policy which is officially endorsed by the municipality,\" or a practice that is \"so persistent and widespread that it constitutes a custom or usage of which supervisory authorities must have been aware, or that a municipal custom, policy, or usage can be inferred from the evidence of deliberate indifference of supervisory officials as to such abuses.\"\n   <em>\n    Iacovangelo v.

Defendants argue that the \"conclusory allegations as to the placement of holds [ ] and removal of collateral items [ ] do not support the existence of a policy or practice\" because \"the number of holds and removals was only\" six in four years at the Queens location or fewer than two per year \"and, thus, not sufficient to support an improper policy or practice.\" (Defs.' Br., Dkt. 46, at ECF 406.) But, as discussed\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , the use of holds and the confiscation of property are not the only grounds for EZ Pawn's Fourth Amendment claim, and there exists sufficient evidence in the record that NYPD officers engaged in warrantless searches and seizures of pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers with regularity, so as to create a\n   triable issue of fact regarding the NYPD's violation of EZ Pawn's Fourth Amendment rights. New York City Charter \u00a7 436 empowers NYPD officers to inspect pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers as irregularly or inconsistently as they choose, and punishes refusal to comply with an inspection with \"thirty days' imprisonment, or by a fine of not more than fifty dollars, or both.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20City%20Charter%20%C2%A7%20436\">\n    N.Y.

(Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 47-3, at ECF 493; Cecchini Dep., Dkt. 47-4, at ECF 592.) Additionally, EZ Pawn has submitted evidence from other pawnbrokers and second-hand dealers in New York City who attest that they were subjected to warrantless holds on, and removal of, merchandise by members of the NYPD. (Pls.'

The Court concludes that the evidence shows that these warrantless searches and seizures by the NYPD were sufficiently \"persistent or widespread as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law\" to enable EZ Pawn's\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claim to withstand summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Patterson v.

(Compl., \u00b6\u00b6 91-99.) \"In order to prevail on a \u00a7 1983 claim against a state actor for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must show a violation of [his] rights under the Fourth Amendment, and must establish the elements of a malicious prosecution claim under state law.\"\n   <em>\n    Manganiello v.

Because Onwuakor has failed to create a triable issue of fact with respect to the malice element-a requirement of both federal and state malicious prosecution-the Court grants summary judgment to Bulzomi on these claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The relevant facts underlying Onwuakor's malicious prosecution claims are as follows. On July 10, 2015, Bulzomi arrested Onwuakor on misdemeanor charges\n   of \"improper pawnbroking record\" in violation of GBL \u00a7 43 and \"usurious loan by pawnbroker\" in violation of GBL \u00a7 46. (Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-3, ECF 278-81, 290; Bulzomi Dep., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 317). At arraignment, Onwuakor was offered a violation and time served for both GBL charges. (Defs.' Aff. &amp; Decl., Dkt. 45-3, at ECF 286.) After declining the offer, Onwuakor was released on his own recognizance. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On November 19, 2015, Onwuakor's case was dismissed pursuant to New York Criminal Procedure Law \u00a7 170.30, all charges against him were dropped, and all related records were sealed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at ECF 297, 300.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Even accepting Plaintiff Onwuakor's version of the facts, there is insufficient evidence in the record to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Defendant Bulzomi possessed the requisite level of malice to sustain a malicious prosecution claim. A plaintiff asserting a malicious prosecution claim must show that the defendant acted out of \"a wrong or improper motive, something other than a desire to see the ends of justice served.\"\n   <em>\n    Fulton v.
