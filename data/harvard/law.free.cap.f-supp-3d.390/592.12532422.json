Hartnett, Elizabeth M. Galaska, Robert G. Brough, Jr., and John M. Cress, Pennsylvania public school teachers, (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") initiated this action by filing a complaint (Doc. No. 1)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   against their respective school district employers Homer-Center School District, Twin Valley School District, and Ellwood City School District (the \"School District Defendants\"), as well as the superintendents of those school districts, and the following collective bargaining entities: Homer-Center Education Association (\"H-CEA\"), Twin Valley Education Association (\"TVEA\"), Ellwood City Education Association (\"ECEA\"), and the Pennsylvania State Education Association (\"PSEA\") (collectively, the \"Union Defendants\"), alleging violations of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights as a result of the compulsory collection of union fees (or so-called \"fair share\" fees), from nonmember public school teachers pursuant to the Pennsylvania statutory framework permitting the collection of those fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiffs' amended complaint seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, nominal damages, and an award of attorneys' fees. (Doc. No. 23 \u00b6 80.) Currently pending before the Court are the parties' cross-motions: the Union Defendants'\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Motion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 64), and Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 63). For the reasons that follow, the Union Defendants' Motion to Dismiss will be granted, and Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment will be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   As noted above, through this litigation, Plaintiffs challenge the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's statutory framework governing the compulsory collection of \"fair share\" union fees from nonmember public school teachers on its face and as applied, maintaining that such fees are a violation of their First Amendment rights. (Doc. No.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   23.) The Union Defendants' initial defense to this litigation centered on the United States Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Abood v. Detroit Board of Education\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    431 U.S. 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1929\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/209/\">\n    52 L.Ed.2d 261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1977), which upheld the constitutionality of \"fair share\" statutory provisions under a public sector labor contract. In recent years, several lawsuits, including the instant case, were filed around the country for the purpose of obtaining Supreme Court review in an effort to overrule\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   and to declare \"fair share\" fees in the public sector unconstitutional. During the pendency of this litigation, the United States Supreme Court granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    Janus v. AFSCME Council 31\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S. Ct. 2448\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    201 L.Ed.2d 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2018), which presented the question of whether\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   should be overruled and public sector \"fair share\" fee arrangements declared unconstitutional. Specifically,\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   involved an Illinois public employee's challenge to compulsory \"fair share\" fees charged to non-union members pursuant to Illinois law as violative of his First Amendment rights. Recognizing the significance of the Supreme Court's eventual ruling in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   to this litigation - that it was \"nearly certain to impact and control the disposition of this matter\" - the parties filed a joint motion seeking a stay of these proceedings until the resolution of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. No. 55.) The Court granted the motion, staying these proceedings until the Supreme Court's final disposition of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   . (Doc. No. 56.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 27, 2018, the Supreme Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , overruling\n   <em>\n    Abood\n   </em>\n   by a vote of 5-4 and holding that \"[s]tates and public-sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12613066\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/138/2448/\">\n    138 S. Ct. at 2459\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Shortly thereafter, the Court held a status telephone conference with the parties regarding the impact of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   on the disposition of this case. (Doc. No. 59.) At that time, the Union Defendants expressed their position that, because of their stated compliance with\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   by ceasing all collection of \"fair share\" fees from nonmembers (including all four Plaintiffs) and returning any such fees collected after the date of the Supreme Court's decision, this litigation has been rendered moot. Plaintiffs, on the other hand, maintained that they continue to seek declaratory and injunctive relief from this Court in the form of a finding that Pennsylvania's \"fair share\" statutory scheme is unconstitutional in light of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the Court issued a scheduling Order setting dates for the cross-filing and briefing of the parties' respective dispositive motions regarding the appropriate resolution of this litigation. (Doc. No. 60.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Thereafter, on September 14, 2018, Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Summary Judgment seeking a declaration from this Court that the relevant provisions of Pennsylvania law, as well as the actual \"fair share\" fee provisions in the respective collective bargaining agreements (\"CBAs\") applicable to Plaintiffs, are an unconstitutional violation of Plaintiffs' First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and, therefore, null and void, as well as injunctive relief requiring the Union Defendants to remove the \"fair share\" fee provisions in the CBAs governing Plaintiffs' respective bargaining units, and prohibiting the inclusion of any such provisions in any subsequent CBAs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. No. 63 at 4.) Plaintiffs also filed a Statement of Facts supporting their Motion for Summary Judgment (Doc. No. 65), and a brief in support of their\n   motion (Doc. No. 66). The Union Defendants subsequently filed a brief in opposition to Plaintiffs' motion (Doc. No. 69), as well as an Answer to Statement of Facts (Doc. No. 68). Plaintiffs filed their brief in reply, rendering the motion ripe for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the same time, the Union Defendants filed their Motion to Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction, or in the alternative, for Summary Judgment. (Doc. No. 64.) In their motion, the Union Defendants argue that in light of the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision and the measures taken by the Union Defendants to comply with that decision, Plaintiffs can no longer obtain meaningful relief from this Court, and Plaintiffs' claims are moot and subject to dismissal pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6.) The Union Defendants filed a Statement of Material Facts in Support of their Motion (Doc. No. 64-1), as well as a brief in support (Doc. No. 67). Plaintiffs filed a brief in opposition to the Union Defendants' motion (Doc. No. 71), as well as an Answer to Statement of Facts (Doc. No. 70). The Union Defendants subsequently filed their reply brief, rendering the motion ripe for disposition.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(Doc. No. 67 at 14-15.) In support of their position, the Union Defendants point to a post-\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision in\n   <em>\n    Danielson v.

Defendants further note that they can collect \"fair share\" union fees from nonmembers only with the assistance of school district employers in deducting those fees from nonmember paychecks and remitting them to the relevant Union Defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.) Defendants argue that given that: (1) such deductions are now unlawful under\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   ; (2) governmental agencies are presumed to follow the law; and (3) the Union Defendants have submitted evidence demonstrating that Plaintiffs' employers have followed the law, ceasing deduction of \"fair share\" fees from nonmembers and attesting to their intent to fully comply with\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , there is no reasonable expectation that \"fair share\" fees will be deducted\n   from Plaintiffs' paychecks in the future. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, in sum, the Union Defendants argue that \"[i]t has become 'absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur,' \" and therefore, there is no meaningful relief that can be provided by this Court, mooting Plaintiffs' requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.

No. 71 at 10.) Second, Plaintiffs argue that this case is not moot because no court has applied\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   to Pennsylvania law, analogizing the instant case (and the obligations of a district court in the aftermath of a relevant Supreme Court decision) to two other high-profile Supreme Court decisions -\n   <em>\n    Citizens United v.

(Doc. No. 71 at 13-14.) The Eighth Circuit found that Nebraska's \"assurances of compliance with\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   do not moot the case\" under the standard articulated in\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   , instead finding that those assurances from the state may impact the necessity of continued injunctive relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4331484\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/798/682/\">\n    798 F.3d at 685-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Plaintiffs analogize the relief they seek from this Court - a declaration that 71 P.S. \u00a7 575(a) - (i) (Pennsylvania's Public Employee Fair Share Fee Law) and the \"fair share\" fee provisions in Plaintiffs' respective CBAs are invalid, and the issuance of injunctive relief expunging \"fair share\" fee provisions from the relevant CBAs - to that granted by this court after the Supreme Court decision in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   in\n   <em>\n    General Majority PAC v.

Plaintiffs maintain that after the Supreme Court held in\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   that a federal ban on corporate or union-funded independent political speech violated the First Amendment, a number of lower courts struck down similar state bans pursuant to that decision. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13, 16-17.) Plaintiffs argue that in\n   <em>\n    Aichele\n   </em>\n   , despite the fact that the government defendant conceded the unconstitutionality of Pennsylvania's statute, the court still entered a permanent injunction against the enforcement of Pennsylvania's statute. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Finally, Plaintiffs maintain that this case is not moot because the Union Defendants' \"voluntary change\" in policy fails to meet their burden to demonstrate that there is no reasonable expectation that the wrongful\n   behavior will recur. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-21.) Plaintiffs note that the Third Circuit has described the burden to demonstrate mootness as a \"formidable\" one, and argue that it is not met by the Union Defendants' statement of intent not to resume illegal activity, pointing to what it describes as the potential for PSEA to \"press [its] authority under state law like it has done before,\" and the fact that only one of the three local union affiliate Defendants has executed a Memorandum of Understanding removing the \"fair share\" fee provision from the relevant CBA, which Plaintiffs argue \"raises questions as to why those two local defendants are resistant to the expungement of the forced fee provision.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19-20.) In addition, Plaintiffs maintain that to the extent that the policy articulated by the PSEA as to the cessation of any attempts to collect \"fair share\" union fees from nonmembers in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   provides assurance against the recurrence of the illegal behavior, such assurance does not moot the need for a declaration as to the constitutionality of Pennsylvania law, but instead impacts the scope of potential injunctive relief, again citing\n   <em>\n    Waters\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aichele\n   </em>\n   regarding the aftermath of the Supreme Court's decisions in\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   . (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In their brief in reply, the Union Defendants maintain that the operative point as to mootness - overlooked by Plaintiffs in pressing for a ruling of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   's impact on Pennsylvania law - is that \"because of a significant change in circumstances prompted by\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   , Plaintiffs no longer face the kind of imminent threat of harm necessary to support standing for claims of injunctive and declaratory relief.\" (Doc. No. 72 at 6.) The Union Defendants maintain that the ruling of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   - that \"States and public sector unions may no longer extract agency fees from nonconsenting employees\" - \"leaves no room for uncertainty.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, the Union Defendants argue that the undisputed facts regarding their actions in the wake of\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   attest to the fact that they recognize their responsibility to abide by its holding. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Along these lines, the Union Defendants point out that on October 17, 2018, Defendant EAEA executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Ellwood Area School District recognizing that\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   rendered the fair share fee provision of their CBA unenforceable, confirming that the school district will no longer deduct \"fair share\" union fees from non-member paychecks, and removing the unenforceable provision from their CBA. (Doc. No. 72, Addendum at 16.) The Union Defendants also point to guidance issued by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's Attorney General and Department of Labor and Industry to all public sector employers confirming that they must stop collecting \"fair share\" fees from non-union employees\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   as additional support for the fact that there is no reasonable chance that the deduction of \"fair share\" fees from the Plaintiffs' paychecks will recur. (Doc. No. 72 at 7-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Plaintiffs' Claims for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief are Moot\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Upon careful consideration of the arguments of the parties, the materials submitted in connection with the Union\n   Defendants' motion, and the relevant authorities, the Court is persuaded that Plaintiffs' remaining claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot. The change in circumstances that has occurred here as to these Plaintiffs in the wake of the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision, specifically consisting of: (1) the PSEA's immediate steps to cease collection of \"fair share\" union fees from all non-members of its local union affiliates (including the four Plaintiffs) and to refund any \"fair share\" fees collected after the date of the\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   decision; (2) the declarations of the superintendents of each school district employing Plaintiffs stating that those districts have ceased deduction of \"fair share\" fees and will not resume such deductions in the future; (3) the declarations from the respective Presidents of Defendants H-CEA, TVEA, and EAEA representing that the \"fair share\" fee provisions in their CBAs are not valid or enforceable, and that they will not seek to collect further \"fair share\" fees; and (4) the Memoranda of Understanding entered into between the Homer-Center School District and the H-CEA and Ellwood Area School District and the EAEA, formally removing the unenforceable provisions from their CBAs,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   demonstrate that it has become \"absolutely clear that the allegedly wrongful behavior could not reasonably be expected to recur.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Friends of the Earth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    528 U.S. at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9476232\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/528/167/#p189\">\n    120 S.Ct. 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In light of the changed circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiffs face no realistic possibility that they will be subject to the unlawful collection of \"fair share\" fees, and, therefore, Plaintiffs' claims for declaratory and injunctive relief are moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In addition, the Court finds Plaintiffs' analogies to\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   to be inapposite. As to\n   <em>\n    Obergefell\n   </em>\n   , the Union Defendants distinguish the statutes at issue in the post-Obergefell cases as self-enforcing legislative mandates banning the recognition of same-sex marriage or the extension of marital privileges to same-sex couples, while pointing out that the Pennsylvania statute challenged by Plaintiffs here is not self-enforcing, but instead permits the deduction of \"fair share\" fees in the event that the union would \"provide the public employer with the name of the nonmember who is obligated to pay a fair-share fee,\" as well as the amount of the fee. (Doc. No. 72 at 12) (citing 71 P.S. \u00a7 575(c) ). Accordingly, the Union Defendants maintain that as they have confirmed that no such information is being provided or will be provided by the unions to the Plaintiffs' school district employers, the \"fair share\" fee statute can have no impact on Plaintiffs. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) As to the post-\n   <em>\n    Citizens United\n   </em>\n   cases, the Union Defendants note that in virtually all of the cases, a live controversy existed because the government defendants did not concede that the challenged state laws were unconstitutional. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12-13.) The fact that the court in\n   <em>\n    Aichele\n   </em>\n   found that a live dispute existed over the scope of the remedy for a violation where the state government conceded the unconstitutionality of the statute does not change the Court's conclusion here as to the mootness of Plaintiffs' claims, especially where the question of mootness was not presented to the court in\n   <em>\n    Aichele\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Court addresses one final issue raised by Plaintiffs. In their supplemental filings submitted after the completion of briefing on the pending motions, Plaintiffs have identified several post-\n   <em>\n    Janus\n   </em>\n   CBAs entered into between certain Pennsylvania school districts and their local union affiliates containing \"fair share\" fee provisions, in an apparent effort to substantiate their claims that the Union Defendants here may resume unlawful deduction of \"fair share\" fees from the Plaintiffs in this case. (Doc. Nos. 79, 81, 85-89.) However, as surprising as those submissions may be, in light of the fact that none of them involves any of the three school district employers of Plaintiffs, or their respective local union affiliates who are defendants in this litigation, they are irrelevant to the issue as to whether\n   <em>\n    these\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Plaintiffs'\n   </em>\n   claims have been rendered moot. Absent some reason to doubt that the representations of the school district officials are genuine, the Court will not question the validity of those representations based on language in CBAs applicable to other school districts and other local union affiliates who are not parties to this litigation.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Flanigan's Enter., Inc. v.
