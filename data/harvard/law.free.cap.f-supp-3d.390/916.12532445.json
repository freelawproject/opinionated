It also created VIX-related products, including futures and options, that allow investors to trade on their predictions of the market's volatility. Plaintiffs bought and sold VIX-related products on Cboe's exchanges and now argue that Cboe designed the VIX enterprise in a way that allowed anonymous traders to manipulate the market for their own benefit. Cboe knew about this manipulation of its most profitable venture, plaintiffs assert, and chose not to stop it, prioritizing its own profits over its duty to maintain a fair market. Plaintiffs allege that they lost money as a result and bring\n   Securities Exchange Act and Commodities Exchange Act claims against Cboe, as well as a negligence claim. Plaintiffs bring similar claims against unknown Doe Defendants and allege that the Does violated the Sherman Act through their manipulative trading. Cboe moves to dismiss all claims plaintiffs bring against it, and for the reasons discussed below, the motion is granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

An Overview of the VIX\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Defendant Cboe Global Markets, Inc. was a publicly traded holding company of, among other entities, defendants Cboe Futures Exchange, LLC and Cboe Exchange, Inc.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 26. The S&amp;P 500 index, known as the SPX, was a weighted index of 500 U.S. stocks from different industries and widely regarded as the leading benchmark of the overall U.S. stock market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. Cboe was the exclusive provider of options on the SPX, offering a range of SPX Options, including those with morning and afternoon settlements, weekly options, end-of-month options, and mini SPX options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 43-44. An option contract gives the buyer the right-but not the obligation-either to buy (a call option) or sell (a put option) a commodity or financial instrument at some specified time, at an\n   agreed price-the strike price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 35. A contract that involves a promise to buy or sell at a certain price on a fixed date is a futures contract.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 40. Whether the owner of an option exercises it usually turns on whether the option is in the money or out of the money.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37. An option is in the money if the owner would be entitled to payment if she chose to exercise it; an out-of-the-money option is one where the owner would not get a payment if exercised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 37-38. A substantial portion of Cboe's trading volume and transaction fees came from SPX Options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 44.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Cboe created its own index (called the VIX), to measure the expected volatility of the S&amp;P 500.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. The VIX Index was meant to provide an instantaneous measure of how much the market thought the S&amp;P 500 would fluctuate over 30 days.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. The VIX was determined by referencing the prices of SPX Options because the prevailing quotation levels of SPX Options indicated the market's expectations of future stock price volatility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Initially, the VIX was only a benchmark figure; there was no way for investors to take a position in it.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. But in 2004, Cboe created VIX Futures, and two years later it created VIX Options, to allow participants to make investments based on market volatility.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . The VIX quickly became Cboe's most profitable venture, and today it is widely known as the U.S. stock market's \"fear gauge.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 1, 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Because the VIX was a financial index, not a physical good, all VIX Options and Futures were cash-settled.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5. When VIX Options or Futures expired, Cboe made a series of calculations to determine who owed whom money and how much.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cboe calculated the VIX using only standard SPX Options (which expired on the third Friday of each month) and weekly SPX Options (which expired on all other Fridays) that Cboe listed for trading.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 49. Only SPX Options with more than 23 days and fewer than 37 days to expiration were used in the calculation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Those options were then weighted to yield a constant, 30-day measure of expected volatility of the S&amp;P 500 Index.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The VIX was calculated every 15 seconds throughout the trading day and was based on bid and ask premiums at various strike prices for different SPX Options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 51. To determine which SPX Options to use, the calculation process began with the strike price closest to the prevailing at-the-money value and moved in both out-of-the-money directions until it reached two zero-bid strike prices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The two-zero bid rule ensured that the SPX put and call options used to determine the value of the VIX were drawn from those for which there had not been two or more zero bids in a row, as illustrated below:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-17\">included in VIX included in VIX Put Strike Bid Premium Ask Premium calculation?

Before 2003, the VIX was calculated based on a small range of strike prices for puts and calls of options on the\n   S&amp;P 100, clustered around an at-the-money price.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54 n. 12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Investors could only exercise VIX Options at expiration, which since mid-2005 occurred every Wednesday (before 2005 expirations were monthly).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 55. VIX Futures were also cash-settled at expiry, through the same process-the SOQ process-as VIX Options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   That process was similar, but not identical, to the process used to calculate the VIX itself.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cboe conducted the SOQ settlement process using a Hybrid Opening System, which found a single clearing price that maximized the number of contracts that could be traded within the SOQ price range.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 56. Before September 2007, Cboe employed an Order Book Official who worked with market makers through the SOQ process.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 57. As Cboe prepared to take itself public, it shifted toward automation and removed that position.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Cboe officials received warnings that this would expose the SOQ process to the risk that unreasonable orders that did not reflect prevailing market conditions would influence the calculation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   A lot of control over the bidding and trading process for SPX Options was vested in Cboe-appointed Lead Market Makers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. Cboe required Lead Market Makers to \"provide continuous electronic quotes\" in certain situations.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 58. All market makers could participate in the SOQ, but Lead Market Makers were obligated to enter opening quotes for SPX Options if no one else did.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60. Cboe initially designated two Lead Market Makers for SPX Options, and by 2014 it designated three Lead Market Makers for both SPX Options and VIX Options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 59. Cboe kept the identities of these Lead Market Makers confidential.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 61. Lead Market Makers (and Designated Primary Market Makers for weekly SPX Options) could participate in the SOQ with both orders and non-binding quotes; all other market participants could participate only through orders, which are binding offers.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 61-62. Certain market makers were given steep discounts for quoting out-of-the-money SPX Options.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 60 n. 14. When there was no opening trade for SPX Options during the settlement window for VIX Options and Futures, and thus no price to incorporate, the opening price was the average of an SPX Option's bid and ask price determined at the open at 8:30 a.m.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 63. Cboe then executed the SPX Options orders at market-clearing prices and removed remaining unexecuted orders.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The auction clearing prices for SPX Options expiring in exactly 30 days were then used as part of the calculations to settle VIX Options and VIX Futures expiring that calculation day.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Shortly after Cboe created VIX Options, it also created a new set of products which allowed investors to buy shares (ETFs) and notes (ETNs), the value of which was directly linked to the value of the VIX or related products.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 64. They traded on a national securities exchange like a security.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Cboe long promoted VIX Options and Futures as effective investments.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66, 68. Cboe's website encouraged investors to use VIX Options and Futures to \"seek diversification, hedge or capitalize on volatility or efficiently generate income.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 66-67. It advertised the VIX as \"a leading measure of market expectations of near-term volatility\" and stressed that the \"addition of weekly expirations ... offers volatility exposures that more precisely track the performance of the VIX Index.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 69. In 2007, Cboe launched a branding campaign to \"communicat[e] to the world that CBOE is a vital necessity in the options marketplace for which there is no substitute.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 71. In 2012, Cboe advertised that VIX Options provided investors\n   \"targeted trading strategies around market news and events.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Vulnerability to manipulation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Some people have criticized the settlement process for the VIX Options and Futures as being ripe for manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. Plaintiffs allege that the Doe Defendants took advantage of this vulnerability and routinely manipulated the cash-settlement values for VIX Options and Futures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 73. Certain features of the settlement process made it especially susceptible to manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74. For example, the settlement process depended on the value of thinly traded, illiquid financial instruments-out-of-the-money SPX Options-which traded in far lower volumes than VIX Options and Futures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 76. This allowed Does to make a small number of out-of-the-money SPX Options trades and have a disproportionate impact on the settlement values of the VIX Options and Futures.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 77. Though it took place in the morning, this strategy is similar to what's commonly referred to as \"banging the close.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The ability to manipulate the market was amplified by the fact that manipulators only needed to move the market for a very short period to have an effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 78. Cboe began publishing information at 7:30 a.m. and required all strategy orders for SPX Options to be made within fifty minutes, meaning the manipulators only needed to move the market shortly before 8:20 a.m. to have an effect.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The infrequency of VIX settlements further exacerbated the problem.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Had Cboe made the SOQ settlement window longer, during normal market hours, or more frequent, it would have been more difficult for manipulators to affect the market.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, manipulators were able to exploit the two-zero bid rule by spreading bids out across strike prices to ensure there were never two or more consecutive zero-bid puts ahead of any strike prices the manipulators wanted the SOQ process to include.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 82. Cboe's formula further magnified the effect of the manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-87. In May 2017, two professors published a research paper, detailing patterns that were consistent with manipulation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Cboe's Rules\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As a board of trade, Cboe was required to establish rules to prevent abusive trade practices.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 143. Cboe's Rule 8.7 required market makers to \"contribute to the maintenance of a fair and orderly market\" and not \"enter into transactions or make bids or offers that are inconsistent with such a course of dealings.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 144. Cboe also required that trading-permit holders not\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   effect or induce the purchase, sale or exercise of any security for the purpose of creating or inducing a false, misleading, or artificial appearance of activity ... or for the purpose of unduly or improperly influencing the market price of such security ... or for the purpose of making a price which does not reflect the true state of the market.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Cboe's Rule 601 further prohibited manipulation by providing,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [n]either a Trading Privilege Holder nor any of its Related Parties shall engage or attempt to engage in any fraudulent act or engage or attempt to engage in any scheme to defraud, deceive or trick, in connection with or related to any trade on or other activity related to the Exchange or Clearing Corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . And Rule 603 stated,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   [a]ny manipulation of the market in any Contract is prohibited. Orders entered into the CFE System for the purpose of generating unnecessary volatility or creating a condition in which prices do not\n   or will not reflect fair market values are prohibited and any Trading Privilege Holder (including its respective Related Parties) who makes or assists in entering any such Order with knowledge of the purpose thereof or who, with such knowledge, in any way assists in carrying out any plan or scheme for the entering of any such Order, shall be deemed to have engaged in an act detrimental to the Exchange.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   These rules signaled to investors that the VIX was safe and show, plaintiffs allege, that Cboe must have known about, or recklessly disregarded, the Doe Defendants' manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Cboe moves to dismiss all of plaintiffs' claims against it. Cboe argues plaintiffs' Securities Exchange Act claim is precluded, that Cboe's status as a self-regulatory organization entitles it to immunity, and that plaintiffs have otherwise failed to allege the requisite elements of a claim, including loss causation and scienter. Cboe argues plaintiffs' Commodities Exchange Act claim fails because it is too general and because plaintiffs have failed to plausibly allege actual damages and bad faith. For similar reasons, Cboe asserts, plaintiffs have failed to plead a claim for secondary Commodities Act liability. Finally, Cboe argues plaintiffs' negligence claim is preempted or otherwise inadequate.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Like the FDCA (which gives the government nearly exclusive enforcement authority) and the Lanham Act (which relies on injured competitors to file lawsuits), the private right of action and SEC oversight offer different mechanisms to further same broad goal: preventing manipulation.

Plaintiffs acknowledge this principle but argue that the \"extreme importance of the VIX franchise to Cboe\" went beyond a generalized profit motive. [192] at 36. I disagree. Though the VIX franchise was especially lucrative to Cboe, Cboe did not enjoy any additional benefit from the manipulation itself.

Plaintiffs have not alleged that Cboe benefitted in any additional way by attracting the business of market makers. Instead, plaintiffs allege generalized profit motivations, which are not enough to establish a strong inference of scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   As circumstantial evidence of Cboe's scienter, plaintiffs assert that Cboe had full access to relevant trading data and that it reviewed that data-as it was obligated to do-for signs of manipulation. Because the VIX was so central to Cboe's success, and because even public data showed signs of manipulation, the most compelling inference, plaintiffs assert, is that Cboe was aware that the VIX was being manipulated. Plaintiffs also allege that the SEC has previously fined Cboe for prioritizing its business interests over its regulatory interests by allowing short selling to occur and argue this makes it more likely Cboe acted with scienter here. [140] \u00b6\u00b6 161-64. Finally, plaintiffs argue that Cboe's design of the SOQ calculation process (including the use of out-of-the-money SPX Options, the two-zero bid rule, and restricted access to anonymous participants), along with its removal of the Order Book Official and granting of special privileges to select market participants, make it in increasingly likely that Cboe knew about the manipulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Taking these allegations together and in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, they are not enough to suggest that Cboe intended to manipulate the market. Though Cboe may have designed a process with features that made it vulnerable to manipulation, the facts alleged in complaint do not support the conclusion that Cboe knew about these flaws at the time it designed the VIX enterprise or that it purposefully designed the market to facilitate manipulation. And showing that fraud occurred does not support an inference that Cboe must have, therefore, intentionally or recklessly created a market susceptible to manipulation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pugh v. Tribune Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3736469\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/521/686/#p694\">\n    521 F.3d 686\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 694 (7th Cir. 2008) (rejecting a similar \"fraud by hindsight\" theory of scienter). Plaintiffs go one step further than the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Pugh\n   </em>\n   and explain why the design features of the VIX were, in fact, prone to manipulation. But this is still insufficient to show that Cboe included those features to facilitate manipulation. A more compelling inference is that Cboe (like the SEC, who approved nearly all\n   aspects of the design) thought it included adequate safeguards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Cboe's alleged knowledge of the Does' manipulation does not combine with its knowledge of vulnerabilities to strongly suggest an intent to defraud. Plaintiffs allege two layers of manipulation, the Does' manipulative trading and Cboe's manipulative market structure. Cboe must have scienter with respect to its conduct (aiding and abetting the Does is not enough). While knowledge of a statement's falsity may allow an inference of scienter in a misrepresentation case,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Tellabs II\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3164106\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/513/702/#p708\">\n    513 F.3d at 709-10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Cboe's knowledge of the Doe Defendants' manipulation is not enough to infer that Cboe acted with the requisite intent for its conduct. Knowing that certain market participants acted fraudulently through one course of conduct does not suggest that the exchange intended to cheat through its behavior. Passive acquiescence is just as strong an inference. As a result, plaintiffs have not adequately pled a strong inference of Cboe's scienter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Though plaintiffs allege that Cboe repeatedly violated rules it was required to enforce, its allegations are not so general that they fail to state a claim. Plaintiffs list Rules 601 and 603, both of which are applicable to Cboe Futures and prohibit market manipulation. Plaintiffs further assert that by allowing manipulation to take place, Cboe failed to enforce those rules. Cboe argues plaintiffs' allegations are more general than any previously successful 22(b) claim. This matters, Cboe argues, because without alleging a specific rule violation, it is impossible to assess whether the circumstances warranted enforcement, whether enforcement would have made any difference, and if lack of enforcement was done in bad faith. But I read plaintiffs' complaint as alleging that each time a Doe Defendant manipulated the VIX Futures, Cboe failed to enforce its rules prohibiting manipulation.

It reasoned that allowing plaintiff to bring its state-law claims would frustrate Congress's intent to bring the markets under a uniform set of regulations.

In response, plaintiffs argue that the preemption inquiry mirrors the immunity analysis, and because Cboe was not acting as a regulator, there is no preemption.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Facebook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3594716\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/986/428/#p455\">\n    986 F.Supp.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   454 n. 15 (noting \"preemption precludes allowing state law claims that arise from actions taken by Defendants in their regulatory capacity as agents of the government or even actions 'incident to the exercise of regulatory power' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    NYSE Specialists\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2923109\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/503/89/#p95\">\n    503 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   98 )).

Because the SEC approved much of the design process that forms the basis for plaintiffs' negligence claim, subjecting Cboe to conflicting state negligence regimes, even though that conduct is non-regulatory, would run counter to congressional intent that markets be subject to uniform standards. Subjecting Cboe to varying standards would hamper the efficient operation of the futures market, and so the Commodities Exchange Act preempts plaintiffs' negligence claims.
