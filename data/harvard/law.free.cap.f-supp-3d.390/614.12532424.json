Plaintiff Continental Casualty Company (\"CCC\") has sued Defendant Pennsylvania National Mutual Casualty Insurance Company (\"Penn National\") seeking reimbursement from Penn National for settlement sums paid by CCC. Both parties have filed summary judgment motions. For the following reasons, I find that genuine issues of material fact remain that preclude a grant of summary judgment for either party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n    <em>\n     The Accident\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 15, 2015, Jeremy Esakoff was operating a motorcycle in Reading Township, New Jersey, when he was struck by a GMC Yukon operated by Kathryn Marquet-Sandt. (Pl.'s Mot. Summ. J., Aff. of Melissa Cornibe (\"Cornibe Aff.\"), Ex. A.) At the time of the accident, Marquet-Sandt was employed by Shady Maple Smorgasboard, Inc. (\"Shady Maple\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The GMC Yukon (the \"Yukon\") was owned by Sight &amp; Sound Ministries, Inc. (\"SSMI\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Marquet-Sandt obtained prior approval from her manager before taking trips on behalf of Shady Maple. (Dep. of Kathryn Marquet-Sandt, May 3, 2018 (\"May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep.\"), 25:3-26:15.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the day of the accident, an SSMI employee, William Luckenbaugh, planned to use the Yukon to travel to a trade show in New York. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:17-20, 17:21-25.) Because Marquet-Sandt was travelling to the same show, she spoke with someone at SSMI about going in the same car as Luckenbaugh. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 55:1-56:25.) Marquet-Sandt met Luckenbaugh in a parking lot the morning of the trip, at which point she suggested that she drive the car because \"he's older and [she] knew it was a long drive.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 57:1-25.) This was a spur-of-the moment decision, and Luckenbaugh did not have any idea that Marquet-Sandt would be driving before meeting her that morning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 103:20-25; Dep. of William Luckenbaugh, July 17, 2018 (\"July 17 Luckenbaugh Dep.\") 11:14-22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Although Marquet-Sandt did not have authority from Shady Maple to borrow the vehicle for any purpose, Shady Maple had no policies barring its employees from borrowing and using vehicles, in the course of Shady Maple's business, which were not owned by the employee or by Shady Maple. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. D; Dep. of Diane Adamczyk (\"Adamczyk Dep.\") 17:4-18:17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Marquet-Sandt attested to the fact that, at all times she occupied the Yukon, whether as a driver or as a passenger, Luckenbaugh had \"the exclusive right to command and control the SUV and had absolute authority to direct the route and\n   manner in which it was driven.\" (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. D.) Because Luckenbaugh's company, SSMI, owned the Yukon, Marquet-Sandt understood that Luckenbaugh had the right to tell her whether she could drive, where should could drive, and when she had to stop driving. (May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep. 103-04, 133-36.) Luckenbaugh understood that he had authority to let her drive the Yukon. (Def.'s Mot. Summ. J., Ex. F., Luckenbaugh Dep., Feb. 2, 2017 (\"Feb. 2 Luckenbaugh Dep.\") 27:7-18.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Prior to leaving for the trade show, Marquet-Sandt placed various Shady Maple display items and commercial materials in the Yukon for use at the trade show. (May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep. 58:6-12.) She also used her own GPS. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 59:16-60:9.) As the two proceeded, Luckenbaugh wanted to make a stop at a McDonalds to use the restroom and then take over driving. (July 17 Luckenbaugh Dep. 8:24-9:17, 12:21-13:17, 16:19-24.) The accident with Esakoff occurred when Marquet-Sandt proceeded to pull off the highway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     The\n     <em>\n      Esakoff\n     </em>\n     Action and Insurance Coverage\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Esakoff filed suit in the Philadelphia County Court of Common Pleas (the \"\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action\"), naming nineteen defendants, including Marquet-Sandt, SSMI, and other entities affiliated with both SSMI and Shady Maple.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Cornibe Aff., Ex. A.) The amended complaint in that action alleged that the accident was caused by Marquet-Sandt's negligence, and that the remaining defendants were vicariously liable. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Non-party Great American Insurance Company (\"Great American\") issued an insurance policy to a group of Sight &amp; Sound entities (\"Sight &amp; Sound\"), including SSMI, in the amount of $ 1 million, and Great American agreed to provide a defense to Sight &amp; Sound in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action. (Cornibe Aff., Ex. F.; Dep. of Andrew Campbell (\"Campbell Dep.\"), 8:7-12.) Plaintiff CCC issued a commercial umbrella policy to Sight &amp; Sound that provided coverage above certain designated coverage amounts issued to Sight &amp; Sound by Great American. (Cornibe Aff., Ex. H.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendant Penn National issued a business automobile policy to Shady Maple. (Cornibe Aff., Ex. I.) In connection with that policy, Penn National provided a defense to Shady Maple in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action. (Dep. of Matthew Clerkin (\"Clerkin Dep.\"), 21:4-6.) Penn National declined coverage for Marquet-Sandt pursuant to an understanding that Great American would provide Marquet-Sandt primary coverage. (Cornibe Aff., Ex. L.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   During the pendency of the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action, various parties were dismissed from the case, leaving only the following defendants: Marquet-Sandt, Shady Maple Companies, Shady Maple Foundation, Shady Maple RV, Inc., Shady Maple Caf\u00e9, and SSMI. (Cornibe Aff., Ex. N.) All of these defendants, except for SSMI, were Penn National insureds. (Cornibe Aff., Exs. I, M.) CCC and Penn National disputed the priority of coverage. CCC asserted that Marquet-Sandt was acting in the scope of her employment for Shady Maple, which was an insured on Penn National's policies. Penn National claimed that its insured, Shady Maple, did not own, hire, or borrow\n   the GMC Yukon and, therefore, it had no coverage obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On November 1, 2017, the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action was settled at a private mediation for the sum of $ 10 million (the \"\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   settlement\"). (Cornibe Aff., Ex. T.) CCC participated in the mediation and contributed $ 8.7 million to the settlement, while Great American contributed $ 1 million and Erie Insurance Exchange contributed $ 300,000.

What's more, consistent with the fact that the settlement amount was paid, CCC produced evidence that the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action was subsequently concluded via a Praecipe to Settle, Discontinue and End. (Penn National Mot. Summ. J., Ex. M, Dep. of Marc. Zingarini (\"Zingarini Dep.\") 34:10-35:3.) CCC has also provided a payment screen which indicated the date on the which the settlement check was issued, the amount of the settlement check, and the payee on that check. (CCC's Resp. Opp'n Summ. J., Ex. 2.) Considered collectively, and in the light most favorable to CCC, such evidence raises a sufficient factual dispute that CCC actually paid $ 8.7 million towards the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   settlement and precludes a grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   2.\n   <em>\n    Whether CCC Paid the Settlement Money on Behalf of Multiple Parties Other Than Marquet-Sandt and Shady Maple\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Penn National next asserts that CCC can recover if the settlement money was paid\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   on behalf of Shady Maple-who was a Penn National insured-and not on behalf of any of the other defendants named in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action.

Indeed, Sight &amp; Sound had filed a motion for summary judgment in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action claiming that Marquet-Sandt was acting in the scope of her employment for Shady Maple. The trial court denied the motion, noting that, at the time Marquet-Sandt was driving the Yukon, it was possible that she was acting as Sight &amp; Sound's servant and agent. (Penn National's Mot. Summ. J., Ex. W.) Specifically, the trial court stated in part:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Here, [the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   ] Plaintiffs have adduced an abundance of evidence demonstrating that Ms. Marquet-Sandt was acting as a servant and agent of the Sight and Sound Defendants and that she was engaged in a joint enterprise with the Sight and Sound Defendants ... Mr. Luckenbaugh, in his position for the Sight and Sound Defendants, gave Ms. Marquet-Sandt permission to drive the 2013 GMC Yukon and directed the route to the trade show ... immediately after the subject accident Sight and Sound Defendants were notified of the accident, and a Sight and Sound Defendants' employee drove to New Jersey to collect both Mr. Luckenbaugh and Ms. Marquet-Sandt, evidence that the Sight and Sound Defendants\n   <em>\n    continued\n   </em>\n   to control Ms. Marquet-Sandt after the accident.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   \u2022 Because SSMI was still a defendant in the case accused of being vicariously liable for the negligence of Marquet-Sandt, Sight &amp; Sound's counsel participated in the mediation. (Dep. of John Delaney, III (\"Delaney Dep.\") 47:11-24.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   In addition to this evidence, Penn National posits that the SSMI language in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Release was a \"sham designed to fool the Court as to the purpose and nature of the payment.\" (Penn National's\n   Mem. Supp. Summ. J. 9.) Penn National argues that CCC employees admitted that the SSMI language was put in to the Release only at the behest of CCC to preserve CCC's potential claims against Penn National. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dep. of Anthony McMahon (\"McMahon Dep.\") 15:18-25 (\"[I]t appears [the language] was put in there to protect [CCC]'s ability to pursue recovery potentially and also because it was based on the facts at the time that the case was ongoing that there was a belief that Sight and Sound had no liability in the matter.\"); Kennealy Dep. 14:9-16:7 (noting that one of the purposes of the SSMI language was to assist in pursuit of Penn National).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Finally, even taking the SSMI release language as true, Penn National contends that such language states only that the settlement money was not paid on behalf of SSMI, meaning that it had to have been paid for the benefit of both Marquet-Sandt and Shady Maple. Indeed, CCC's Rule 30(b)(6) deponent expressly testified that its contribution was paid on behalf of Marquet-Sandt and Shady Maple, without apportioning the payment between the two. (Kennealy Dep. 18:9-19:23.) Because only Shady Maple is Penn National's insured, to the extent any money was paid solely for the individual liability of Marquis-Sandt, Penn National claims it would have no obligation to reimburse CCC for such payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The conflicting evidence set out above raises a genuine issue of material fact as to the true allocation of the settlement funds paid out in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Settlement. CCC points to evidence that all of the settlement money was paid to cover Shady Maple, as vicariously liable for Marquet-Sandt's negligence in the scope of her employment. But Penn National has pointed to evidence that SSMI was still a viable defendant at the time of the settlement and that, according to the trial judge, Marquet-Sandt was potentially acting as SSMI's agent at the time of the accident. Thus, there remains a question of fact that at least some of the settlement was paid on SSMI's behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   \"[A] claim for equitable contribution calls upon the power of the court to design a remedy that is fair.

In that matter, Cedar Johnson was operating his wife's vehicle when he struck another car.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   At the time of the accident, Johnson and his passenger, Daniel LaVienna, were employed by Cambridge Frozen Bakery Products (\"Cambridge\"), and were returning from the home of Cambridge's president, Majewski, who had sent them to his home to retrieve his prescription medicine.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Neither man had \"punched out,\" and both remained \"on the clock,\" and therefore were working for Cambridge during the trip.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   When the victim sued the Johnsons, Cambridge, and Majewski for negligence, Cambridge's insurance company denied coverage on behalf of Majewski, arguing that Majewski was not an insured under the policy because he did not \"borrow\" the car with Cambridge's permission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The New Jersey Superior Court disagreed, finding that a person becomes a borrower when he or she \"assume[s] a certain amount of control, dominion or power over the object being borrowed\" and where the \"user\" of the vehicle has simultaneous authority to move the vehicle in order to be considered a \"borrower.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *2-3.

But, as explained below, adopting the majority view of \"borrow\" does not result in summary judgment in Penn National's favor because a genuine issue of material fact remains as to whether Shady Maple, acting through Marquet-Sandt, \"borrowed\" the SSMI vehicle for its use.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Penn National offers multiple facts which allegedly establish that Marquet-Sandt, as an employee of Shady Maple, never acquired control, dominion, or possession over the SSMI vehicle. First, Marquet-Sandt testified that SSMI and Shady Maple jointly promoted a dinner-and-a-show package, wherein special pricing would be offered for seeing a play at Sight &amp; Sound and eating at Shady Maple. (May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep. 34:4-20.) As a\n   result, Marquet-Sandt would often travel to events with someone from SSMI because the two companies promoted each other. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 34:21-35:14.) Thus, Penn National notes that the vehicle was used for a joint purpose and was not under the control of Marquet-Sandt. Penn National also points out that, on the day of the accident, the vehicle was owned by SSMI and had a wrap-around SSMI decal on the outside, thereby functioning as a moving advertisement for SSMI.

Rather, she explained that it was a last-minute decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   Q.

Marquet-Sandt was travelling on behalf of Shady Maple and placed various Shady Maple display items and commercial materials for use at the trade show in the SSMI vehicle.

Penn National's corporate designee and Shady Maple's insurance broker both testified that this lawsuit was one of the biggest lawsuits they had ever faced on a liability policy, thereby giving them incentive to avoid liability. (Adamczyk Dep. 34:11-17; Dep. of J. Bradford Forney (\"Forney Dep.\") 28:12-15.) When Shady Maple's representatives, and Penn National representatives met to strategize regarding coverage for the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   claim, the expectation was that Sight &amp; Sound would bear primary liability on the case and, if it did not work out, then Shady Maple would pursue Marquet-Sandt as a driver. (Dep. of Glenn Weaver (\"Weaver Dep.\") 55:5-15, 75:6-76:19.) Then, on November 3, 2017, Marquet-Sandt was called into a Shady Maple conference room with Glenn Weaver, Shady Maple's CFO; Peter Speaker, Penn National's coverage counsel; Brad Forney, Shady Maple's insurance broker; and three other unknown people. (May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep. 89:2-94:9.) Marquet-Sandt's coverage counsel, Marc Zingarini was not in the room and was not contacted about the meeting. (Zingarini Dep. 35:4-15.) Marquet-Sandt was given the affidavit and was told that if she had any changes to be made, to make them. (May 3 Marquet-Sandt Dep. 94:21-95:13.) She admitted that she did not understand some of the provisions in the affidavit, in particular the statement that she believed that she would be covered by SSMI's insurance policies on its SUV. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 107:16-25, 108:22-109:24.) She also did not fully understand the legal implications of her statement that she did not \"borrow\" the SSMI vehicle. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 112:6-25.) Finally, despite the fact that the affidavit indicated that she had reviewed Shady Maple's insurance policies, she actually had not reviewed them at that time. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 113:1-25.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In light of this record, and the facts identified by both parties, there remains a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Marquet-Sandt \"borrowed\" the SSMI vehicle on behalf of her employer, such that Shady Maple had possession reflecting dominion and control over the vehicle. CCC has pointed to some evidence suggesting that Shady Maple regularly, through Marquet-Sandt, used SSMI vehicles for its business purposes, that Shady Maple was using the Yukon on the day of the accident, and that Shady Maple's employee assumed possession reflecting dominion and control over the Yukon's movement on the day of the accident. On the other hand, Penn National has presented evidence that Shady Maple did not authorize Marquet-Sandt to drive the Yukon on the day of the accident and that SSMI, through its employee Luckenbaugh, retained full control over the vehicle at all times. As a reasonable factfinder could find in favor of either party, summary judgment is not appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   4.\n   <em>\n    Whether CCC Can Meet Its Burden of Showing that It Discharged the Debt for the Benefit of a Common Insured\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   Finally, Penn National contends that even if one disregards the language of the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Release and considers for whom the money\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   have been paid,\n   Penn National still has no obligation to CCC. Penn National argues that the money should have been paid for Marquet-Sandt, as she was the only primary, active tortfeasor, and that the release of Marquet-Sandt automatically extinguished the vicarious liability of the other eighteen defendants. Because Marquet-Sandt was not insured by Penn National, Penn National claims that CCC has no right to reimbursement for settlement money it paid on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   This argument again turns on how the settlement funds were allocated. If the funds were paid for Marquet-Sandt acting in the course and scope of her employment for Shady Maple, Penn National could potentially have liability. If the funds were paid for Marquet-Sandt acting only in her individual capacity, Penn National would not have liability. These facts remain in dispute and, as such, for the reasons set forth above, I cannot decide this issue on summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   5.\n   <em>\n    Whether Penn National's Insureds, Including Shady Maple, Had a Right to Be Indemnified by CCC's Insured, Marquet-Sandt, as the Active Tortfeasor\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In an alternative theory, Penn National argues that, under all factual scenarios, Marquet-Sandt was the active tortfeasor and, therefore, ultimately liable for the accident. Penn National posits that if other defendants, including Shady Maple, had been held vicariously liable based on Marquet-Sandt's negligence, Shady Maple could have pursued indemnification from her as a matter of law. Since she was not insured by Penn National, CCC has no right to reimbursement for any money it paid on her behalf.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   This argument turns entirely on speculation. Even if I could conclude as a matter of law that Marquet-Sandt was not an insured, Shady Maple remained an individually-named defendant in the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action with a cross-claim against the Sight &amp; Sound entities, but made no claim against Marquet-Sandt at that time. Having failed to initiate any indemnity action against Marquet-Sandt, it is too great a leap to find that Marquet-Sandt owed indemnity to Shady Maple, as a matter of law, such that Penn National's obligations were eliminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-174\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n    <em>\n     CCC's Motion for Summary Judgment\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-175\">\n   CCC's Cross-motion seeks summary judgment in its favor and reimbursement of the full $ 8.7 million paid to resolve the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   Action. It contends that Shady Maple is a mutual insured of Penn National and CCC, and that Marquet-Sandt-having \"borrowed\" the SSMI vehicle on behalf of her employer, Shady Maple-is also a mutual insured of Penn National and CCC. CCC reasons that because Penn National's coverage stands first in priority when compared to the CCC policy, Penn National is liable as a matter of law for some portion, if not the full amount, of the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   As set forth in detail above, however, the analysis is not that simple. Questions of material fact remain regarding (a) what amount of the\n   <em>\n    Esakoff\n   </em>\n   settlement was paid on behalf of Shady Maple as vicariously responsible for Marquet-Sandt, and what amount was paid on behalf of SSMI; and (b) whether Marquet-Sandt \"borrowed\" the SSMI vehicle such that she was an insured under the Penn National policy. Absent resolution of those factual disputes, I cannot determine what policy stands in first priority on the claim. Accordingly, I will also deny CCC's Motion for Summary Judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   In light of the foregoing, I find that genuine issues of material fact remain that\n   preclude the entry of summary judgment for either party. Accordingly, I will deny the Cross-motions for Summary Judgment and schedule a trial in this matter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-181\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, the following facts are undisputed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-182\">\n    These other entities included: Sight &amp; Sound Management Company, Inc.; Sight &amp; Sound Theatres; Sight &amp; Sound Conservatory; Jeffrey Enck; Matthew Neff; Anthony H.
