The Court issued oral decisions on the motions at the Wednesday, May 24, 2019 Final Pretrial Conference, but sets forth its reasoning more fully herein. For the following reasons, the Court\n   <strong>\n    DENIES\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion to limit the Defendants' opinion witness testimony. The Court\n   <strong>\n    HOLDS IN ABEYANCE\n   </strong>\n   Plaintiff's Motion to exclude Dr. Atkinson's statement in Mrs. Tucker's medical record. The Court\n   <strong>\n    GRANTS\n   </strong>\n   Defendants' Motion to exclude cross-examination on Dr. Nelson's failed attempts at board certification.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Brenda Tucker, a citizen of West Virginia, went to the Holzer Clinic in Gallipolis, Ohio, for an angiogram, angioplasty, and stenting of her left common iliac artery on November 2, 2015. (ECF No. 1 at 2). Dr. Dean Siciliano performed the procedure. About an hour after the procedure, Mrs. Tucker's right foot began to hurt, and her foot appeared pale. The doctors put Mrs. Tucker on a heparin drip. Her foot pain intensified, and Dr. Nelson performed surgery on Mrs. Tucker.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Plaintiff alleges that Mrs. Tucker experienced an arterial bleed, and Dr. Nelson negligently treated the bleed. Mrs. Tucker died following the surgery. Johnnie Tucker, as Administrator of Mrs. Tucker's estate, brought this action for wrongful death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As a general rule, \"a court should exclude evidence on a motion in\n   <em>\n    limine\n   </em>\n   only when that evidence is determined to be clearly inadmissible on all potential grounds.\"\n   <em>\n    Delay v.

Additionally, evidence can be relevant even if it does not relate to a fact in dispute, provided the evidence supplies background information about a party or issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Advisory Committee Notes to 1972 Proposed Rules (\"Evidence which is essentially background in nature can scarcely be said to involve disputed matter, yet it is universally offered and admitted as an aid to understanding.\"). Relevant evidence is admissible unless excluded under a specific provision of the Constitution,a\n   federal statute, Federal Rules of Evidence, or other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court. Fed. R. Evid. 402.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Rule 403 can operate to bar otherwise relevant evidence. Rule 403 grants trial courts discretion to exclude evidence \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed\" by the risk of \"unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Information Contained in Medical Records\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Plaintiff moves to exclude Dr. Sarah Atkinson's statement in Mrs. Tucker's medical records. Dr. Atkinson states: \"Given results of aortogram and CT this is likely a venous bleed.\" Plaintiff argues that Dr. Atkinson never saw Mrs. Tucker and that the statement goes to an ultimate issue in the case-where Mrs. Tucker was bleeding. (ECF No. 36 at 1). Plaintiff also argues that this statement is hearsay not subject to any exception. Defendants argue that this statement is admissible as a business record under Rule 803(6) and that Dr. Atkinson was involved in diagnosing and treating Mrs. Tucker. (ECF No. 39 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Hearsay is any out of court statement \"offer[ed] in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.\" Fed. R. Evid. 801(c). The statement here is hearsay: Dr. Atkinson made the out of court statement, and the Defendants are offering it for the truth of the matter asserted in the statement. Generally, hearsay is not admissible unless an exception applies. Fed. R. Evid. 802.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Defendants argue that Dr. Atkinson's statement is admissible as a statement made for medical diagnosis or treatment under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(4). Rule 803(4) provides an exception to the rule against hearsay if a statement \"(A) is made for-and is reasonably pertinent to-medical diagnosis or treatment; and (B) describes medical history; past or present symptoms or sensations; their inception; or their general cause.\" Fed. R. Evid. 803(4). But this exception only \"applies ... to statements made by the one actually seeking or receiving medical treatment.\"\n   <em>\n    Field v. Trigg Cty.

Defendants argue that\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   presented a different factual scenario than the statements here because in\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   the Sixth Circuit was deciding the admissibility of statements made by two doctors to a third doctor about the third doctor's treatment. Defendants are correct that this case presents different facts than\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   . Nevertheless, the language in\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   is broad enough to encompass the scenario here.\n   <em>\n    Field\n   </em>\n   says, plainly, that Rule 803(4) applies only to statements by the patient, not the doctor. Thus, Dr. Atkinson's statement is not admissible under Rule 803(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendants have also argued that Dr. Atkinson's statement is admissible under the business records exception in Rule 803(6). Rule 803(6) provides for an exception to the rule against hearsay for business records if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (A) the record was made at or near the time by - or from information transmitted by - someone with knowledge;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   (B) the record was kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity of a business, organization, occupation, or calling, whether or not for profit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (C) making the record was a regular practice of that activity;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (D) all these conditions are shown by the testimony of the custodian or another\n   qualified witness, or by a certification that complies with Rule 902(11) or (12) or with a statute permitting certification; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   (E) the opponent does not show that the source of information or the method or circumstances of preparation indicate a lack of trustworthiness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Fed.

Evid. 803(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Medical records can be offered into evidence under the business records exception, provided the party offering the records for admission can meet the requirements set forth in Rule 803(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lankford v.

Ohio Apr. 8, 2016) (\"Medical records may qualify for the business record exception to the rule against hearsay.\"). Medical records, like other records being admitted under Rule 803(6), must be \"kept in the course of a regularly conducted activity.\" And although \"[h]ospital diagnoses may qualify for this exception to the hearsay rule,\" Rule 803(6) \"specifically refers to the 'compilation, in any form, of ... diagnoses, made at or near the time by ... a person with knowledge, if kept in the course of a regularly conducted business activity ...' \".\n   <em>\n    Norton v.

(ECF No. 36 at 1). Further, Dr. Atkinson is not on Defendants' witness list and was not deposed, meaning both that the records lack a proper custodian as required by Rule 803(6) and that she cannot be properly confronted about her statement in an effort to interrogate its reliability.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. Roa\n   </em>\n   , 2:14-CV-2555,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205045766\">\n    2018 WL 5045766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *2 (S.D. Ohio) (finding a doctor's statement to be within the hearsay exceptions but limiting testimony to the doctor who testified at trial because only that doctor could be the custodian and be cross-examined).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendants do not squarely address the custodian or \"regular course of business\" issues. They characterize Plaintiff's argument as being \"that he doesn't know whether Dr. Atkinson is qualified, as a general surgeon, to interpret imaging studies and make a determination as to the source of bleeding.\" (ECF No. 39 at 3). To be clear, Plaintiff's objection is not that Dr. Atkinson is not qualified to opine in the abstract, but rather that this one line of her analysis will be admitted as evidence devoid of context, because \"no one knows how or why Dr. Atkinson reached her opinion because she has not been deposed and she will not be testifying at trial.\" (ECF No. 36 at 3). Having characterized Plaintiff's argument thus, Defendants continue on to say that, \"[s]ince that argument could be used against any physician whose opinions and diagnoses are contained in the medical records that have been stipulated to as admissible in this case, this is a rather curious argument,\" and that \"Dr. Atkinson's opinion is the result of interpreting imaging studies, not simply relying on a report of a radiologist.\" (ECF No. 39 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Federal Rules of Evidence do not prohibit, in the abstract, the admission of a diagnosis in a medical record so long as all of the requirements of Rule 803(6) are satisfied.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wharton v. Preslin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2009%20WL%201850085\">\n    2009 WL 1850085\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.D. Ohio) (permitting evidence of medical records \"provided that such records are relevant and that a proper foundation is laid,\" as provided in Rule 902(11) and 902(12)). Therefore, Defendants may introduce the statement in the medical record provided they can lay a proper foundation at trial. Plaintiff may\n   renew his objection to the admissibility of the statement at that time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Plaintiff relies on\n   <em>\n    Mathis v. Roa\n   </em>\n   , but that case is distinguishable. In\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   , the Court allowed the statement of a physician in a medical record but limited the testimony to the doctor who testified at trial because that doctor was the only one who was a custodian of the record and could be cross-examined.\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%205045766\">\n    2018 WL 5045766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. But the statements in\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   attempted to fix the cause of the plaintiff's harm on another doctor who treated the plaintiff in the past. Here, Dr. Atkinson's statement is in the form of a medical diagnosis and was made while treatment of Mrs. Tucker was ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Rule 403 does not bar admission of Dr. Atkinson's statement. Under Rule 403, evidence may be excluded \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed\" by the risk of \"unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.\" Fed. R. Evid. 403. Plaintiff did not expand on his basis for invoking Rule 403, except to say that the statement could only be made by a Rule 702 opinion witness, and Dr. Atkinson is not being offered as such. The probative value of the evidence is not substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice, confusing the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, wasting time, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence. Plaintiff's concerns go to weight, not admissibility. Both sides are presenting the testimony of their own opinion witnesses as to the cause of Mrs. Tucker's bleed. The jury is already tasked with evaluating competing opinions. Dr. Atkinson's statement would merely be a third potential statement to evaluate, and the jury is more than capable of assessing the weight to accord her statement, particularly when comparing the amount of context surrounding Dr. Atkinson's statement with the context surrounding the testimony of the two opinion witnesses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Plaintiff has also asked that Defendants' opinion witnesses be precluded from referencing Dr. Atkinson's statement. As a threshold matter, if the statement is admitted, obviously Defendants' opinion witnesses may refer to it. Even if Dr. Atkinson's statement is not admitted, Rule 703 allows for an opinion based on \"those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject\" that \"experts in a particular field would reasonably rely on,\" even if those facts or data are not admissible. Fed. R. Evid. 703. If the opinion witness does rely on such inadmissible evidence, however, the inadmissible evidence may be disclosed \"to the jury only if their probative value in helping the jury evaluate the opinion substantially outweighs their prejudicial effect.\" Fed. R. Evid. 703. As stated above, Dr. Atkinson's statement is relevant, and so long as Defendants can establish that the information is the type that experts in the field rely on, it will be admitted under Rule 703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiff's Motion in Limine is therefore\n   <strong>\n    HELD IN ABEYANCE\n   </strong>\n   but will be denied if Defendants can lay the foundation under 803(6) or can establish that Dr. Atkinson's statement is the type relied upon under Rule 703.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Testimony Regarding Dr. Nelson's Board Certification Exam\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Defendants have moved to exclude any reference to Dr. Nelson's failed attempts to obtain board certification in cardiothoracic surgery. Defendants intend to call Dr. Nelson as an opinion witness at trial. Dr. Nelson twice attempted the cardiothoracic surgery board certification exam, and failed the exams, before treating Mrs. Tucker. After treating Mrs. Tucker, Dr. Nelson passed the cardiothoracic surgery board certification exam. Plaintiffs\n   seek to use these failed attempts to pass the board certification exam as a means of attacking her credibility as an opinion witness. Defendants argue that such testimony is irrelevant and unfairly prejudicial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Generally, \"[w]here a physician sued for malpractice testifies as an expert, evidence as to the physician's age, practice, and other matters going to the physician's qualifications as an expert is admissible.\" 61 Am. Jur. 2d Physicians, Surgeons, Etc. \u00a7 316. Following this reasoning, some state courts have upheld lower court rulings allowing evidence of a physician's failed attempts to become board certified. For example, the South Carolina Court of Appeals in\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Epting\n   </em>\n   upheld a decision to allow evidence of past board certification exam failures because the lack of a certification bore on the doctor's credibility.\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Epting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2170017\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/290/547/\">\n    290 S.C. 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2170017\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/290/547/\">\n    351 S.E.2d 867\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872-73 (App. 1986).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   There is a dearth of federal caselaw on whether a doctor's failed attempts to become board certified in a specialty are admissible for impeachment purposes when the doctor testifies as an opinion witness. At least one federal circuit upheld a district court's ruling prohibiting evidence of failed attempts to pass the board certification exam but allowed testimony that the doctor was not board certified.\n   <em>\n    Campbell v. Vinjamuri\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514424\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1274/#p1276\">\n    19 F.3d 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1276-77 (8th Cir. 1994). The Eighth Circuit in\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   found that the doctor's previous attempts at board certification were not relevant and that \"it would be improper for the jury to use the evidence ... to conclude that because a physician was unable to pass his board exams, he was negligent on a specific occasion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514424\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1274/#p1276\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514424\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1274/#p1276\">\n    at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In\n   <em>\n    Ward\n   </em>\n   , the testifying doctor lacked a certification altogether, and the South Carolina Court's holding simply stated that \"[t]he fact that [the doctor] was not board certified relates to her credibility as a witness.\"\n   <em>\n    Ward v. Epting\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2170017\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/290/547/\">\n    351 S.E.2d at 873\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Ward's applicability to the situation here is, therefore, limited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   From the foregoing cases, the following general rule can be distilled: When a doctor is testifying as an opinion witness, the fact that she is not board certified in a particular specialty is admissible. Whether the doctor previously failed board certification exams may be relevant, but the probative value of such evidence must be weighed against the possibility for unfair prejudice, as required by Rule 403.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   While Dr. Nelson's past attempts at board certification may have some limited probative value as to her credibility, such probative value is outweighed by the potential for unfair prejudice and confusing the issues. Plaintiff's brief arguing for the admission of the evidence of her past failures demonstrates the ease with which Dr. Nelson's credibility can be conflated with the merits of whether she was negligent. Plaintiff argues that Dr. Nelson's testimony will help establish the standard of care and that \"she treated Mrs. Tucker in the best and safest way possible.\" (ECF No. 53 at 2). While the first use of her testimony goes to proper medical procedure, the second use-whether she properly treated Mrs. Tucker-bears on her own alleged negligence. Using Dr. Nelson's previous failures to pass the board certification exam to impeach her credibility, while permissible, could too easily be conflated with whether she was negligent at the time she treated Mrs. Tucker. The question of the proper standard of care, and whether an individual doctor met that standard of care in a specific instance, is independent of a doctor's board certification\n   <em>\n    . See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Campbell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10514424\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/19/1274/#p1276\">\n    19 F.3d at 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[I]t would be improper for the jury to ... conclude that because a physician was unable to pass his board exams, he was negligent on a specific occasion.\") (citing\n   <em>\n    Beis v. Dias\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10014071\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/859/835/\">\n    859 S.W.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. App. 1993) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   While the jury will have to weigh the competing testimony of the Plaintiff's and Defendants' opinion witness, Dr. Nelson is unlikely to be the only physician who will testify for Defendants as to the proper standard of care. Dr. Black's deposition also addresses the standard of care, and Dr. Watson's testimony could similarly overlap with Dr. Nelson's. Therefore, it will not be the simple matter of comparing Dr. Nelson's testimony to Plaintiff's opinion witness, Dr. Sampson, and deciding who is right and who is wrong.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Unlike in other cases in which the doctor testifying as an expert lacked board certification, Dr. Nelson has since passed the\n   board certification exam for cardiothoracic surgery. Therefore, cross-examining Dr. Nelson on her lack of board certification at the time of Mrs. Tucker's procedure would only magnify the risk of unfair prejudice because it could too easily lead the jury to doubt Dr. Nelson's competency as a doctor at the time of treatment, rather than comparing her actions to the appropriate standard of care.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Plaintiff may, however, cross-examine Dr. Nelson as to\n   <em>\n    how long\n   </em>\n   she has been board-certified. Additionally, Plaintiff may be permitted to cross-examine Dr. Nelson as to her failed attempts to become board certified should Defendants open the door on direct examination.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nelson v. Waxman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11492435\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/9/601/#p605\">\n    9 S.W.3d 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 605 (Mo. 2000) (allowing cross-examination on failed board certification attempts because direct examination implied that the doctor was \"not board certified in critical care\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   because the board examination was not available\" and that the doctor was a member of the \"Society of Critical Care\" without explaining what was required to be such a member).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Testimony from Multiple Opinion Witnesses\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Plaintiffs also move to exclude the testimony of Defendants' opinion witnesses, arguing that having multiple witnesses testify to the same facts is cumulative evidence. Defendants argue that the two witnesses will not testify to precisely the same facts and that each witness will be used for a different sub-area or specialty. Defendants explain that \"[a]though Dr. Watson's testimony will necessarily overlap regarding opinions on the standard of care and causation, Dr. Watson will focus on the pathophysiology involved in a patient like Brenda Tucker and the cascade of events as described in his deposition,\" whereas Dr. Black \"will explain the procedure performed and the complications that occurred and distinguish for the jury why Brenda Tucker died from a rare but known complication ...\" (ECF No. 39 at 4-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In general, the district court \"retains considerable latitude even with admittedly relevant evidence in rejecting that which is cumulative, and in requiring that which is to be brought to the jury's attention to be done so in a manner least likely to confuse that body.\"\n   <em>\n    Hamling v.
