After\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review of the record, and the benefit of oral argument on May 17, 2019, this Court\n   <strong>\n    REMANDS\n   </strong>\n   the action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Stephen Jamar Shanks was injured in a job-related accident on April 24, 2018 while working for Globe Metallurgical, Inc., (\"Globe\") in Dallas County, Alabama. (Doc. 15, p. 3). On May 4, 2018, Plaintiffs Tommie Jean and Willie Lee Shanks, in their individual capacities and as \"next to [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] friend(s)\" of Stephen Jamar Shanks, sued Globe and several Fictitious Defendants. (Doc. 1-7, pp. 1 - 13). In their Original Complaint, Plaintiffs brought these claims against Globe and those Fictitious Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-10\">\n   1) Worker's Compensation Benefits and Medical Expenses against Globe to which Stephen or his dependents are entitled;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   2) Removal of Safety Devices against Fictitious Defendants A and B;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   3) Removal of Safety Devices against Fictitious Defendants A and B;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   4) Alabama Extended Manufacture Liability Doctrine against Fictitious Defendants C - H;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   5) Failure to Worn [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] / Negligence against Fictitious Defendants;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   6) Negligence / Failure to Warn or Guard against Fictitious Defendants C - H; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   7) Loss of Consortium against all Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (Doc. 1-7, pp. 5 - 12). Stephen Shanks died on May 6, 2018, due to his injuries.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After Stephen's death, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint ( \"FAC\") in the Dallas County Circuit Court. (Doc. 1-7, pp. 191 - 204). In the FAC, Plaintiffs added Erica Acoff \"both individually as a dependent of Stephen Jamar Shanks deceased, and as a next of friend to JAMAR ACOFF, a minor child and dependent of Stephen Jamar Shanks deceased.\" (Doc 1-7, p. 192). In the FAC, Tommie Jean and Willie Lee Shanks remained parties in their capacities as \"individual(s)\" and \"next to [sic] friends\" of Stephen Jamar Shanks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Plaintiffs also named Defendants A &amp; G Manufacturing, Inc. (\"A &amp; G\") and Yale Carolinas, Inc. (\"Yale\"), bringing third party tort claims against them. (Doc. 1-7, pp. 196 - 204). Last, Plaintiffs asserted claims against Fictitious Defendants 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' for the removal of safety devices. Plaintiffs identified those Fictitious Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   ... those Alabama resident adult citizens who were co-employees of Stephen Jamar Shanks whose willful, intentional, and otherwise wrongful acts either caused or contributed to cause the injuries and damages to the Plaintiffs, all of whose true and correct names are unknown to the Plaintiffs at this time but will be substituted by amendment once ascertained ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   (Doc. 1-7, p. 194).

In its Notice of Removal, A &amp; G claimed this Court had diversity jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' claims against it, Yale, and Globe Manufacturing (insofar as the claims against Globe did not concern the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act). (Doc. 1, p. 2). A &amp; G cited\n   <em>\n    Lamar v.

Ala. 2012), in which this Court held that when an action is removed on diversity grounds under 28 U.S.C. 1441(a) and the action contains non-removable claims under 28 U.S.C. 1445(c), the Court shall sever and remand the non-removable claims and maintain jurisdiction over the claims properly removed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On January 2, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint ( \"SAC\"), under Rule 15(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. In the SAC, Plaintiffs substituted Scott Patterson, Steve Smith and Antonio Williams - three non-diverse co-employees - for Fictitious Defendants 'A,' 'B,' and 'C'. (Doc. 15, pp. 2 - 3). In their SAC, Plaintiffs are pursuing these claims against Defendants Globe, A &amp; G, Yale, and the newly-substituted co-employee Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   1) A Worker's Compensation Claim against Globe for compensation and medical care expenses;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   2) - 4)\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Claims under AEMLD, Breach of Warranty, and Negligence against A &amp; G and Yale\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   5) Claims for Removal of / Failure to Install or Maintain / By-Passing Safety Devices or Guards against co-employee Defendants; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   6) Loss of Consortium Claim by Tommie Jean and Willie Lee Shanks against all Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   (Doc. 15, pp. 3 - 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   After filing their SAC, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Remand this action to State\n   court (Doc. 16). In their Motion, Plaintiffs argue this Court was divested of jurisdiction following the addition of non-diverse Defendants. Plaintiffs also argue even if this Court were to hold\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   as the law of the District, (which it does), their addition of non-diverse parties distinguishes this action from\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   and divested this Court of subject matter jurisdiction. A &amp; G filed a response, (Doc. 24) to which Plaintiffs filed a Sur-reply. (Doc. 29).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On March 12, 2019, Judge Murray issued a Report and Recommendation (\"R &amp; R\") recommending that the entire action be remanded to the Dallas County Circuit Court, as this Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction after Plaintiffs added the three non-diverse co-employee Defendants. (Doc. 30). The R &amp; R was based on an analysis of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e) and authority from the Sixth Circuit. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , pp. 5 - 9). Judge Murray found that the claims against the non-diverse Defendants did not arise under the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act, and therefore, that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201445\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) did not prohibit their removal. Rather, as those claims had been properly removed, the joinder of non-diverse parties relative to those claims, after removal, divested the Court of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A &amp; G objected to Judge Murray's R &amp; R, arguing that the claims brought against the substituted non-diverse co-employee Defendants arose under the Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act, were unremovable under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201445\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c), and were therefore due to be severed and remanded under\n   <em>\n    Lamar\n   </em>\n   . A &amp; G argued that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2025-5-53\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 25-5-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   displaced all common law actions against co-employees and created causes of action for \"willful conduct\" under Ala. Code 25-5-11(c)(2). A &amp; G's position is that the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act provides the only means of redress Plaintiffs seek. Specifically, A &amp; G noted the legislative and jurisprudential history of that statute. A &amp; G contended that \u00a7 25-5-53's dictate that \"the rights and remedies granted in this chapter to an employee shall exclude all other rights and remedies of the employee ... at common law, by statute, or otherwise on account of injury, loss of services, or death,\" combined with Ala. Code 25-5-11(d)(2)'s definition of \"willful conduct,\" clearly indicate that Plaintiffs' co-employee claims arose under the Alabama Worker's Compensation statute. (Doc. 31, pp. 5-9). This Court conducted a hearing at which Plaintiffs' counsel argued that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ala.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2025-5-53\">\n    Ala. Code \u00a7 25-5-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   simply provided the statutory vehicle to assert co-employee \"willful conduct\" claims, and that such claims do not arise under Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This Court agrees with Judge Murray's conclusion that the claims against A &amp; G, Yale, and Globe were within the Court's subject matter jurisdiction at the time of removal. (Doc. 30, p. 4). All Plaintiffs were diverse from all named Defendants and the amount in controversy exceeded the threshold minimum. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The Court, though, finds it beneficial to conduct an independent analysis as to whether the co-employee claims arise under Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Lamar v.

Therefore, this Court must answer whether the claims brought against the substituted non-diverse Defendants arise under the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   If those claims do not arise under the Act, they were properly removed and the substitution of the non-diverse Defendants deprives this Court of diversity jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In his R &amp; R, Judge Murray found that the claims against the substituted co-employees did not arise under the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act, relying on\n   <em>\n    Ala.

The Court explained that the \"retaliatory discharge cause of action\n   <strong>\n    increases workers' willingness to file compensation claims, and it limits employers' ability to discourage them.\n   </strong>\n   In so doing, \u00a7 25-5-11.1 encourages prompt and thorough medical attention for workplace injuries.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457907\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/1055/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11457907\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/206/1055/\">\n    at 1060\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [A]ctions like the one brought by AMWCF have little effect on the\n   <strong>\n    willingness of workers to bring claims, the ability of employers to discourage claims, or the availability of medical care in the workplace\n   </strong>\n   . Thus,\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   provides no justification for treating AMWCF's claims as arising under Alabama's workmen's compensation laws. Instead,\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   suggests that tort claims, like AMWCF's, should be treated differently from retaliatory discharge claims that do arise under the workmen's compensation scheme.

In sum, the\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   Court found that claims that concerned an underlying common law cause of action did not \"arise under\" Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act because those claims did not concern \"the willingness of workers to bring claims, the ability of employers to discourage claims, or the availability of medical care in the workplace.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268555\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/1165/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12268555\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/234/1165/\">\n    at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

These common law causes of action were difficult to sustain. Before workers compensation statutes, cases were frequently dismissed or overturned on appeal as workers (or their estates) confronted substantial impediments to tort recovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Recovery by\n   injured employees (and the families of deceased employees) was made more difficult by assumption of the risk, contributory negligence, and the fellow servant doctrine defenses. While the fellow servant doctrine shielded\n   <strong>\n    employers\n   </strong>\n   from most common law\n   <strong>\n    negligence\n   </strong>\n   actions where a co-employee's negligence caused the underlying injury, contributory negligence and assumption of the risk made it difficult for injured workers to carry causes of action against an employer and co-employees. 1 ALABAMA WORKERS COMPENSATION LAW AND HANDBOOK \u00a7 1.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This Court found that the overwhelming majority of cases dealing with employees' common law rights in Alabama\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   concerned those actions where an employee filed suit against an employer on the theory that the employer was negligent in hiring the co-employee accused of causing the injuries at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   In a majority of cases, the common law was silent as to whether an employee had a common law right of action against a\n   <strong>\n    co-employee\n   </strong>\n   for injuries resulting from a co-employee's \"willful conduct.\" However, this Court found two Alabama cases that deal with whether a servant (employee) could be held liable, generally, for his willful conduct during the course of his work. In a case concerning an employee's actions that caused a steamboat accident, the Alabama Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   That\n   <strong>\n    for the acts of the agent\n   </strong>\n   , or servant,\n   <strong>\n    willfully and intentionally done,\n   </strong>\n   without the command or authorization of the master,\n   <strong>\n    the servant is liable, and the master is not.\n   </strong>\n   [...] It seems to be well settled that if the servant be in the performance of a duty entrusted to him, and, from a want of either skill or diligence, injure another, it will not excuse the master or employer, even if the servant, in the matter complained of, was acting contrary to instructions. Trusting the servant in the given case, is an assumption by the master of all responsibility which results from negligence or want of skill in the servant. But this rule does not apply,\n   <strong>\n    when the servant actually wills and intends the injury, or steps aside from the purpose of the agency committed to him, and inflicts and independent wrong.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    Cox, Brainard &amp; Co. v.

Similarly, in an action concerning an employee's trespass in 1853, the Court noted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   According to this principle, a master is not liable in trespass\n   <em>\n    vi et armis\n   </em>\n   for\n   <strong>\n    injuries done by his servant, which are\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    willful [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] on the part of the servant\n   </strong>\n   , and of which the master is ignorant, although done in the course of the master's business. If injuries are done by the servant in the course of the master's business, which result from negligence or want of proper care or skill on the part of the servant, the master will be liable, it is true, but only in an action on the case; for there the gist of the action is the negligence of the servant, and for that the master is lawfully liable, although\n   <strong>\n    not for the willful [\n    <em>\n     sic\n    </em>\n    ] torts of his servant\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <em>\n    Lindsay v.

Taken together,\n   <em>\n    Cox\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Lindsay\n   </em>\n   appear to contemplate that an employee could be held liable - at common law - for his willful conduct while in the service of his employer. In other words, employee liability for willful conduct certainly arose under the common law. Accordingly, there is some precedent to imply that the common law allowed an action by an employee against a co-employee for injuries that resulted from a co-employee's willful acts in the course of employment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court now turns to the question of whether the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act abrogated that common law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   As noted in\n   <em>\n    Diamond\n   </em>\n   , \"[a] lawsuit arises under the law that creates the cause of action.\"\n   <em>\n    P.R.

Supp. 3d at 1172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . There is no question that the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act allows for causes of action against co-employees. In relevant part, the provision giving such permission states the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   If the injury or death for which compensation is payable under Articles 3 or 4 of this chapter\n   <strong>\n    was caused under circumstances also creating a legal liability for damages\n   </strong>\n   on the part of any party other than the employer, ... the employee, or his or her dependents in case of death, ... may bring an action against the other party to recover damages for the injury or death, and the amount of the damages shall be ascertained and determined without regard to this chapter. If a party ... is an officer, director, agent, or employee of the same employer, or his or her personal representative, the injured employee, or his or her dependents in the case of death, may bring an action against any ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   person, or his or her personal representative,\n   <strong>\n    only for willful conduct\n   </strong>\n   which results in or proximately causes the injury or death.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Code of Ala. \u00a7 25-5-11(a) (emphasis added). Excerpts in this section indicate that the Act does not create the claims Plaintiffs pursue against the co-employee Defendants. The phrase, \"if the injury or death ...\n   <strong>\n    was caused under circumstances also creating legal liability\n   </strong>\n   for damages ...,\" implies that this legal liability was not created by the statute. In fact, this excerpt suggests the opposite - that the liability existed under other circumstances prior to the Act. The Court cannot reconcile the plain text of the statute with the proposition that the Act creates this cause of action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   A &amp; G insists, though, that additional provisions in the Act require this Court find otherwise. A &amp; G argues that \u00a7\u00a7 25-5-11(a), (b), and (c), in conjunction, provide that common law co-employee actions were abolished and re-constituted by the Act. (Doc. 31, p. 11). In \u00a7\u00a7 25-5-11(b) and (c)(2), the Legislature defined \"willful conduct\" the following way:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   (b) If personal injury or death to any employee results from the willful conduct, as defined in subsection (c) herein, of any ... employee of the same employer ... the employee shall have a cause of action against the person ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   (c) As used herein, \"willful conduct\" means any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   [...]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   (2) The willful and intentional removal from a machine of a safety guard or safety device provided by the manufacturer of the machine with knowledge that injury or death would likely or probably result from the removal; provided, however, that removal of a guard or device shall not be willful conduct unless the removal did, in fact, increase the danger in the use of the machine and was not done for the purpose of repair of the machine or was not part of an improvement or modification of the machine which rendered the safety device unnecessary or ineffective.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   A &amp; G's argument does not prevail. The Supreme Court of Alabama has found that \"the legislature\n   <strong>\n    limits\n   </strong>\n   employee's claims for damages, where workmen's compensation benefits are payable ...\"\n   <em>\n    Reed v.

In fact, the Legislature merely preserved and limited, rather than abrogated and re-constituted, employee liability for willful conduct that was previously available at common law. As such, this appears to be a case contemplated by other districts, wherein the claims are found only to \"relate\" to Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Therefore, after careful review, this Court finds these claims do not arise under Alabama's Worker's Compensation Act.

Section 1447(e) provides: \"If after removal the plaintiff seeks to join additional defendants whose joinder would destroy subject matter jurisdiction, the court may deny joinder, or permit joinder and remand the action to the State court.\" As Plaintiffs substituted three non-diverse co-employees for Fictitious Defendants 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' following removal, 1447(e)'s\n   framework applies. Further, as noted in Judge Murray's R &amp; R, the Court is encouraged to undertake a \u00a7 1447(e) analysis regardless of whether the amendments were made as a matter of course, as Plaintiffs' were here. For the reasons articulated in Judge Murray's R &amp; R, this Court agrees that the entire action is due to be remanded based on the analysis of the four factors outlined in the R &amp; R.

(\"Globe\"), was seriously injured in a job-related accident. Stephen died on May 6, 2018 as a result of his injuries. Plaintiffs Tommy Jean Shanks and Willie Lee Shanks, Stephen's parents, filed a complaint against Globe and several fictitious defendants seeking worker's compensation benefits and damages based on claims alleging removal of safety devices, products liability, and negligent failure to warn or guard on May 4, 2018 in the Circuit Court of Dallas County, Alabama. (Doc. 1-1). On October 24, 2018, Plaintiffs filed their First Amended Complaint adding Erica Acoff, individually, as a dependent of Stephen, and as next friend of Jamar Acoff, a minor and dependent of Stephen, as a plaintiff and adding A &amp; G and Yale Carolinas as defendants. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 5). In the amended complaint, Plaintiffs continued to assert claims against fictitious defendants. Plaintiffs identified \"Fictitious Defendants 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' [as] those Alabama resident adult citizens who were co-employees of Stephen Jamar Shanks whose willful, intentional, and otherwise wrongful acts either caused or contributed to cause the injuries and damages to the Plaintiffs....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at p. 7).

(Doc. 15 at pp. 1-3). Because these three defendants, like Plaintiffs, are residents of Alabama, Plaintiffs filed a motion to remand this action to state court on January 3, 2019 based on lack of diversity jurisdiction.

The parties do not dispute that the amount in controversy exceeds $75,000. (Doc. 1 at pp. 5-6; Doc. 16 at p. 5). At the time of removal, the operative complaint was Plaintiffs' First Amended Complaint, which had been filed in state court on October 24, 2018. (Doc. 1 at pp. 3-4). In the First Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs asserted a claim for worker's compensation benefits against Globe, a claim under the Alabama Extended Manufacturer's Liability Doctrine (\"AELMD\") against A &amp; G and Yale, a dual capacity of employer as designer of manufacturer claim against Globe, a negligent failure to warn or guard claim against A &amp; G and Yale, and several claims against fictitious defendants. For the purpose of assessing the propriety of removal based on diversity jurisdiction, the citizenship of parties sued under fictitious names is to be disregarded.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201441\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walker v.

According to the First Amended\n   Complaint, Plaintiffs are each residents and citizens of Dallas County, Alabama. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 6). Defendant Globe is incorporated under the laws of Delaware and has its principal place of business in Beverly, Ohio. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 6; Doc. 1-3 at p. 1). Defendant A &amp; G is incorporated under the laws of Ohio and has its principal place of business in Galion, Ohio. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 7; Doc. 1-4 at p.2). Defendant Yale is incorporated under the laws of the state of North Carolina and has its principal place of business in Charlotte, North Carolina. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 7; Doc. 1-5 at p. 2). Because all Plaintiffs and all Defendants were diverse in citizenship and because the amount in controversy was met, federal jurisdiction based on diversity of citizenship was present at the time of removal. Yet, Plaintiffs argue that the case is due to be remanded on two grounds. First, Plaintiffs assert that this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over a claim for worker's compensation benefits under the Alabama Worker's Compensation Act, such as the claim asserted against Globe in the First Amended Complaint. Second, Plaintiffs argue that this case is due to be remanded in its entirety because, shortly after removal and within the time period allowed for amending the complaint without leave of court, Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add three defendants who are residents of Alabama and, therefore, not diverse from Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs argue that, because complete diversity no longer exists, this Court no longer has subject matter jurisdiction and this action is due to be remanded\n   <em>\n    in toto.\n   </em>\n   The Court will address the second ground raised by Plaintiffs first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The issue presented is whether the amendment to the complaint, which essentially substituted three named defendants for previously identified fictitious defendants and which unquestionably destroyed complete diversity, also divested this Court of federal subject matter jurisdiction. On January 2, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, pursuant to Rule 15(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, as a matter of course, as it was filed within 21 days of service of a responsive pleading. (Doc. 15). In the Second Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs added claims against three co-employees of Plaintiff who reside in Alabama. (Doc. 15 at pp. 2-3). The claims asserted against these Defendants were the same or substantially similar to claims that had been made against fictitious defendants in the First Amended Complaint, which had been filed in state court prior to removal. The fictitious defendants were identified in the First Amended Complaint as follows: \"Fictitious Defendants 'A,' 'B,' and 'C' are those Alabama resident adult citizens who were co-employees of Stephen Jamar Shanks whose willful, intentional, and otherwise wrongful acts either caused or contributed to cause the injuries and damages to the Plaintiffs, all of whose true and correct names are unknown to the Plaintiffs at this time but will be substituted by amendment once ascertained.\" (Doc. 1-2 at p. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the removal statutes, or previous decisions in the Eleventh Circuit directly address whether the exact situation presented here constitutes a joinder of additional parties which would invoke the provisions of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   or whether adding named non-diverse defendants in place of fictitious defendants within the time allowed for amending as of course\n   automatically divests the court of subject matter jurisdiction based on diversity. Having reviewed cases in both this jurisdiction, as well as others, and examined the applicable rules and statutes, the Court finds that holdings in other jurisdictions that have addressed this issue are instructive here. Some cases have indicated that the decision to deny or permit joinder that is required by \u00a7 1447(e) must be made by the court even when an amendment is made as a matter of course pursuant to Rule 15(a)(1). For example, in\n   <em>\n    Dunigan v.

If this Court adopts the reasoning set forth in\n   <em>\n    Curry\n   </em>\n   , the amendment naming non-diverse defendants in place of fictitious defendants, which was filed after removal, but within the time allowed for amendments as a matter of course, would result in a finding that diversity and, therefore, subject matter jurisdiction did not exist as of the time of the filing of the amended complaint. Accordingly, remand would seemingly be appropriate without any further analysis. However, if the Court follows the reasoning of courts that find that \u00a7 1447(e) applies to amendments adding parties as a matter of course, then the Court must determine whether to \"(1) deny joinder; or (2) permit joinder and remand [plaintiffs'] case to state court.\"\n   <em>\n    Ingram v.

In this case, it is clear that, at the time the First Amended Complaint was filed in state court, approximately six weeks prior to removal, Plaintiff intended to substitute individual defendants \"who were co-employees of Stephen Jamar Shanks whose willful, intentional, and otherwise wrongful acts either caused or contributed to cause the injuries and damages to the Plaintiffs\" and that Plaintiffs did not know the exact identity of those individuals at that time. (Doc. 1-2 at p. 7). There is no indication in this case that Plaintiffs amended their complaint to add the individual co-employee defendants for the purpose of defeating federal jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams v. Int'l Paper Co.\n   </em>\n   , Civ.

May 5, 2017) (finding the plaintiffs met this factor when \"the amended pleading simply presented the claims that plaintiffs had always intended to bring, under theories that plaintiffs had always intended to raise, against defendants that plaintiffs had always intended to sue\"). The Court finds that this factor weighs in favor of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The second factor to evaluate is whether Plaintiffs have been dilatory in amending their complaint to add the individual co-employee defendants. A &amp; G removed this action approximately six weeks after the first Amended Complaint was filed, and Plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint, which named the individual co-employee defendants, less than one month after the case was removed and within the time allowed for amendments as a matter of course. No scheduling order had been entered as of the date of the amendment, and the case was in its early stages. Under these circumstances, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have not been dilatory in amending their complaint to add the non-diverse defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The third factor to consider is whether Plaintiffs will be significantly injured if the amendment is not allowed. While it is true that a defendant's right to seek a federal forum by removal bears some weight, so too does the plaintiff's interest in avoiding duplicate litigation in two separate courts. If Plaintiffs were not allowed to amend their complaint to add the individual co-employee defendants, they would have to continue to litigate their action against A &amp; G and Yale in this Court and would have to bring their claims against the co-employee defendants in the Circuit Court of Dallas County. Under this scenario, many of the same factual and legal questions would be contested in two separate courts, wasting precious judicial resources and increasing the cost of the litigation for all parties. In addition to having to bear the costs of separate litigation to pursue their claims, Plaintiffs could potentially have to sit through two separate trials concerning the death of their loved one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201828908\">\n    2017 WL 1828908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at * 5 (noting that disallowance of the amendment would place the plaintiffs \"in the unenviable position of having to maintain parallel proceedings ... with the attendant inefficiencies and additional expense that entails\");\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

This case was only recently removed to this Court. No scheduling order has been entered, and the date for amending pleadings and joining parties has not yet even been set. \"Little effort will have been wasted in this case if it is returned to state court, whereas failing to remand it will result in double litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

Under these circumstances, A &amp; G's choice of a federal forum is a mere fortuity that is not entitled to dispositive weight. The expense, inconvenience, and inefficiency of forcing Plaintiffs to maintain separate, parallel suits in two different courts, as well as the doubling of the expenditure of judicial resources favor allowing the amendment. Thus, the Court concludes that the equities in this case favor allowing Plaintiffs to join the non-diverse defendants under \u00a7 1447(e).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201828908\">\n    2017 WL 1828908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Section 1447(e) states that if the Court permits joinder, the action should be remanded to state court.

Unlike the retaliatory discharge provision which was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Reed\n   </em>\n   , which created a cause of action for workers to seek compensation against employers who retaliate against them for pursuing benefits under the AWCA, \u00a7 25-5-11(c) restricts the ability of workers to pursue certain causes of action against co-employees that existed prior to implementation of the AWCA. Under these circumstances, it can hardly be said that Plaintiff's action against the co-employees \"arises under\" workmen's compensation laws for the purpose of \u00a7 1445(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The Court finds no grounds to exercise any discretionary authority it may have to sever the co-employee claims from the third-party tort claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed.

Because the issue of the mechanism of the injury to Shanks will be contested based on the allegations of the complaint, as well as damages, there will clearly be common questions of fact in the co-employee claims and the third-party tort claims. Judicial economy is best served under these circumstances by keeping the co-employee claim joined to the third-party tort claim. Based on the foregoing, the Court finds that Plaintiff's co-employee action is not required to be nor should be severed from the remaining tort claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     CONCLUSION\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Because the addition of non-diverse co-employee defendants in this case destroys complete diversity and because the Court finds no ground for severance of the co-employee claims from the third-party tort claims, this action is due to be remanded.
