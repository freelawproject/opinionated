Jenkins did not detain Rios based on a suspected civil immigration violation before communicating with federal authorities. Instead, Jenkins held Rios for up to 48 additional hours pursuant to the immigration detainer and administrative warrant issued by ICE. As indicated above, the detainer specifically requested that Jenkins maintain custody of Rios for an additional 48 hours beyond the time when he would otherwise have been released from the sheriff's custody. And unlike Santos, Jenkins received the ICE detainer and administrative warrant long before the plaintiff's detention was temporarily extended. While Rios argues that the detainer is \"merely a request\" and therefore \"does not constitute 'ICE's express authorization or direction' within the meaning of Santos,\" this argument finds no support in the Fourth Circuit's decision.

We conclude that the deputies seized Santos when Deputy Openshaw told her to remain seated-after they had learned of the outstanding ICE warrant but before dispatch confirmed with ICE that the warrant was active.
