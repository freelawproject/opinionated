Rayes, United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   Before the Court is Defendant Insys Therapeutics Incorporated's (\"Insys\") motion to dismiss (Doc. 97), which is fully briefed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   For the reasons stated below, Insys' motion is granted in part and denied in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Anthem insures and administers employer-sponsored group health insurance benefits plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Doc. 84 \u00b6 53.) Anthem offers fully insured and self-funded plans. For the fully insured plans, Anthem directly insures the plan, resolves benefit claims, and makes benefit payments from its own assets. (\u00b6 54.) In contrast, self-funded plans are funded by the employer sponsor, while Anthem operates as the claims administrator for the plans. (\u00b6 55.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As part of Anthem's benefit plans, members may be entitled to prescription drug coverage. Plan members with prescription drug coverage may be reimbursed for medications if certain conditions are met, including that the drug is available on Anthem's drug list. (\u00b6 47.) Subsys, an opioid manufactured, marketed, and sold by Insys, is not on Anthem's drug list. (\u00b6\u00b6 1, 47.) Anthem's plan members, however, still may be reimbursed for Insys prescriptions if: (1) the prescription meets the Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\") approved indication (commonly referred to as \"on-label use\") and (2) the prescriber or patient obtain a prior authorization from\n   Anthem. (\u00b6\u00b6 49-51.) To obtain prior authorization, Anthem requires the prescriber to confirm that the patient has a diagnosis of cancer with breakthrough pain and that the patient is already receiving opioids and is tolerant to opioid therapy, which is the only approved FDA use. (\u00b6\u00b6 39, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Subsys' profitability is constrained by the limited number of patients with a qualifying diagnosis for on-label use. (\u00b6 3.) If, however, Insys were able to successfully have Subsys prescribed for off-label uses it could expand the eligible patient population and increase its profitability. Off-label refers to use of an FDA approved drug for any purpose, or in any manner, other than what is described in the drug's labeling. (\u00b6\u00b6 3, 36.) Anthem, like many insurers, will not reimburse for off-label use of Subsys. (\u00b6\u00b6 2, 4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Faced with the limited on-label patient population and insurers unwilling to reimburse for off-label use, Insys developed a scheme to unlawfully obtain reimbursements from insurers, including Anthem, for off-label prescriptions of Subsys.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Efforts to Induce Prescribers to Write Off-Label Prescriptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   A major part of Insys' scheme was to convince prescribers to write off-label prescriptions for Subsys.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Insys paid illegal kickbacks to prescribers identified as high-volume high-dose prescribers. (\u00b6\u00b6 67, 112-18.) Insys ranked its targeted prescribers without screening for eligible patient populations. (\u00b6\u00b6 65-66.) Several Subsys' prescribers have been criminally convicted of accepting kickbacks, at least two of which prescribed Subsys to Anthem members that did not have an underlying cancer diagnosis. (\u00b6\u00b6 112-18, 130.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Aside from kickbacks, Insys also offered free administrative services to prescribers. Specifically, Insys' reimbursement unit handled the prior authorization process on behalf of prescribers. (\u00b6 131.) Aware that Anthem, like many other insurers, prohibits anyone other than plan members, member representatives, or the prescriber to request prior authorization, employees in Insys' reimbursement unit took efforts to conceal or misrepresent their identity when seeking prior authorization for Subsys. (\u00b6\u00b6 133-34.) For instance, in an attempt to mislead insurers about the nature of their employment, Insys' employees would call from blocked phone numbers and represent that they were calling from the prescriber's office. (\u00b6\u00b6 135-36.) Moreover, by offering to handle the prior authorization process for prescribers Insys controlled the fraudulent representations made to insurers, including Anthem. (\u00b6\u00b6 131-32.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Efforts to Induce Insurers to Reimburse for Off-Label Prescriptions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As part of its scheme, Insys drafted and disseminated letters of medical necessity to prescribers. (\u00b6 99.) Ordinarily, these letters are provided to aid insurers in their coverage decision for benefit claims. (\u00b6 99.) Insys adapted its template letters to maximize the likelihood of garnering prior authorization. (\u00b6 99.) For instance, Insys' self-proclaimed \"strong\" letter included representations about the provider's experience with Subsys, the patient's need for Subsys, and the provider's expectation that the patient's medical necessity for Subsys\n   would \"continue for a long-long period.\" (\u00b6\u00b6 101-02.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   To further alleviate the burden of the prior authorization process on prescribers and elicit coverage for off-label Subsys prescriptions, Insys provided free administrative services like handling prior authorization requests for prescribers. Because Insys understood that insurers would not approve prior authorizations for off-label uses of Subsys, Insys employees would represent to the insurer that the patient had a cancer diagnosis and was tolerant to opioids even when that was not the case. (\u00b6\u00b6 142, 146.) Insys employees were directed to falsely confirm lists of tried and failed medications that would help qualify the patient for prior-authorization to try Subsys. (\u00b6 147.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In an effort to mislead insurers, Insys also provided employees with scripts and training on how to answer prior-authorization questions. One such script, which Insys called \"the spiel,\" read: \"The physician is aware that the medication is intended for the management of breakthrough pain in cancer patients. The physician is treating the patient for their pain (or breakthrough pain, whichever is applicable).\" (\u00b6\u00b6 143-45.) Strategically and deliberately omitted from the script was the phrase cancer diagnosis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Elizabeth Gurrieri, the Insys employee who managed the reimbursement unit and later pleaded guilty to federal crimes for her role in Insys' illegal scheme, admitted that she \"specifically directed employees to lie using a number of different methods to mislead insurers ... [and] that multiple employees as well as Ms. Gurrieri actually lied to insurers ... in order to gain prior authorization.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\u00b6 148.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Efforts to Eliminate Co-Payment Obligations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The co-payment obligations of Anthem's plan members presented a final hurdle. Anthem, like most insurers, contractually requires that plan members pay for a portion of the medical services or prescriptions consumed by that member. This obligation, which is commonly referred to as a co-payment or co-pay, is ordinarily a percentage of the total cost for the medical service or prescription consumed by the member. (\u00b6\u00b6 155-56.) That means that the more expensive the treatment or prescription, the higher the co-payment obligation. This requirement creates an incentive for members to be sensitive to the cost of their healthcare and to act prudently in choosing services and prescriptions. (\u00b6\u00b6 157-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Subsys is extremely expensive, especially as dosage strengths are increased. (\u00b6 46.) Aware that co-pay obligations limit the willingness of patients to use Subsys rather than more affordable opioids, Insys habitually eliminated patient co-pay obligations for the drug. (\u00b6 154.) One way in which Insys eliminated co-pay obligations was to issue a super voucher to the pharmacy, in which Insys paid the co-pay obligation on behalf of the patient. (\u00b6\u00b6 91-98, 159-60.) With their co-pay obligations eliminated, Anthem's members disregarded their contractual incentive to seek a less expensive alternative and filled Subsys prescriptions they otherwise would not have filled. (\u00b6\u00b6 154, 161-63.) In doing so, Anthem was forced to reimburse for Subsys prescriptions it otherwise would not have paid for had the members incurred the co-payments. (\u00b6\u00b6 154, 161-63.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Harm Caused by Insys' Scheme\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Anthem conducted a retrospective review of all claims for reimbursement for\n   Subsys prescriptions and determined that 54% of members with Subsys prescriptions that had been reimbursed by Anthem did not actually have an underlying cancer diagnosis. (\u00b6 196.) This equates to over $ 19 million in reimbursements Anthem made for Subsys prescriptions that were not covered by Anthem's plans. (\u00b6 198.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Anthem filed an amended complaint in the instant action on July 23, 2018, asserting multiple claims against Insys, including: statutory claims for deceptive, unfair, and unlawful business practices (Count I), and common law claims for fraud (Count II), negligent misrepresentation (Count III), unjust enrichment (Count IV), civil conspiracy (Count V), and tortious interference with a contract (Count VI). (Doc. 84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Insys now moves to dismiss all of Anthem's claims. First, Insys contends that Anthem's claims should be dismissed because they are preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201001\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   , and the Federal Drug and Cosmetics Act (\"FDCA\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20301\">\n    21 U.S.C. \u00a7 301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   Next, Insys argues that Anthem lacks Article III standing to bring its claims. Finally, Insys argues that Anthem fails to state a claim for which relief can be granted under Rule 12(b)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Preemption\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <strong>\n    1. ERISA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   There are two strands to ERISA's powerful preemptive force. First, ERISA section 514(a) expressly preempts all state laws that \"relate to any employee benefit plan.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201144\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). Second, ERISA section 502(a) contains a comprehensive scheme of civil remedies to enforce ERISA's provisions.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201132\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). A state cause of action that would fall within the scope of this scheme of remedies is preempted as conflicting with the intended exclusivity of the ERISA remedial scheme, even if those causes of action would not necessarily be preempted by section 514(a).\n   <em>\n    Cleghorn v. Blue Shield of California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8961279\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/408/1222/#p1225\">\n    408 F.3d 1222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1225 (9th Cir. 2005). Insys contends that both strands apply to Anthem's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Section 514(a)\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Section 514(a) provides that, subject to various exceptions not applicable here, ERISA \"supersede[s] any and all State laws insofar as they may ... relate to any employee benefit plan.\" \u00a7 1144(a). \"A law 'relates to' an employee benefit plan, in the normal sense of the phrase, if it has a connection with or reference to such a plan.\"\n   <em>\n    Shaw v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/#p96\">\n    463 U.S. 85\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 96-97,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/#p96\">\n    103 S.Ct. 2890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6191473\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/463/85/#p96\">\n    77 L.Ed.2d 490\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1983). A state law demonstrates the forbidden \"reference to\" an ERISA plan when it \"acts immediately\n   and exclusively upon ERISA plans ... or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\"\n   <em>\n    Cal. Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Const., N.A., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595471\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/316/#p325\">\n    519 U.S. 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595471\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/316/#p325\">\n    117 S.Ct. 832\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11595471\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/519/316/#p325\">\n    136 L.Ed.2d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997). On the other hand, in determining whether a state law has a \"connection with\" an ERISA plan the Ninth Circuit applies a \"relationship test\" under which \"a state law claim is preempted when the claim bears on an ERISA-regulated relationship,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the relationship between plan and plan member, between plan and employer, between employer and employee.\"\n   <em>\n    Paulsen v. CNF Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5656447\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/1061/#p1082\">\n    559 F.3d 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (9th Cir. 2009). Insys argues that Anthem's claims have a \"connection with\" and \"reference to\" ERISA. The Court disagrees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Common law fraud does not refer to ERISA plans, as it is a law of general applicability that neither \"acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans,\" nor relies upon the existence of ERISA plans to operate.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Paulsen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5656447\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/559/1061/#p1082\">\n    559 F.3d at 1082\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Notwithstanding Anthem's obligation to prove that Insys made misrepresentations and received payments for non-covered benefits, the Court will not have to \"interpret the plan in any manner that would substantially effect the rights and obligations established by the employee benefit plan in this case.\"\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spinedex v. Physical Therapy, U.S.A., Inc. v. Arizona\n   </em>\n   , No. 04-CV-1576-PHX-JAT,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203821387\">\n    2005 WL 3821387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 (D. Ariz. Nov. 9, 2005)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The same is true for Anthem's claims for negligent misrepresentation, unjust enrichment, civil conspiracy, tortious interference with contract, and statutory claims for unfair and deceptive competition and practices. This conclusion is supported by the overwhelming weight of authority. Courts addressing arguments that ERISA preempts similar state law claims under factually analogous circumstances have found the claims not preempted.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Spinedex\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2005%20WL%203821387\">\n    2005 WL 3821387\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *8 ;\n   <em>\n    Almont Ambulatory Surgery Center, LLC v.

Anthem's complaint does not allege claims which ordinarily implicate an ERISA relationship-i.e., charging an ERISA entity with an alleged improper administration of an ERISA plan, mishandling of plan benefits, or failure to pay covered benefits.

Instead, Insys argues that Anthem's claims are irreparably defective and must be dismissed because Anthem did not affirmatively plead that a particular state's law applies. Neither the language of Rule 12(b)(6) nor\n   <em>\n    Twombly\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Iqbal\n   </em>\n   impose such an obligation, however.

Insys puts forth separate arguments for Counts I through V and Count VI. The thrust of Insys' argument with respect to Counts I through V is that, when prescribing Subsys, providers were exercising their independent medical judgment, which breaks the causal chain between Insys' actions and Anthem's alleged injury. (Doc. 129 at 15.) As pled, however, the complaint alleges that prescribers were not exercising independent medical judgment. That is, prescribers were prescribing Subsys in exchange for kickbacks. (Doc. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 112-31.) Notwithstanding whether prescribers were exercising independent medical judgment, Anthem also alleges that Insys made or assisted in making prior authorization requests in which it was represented that \"the patient had a cancer diagnosis and was tolerant to opioids even when that was not the case.\" (\u00b6 132.) Aware that Anthem and other insurers \"would not authorize payment for non-indicated uses of Subsys,\" Insys allegedly made these representations with the intent induce reimbursement that otherwise would not have been made. (\u00b6\u00b6 132, 137-40, 142.) These allegations sufficiently support causation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As to Count VI, Anthem's tortious interference with contract claim attempts to impose liability based on Insys' super voucher program, which \"intentionally interfer[ed] with Anthem's contracts with its members,\" and caused \"Anthem members to fill prescriptions that they otherwise would not have filled.\" (Doc. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 162, 244.) Both parties rely on Arizona law for the elements of a tortious interference claim. The Court will do the same. In Arizona, to recover for the tort of intentional interference with contractual relations, a plaintiff must prove five elements: \"(1) existence of a valid contractual relationship, (2) knowledge of the relationship on the part of the interferor, (3) intentional interference inducing or causing a breach, (4) resultant damage to the party whose\n   relationship has been disrupted, and (5) that the defendant acted improperly.\"\n   <em>\n    Wells Fargo Bank v.

The Court agrees. At most, Anthem alleges that Insys interfered with a \"contractual incentive.\" (Doc. 84 \u00b6\u00b6 244-45.) Anthem cites no authority that inducing a party to forego a contractual incentive constitutes a breach.
