The Supreme Court has explained,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   A claim has facial plausibility when the plaintiff pleads factual content that allows the court to draw the reasonable inference that the defendant is liable for the misconduct alleged. The plausibility standard is not akin to a \"probability\n   requirement,\" but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully. Where a complaint pleads facts that are \"merely consistent with\" a defendant's liability, it \"stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Ashcroft v.

Buzzfeed's Argument that Liability Regarding Photographs No. 17 and 24 is Barred by the DMCA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court declines to consider whether Buzzfeed's alleged use of Photographs No. 17 and 24 would fall under the DMCA's \u00a7 512(c) safe harbor provision, because\n   those two photographs have been dismissed as time-barred.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   D. Buzzfeed's Argument that Minden Pictures' Damages Claims Should be Reduced\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Buzzfeed argues that Minden Pictures' claims for damages should be pared back because (1) the Amended Complaint is insufficient to state a claim as to Buzzfeed's willfulness, so any claim for enhanced damages should be dismissed; (2) statutory damages and attorney's fees should be dismissed regarding Photographs No. 7-11, 16, 20, 22, 26-27, and 29 for Minden Pictures' failure to register them in a timely manner under the Copyright Act; and (3) five sets of the photographs\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   were registered as \"collective works\" and Minden Pictures is therefore entitled to only one award of statutory damages per set.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss at 20-23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Minden Pictures responds that (1) Buzzfeed's alleged infringement of\n   <em>\n    forty\n   </em>\n   of its photographs is enough for this Court to infer willfulness; (2) regarding Buzzfeed's argument that the photographs registered as collective works should be considered as sets for statutory damages calculations, the number of copyright registrations is not determinative of the number of statutory damage awards.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 13-15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Court will now consider Buzzfeed's first argument regarding enhanced damages. To prove \"willfulness\" under \u00a7 504(c)(2) the Copyright Act for purposes of enhancing statutory damages, the plaintiff must show (1) that the defendant was actually aware of the infringing activity, or (2) that the defendant's actions were the result of \"reckless disregard\" for, or \"willful blindness\" to, the copyright holder's rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Aimster Copyright Litigation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1530199\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/334/643/#p650\">\n    334 F.3d 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 650 (7th Cir. 2003) ;\n   <em>\n    Lipton v.

Compl. \u00b6 19. This, standing alone, is insufficient factual support for the allegation that Buzzfeed's infringement was willful. The Court finds that Minden Pictures has not adequately alleged Defendants' willfulness related to its alleged copyright infringement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   In response to Buzzfeed's second argument regarding timely registration, Minden Pictures does not dispute that it is only able to seek statutory damages \"for those claims for which there is timely registration.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pl.'s Opp. at 13 (internal quotations omitted).

Here, the threshold question is, did the proto-copyright-holder\n   <em>\n    register\n   </em>\n   the material as one collective work? That is, for the purposes of registration, did they consider it to be one work, or multiple works?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The Court finds that under these facts - where a copyright holder chose to \"assemble[ ] into a collective whole\" certain photographs during the registration of its copyright, i.e. registering them in sets rather than as individual photographic works - the copyright holder has created a \"collective work\" and \"compilation\" as those terms are defined in \u00a7 101.
