ACOSTA, United States Magistrate Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    Introduction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Plaintiffs Theodore Dauven and his daughter, Christiana Dauven (collectively, the \"Dauvens\"), seek money damages from defendant U.S. Bancorp (\"Bancorp\") for the conversion of the Dauvens' personal property left at a residence in Lake Oswego, Oregon (the \"Property\") following their eviction in May 2011. The Dauvens allege Bancorp wrongfully removed and disposed of personal items, including furniture, appliances, home goods, and motor vehicles, left at the Property after the Dauvens were evicted without first providing them written notice as required by Chapters 90 and 105 of the Oregon Revised Statutes (\"ORS\"). Before the court is Bancorp's Motion to Dismiss (\"Motion\") pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure (\"Rule\") 12(b)(6). (Def. U.S. Bancorp's Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 8 (\"Motion\").) Bancorp moves to dismiss the Complaint in its entirety, alleging it is barred by claim preclusion, issue preclusion, and the statute of limitations. For the reasons that follow, Bancorp's Motion should be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    Preliminary Procedural Matter\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Bancorp requests the court take judicial notice of several documents and previous lawsuits involving the Dauvens. Specifically, Bancorp seeks judicial notice of the following documents: (1) the docket report for\n   <em>\n    Theodore (Ted) Dauven v. U.S. Bancorp\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:13-cv-00844-AC (\"\n   <em>\n    Dauven II\n   </em>\n   \"), filed in United States District Court for the District of Oregon on May 20, 2013; (2) the Findings and Recommendation issued by this court in\n   <em>\n    Dauven II\n   </em>\n   on March 2, 2015; (3) the Order issued on May 12, 2015 by Judge Brown adopting the Findings and Recommendation in\n   <em>\n    Dauven II\n   </em>\n   ; (4) the judgment entered in\n   <em>\n    Dauven II\n   </em>\n   ; and (5) the Findings and Recommendation issued by Judge Papak on June 7, 2010, in\n   <em>\n    Barbara G. Dauven v. U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n\n   </em>\n   , Case No. 3:09-cv-01471-PK (\"\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   \"), filed in United States District Court for the District of Oregon on December 16, 2009. (Def. U.S. Bancorp's Req. for Judicial Notice, ECF No. 9 (\"Req. for Judicial Notice\"), at 2-3.) Bancorp also requests the court take judicial notice of 12 lawsuits to which the Dauvens have been party-six related to the Dauvens' eviction from the Property and six initiated by the Dauvens against various parties regarding unrelated matters. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.) Neither party objects to the court taking judicial notice of the existence or content of the documents submitted or the previous lawsuits involving the Dauvens.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bancorp is offering materials outside of the pleadings in support of a motion to dismiss. In general, material outside the pleadings may not be considered in ruling on a motion to dismiss unless the motion is treated as one for summary judgment and the parties are \"given reasonable opportunity to present all materials made pertinent to such motion by Rule 56.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacobson v.

There are two exceptions to this rule. First, a court may consider \"material which is properly submitted to the court as part of the complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    Lee v. Cty of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=240%20F.3d%20754\">\n    240 F.3d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 774 (9th Cir. 2001),\n   <em>\n    overruled on other grounds by\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Galbraith v.

The second exception is that under Federal Rule of Evidence (\"FRE\") 201, the court may take judicial notice of \"matters of public record.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11357676\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/307/1119/#p1125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   FRE 201 allows judicial notice of facts (1) that are generally known within the court's jurisdiction; or \"(2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\" FED. R. EVID. 201(b). In addition to the meeting the requirements of FRE 201, the fact to be noticed must be relevant to the matter at hand.\n   <em>\n    Pacific Gas and Elec. Co. v.

However, a court may not take judicial notice of facts presented in those documents or in court opinions for the purpose of considering those facts to be established in the case currently before them.\n   <em>\n    Wyatt v.

Further, the documents offered are judicial records,\n   <em>\n    Lee v. City of Los Angeles\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11100379\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/250/668/#p688\">\n    250 F.3d 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 688-89 (9th Cir. 2001), they relate to proceedings that involve the same parties reflected in the documents,\n   <em>\n    Egan v. Teets\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"696225\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/251/571/#p577\">\n    251 F.2d 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 577-79 (9th Cir. 1957), and recount judicial developments that \"affect [the court's] consideration of the various issues presented,\"\n   <em>\n    Bryant v.

The six state and federal lawsuits in which various issues stemming from the Dauvens' eviction\n   were previously adjudicated are similarly matters of public record that may be noticed by this court. Bancorp does not explain, however, and the court cannot surmise, how the six lawsuits initiated by the Dauvens for claims unrelated to the eviction are relevant to the instant dispute. Because those lawsuits are not relevant here, they will not be considered. The court therefore takes judicial notice of the five documents listed above and the six previous lawsuits addressing the Dauvens' eviction from the Property adjudicated prior to the filing of the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    I. The Dauvens' Eviction\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2006, the Dauvens leased the Property, located at 13120 SW Thoma Road in Lake Oswego, Oregon, from its owner, Jerry Reeves (\"Reeves\"). (Notice of Removal of Civil Action, ECF No. 1 (\"Notice of Removal\"), Ex. 1, at 1-9\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\"Compl.\"), \u00b6 5.) In 2008, Reeves defaulted on a loan secured by the Property, resulting in its foreclosure on July 1, 2009. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 6, 9.) On August 12, 2009, the Dauvens received a formal 90-day notice to vacate, informing them of the foreclosure and instructing them to vacate the Property within 90 days. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 11.) Believing the eviction was wrongful, the Dauvens refused to leave the Property as instructed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Dauvens' unwillingness to leave the Property prompted U.S. Bank National Association (\"U.S. Bank\") to file a forcible entry and detainer (\"FED\") action in the Circuit Court of the State of Oregon for the County of Clackamas.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. All Occupants of the Premises, Ted Dauven, Barbara Dauven\n   </em>\n   , Case No. FE 092002 (Clackamas Cty. Cir. Ct.). On December 16, 2009, the Dauvens appeared before Circuit Court Judge Norby, arguing the foreclosure on the Property and resulting 90-day notice to vacate had been replete with \"legal irregularities and violations.\" (Compl. \u00b6 16.) Finding the Dauvens' arguments unpersuasive, Judge Norby entered judgment in favor of U.S. Bank on December 29, 2009, and ordered the Dauvens to relinquish possession of the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Dauvens appealed the circuit court judgment and remained steadfast in their refusal to leave the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17-19.) The Oregon Court of Appeals and the Oregon Supreme Court subsequently denied the Dauvens' appeals. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Consequently, U.S. Bank brought a second FED action against the Dauvens in April 2011.\n   <em>\n    U.S. Bank Nat'l Ass'n v. Ted Dauven and Barbara Dauven\n   </em>\n   , Case No. FE 110602 (Clackamas Cty. Cir. Ct.). In opposition, the Dauvens again argued the foreclosure had been legally deficient. Further, the Dauvens challenged the first FED proceeding and the \"errant dismissal\" of their subsequent appeals. (Compl. \u00b6 20.) The Dauvens' legal arguments were unavailing, and judgment was entered in favor of U. S. Bank on May 16, 2011. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Further appeals and attempts to challenge the legitimacy of the foreclosure and eviction were all \"rejected by the different Courts.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On May 20, 2011, the Dauvens vacated the Property and moved in with their neighbor, Joanne Balkovic (\"Mrs. Balkovic\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24.) The close proximity of Mrs. Balkovic's residence allowed the Dauvens to \"monitor\" personal possessions left\n   behind at the Property following their eviction. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) On June 22, 2011, the Dauvens were presented with a restraining order by the Clackamas County Sheriff's Office on Mrs. Balkovic's behalf. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.) The order alleged the Dauvens had financially and emotionally abused Mrs. Balkovic and required them to vacate Mrs. Balkovic's home. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) \"Within a week after the Dauvens were removed from the Balkovic residence, all [of the personal possessions remaining at the Property were] removed and [disposed] of without\" notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     II. Dauven I\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On December 16, 2009, the Dauvens initiated a lawsuit in federal court against U.S. Bank, Bancorp, and Wells Fargo National Association (\"Wells Fargo\") (collectively, the \"Banks\"), asserting several claims arising from the ongoing efforts to evict the Dauvens from the Property. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Compl., ECF No. 2.) The complaint sought relief for a variety of state law claims against each defendant separately, but alleged only one claim - trespass asserted against all defendants generally-that implicated Bancorp. (Req. for Judicial Notice, Ex. 5, at 2-4.) At the time of filing, the first FED action was pending in state court and the Dauvens continued to reside at the Property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On January 20, 2010, the Dauvens filed an Amended Complaint to show cause regarding the court's subject matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Dauven v.

Or. Nov. 7, 2012). The Dauvens filed a Second Amended Complaint on July 30, 2010, and a Third Amended Complaint on December 30, 2010 - twice amending the complaint after the dismissal of several claims on motions filed by the Banks.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205449628\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On July 20, 2011, the Dauvens requested leave to file a Fourth Amended Complaint. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Mot./Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Leave to File Am. Compl., ECF No. 61, Attach. 1.) Among other things, the proposed amendments included a new claim for conversion alleged against the Banks following the removal and disposal of the Dauvens' personal possessions from the Property in the weeks prior. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 33-34.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) All of the newly proposed claims, including the claim for conversion, were predicated on the alleged illegality of the foreclosure on the Property and the alleged deficiency of the 90-day notice to vacate given to the Dauvens. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 29-34.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On September 20, 2011, Judge Papak issued an Opinion and Order denying the motion to amend. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Op. and Order, ECF No. 67, at 7.) Though timely asserted, Judge Papak determined the proposed claims were futile because the legal theories upon which they relied-the sufficiency of the foreclosure and 90-day notice to vacate - were \"previously ... litigated and rejected by the state court in two earlier FED actions.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Accordingly, Judge Papak found the Dauvens were \"precluded from pursuing claims based on those theories.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In a footnote, however, Judge Papak noted the proposed conversion claim included \"no allegations that defendants failed to follow the requirements of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2090.425\">\n    Or.

The proposed claim alleged the Dauvens were entitled to written notice prior to the removal and disposal of the belongings left at the Property following their eviction, and that such notice was not provided in violation of ORS 90.425 and 105.165. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On September 7, 2012, Judge Papak issued a Findings and Recommendation addressing Mr. Dauven's motion to amend and the Banks' motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205449632\">\n    2012 WL 5449632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1. With respect to the motion to amend, Judge Papak determined the motion should be denied, finding, in part, that the proposed claim would be futile because it failed to state a claim and would certainly fail on summary judgment if allowed to proceed.\n   <em>\n    Dauven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205449632\">\n    2012 WL 5449632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.

As relevant here, the conversion claim alleged the Banks had wrongfully evicted the Dauvens from their home, forcing them to leave most of their possessions behind.

Because a variety of claims asserted by the Dauvens against Bancorp have previously been adjudicated in multiple courts, Bancorp contends the instant case is barred by claim preclusion. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Specifically, Bancorp asserts that all prior actions, including the state FED actions, have involved Bancorp and have involved the same factual transaction-the Dauvens' eviction and the subsequent loss of their belongings left at the Property. The Dauvens' reject Bancorp's contention that claim preclusion applies here. The Dauvens argue Judge Brown ultimately dismissed the conversion claim asserted in\n   <em>\n    Dauven II\n   </em>\n   , without prejudice, based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, not claim preclusion.

First, the Oregon rule regarding claim preclusion explicitly prohibits a\n   <em>\n    plaintiff\n   </em>\n   who has previously prosecuted an action against a\n   <em>\n    defendant\n   </em>\n   from bringing a second action against the\n   <em>\n    same defendant\n   </em>\n   for the same claim. The Dauvens were defendants, not plaintiffs, in both FED actions, and therefore neither case can serve to preclude the Dauvens from asserting the current claim against Bancorp. Second, both FED actions were litigated through to a final judgment prior to the removal and disposal of the Dauvens' belongings from the Property. Thus, even if the FED actions could serve as possible bases for claim preclusion in this case, the claim asserted here could not have been joined in those actions. Accordingly, the previous state FED actions do not preclude the Dauvens' current conversion claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   But, the Dauvens brought suit as plaintiffs against defendant Bancorp in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , where a final judgment was issued in favor of Bancorp. Because the Dauvens again assert legal claims against defendant Bancorp,\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   may preclude the current suit if the claim preclusion elements are met. There is no disagreement between the parties that the conversion claim currently before the court stems from the same factual transaction - the Dauvens' eviction from the Property - at the heart of\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n   Both parties, however, neglected to address the additional claim preclusion elements in their briefs. Nevertheless, the court still must analyze whether the other elements are met with respect to\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The second element is met if the plaintiff seeks alternative or additional remedies\n   to those sought in the previous suit.\n   <em>\n    Drews\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2199489\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/310/134/#p140\">\n    310 Or. at 139-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2199489\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/310/134/#p140\">\n    795 P.2d 531\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Dauvens' current lawsuit seeks $250,000 in money damages to compensate for the loss of their personal possessions. The money damages sought in this case are additional to the remedies sought for the various claims at issue in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n   Thus, the second element is met here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The third element - which highlights the strong preference exhibited in Oregon case law for the resolution of all possible claims in one proceeding - is met if the claim alleged could have been joined and fairly litigated in the prior action.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2199489\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/310/134/#p140\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Though\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   was filed on December 16, 2009, well over a year before the Dauvens actually vacated the property following the second FED proceeding, the Dauvens could have joined the conversion claim alleged here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Approximately one month after the Dauvens' possessions were removed from the Property in June 2011, Mr. Dauven moved to file a Fourth Amended Complaint, seeking to assert a new claim for conversion that hinged on the alleged illegality of the foreclosure and insufficiency of the 90-day notice to vacate. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 61.) Judge Papak denied the motion, determining amendment would be futile because the Dauvens were precluded from relying on the legal theories underlying the claim. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , ECF No. 6-7.) He did not, however, find that an amendment to add a claim for conversion would cause undue delay or otherwise prejudice the Banks. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7-8.) Rather, Judge Papak concluded that Mr. Dauven's close-in-time attempt to amend the complaint to add new claims following the eviction was \"not indicative of unreasonable delay\" that would cause prejudice to the defendants. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) Thus, if Mr. Dauven had asserted an alternative legal basis for the proposed conversion claim that was not futile, Judge Papak's opinion implies he would have permitted Mr. Dauven to amend the complaint to include new claims related to the Dauvens' eviction and loss of personal property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Almost eight months after the Dauvens' possessions were removed, Mr. Dauven again sought leave to amend, this time asserting a conversion claim predicated on the same notice requirements at issue here. Judge Papak denied the motion, reasoning, in part, that \"[Mr. Dauven] was aware of the newly alleged facts within weeks after being evicted from the property in May 2011,\" but waited until after discovery had closed before asserting the proposed claims.\n   <em>\n    Dauven\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%205449632\">\n    2012 WL 5449632\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *5. Mr. Dauven was similarly aware of those facts when he attempted to amend the complaint in July 2011 and chose not to include the lack of notice as an alternative ground on which to allege the proposed conversion claim he sought to add. Such pleading decisions are matters of personal discretion and cannot negate the fact that the claim for conversion, as it currently stands before this court, could have been joined in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   if its addition would not have been futile. The third element therefore is met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The claim preclusion elements are all met here. The Dauvens could have asserted the current conversion claim in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   after their possessions were removed from the Property in June 2011. Thus, the Dauvens' claim is barred by claim preclusion and should be dismissed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    2.

Summary\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Dauvens' current claim is not precluded by the previous state FED proceedings or\n   <em>\n    Dauven II.\n   </em>\n   However, the Dauvens could have, and should have, amended the complaint in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   in the weeks following their eviction and loss of property in June 2011 to add all new claims borne from those events. Such amendments, had they stated a viable claim for relief, likely would have been timely and joined by the court. The Dauvens had an obligation under Oregon law to assert all claims, alternative legal theories, and possible grounds for relief arising from their eviction and loss of property in one action but they did not, and they cannot now attempt to bring suit on a theory they failed to timely assert in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n   The Dauvens' status as self-represented litigants does not relax the obligation of this court to strictly apply the principles of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   so that they may bring a new lawsuit every time they come across a new legal theory upon which they might seek redress. Consequently, the claim currently before the court is barred by claim preclusion and Bancorp's Motion should be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    C. Issue Preclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As alleged, the Dauvens' conversion claim is centered on Bancorp's failure to provide written notice, pursuant to ORS 90.425 and 105.165, prior to removing and disposing of the Dauvens' belongings from the Property. (Compl., at 8.) Bancorp alleges the\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   court considered the issue of whether the Dauvens were entitled to statutory notice before their possessions were removed, and that the court conclusively determined the notice requirements did not apply because the Dauvens were not \"tenants\" as defined by those statutes. (Motion, at 7-8.) Consequently, Bancorp argues issue preclusion bars the Dauvens from basing their current claim on their right to statutory notice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In response, the Dauvens allege the conversion claim was never litigated prior to this lawsuit. (Pl.'s Resp., at 7.) Because Bancorp relies solely on\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Oregon preclusion law governs whether issue preclusion applies in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   \"Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, a party is bound by the determination of a particular issue in an earlier proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Minihan v.

Though Ms. Dauven was no longer a named plaintiff when Mr. Dauven asserted the issue of statutory notice in the proposed Fifth Amended Complaint, she was a party in privity because her interests were represented by Mr. Dauven.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Secor Invs., LLC v.

In fact,\n   Mr. Dauven sought to reinstate Ms. Dauven as a plaintiff in the proposed Fifth Amended Complaint, arguing the addition would have been \"entirely proper because of the new cause of action in which Plaintiff and his wife and daughter all share the same interest and assert the same claim and the same relief.\" (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Mot. and Mem. in Supp. of Mot. for Leave to File Suppl. and Am.

Thus, the first and fourth requirements are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Whether the statutory notice issue was \"actually litigated,\" however, is not as clear. \"An issue is 'actually litigated' when 'the factual and legal issues that the plaintiff raises in the second case were\n   <em>\n    actually\n   </em>\n   adjudicated and essential to the determination of the first case.\"\n   <em>\n    Ram Technical Servs., Inc. v.

More specifically, \"[w]hen an issue is properly raised, by the pleadings\n   <em>\n    or otherwise\n   </em>\n   , and is submitted for determination, and is determined, the issue is actually litigated.\" RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF JUDGMENTS \u00a7 27 cmt. d (Am. Law Inst. 1982) (emphasis added). Here, Mr. Dauven properly raised the issue when he moved to file a Fifth Amended Complaint to add a claim for gross negligence based on the apparent lack of statutory notice, arguing the Dauvens' possessions had been removed without warning one month after vacating the Property. Judge Papak considered the proposed claim under both Rule 12(b)(6) and summary judgment standards, and determined it was futile because ORS 90.425 is inapplicable unless the aggrieved party qualifies as a \"tenant\" under that statute - which Mr. Dauven did not. Based on that determination, Judge Papak recommended denying leave to amend, a recommendation subsequently considered and adopted by Judge Hernandez. Because the issue of whether the Dauvens were entitled to statutory notice under Chapter 90 of the Oregon Revised Statutes was fully briefed by the parties and was essential to the denial of leave to amend by two separate judges, the statutory notice issue was actually litigated in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The first, second, and fourth elements are met here, thus the burden shifts to the Dauvens to demonstrate the third and fifth issue preclusion elements are not met. The Dauvens offer little argument with respect to issue preclusion, simply asserting the eviction complaint was filed under ORS 105.165, which incorporates by reference the notice requirements of ORS 90.425. (Pl.'s Resp., at 7.) While that may be so, the Dauvens' argument fails to establish issue preclusion is inapplicable here. First, federal court proceedings are of a type that may be given preclusive effect. Second, the Dauvens had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the statutory notice issue in\n   <em>\n    Dauven I.\n   </em>\n   When they moved to file the Fifth Amended Complaint, the Dauvens were able to argue the grounds on which they sought to add the proposed claim, and subsequently filed a reply brief to address the Banks' opposition to their motion. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Reply to Def.'s Resp. in Opp'n to Pl.'s Mot. for Leave to File Suppl. and Am. Compl./Pet., ECF No. 89.) Further, the Dauvens had opportunity to object to the Findings and Recommendation issued by Judge Papak denying leave to amend, and expressly declined to do so. (\n   <em>\n    Dauven I\n   </em>\n   , Pl.'s Resp. to Def.'s Objections to Findings and Recommendations, ECF No. 111, at 1) (\"Plaintiff has stated that he has no objections to Judge Papak's Findings and Recommendations ....\") Additionally, the Dauvens did not appeal Judge Hernandez's decision adopting Judge Papak's Findings and Recommendation with respect to the motion to amend, and dismissing the claims that remained. Because the Dauvens had opportunity\n   to fully brief the issue, object to Judge Papak's Findings and Recommendation, and appeal Judge Hernandez's adoption of Judge Papak's conclusions regarding the motion to amend, the Dauvens had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the statutory notice issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   The requisite elements for the application of issue preclusion are met in this case. Accordingly, the Dauvens are precluded from relying on their alleged entitlement to statutory notice under ORS 90.425 and 105.165 to establish their conversion claim because it was previously determined that they are not \"tenants\" as defined by those statutes and thus are not entitled to the statutory notice prescribed by those statutes. Because their conversion claim and remedies sought rest squarely on Bancorp's alleged failure to adhere to the notice requirements of ORS 90.425 and 105.165, issue preclusion bars the instant claim and Bancorp's Motion should be GRANTED.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <em>\n    II. Statute of Limitations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Bancorp contends that even if the instant case is not barred by the doctrines of claim and issue preclusion, it is time-barred by the statute of limitations. Specifically, Bancorp argues the applicable statute of limitations for the claim at bar is governed by ORS 12.125. (Motion, at 9-10.) Under that provision, \"[a]n action arising under a rental agreement or ORS chapter 90 shall be commenced within one year.\" OR. REV. STAT. \u00a7 12.125. Because the Dauvens' belongings were removed from the Properly in June 2011, and the Dauvens filed this suit in August 2018, Bancorp alleges this lawsuit is untimely and should be dismissed. (Motion, 9-10.) The Dauvens refute Bancorp's assertions, arguing the current lawsuit was filed under ORS chapter 105 rather than the Oregon Residential Landlord and Tenant Act (\"ORLTA\") codified by chapter 90. (Pl.'s Resp., at 7.) Because ORS 105.165 incorporates a specific section of chapter 90 - ORS 90.425 - the Dauvens claim \"there is no doubt that [chapter 105] is not allowing ORS \u00a7 12.125 to be a controlling factor under 105.165.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) The Dauvens do not identify the appropriate statute of limitations that would otherwise apply to the claim at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The Oregon Supreme Court addressed the scope of ORS 12.125 in\n   <em>\n    Waldner v.

Though the complaint was \"laced with references to the ORLTA and the rental agreement,\" the Oregon Supreme Court found that neither was relied upon to directly authorize the common-law negligence claim asserted.

That the Dauvens' claim was filed under ORS 105.165 and not ORS 90.425 is of no consequence, for the part of that provision upon which the Dauvens rely is applicable only if \"ORS chapter 90 applies to a dwelling unit, following restitution of the premises ... by the sheriff\" pursuant to service and enforcement of a writ of execution and eviction trespass notice, and requires the removal, storage, and disposal of personal property left on the premises in accordance with ORS 90.425. OR. REV. STAT. 105.165(1). Though the Complaint refers generically to ORS 105.165 and does not identify subsection one as the authority on which the conversion claim relies, the Dauvens seek double damages which are available only \"[i]f the plaintiff fails to permit the defendant to recover possession of the defendant's personal property under subsection (1) of this section.\" OR. REV. STAT. 105.165(4). Consequently, the Dauvens' complaint relies on subsection one of ORS 105.165, which in turn rests on the requirements of ORS 90.425. Because the Dauvens' conversion claim ultimately relies on the notice requirement imposed by a provision of the ORLTA, the one-year limitations period set forth by ORS 12.125 applies to bar the instant case.
