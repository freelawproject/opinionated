This jurisdictional argument proceeds outside of the requirements of Section 1326(d).

Jurisdiction Of Immigration Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Torres argues that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction in 2008 and that, therefore, his 2008 removal order was\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   and cannot be used to support a Section 1326 prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ECF No. 13 at 5-16.

First, as set out above, the use of the term \"jurisdiction\" \"convey[s] many, too many, meanings.\"\n   <em>\n    Rivera Lopez\n   </em>\n   , 355 F. Supp. 3d at 439 (internal quotation omitted).

Second, the transitional rules were not even in force at the time of Torres' removal proceedings in 2008.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Okpa v.

He argues that, because the immigration court lacked jurisdiction, he is excused from exhausting administrative remedies (which he clearly has not done) and from demonstrating a deprivation of judicial review (Torres did not seek judicial review and in fact waived appeal). He argues that \"[p]rejudice from a void order is also presumed\" and that there was a due process violation where the immigration court's order lacked jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931630\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/659/#p664\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For the reasons set forth above, Torres' argument that the immigration court lacked jurisdiction to order Torres removed in 2008 has been rejected.
