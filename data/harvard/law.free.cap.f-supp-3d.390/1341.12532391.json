MOODY, JR., UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   THIS CAUSE comes before the Court upon Defendants' Motion to Dismiss (Dkt. 36), Plaintiff's Response in Opposition (Dkt. 42), Defendants' Memorandum in Support of the Motion (Dkt. 48), and Plaintiff's Response to Defendants' Memorandum (Dkt. 55). The Court, having reviewed the filings and being otherwise advised in the premises, concludes that Defendants' Motion should be granted in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The 340B Drug Pricing Program (\"340B Program\" or \"340B\") is a federal government program that allows qualifying healthcare providers, called \"covered entities,\" to purchase outpatient drugs at a\n   significant discount. After purchasing the discounted drugs, covered entities can dispense them to patients directly, or through third-party pharmacies called \"contract pharmacies.\" The 340B Program provides covered entities with savings based on the discounted prices of drugs. And participants in the program can choose how to use the savings they realize, including \"caring for more patients, providing charitable medical care, and offsetting losses incurred from treating underinsured, uninsured, and indigent patients.\" Dkt. 30, p. 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The 340B Program holds participating covered entities responsible for complex tasks such as managing the contract pharmacies, preventing duplicate discounts for certain drugs, and ensuring compliance with government regulations. Plaintiff RxStrategies, Inc. (\"RxStrategies\") is a 340B program administrator, hired by covered entities to ensure their compliance with the 340B Program. Defendant CVS Pharmacy, Inc. (\"CVS\") is a retail pharmacy chain with some (or as RxStrategies argues, many) contract pharmacies that dispense outpatient drugs pursuant to the 340B Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   According to RxStrategies, in 2016, CVS approached RxStrategies with the idea that RxStrategies could serve as a program administrator for CVS. The two entities entered into a mutual non-disclosure agreement (\"NDA\"), and RxStrategies began designing, building, and testing software solutions for CVS. RxStrategies alleged it shared proprietary information with CVS during these development phases, including lists of RxStrategies' covered entity customers and data processing solutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On December 18, 2017, CVS announced it acquired Defendant Wellpartner, LLC (\"Wellpartner\") to serve as CVS's exclusive program administrator for the 340B Program. RxStrategies alleged that CVS shared RxStrategies' proprietary information with Wellpartner, and Wellpartner contacted some of RxStrategies' covered entity customers. Wellpartner and RxStrategies are direct competitors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   CVS now requires any covered entity that wants to fill 340B Program prescriptions at a CVS pharmacy to use Wellpartner as its program administrator. If the covered entity does not want to use Wellpartner as its 340B program administrator, it cannot utilize CVS as a contract pharmacy for the 340B Program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   RxStrategies filed suit against CVS and Wellpartner alleging claims for illegal tying in violation of the Sherman Act against both Defendants (Count I); breach of contract against CVS (Count II); tortious interference with a contractual relationship against both Defendants (Count III); tortious interference with a business relationship against both Defendants (Count IV); misappropriation of trade secrets against both Defendants (Counts V and VI); fraud in the inducement against CVS (Count VII); fraudulent misrepresentation against CVS (Count VIII); negligent misrepresentation against CVS (Count IX); and unjust enrichment against CVS (Count X). Defendants move to dismiss RxStrategies' Amended Complaint.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     MOTION TO DISMISS STANDARD\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) allows a court to dismiss a complaint when it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.

Neither party disputes RxStrategies' antitrust standing, and the Court concludes that RxStrategies has established standing to bring its antitrust claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   With its antitrust claim, RxStrategies takes issue with CVS's mandate: covered entities that want to use CVS for 340B contract pharmacy services must also use Wellpartner for 340B program administrator services.

Therefore, Defendants argue, RxStrategies does not allege market power in the\n   <em>\n    relevant\n   </em>\n   market. Defendants also argue that RxStrategies does not allege enough for the Court to infer that CVS's retail pharmacy market power (a market share of 23.6% of retail pharmacies) is sufficient to establish market power for 340B contract pharmacies. The Court addresses each argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   RxStrategies alleges many facts about CVS. According to RxStrategies, 82% of the population lives within 10 miles of a CVS pharmacy location; CVS is the second-largest contract pharmacy; CVS has grown its number of locations by 281% since 2013, and has 9,800 pharmacy locations (\"the most pharmacy locations\"); patients fill their prescriptions, including prescriptions pursuant to the 340B Program, close to where they live; covered entities utilize pharmacies that a large percentage of their patients already use to fill prescriptions; and covered entities view CVS as an \"essential\" contract pharmacy. RxStrategies also urges the Court to accept that available data about CVS's market share in the 340B contract pharmacy market is understated because of CVS's recent changes to its policies for partnering with covered entities.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In a way, RxStrategies asks the Court to infer that CVS's dominance among retail pharmacies results in dominance in the 340B contract pharmacy market. Though this may be true, RxStrategies' Amended Complaint does not include enough for the Court to infer the level of dominance that equates to market power in the relevant product market. Importantly, as Defendants argue, RxStrategies alleges much about CVS's national market power and market share in certain states. But RxStrategies alleged its geographic markets are local. The allegations are not inconsistent, but they are lacking for the geographic market RxStrategies defined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The parties argue over the importance of CVS's alleged 23.6% nationwide market share of retail pharmacies. Though the number would likely be insufficient to establish market power, the figure is for a different product market, so it does not have as much relevance here. With 23.6% of the retail pharmacy market share, CVS could have a 10% market share of 340B contract pharmacies or a 90% share. RxStrategies alleges that the five largest pharmacy chains (as alleged, \"CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Rite Aid, and Kroger\") represent 60% of 340B contract pharmacies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Dkt. 30, p. 12. It is unclear what percentage of this share CVS occupies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   RxStrategies does allege that CVS has a 60% market share for\n   <em>\n    specialty\n   </em>\n   drugs in the 340B Program. But RxStrategies does not allege how this figure translates to the 340B drug market as a whole, and importantly, CVS's share of the market.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   RxStrategies also alleges that \"nearly 8,000 covered entities participate\" in the 340B Program. Dkt. 30, p. 4. And since CVS's partnership with Wellpartner, 1,200 covered entities that previously used only RxStrategies as their 340B program administrator now use only Wellpartner. These figures, among others, help explain the alleged effects CVS's decision has had on some of the contract pharmacy market. But they are not enough to establish market power in the relevant market, especially when RxStrategies' geographic markets are local markets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Though the Amended Complaint paints the picture of CVS's dominance in the retail pharmacy market, the facts do not establish the requisite market power. Accordingly, the Court will dismiss the claim, without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <em>\n    <em>\n     Counts V and VI; Misappropriation of Trade Secrets, against both Defendants\n    </em>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   A misappropriation claim requires a showing that \"(1) the plaintiff possessed secret information and took reasonable steps to protect its secrecy and (2) the secret it possessed was misappropriated, either by one who knew or had reason to know that the secret was improperly obtained or by one who used improper means to obtain it.\"\n   <em>\n    Audiology Distribution, LLC v.

RxStrategies alleged Defendants misappropriated trade secrets, in the form of proprietary customer information and data processing solutions.

But RxStrategies alleged sufficient facts to establish, at this stage, that it expended effort to compile this information and transform it into a trade secret. For example, RxStrategies alleged it \"devote[d] substantial resources and investment ... to prospecting, identifying, and developing covered entities interested in participating in the 340B program....

RxStrategies responded to Defendants' argument with caselaw the Court finds persuasive. And to allege misappropriation, RxStrategies alleged facts about its reliance on its NDA with CVS, among other things. At this stage, RxStrategies has alleged sufficient facts to support its claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <em>\n    Data Processing Solutions\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Defendants also argue that RxStrategies failed to show its \"proprietary data processing solutions\" are trade secrets.

Defendants focus on one of RxStrategies' allegations and deem it insufficient: Wellpartner transitioned customers from RxStrategies to Wellpartner at a quicker rate than it would have been able to absent information from RxStrategies' data processing solutions. But RxStrategies alleged other facts to indicate that Defendants disclosed or used RxStrategies' data processing solutions.

(\"although Defendants are correct that a plaintiff cannot recover under both unjust enrichment and breach of contract, both the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and Florida law\n   permit a party to allege these claims in the alternative.\").
