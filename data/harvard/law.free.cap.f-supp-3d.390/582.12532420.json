(collectively, \"Galderma\") brought this action against Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. for infringement of several patents under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A). (D.I. 1). I held a bench trial from June 10 to 12, 2019. (D.I. 253-56).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   By trial the parties had narrowed the case to three patents- U.S. Patent Nos. 9,089,587 (\"the '587 patent\"), 9,233,117 (\"the '117 patent\"), and 9,233,118 (\"the '118 patent\") (collectively, \"the asserted patents\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Presently before the Court are the issues of validity and infringement of the asserted patents. Galderma asserts infringement of claim 12 of the '587 patent, claims 2, 3, and 6 of the '117 patent, and claims 6, 7, 10, and 11 of the '118 patent. (D.I. 241). The parties stipulated to infringement of claim 6 of the '118 patent, assuming the claim is valid and enforceable. (D.I. 230, Ex. B). Teva argues, however, that each of the asserted claims are invalid for lack of written description, anticipation, and obviousness. (D.I. 240). I have considered the parties' post-trial briefing. (D.I. 240, 241, 244, 245, 248, 249).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the following reasons, I find each of the asserted claims invalid for anticipation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The asserted patents are directed to methods of treating papulopustular rosacea. I have construed \"papulopustular rosacea\" as a \"chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by facial papules, pustules, persistent erythema, and the presence of inflammatory infiltrates that accompany flares.\" (D.I. 126 at 2). I also adopted the parties' agreed-upon construction of \"inflammatory lesions of [papulopustular] rosacea\" as \"papules and/or pustules.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Galderma owns NDA No. 206255 for Soolantra (ivermectin ) Cream 1% for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea. (D.I. 228 \u00b6\u00b6 5-6). Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug derivative that has been approved for human use since 1996. PX-1 at 1:50-54. All the asserted patents are listed in the Orange Book for Soolantra. (D.I. 228 \u00b6 7). Teva filed ANDA No. 210019 on December 30, 2016 seeking FDA approval for the commercial manufacture, use, and sale of a generic 1% ivermectin cream (\"Teva's ANDA product\"). (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 17, 20). Teva's ANDA label states that the product is \"indicated for the treatment of inflammatory lesions of rosacea.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25). Teva sent its Paragraph IV certification to Galderma on March 10, 2017 stating that the asserted patents are \"invalid, unenforceable, and/or will not be infringed\" by its ANDA product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20). Galderma then filed this action alleging infringement by Teva's ANDA submission. (D.I. 1);\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20271\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(2)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The claims also include various efficacy limitations relating to the results of the treatment method, which I address separately.\n   <em>\n    See infra\n   </em>\n   Section IV.B.2.

During this initial phase of ivermectin administration, conventional anti-rosacea medications such as oral tetracycline and topical metronidazole can be employed to suppress early flareups and to give early clinical response.

McDaniel describes a potential delay in benefits from the ivermectin treatment due to the remnants of dead mites. Any increase in lesion formation is temporary. Regardless, lesion formation is a measure of efficacy and is irrelevant to whether McDaniel discloses the steps of the treatment method. As for the co-administration of \"conventional\" medications, McDaniel merely suggests that other drugs can be \"employed\" with ivermectin in the early stages of treatment. This is not a requirement of co-administration in the early stages.

(D.I. 245 at 7-9). Galderma cites no authority. To the contrary, it is well established that \"[f]or a prior-art reference to be enabling, it need not enable the claim in its entirety, but instead the reference need only enable a single embodiment of the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Morsa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4346232\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/803/1374/#p1377\">\n    803 F.3d at 1377\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It is undisputed that the topical application of Soolantra, once daily, to skin affected by inflammatory lesions of rosacea, is an embodiment of the asserted claims. (D.I. 241 at 3-5 (\"Galderma's Clinical Studies Establish That the Use of Soolantra\u00ae Will Meet Every Element of the Asserted Claims\")). Therefore, McDaniel need only enable its treatment method with respect to Soolantra. As Soolantra is the Marietta formulation, the parties have stipulated to such enablement. (D.I. 219 at 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   The asserted claims consist of the same steps described in McDaniel and are directed to the same use-treating inflammatory lesions of papulopustular rosacea. \"Using the same composition claimed by [Galderma] in the same manner claimed by [Galderma] naturally results in the same claimed skin benefits.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Perricone\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"556349\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/432/1368/#p1376\">\n    432 F.3d at 1380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Therefore, the claimed efficacies are nothing more than \"the natural result flowing from the explicit disclosure\" of the claimed treatment method.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schering\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9105276\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1373/#p1379\">\n    339 F.3d at 1379\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As such, those efficacies are inherent to and anticipated by McDaniel's disclosure of the claimed treatment method.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I find each of the asserted claims invalid for anticipation by McDaniel. I therefore do not need to reach Teva's alternative invalidity arguments.
