HILLMAN, DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Europa Eye Wear Corporation (\"Europa\") and Alan McKinley (\"McKinley\"), president of AO Eyewear, Inc. (\"AO\"), brought these actions seeking declaratory judgment that Kaizen Advisors, LLC (\"KZA\") could not enjoin its impending acquisition AO, (Docket No. 1, No. 4:19-cv-40022-TSH), and that McKinley is not liable to KZA for fraud (Docket No. 1, No. 4:19-cv-40024-TSH). In both actions, KZA subsequently moved to dismiss or alternatively, transfer on the grounds Europa's and McKinley's claims falls within the scope of two forum-selection clauses governing\n   the relationship between KZA and AO, which require all claims to be brought in California. (Docket No. 28, No. 4:19-cv-40022-TSH; Docket No. 11, No. 4:19-cv-40024-TSH). For the reasons stated below, KZA's motions are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Background\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   KZA negotiated and conducted due diligence to acquire AO. In furtherance of their negotiations, KZA and AO entered two contracts, a Non-Disclosure and Non-Circumvention Agreement (\"NDNCA\") and a Letter of Intent (\"LOI\"), both of which include forum-selection clauses providing that disputes be resolved in California. The NDNCA, in relevant part, reads: \"The parties agree and accept that any legal action or proceeding brought with respect to this Agreement shall be brought in the State of California or the United States District Court for the Central District of California, Los Angeles, California.\" (Docket No. 29-1, at 22, No. 4:19-cv-40022-TSH). Similarly, the LOI provides: \"Any dispute shall be resolved exclusively in the State or Federal courts located in Los Angeles, California.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Before the deal closed, however, AO terminated the planned acquisition and entered a binding letter of intent with Europa. Europa then filed this action for declaratory relief, outpacing KZA to the courthouse doors who subsequently filed its own action in California state court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Legal Standard\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201404\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) is the appropriate framework to assess whether a Court should grant a motion to transfer due to a forum-selection clause.\n   <em>\n    Atl.

Accordingly, like all other plaintiffs, if it wishes to proceed with its claims, it must do so in the proper forum. Here, that is the Central District of California. If it objects to forum-selection clause on jurisdictional grounds, the California Action (where Europa is a defendant) is the appropriate court to adjudicate those claims upon a more fully developed record than presented to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     Conclusion\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   For the reasons stated above, KZA's motions are\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      granted\n     </em>\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, it is ordered that this case be transferred to the Central District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-30\">\n    McKinley does not proffer any unique arguments why enforcing the forum-selection clauses is improper and instead relies on the arguments offered by Europa.\n    <em>\n     See generally\n    </em>\n    Docket No. 35, 4:19-cv-40022-TSH. Therefore, because the Court finds Europa's arguments unconvincing, both cases will be transferred to the Central District of California. Further, because the Court will transfer the cases, it will not address KZA's motions insofar as it seeks dismissal of Europa's or McKinley's claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-31\">\n    Europa has since removed that action to federal court in the Central District of California.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
