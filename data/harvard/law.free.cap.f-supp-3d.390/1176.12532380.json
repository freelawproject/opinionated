No. 1-1.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint is based on AbbVie's conduct in California with California patients and California healthcare providers. Plaintiffs are the State of California, by and through the California Insurance Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"), and relator-plaintiff Lazaro Suarez. The complaint states a single claim under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which prohibits the use of \"runners, cappers, steerers, or other persons to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits\" covered by insurance. <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1871.7</extracted-citation>(a) (\"IFPA\").</p><p id=\"p-10\">AbbVie removed the case to this Court on the argument that it has complete diversity with Suarez and that the State of California should be disregarded as a nominal party for jurisdictional purposes. Dkt. No. 1 at 2-3. Plaintiffs now ask for the matter to be remanded to state court. Dkt. No. 47. The Court finds that the State of California is a real party in interest and that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction. It is remanded to the Superior Court. <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447</extracted-citation>(c).</p><p id=\"p-11\"><strong>BACKGROUND</strong></p><p id=\"p-13\">The State of California and Suarez have sued AbbVie only for its conduct in California. As alleged in the complaint, AbbVie pursued two illicit schemes to pump up the sales of Humira in California. One scheme involved \"classic kickbacks\" in the form of substantial cash payments, gifts, trips and vacations, meals at \"fancy restaurants\" and wineries, and other bribes given to California healthcare providers, including providers employed by the University of California. Dkt. No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 82-156. While the sufficiency of the complaint is not in question for the remand motion, the detailed kickback allegations are all the more striking in that they feature evidence gleaned from AbbVie's own emails and records, and the testimony of confidential witnesses. <em>See,</em> <em>e.g.</em> , <em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6\u00b6 129-36</extracted-citation>. The complaint alleges that the kickback scheme succeeded in getting healthcare providers in California to order Humira \"far in excess of the amount that they would have prescribed\" without the bribes. <em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6 1</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-14\">The other scheme took the form of AbbVie's \"Ambassador Program,\" which was a network of nurses AbbVie made available at no cost to healthcare providers who prescribed Humira for their patients. <em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6\u00b6 48-49</extracted-citation>. A central theme of the complaint is that AbbVie used the Ambassador Program to start and keep patients on Humira <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1179\" href=\"#p1179\" id=\"p1179\">*1179</a>under the guise of providing skilled nursing services to them. The \"ambassadors\" would develop relationships with doctors and patients to increase sales of Humira by handling insurance authorizations and claims, appealing denials of coverage by insurers, guiding patients to enroll in insurance plans that paid for Humira, and other tactics to ensure coverage of Humira prescriptions for commercially insured patients. <em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6\u00b6 52-81</extracted-citation>. Plaintiffs contend that the Ambassador Program was \"wildly successful\" and \"dramatically increased the number of prescriptions for Humira that are filled and refilled\" in California. <em><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6\u00b6 54, 61</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-15\">Plaintiffs say that these illicit sales practices were particularly pernicious because Humira is an expensive drug with serious potential health hazards. The complaint alleges that Humira is subject to a \"boxed warning\" condition, which requires AbbVie to state in a bold-print box that Humira is associated with \"serious infections and malignancies\" such as tuberculosis and T-cell lymphoma. <em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6\u00b6 4, 46</extracted-citation>. The complaint also alleges that AbbVie made over $12 billion in Humira sales in 2017 alone. <em><extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6 44</extracted-citation>. With respect to California, it alleges that insurers paid approximately $1,290,000,000 to cover 274,000 claims for Humira prescriptions by California patients between 2013 and 2018. <em><extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\"> \u00b6 45</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-16\">On the basis of these and other factual allegations, the State of California and Suarez have brought a single claim against AbbVie for insurance fraud under the IFPA. Section 1871.7 of the IFPA makes it unlawful to use \"runners, cappers, steerers, or other persons to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits ... under a contract of insurance or that will be the basis for a claim against an insured individual or his or her insurer.\" <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1871.7</extracted-citation>(a). Violations are subject to a \"civil penalty of not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) nor more than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), plus an assessment of not more than three times the amount of each claim\" paid by an insurer. <em><extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 1871.7(b).

It also allows for an \"interested person\" to bring a qui tam action \"for the person and for the State of California\" and \"in the name of the State.\" <em><extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> \u00a7 1871.7(e)(1).

The State of California exercised its right to intervene by and through the Commissioner. Dkt. No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 8-10. Suarez is staying on as a relator-plaintiff, but the Commissioner has \"primary responsibility for prosecuting the action, and shall not be bound by an act of the person bringing the action.\" <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Cal.

The crucial issue for the remand motion is whether the State of California is a real party to this action for jurisdictional purposes. If California is an interested party with a genuine stake in the lawsuit, then complete diversity is lacking because a state cannot be a citizen of itself. <em>Moor v.

But the IFPA and FCA are different statutes. One of the differences is that the goal of the FCA is to recover funds fraudulently obtained directly from the government. In FCA cases, the government itself is the direct, and only, victim. In contrast, the direct victims under the IFPA are the insurers who pay out on fraudulent claims or coverage, and the insureds who pay inflated premiums to cover the cost of the fraud. <em>See</em> <em>People ex rel.

Consequently, the FCA cases are of only approximate help in resolving the issue of jurisdiction here.</p><p id=\"p-27\">The better approach to determining California's stake in this case is to understand its role under the plain language of the IFPA.

It is an enforcement action by the State of California against a drug manufacturer that is alleged to have engaged in pervasive insurance fraud in California through illicit schemes intended to generate insurance claims and coverage for Humira prescriptions. If California prevails on the merits, it stands to recover from AbbVie tens of millions of dollars, or more, in civil penalties and potentially trebled claim-based assessments, along with attorney's fees and costs.</p><p id=\"p-32\">By any measure, these stakes make California a real party in interest in this case. It would not go too far to say that California is the only real party in interest here. As a relator under the IFPA, Suarez is suing in the name of the state and has no personal claim or right to vindicate, and no possibility of recovering personal damages for himself. <em>Strathmann</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260410\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/210/487/#p502\">210 Cal.

In <em>Strathmann</em> , the California Court of Appeal strongly signaled that the State of California is always the real party in interest in qui tam actions under the IFPA. <em>Strathmann</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4260410\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/210/487/#p502\">210 Cal. App. 4th. at 500-01</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">148 Cal.Rptr.3d 361</extracted-citation>. The court's discussion of the issue occurred in the course of deciding whether a public interest exception barring a motion to strike under the California anti-SLAPP statute applied to an IFPA relator plaintiff. <em><extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\"> at 491-92</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">148 Cal.Rptr.3d 361</extracted-citation>. The court found that it did because the relator stands in the shoes of the government. <em><extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\"> at 500-01</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=148%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20361\">148 Cal.Rptr.3d 361</extracted-citation>. There is no question that this analysis was an essential part of the court's holding and not dicta, but because the court was directly addressing the anti-SLAPP statute and not Section 1871.7, its observations are best treated as a powerful indicator but not quite dispositive here.</p><p id=\"p-34\">AbbVie does not present any good reason to marginalize the State of California as a nominal player. It relies heavily on <em>Lucent</em> and <em>Missouri Railway</em> , a Supreme Court case of an older vintage, for the proposition that \"general government interests\" in protecting the health and welfare of its citizens are not substantial enough to make a state a real party in interest for diversity jurisdiction purposes. <em>See</em> Dkt. No. 1 at 7-11; Dkt. No. 55 at 8-9; <em>Mo., Kan. &amp; Tex. Ry. Co. of Kansas v. Hickman</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">183 U.S. 53</extracted-citation>, 60, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">22 S.Ct. 18</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">46 L.Ed. 78</extracted-citation> (1901) (\" <em>Missouri Railway</em> \"); <em>Lucent</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">642 F.3d at 738-39</extracted-citation>. That is without a doubt true, but AbbVie fails to account for the plain language of the IFPA and the specific and tangible state interests it embodies, which are far removed from a general concern about good government that was found to be insufficient for jurisdiction in other cases. AbbVie's reliance on <em>Missouri Railway</em> is further misplaced in light of the fact that, unlike here, the State of Missouri was not a party of record and had no tangible stake in the outcome of the case. <em>Missouri Railway</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">183 U.S. at 61</extracted-citation>, <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">22 S.Ct. 18</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-35\"><em>Lucent</em> is even farther afield in that it involved a claim for employment discrimination by a single individual under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\"). <em>Lucent</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">642 F.3d at 735-36</extracted-citation>. Although the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed the case on behalf of the individual, our circuit held that the FEHA expressed only a general governmental interest in fair employment and that all the meaningful relief available in court would go to the individual, not the state. <em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\"> at 738-39</extracted-citation>. As the prior discussion demonstrates, neither condition is present in this IFPA action.</p><p id=\"p-36\">AbbVie's other arguments are equally unavailing. It points to <em>Bates v. Mortgage Electronic Registration System, Inc.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522139\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1076/\">694 F.3d 1076</extracted-citation> (9th Cir. 2012), to say that the state is not necessarily the real party in interest in every qui tam action. Dkt. No. 55 at 3. Maybe so, but this case is brought under the California IFPA, which is different from the federal or state FCA, and in any event the <em>Bates</em> relator filed a complaint on behalf of \"the Counties\" of California, not the state itself. <em>Bates</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522139\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1076/\">694 F.3d at 1080</extracted-citation>.</p><p id=\"p-37\">AbbVie's emphasis on an unpublished memorandum in <em>California ex rel. TIG Insurance Co. v. Culpepper</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">720 F. App'x 884</extracted-citation> (9th Cir. 2018), is particularly questionable. <em>See</em> Dkt. No. 55 at 1, 6. In that case, an insurance company sued the defendant in state court under the IFPA for <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1183\" href=\"#p1183\" id=\"p1183\">*1183</a>fraudulently obtaining a workers' compensation award. The defendant removed the action on diversity jurisdiction to federal district court. <em>Culpepper</em> , <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">720 F. App'x at 884</extracted-citation>. The memorandum addressed a possible bar to the district court proceedings under the California Labor Code, and concluded that the code did not block the IFPA. <em><extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">Id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\"> at 884-85</extracted-citation>. Neither removal nor diversity jurisdiction were challenged in the appeal, and the State of California was not a direct participant in the case.</p><p id=\"p-38\">AbbVie says \" <em>Culpepper</em> confirms that federal courts can exercise diversity jurisdiction in IFPA cases\" and that the same should be true here. Dkt. No. 55 at 6. The contention is unpersuasive for two reasons. To start, even if it were accepted without question that diversity jurisdiction with respect to the IFPA \"can\" be found, nothing in <em>Culpepper</em> says it \"must\" be found, particularly in the factual circumstances here where the State of California is a named plaintiff with a substantial interest at stake and control of the litigation.</p><p id=\"p-39\">More problematically for AbbVie, its interpretation of <em>Culpepper</em> is not based on anything actually said in the memorandum. Instead, AbbVie relies on what the circuit panel <em>did not</em> say or do. Since the circuit panel did not address diversity or dismiss the case <em>sua sponte</em> for lack of jurisdiction, AbbVie posits that it must have affirmatively found that diversity jurisdiction was proper. <em><extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">Id.</extracted-citation></em> In effect, AbbVie interprets the negative space in <em>Culpepper</em> to signal that diversity jurisdiction is proper over IFPA actions irrespective of the role of the state.</p><p id=\"p-40\">Finding judicial holdings in the ether is more spiritualism than sound legal argument. Common sense advises that <em>Culpepper</em> did not address diversity jurisdiction because the parties never said a word about it. Subsequent developments in the litigation validate this obvious explanation. Several months after the appeal, the <em>Culpepper</em> parties jointly filed a stipulation to remand the case to state court. <em>California ex rel. TIG Ins. Co. v. Culpepper</em> , No. 8:16-cv-01555-CJC-JCG (C.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2019), Dkt. No. 40. The parties acknowledged that \"[a]t the time of removal, the parties were unaware of legal authority establishing that the Court lacks jurisdiction\" in light of the state's interest in an IFPA action. <em>Id.</em> at 2. The district court immediately remanded the case to the Superior Court. <em>Id.</em> , Dkt. No. 41. This course of events puts to rest any possible theory that <em>Culpepper</em> stands for a stealth approval of diversity jurisdiction here.</p><p id=\"p-41\">AbbVie's suggestion that the state is not really a party here because it is acting through the Commissioner is also untenable. The state is the named plaintiff; it holds the interests conferred by the IFPA and will hold any monetary recovery that is awarded. The Commissioner is the state's living and breathing representative for the practical purpose of handling the litigation. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1871.7</extracted-citation>(e)(1). AbbVie does not cite any meaningful authority to indicate that this arrangement in any way negates the state's role in this case.</p><p id=\"p-42\">As a closing observation, AbbVie's complaints about how Suarez participated in similar proceedings in another court are of no consequence. Suarez is perfectly free to choose a litigation forum, <em>Hansen</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518400\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1051/#p1057\">902 F.3d at 1056</extracted-citation>, and AbbVie has not proffered any evidence of untoward gamesmanship or abusive litigation tactics. Even if it had, which is not the case, diversity jurisdiction is not granted as a sanction against an allegedly wayward party.</p><p id=\"p-43\"><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-44\">This action was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, and is remanded <a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"1184\" href=\"#p1184\" id=\"p1184\">*1184</a>to the Superior Court of California for the County of Alameda. <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447</extracted-citation>(c).</p></opinion>\n</casebody>\n</body></html>"
