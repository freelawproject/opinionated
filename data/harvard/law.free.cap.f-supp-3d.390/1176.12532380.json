Plaintiffs are the State of California, by and through the California Insurance Commissioner (\"Commissioner\"), and relator-plaintiff Lazaro Suarez. The complaint states a single claim under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, which prohibits the use of \"runners, cappers, steerers, or other persons to procure clients or patients to perform or obtain services or benefits\" covered by insurance.\n       <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">\n        Cal.

Dkt. No. 1 at 2-3. Plaintiffs now ask for the matter to be remanded to state court. Dkt. No. 47. The Court finds that the State of California is a real party in interest and that the case was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction.

As alleged in the complaint, AbbVie pursued two illicit schemes to pump up the sales of Humira in California. One scheme involved \"classic kickbacks\" in the form of substantial cash payments, gifts, trips and vacations, meals at \"fancy restaurants\" and wineries, and other bribes given to California healthcare providers, including providers employed by the University of California. Dkt. No. 1-1 \u00b6\u00b6 82-156. While the sufficiency of the complaint is not in question for the remand motion, the detailed kickback allegations are all the more striking in that they feature evidence gleaned from AbbVie's own emails and records, and the testimony of confidential witnesses.\n       <em>\n        See,\n       </em>\n       <em>\n        e.g.\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n         id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n        \u00b6\u00b6 129-36\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

A central theme of the complaint is that AbbVie used the Ambassador Program to start and keep patients on Humira\n      under the guise of providing skilled nursing services to them. The \"ambassadors\" would develop relationships with doctors and patients to increase sales of Humira by handling insurance authorizations and claims, appealing denials of coverage by insurers, guiding patients to enroll in insurance plans that paid for Humira, and other tactics to ensure coverage of Humira prescriptions for commercially insured patients.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n        \u00b6\u00b6 52-81\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

The complaint alleges that Humira is subject to a \"boxed warning\" condition, which requires AbbVie to state in a bold-print box that Humira is associated with \"serious infections and malignancies\" such as tuberculosis and T-cell lymphoma.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n        \u00b6\u00b6 4, 46\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

AbbVie's reliance on\n       <em>\n        Missouri Railway\n       </em>\n       is further misplaced in light of the fact that, unlike here, the State of Missouri was not a party of record and had no tangible stake in the outcome of the case.\n       <em>\n        Missouri Railway\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">\n        183 U.S. at 61\n       </extracted-citation>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8296677\" index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/183/53/#p60\">\n        22 S.Ct. 18\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-35\">\n       <em>\n        Lucent\n       </em>\n       is even farther afield in that it involved a claim for employment discrimination by a single individual under the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (\"FEHA\").\n       <em>\n        Lucent\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">\n        642 F.3d at 735-36\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . Although the state Department of Fair Employment and Housing filed the case on behalf of the individual, our circuit held that the FEHA expressed only a general governmental interest in fair employment and that all the meaningful relief available in court would go to the individual, not the state.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3383218\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/642/728/#p737\">\n        at 738-39\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .

Dkt. No. 55 at 3. Maybe so, but this case is brought under the California IFPA, which is different from the federal or state FCA, and in any event the\n       <em>\n        Bates\n       </em>\n       relator filed a complaint on behalf of \"the Counties\" of California, not the state itself.\n       <em>\n        Bates\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3522139\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/1076/\">\n        694 F.3d at 1080\n       </extracted-citation>\n       .\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-37\">\n       AbbVie's emphasis on an unpublished memorandum in\n       <em>\n        California ex rel.

In that case, an insurance company sued the defendant in state court under the IFPA for\n      fraudulently obtaining a workers' compensation award. The defendant removed the action on diversity jurisdiction to federal district court.\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">\n        720 F. App'x at 884\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . The memorandum addressed a possible bar to the district court proceedings under the California Labor Code, and concluded that the code did not block the IFPA.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">\n        at 884-85\n       </extracted-citation>\n       . Neither removal nor diversity jurisdiction were challenged in the appeal, and the State of California was not a direct participant in the case.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-38\">\n       AbbVie says \"\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       confirms that federal courts can exercise diversity jurisdiction in IFPA cases\" and that the same should be true here. Dkt. No. 55 at 6. The contention is unpersuasive for two reasons. To start, even if it were accepted without question that diversity jurisdiction with respect to the IFPA \"can\" be found, nothing in\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       says it \"must\" be found, particularly in the factual circumstances here where the State of California is a named plaintiff with a substantial interest at stake and control of the litigation.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-39\">\n       More problematically for AbbVie, its interpretation of\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       is not based on anything actually said in the memorandum. Instead, AbbVie relies on what the circuit panel\n       <em>\n        did not\n       </em>\n       say or do. Since the circuit panel did not address diversity or dismiss the case\n       <em>\n        sua sponte\n       </em>\n       for lack of jurisdiction, AbbVie posits that it must have affirmatively found that diversity jurisdiction was proper.\n       <em>\n        <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=720%20F.%20App%27x%20884\">\n         Id.\n        </extracted-citation>\n       </em>\n       In effect, AbbVie interprets the negative space in\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       to signal that diversity jurisdiction is proper over IFPA actions irrespective of the role of the state.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-40\">\n       Finding judicial holdings in the ether is more spiritualism than sound legal argument. Common sense advises that\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       did not address diversity jurisdiction because the parties never said a word about it. Subsequent developments in the litigation validate this obvious explanation. Several months after the appeal, the\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       parties jointly filed a stipulation to remand the case to state court.\n       <em>\n        California ex rel. TIG Ins. Co. v. Culpepper\n       </em>\n       , No. 8:16-cv-01555-CJC-JCG (C.D. Cal. Feb. 6, 2019), Dkt. No. 40. The parties acknowledged that \"[a]t the time of removal, the parties were unaware of legal authority establishing that the Court lacks jurisdiction\" in light of the state's interest in an IFPA action.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       at 2. The district court immediately remanded the case to the Superior Court.\n       <em>\n        Id.\n       </em>\n       , Dkt. No. 41. This course of events puts to rest any possible theory that\n       <em>\n        Culpepper\n       </em>\n       stands for a stealth approval of diversity jurisdiction here.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-41\">\n       AbbVie's suggestion that the state is not really a party here because it is acting through the Commissioner is also untenable. The state is the named plaintiff; it holds the interests conferred by the IFPA and will hold any monetary recovery that is awarded. The Commissioner is the state's living and breathing representative for the practical purpose of handling the litigation.\n       <em>\n        See\n       </em>\n       <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%201871.7\">\n        Cal. Ins. Code \u00a7 1871.7\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (e)(1). AbbVie does not cite any meaningful authority to indicate that this arrangement in any way negates the state's role in this case.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-42\">\n       As a closing observation, AbbVie's complaints about how Suarez participated in similar proceedings in another court are of no consequence. Suarez is perfectly free to choose a litigation forum,\n       <em>\n        Hansen\n       </em>\n       ,\n       <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518400\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/1051/#p1057\">\n        902 F.3d at 1056\n       </extracted-citation>\n       , and AbbVie has not proffered any evidence of untoward gamesmanship or abusive litigation tactics. Even if it had, which is not the case, diversity jurisdiction is not granted as a sanction against an allegedly wayward party.\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-43\">\n       <strong>\n        CONCLUSION\n       </strong>\n      </p>\n      <p id=\"p-44\">\n       This action was removed improvidently and without jurisdiction, and is remanded\n      to the Superior Court of California for the County of Alameda.\n       <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201447\">\n        28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447\n       </extracted-citation>\n       (c).\n      </p>\n     </p>\n    </div>\n   </opinion>\n  </casebody>\n </body>\n</html>\n"
