Commerce did not, however, determine a rate using the production and U.S. sales information that Shandong placed on the record in response to Commerce's questionnaires.

National Nail disputes Commerce's use of \"total adverse facts available\" to assign a rate for the respondent. Specifically, National Nail argues that Commerce's use of \"facts otherwise available,\" as to Shandong's factors of production and U.S. sales,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   was not supported by substantial evidence because Shandong provided the production and sales information that Commerce asked for in the form and manner requested. National Nail also contends that substantial evidence does not support Commerce's finding that Shandong failed to comply with the Department's information requests to \"the best of its ability.\" Thus, for Plaintiff, Commerce's decision to find \"unusable\" all of the production and sales information Shandong provided and, instead, to use \"total adverse facts available\" to arrive at a dumping margin for Shandong lacks the support of substantial evidence and is not in accordance with law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   National Nail's Cmts. on Remand Results 5, ECF No. 70 (\"NN's Cmts.\").

Responses were received between May 2015 and August 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Factors of Production Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With respect to Shandong's factors of production, Commerce and Shandong went back and forth on an acceptable reporting method. Initially, Commerce asked Shandong to report the actual or estimated amounts of the factors of production used\n   to make the subject merchandise solely on a\n   <em>\n    CONNUM-specific\n   </em>\n   basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commerce's Orig. Questionnaire at D-2, D-6. Later, when Shandong made it clear that, because of the way it kept its records and because of its production processes, it could only report some factors of production (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , wire rod used in the wire-drawing workshop\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   ) on a CONNUM-specific basis, and that it could report other factors of production (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , chemicals and water used in the electrogalvanization or \"EG\" workshop) on a \"production-group\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   basis, Commerce agreed that Shandong could report its factors of production \"either on a production-group basis or on a CONNUM-specific basis.\" Commerce's Fourth Sec. D Suppl. Quest. to Shandong (June 25, 2015), P.R. 190, ECF No. 52-28 at 16 (\"Please revise [Shandong's] reported amounts for each [factor of production] and ensure that they are allocated either on a production-group basis or on a CONNUM-specific basis.\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Resp. Cmts. 10 (quoting Remand Results at 16) (\"It is true that Commerce permitted [Shandong] to report its factors of production on 'a less-than CONNUM-specific basis.' \"). No matter which method was selected, however, for Commerce, \"it was 'unacceptable to report a single average [factors of production] usage ratio for all CONNUMs in [the] Section D database.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Final IDM at 36 (quoting Commerce's Second Suppl. Sec. D Quest. to Shandong (Apr. 27, 2015), P.R. 139, ECF No. 52-13 at 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Ultimately, Shandong reported some of its factors of production on a CONNUM-specific basis, and others on a production-group basis. Commerce found, however, that none of the factors information was usable, because, according to the Department,\n   some of the factors of production were reported on a single-average basis. Therefore, for Commerce, necessary factors of production information was \"missing\" from the record.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    B. U.S. Sales Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   With respect to U.S. sales, Commerce asked Shandong to, among other things, reconcile its period of review sales data with other sales data for the two fiscal years that overlapped the period of review (August 1, 2013 to July 31, 2014), and to provide a narrative explanation of \"how all worksheets and supporting documentation tie together.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Commerce's Orig. Questionnaire app. V(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Initially, in its December 24, 2014 Section A submission (the \"December 2014 Submission\"), Shandong provided audited financial statements covering all of 2013, and monthly internal financial reports for all of 2014, except November and December.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Sec. A Questionnaire Resp. (Dec. 24, 2014), C.R. 36, ECF No. 51-2 Ex. A-18 (2013 audited financial statement) and A-19 (2014 monthly internal financial reports). In the December 2014 Submission, Shandong \"noted ... that it was not submitting the full, audited ... 2014 financial statement because the financial statement would not be ready until later in the year.\" Final IDM at 44. November and December 2014 were outside of the period of review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In its January 13, 2015 Section C submission (the \"mid-January 2015 Submission\"), filed a few weeks after the December 2014 Submission, Shandong continued to omit the November and December 2014 sales data, but did not reiterate the explanation it had offered in its previous submission.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 44 (noting Shandong \"failed to provide an explanation in its Section C response as to why it was not reporting the complete monthly sales data for [2013 and 2014]\"). It is worth noting that, given its previous explanation, it is hardly surprising that Shandong should not have audited financials for November and December since its Section C submission was made on January 13, 2015-thirteen days after the company closed its books for the year.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Six months later, in June 2015, Commerce sought the November and December 2014 data by way of supplemental questionnaire.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 45. In its July 2015 response (the \"July 2015 Submission\"), Shandong provided the missing internal financial reports for November and December 2014, along with an explanation as to why they were not included in Shandong's original response,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that they were not available at the time its response was filed. As for the requested narrative explanation tying the sales reconciliation to the 2013 and 2014 financial statements, Shandong provided that, too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 46. Thus, Shandong placed the missing sales information on the record in response to Commerce's supplemental questionnaire. Indeed, all of the information Shandong placed on the record with respect to 2013 and 2014, including the November and December 2014 information, the explanation for why it was not provided when initially requested, and the narrative explanation tying the sales reconciliation to the 2013 and 2014 financial statements, was provided by way of timely filed responses to Commerce's supplemental questionnaires.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to providing the information that Commerce requested, in the July 2015 Submission Shandong made unsolicited revisions to its sales data, decreasing the quantity of subject merchandise sold in two months of the period of review (August 2013 and December 2013), which had the effect of decreasing the total quantity of sales to the United States by approximately one percent. Shandong did not offer an explanation for these revisions.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Shooting Nails Information\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   With respect to shooting nails, Shandong reported that its affiliate Jining Dragon sold a small number\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   of shooting nails in the United States during the period of review. Shandong claimed, however, that Jining Dragon's sales of shooting nails were excluded from the Order because they were \"fasteners suitable for use in powder-actuated hand tools, not threaded and threaded, which are currently classified under [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheadings] 7317.00.20 and 7317.00.30.\" Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044%2C961\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. at 44,961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Based on this claim, Shandong asked that it be excused from reporting Jining Dragon's factors of production and sales information for its shooting nails sales.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Letter Requesting Rescission of Question 10 of the June 25, 2015 Quest. (July 1, 2015), P.R. 192, ECF No. 52-29 at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   On July 2, 2015, Commerce conditionally withdrew\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   its request that Shandong provide Jining Dragon's production and U.S. sales databases for the allegedly excluded shooting nails, but continued to seek information as to whether the nails were, in fact, excluded from the scope of the Order. Specifically, Commerce asked Shandong: \"For two product codes of shooting nails ... please provide product specifications or model diagrams, of each product type's head style, point style, shank style,\n   <em>\n    and the hand tool with material [i.e., \"powder\"] used in the hand tool to shoot this nail, along with supporting documentation\n   </em>\n   .\" Final IDM at 54 (citation omitted) (emphasis added). In response, Shandong did not supply the requested supporting documentation, but simply repeated its assertion that \"the shooting nails were used in a 'shooting gun' and that material used was 'gunpowder.' \" Final IDM at 54 (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Preliminary Results\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Department published the Preliminary Results on August 28, 2015,\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   in which it found that the use of total adverse facts available with respect to Shandong was justified. First, Commerce found that the use of \"facts otherwise available\" was\n   warranted because necessary information was \"missing\" from the record for Shandong's production and sales, and for Jining Dragon's shooting nails. Commerce stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   During the course of this review, the Department discovered that [Shandong] withheld key information that was requested by the Department for calculating an accurate margin for [Shandong]. Specifically, [Shandong] failed to provide in the form and manner requested by the Department: (1) an accurate, reliable sales reconciliation regarding its reported sales of subject merchandise to the United States during the [period of review]; (2) an accurate, reliable factors of production ... database that is reported on a [CONNUM]-specific basis; and (3) sales data, [factors of production] data, and full product specifications, including supporting documentation regarding the hand tool that the shooting nails are used in, from [Shandong's] affiliate, [Jining Dragon], regarding its sales of shooting nails to the United States during the [period of review]. Additionally, [Shandong] along with its affiliate, [Jining Dragon], significantly impeded the proceeding by not providing accurate or complete responses to the Department's questions about its U.S. sales data and [factors of production] data regarding its sales of subject merchandise to the United States during the [period of review].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Prelim. Dec. Mem. at 14;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677e(a). Thus, Commerce found that because the information that Shandong provided in its questionnaire responses was \"so incomplete ... the entirety of the responses need[ed] to be disregarded for the preliminary results.\" Prelim. Dec. Mem. at 27. In other words, Commerce found that none of Shandong's reported production and sales information was usable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to Jining Dragon's shooting nails sales, Commerce found that Shandong had failed to show that the nails were outside the scope of the Order. For Commerce, this failure was significant because the Department's withdrawal of its request for Jining Dragon's factors of production and U.S. sales databases was conditioned on Shandong providing information that showed Jining Dragon's shooting nails were excluded from the scope of the Order. Since Shandong failed to meet that condition, and failed to provide the requested databases, Commerce found that necessary information was missing from the record for the shooting nails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Prelim.

Commerce stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [D]espite the Department's detailed and specific questionnaires, [Shandong] failed to meet its statutory duty to reply accurately and completely to requests for information regarding its affiliates, and the production and sales of subject merchandise.

In sum, ... despite the Department's detailed and specific requests for information through the issuance of multiple questionnaires, [Shandong] failed to meet its statutory duty to reply accurately and completely to requests for information regarding its affiliates, and the production and sales of subject merchandise. Specifically, [Shandong] failed to provide: 1) an accurate, reliable [factors of production] database that is reported on a CONNUM-specific basis; 2) an accurate, reliable sales reconciliation regarding its reported sales of subject merchandise to the United States during the [period of review]; and 3) sales data,\n   [factors of production] data, and full product specifications for the shooting nails of [Shandong's] affiliate, [Jining Dragon]. In this regard, the Department finds ... that [Shandong], from the outset, failed to follow specific instructions, repeatedly misrepresented the data it was submitting to the Department, and repeatedly failed to explain adequately why it needed to make revisions to data previously submitted to the Department. Accordingly, and based on the totality of the evidence discussed [in the Final IDM], the Department continues to find that [Shandong] failed to cooperate to the best of its ability, pursuant to [subsection 1677e(b) ].

Shandong's Factors of Production\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   During the underlying review, Commerce sought information with respect to Shandong's factors of production by way of its Section D questionnaire. Initially, the company was asked to report the actual or estimated amounts of the factors of production that it consumed making the subject merchandise solely on a\n   <em>\n    CONNUM-specific\n   </em>\n   basis. In its questionnaire responses, however, Shandong made it clear that, because of its production process and the way it kept its records, it could only report some factors of production (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , wire rod used in the wire-drawing workshop) on a CONNUM-specific basis. Shandong did, however, represent that it could report other factors of production (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , chemicals and water used in the electrogalvinization, or \"EG\" workshop) on a production-group basis.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   National Nail's Mem.

D Suppl. Quest. to Shandong at 16. No matter which reporting method was selected, though, Commerce directed that \"it was unacceptable to report a single average [number for factors of production] usage ratio for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   CONNUMs in [the] Section D database.\" Final IDM at 36 (emphasis added) (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   In addition, Commerce took seriously the provisions of 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(e) (relating to consideration of information submitted by a party that \"does not meet all the applicable requirements established by [Commerce]\") and 19 U.S.C. \u00a7 1677m(d) (relating to information that Commerce finds deficient) and issued supplemental questionnaires in order to obtain usable information on which to base its determination. By issuing these supplemental questionnaires, Commerce complied with Congress's clear preference that information supplied by the parties, even imperfect information, provide the agency the evidence essential for reaching the applicable determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   In the Remand Results, Commerce found, as it did in the Final Results, that Shandong failed to provide the requested factors of production data in the form and manner requested:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   [Shandong] failed to provide a reliable, accurate database for [factors of production] on a CONNUM-specific basis. In numerous questionnaires, Commerce asked [Shandong] to provide updated databases or to explain why it could not provide its [factors of production] on a CONNUM-specific basis, yet [Shandong] continued to report its [factors of production] on a single average basis. Commerce gave [Shandong] three opportunities to provide its factors of production data on a CONNUM-specific basis and to explain its efforts to report the data on that basis, but it failed to do so. Commerce also provided [Shandong] three opportunities to explain why reporting these data on a CONNUM-specific basis was impossible. However, [Shandong] disregarded Commerce's request to report on a CONNUM-specific basis and continuously\n   <em>\n    reported factors of production on a single-average basis\n   </em>\n   , applying the average ratio to more than 100 CONNUMs, despite Commerce's instruction that it was unacceptable to report [factors of production] on a single-average basis, and with no explanation detailing [Shandong's] efforts to provide Commerce with the [factors of production] data in the form and manner requested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Remand Results at 15-16 (emphasis added). Based on this narrative, Commerce concluded that none of the factors of production information was usable because necessary factors of production information was \"missing\" from the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   The parties disagree as a factual matter as to whether Shandong provided Commerce with the factors of production information in the form and manner requested. National Nail maintains that Shandong reported all of its factors of production either on a CONNUM-specific basis or, as Commerce permitted, on a production-group basis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   After several rounds of supplemental questionnaires and responses, [Shandong] submitted revised [factors of production] databases in which all of the key [factors of production] were reported either on a CONNUM-specific basis (wire rod) or on a production-group basis (other materials, labor, coal/water, electricity). Unlike its first [factors of production] database, [Shandong's] revised [factors of production] database reflected different per-unit consumption amounts for the key [factors of production] .... [Shandong] explained that it had used different yield rates from each of the thirteen different production stages that were derived from actual material consumption data collected at each production stage.... These production group yield rates were then used to calculate the different per-unit [factors of production] consumption amounts ultimately reported in the \"production-group\" [factors of production] database.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   National Nail's Reply, ECF No. 49 at 4-5 (citations omitted). Put another way, Shandong maintains that its revised databases contained the factors of production information Commerce asked for in the form and manner that the Department ultimately agreed to accept,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , on a CONNUM-specific or production-group basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   For its part, Commerce insists that Shandong's responses did not comply with the Department's instructions. Commerce takes particular issue with the factors of production reported on a production-group basis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   [Shandong] reported certain factors of production on a production-group basis, but reported these \"factors of production on a single-average basis, applying the average ratio to more than 100 CONNUMs, despite Commerce's instruction that it was unacceptable to report [factors of production] on a single-average basis.\" Despite receiving multiple opportunities from Commerce to explain its efforts to provide the factors of production databases in the form and manner requested, [Shandong] never contacted Commerce with questions or explained why it could only provide a single-average factors of production usage ratio across all production groups.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Def.'s Resp. Cmts. 10 (quoting Remand Results at 16). Commerce, then, maintains that even though it permitted Shandong to report on a production-group basis, this resulted in reporting some costs on a single-average basis, which was unacceptable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   National Nail nevertheless maintains that Shandong's production-group database did not report costs on a single-average basis:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   Unlike [Shandong's] original \"single-average\" [factors of production] database which reflected only one average per-unit consumption amount for most of the [factors of production], the \"production-group\" [factors of production] database reflected a range of different per-unit consumption amounts for the [factors of production] that accounted for up to 98 percent of the total nail weight, as derived from yield rates calculated from thirteen different production stages. Fundamentally, [Commerce] failed to acknowledge that these differences in the final version of [Shandong's] production-group [factors of production] were ultimately more specific than the originally reported single-average [factors of production] database.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Different CONNUMs may have reported identical [factors of production amounts], but only because these CONNUMs all went through the same production groups. [Commerce] unreasonably assumed that different CONNUMs would have different per-unit consumption amounts even though these nails\n   were essentially produced in the same manner because they all went through the same production stages. Slight differences in CONNUM characteristics would not necessarily result in different per-unit [factors of production] consumption amounts.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   National Nail's Reply 5. Therefore, according to National Nail, nails of different kinds, classified as different CONNUMs, can go through the same production stages and consume the same, or nearly the same, amount of inputs, as with, for example, the chemicals and water inputs used in the electrogalvinization workshop.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Third Suppl. Sec. A and C and Fourth Suppl. Sec. D Questionnaire Resp. (July 21, 2015), P.R. 208, ECF No. 52-33 at 33 (referencing workshops, including the electrogalvinization workshop, where \"the chemicals are the main [factors of production] used to treat ... semi-finished nails. All the nails going through [a] specific workshop are processed together in a container full of liquid (water added with chemicals). There is no method or necessity to allocate the chemicals on a CONNUM-specific basis.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For National Nail, Shandong ultimately supplied Commerce with factors of production information in the form and manner requested,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , consumption amounts of some factors of production were reported on a CONNUM-specific basis (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , the amount of wire rod used in the wire-drawing workshop), and the consumption amounts of other factors of production were reported on a production-group basis (\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , chemicals and water used in other workshops, such as electrogalvinization), as permitted by Commerce. So, according to National Nail, while it may at first blush appear as though Shandong was reporting the consumption of certain factors of production on a single-average basis, that is, the same number for multiple CONNUMs, the number was not an average but represented the actual consumption of the factor of production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   National Nail is right. An examination of the treatment of two different kinds of nails, identified by different CONNUMs, illustrates the point. For example, Shandong reported low-carbon wire rod as a factor of production for two different CONNUMs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   For each CONNUM, Shandong reported different per-unit consumption amounts of wire rod,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , more rod for bigger nails. Galvanized wire-drawing powder,\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   a lubricating material, was another factor of production for both CONNUMs. For each, Shandong reported different per-unit consumption amounts of galvanized wire-drawing powder.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Second and Third Suppl. Sec. D Resp. (June 5, 2015), C.R. 136 Ex. TSD-1, ECF No. 51-6 (revised factors of production database).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   For the same two types of nails, Shandong reported consumption of other inputs, such as chemicals and water, on a\n   production-group basis. As an example, \"Electrogalvinization Nails\" are one of Shandong's thirteen production groups that went through the electrogalvanization workshop. The electrogalvinization workshop includes a thirteen-step production process in which a zinc coating is applied to nails to protect against corrosion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Sec. C and D Questionnaire Resp. (Jan. 13, 2015), P.R. 95 Ex. D-1(2) (electrogalvanization flow chart of production steps). Three of those steps are \"washing,\" one is \"rinsing,\" and one is \"hot water washing.\" Nails went through each step of this process \"in bulk\" amounts, and tracking the consumption amount of, for example, water, on a per-CONNUM basis, according to Shandong, was not feasible.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Shandong's Third Suppl. Sec. A and C and Fourth Suppl. Sec. D Questionnaire Resp. at 33. Because per-CONNUM reporting was not feasible, Shandong reported consumption of this factor of production on a production-group basis. Commerce found that the amounts consumed were reported on a single-average basis, because the consumption rate for both kinds of nails was the same.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Final IDM at 39. In fact, though, Commerce's finding cannot be reconciled with the record evidence showing that the amounts consumed were reported on a production-group basis and that the amounts consumed were reported to be identical because, as best as could be determined, they were the same. Shandong's Sec. D Questionnaire Resp. (Jan. 13, 2015), P.R. 94 Ex. D-8 (\"FOP Water Consumption\") (indicating, for example, 0.002 kilograms of water consumed per one kilogram of nails).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   These are but two kinds of nails where record evidence demonstrates that Shandong reported estimated consumption amounts of factors of production on a per-CONNUM basis, where it was able to do so, and otherwise on a production-group basis. Though equal amounts of an input,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , water, were consumed for both kinds of nails, this does not mean that water consumption was reported on a single-average basis, but rather that the reported factor of production number was the amount consumed by each production group. As noted, just because the amount of water consumed when a basket of nails is dipped in a pool is the same for different nails does not make the reported number an average. Since the information that Commerce requested was provided in accordance with its instructions,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , to report either on a CONNUM-specific basis\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   a production-group basis, its finding that Shandong \"disregarded Commerce's request to report on a CONNUM-specific basis and continuously reported factors of production on a single-average basis\" lacks the support of substantial evidence.

Commerce also found missing a narrative explanation for how Shandong's sales reconciliation and supporting worksheets tied to its financial statements.

This is because, except with respect to the unexplained revisions to the August and December 2013 data, the information Commerce found was \"missing\" is not, in fact, missing. First, the November and December 2014 sales data is not missing from the\n   record. While it is true that Shandong's\n   <em>\n    original\n   </em>\n   sales reconciliation (provided in the mid-January 2015 Submission) did not include November and December 2014 sales data, the record shows that Shandong\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   provided this information in response to a supplemental questionnaire\n   <footnotemark>\n    38\n   </footnotemark>\n   in its July 2015 Submission, and explained it was \"previously absent from its response because the data had not been prepared when the original sales reconciliation chart was submitted\" in the mid-January 2015 Submission. Final IDM at 46. Although Commerce found otherwise,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , that \"as [Shandong] was preparing its [mid-January 2015 Submission] between when it received the original questionnaire [dated November 20, 2014] and when it was due [\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , January 27, 2015], it should have been able to provide information on those last two months of ... 2014 based on the monthly internal financial statements admittedly in its possession,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   it is difficult to see how demanding complete sales information twenty-seven days after Shandong closed its books for the year was reasonable. Final IDM 44-45. Nor is it immediately obvious why information for the two months of sales data starting three months after the close of the period of review was so important. Nevertheless, since there is no dispute that the information was placed on the record\n   <em>\n    on time\n   </em>\n   in a supplemental submission solicited by Commerce, the Department's claims that information is missing from the record are not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Second, in the Final Results, Commerce, as it had in the Preliminary Results, found that Shandong provided a narrative explanation of how its sales reconciliation and supporting worksheets tied to its financial statements.

[Additionally, Shandong] provided an explanation for the revisions to the revised U.S. sales database that it submitted in response to the Department's supplemental Section D questionnaire.

Again, the information was placed on the record in a timely manner. On remand, Commerce did not find that the numbers in the sales reconciliation failed to tie. Thus, substantial evidence does not support Commerce's finding that U.S. sales data was missing for November or December 2014, or that Shandong failed to provide the requested narrative explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   As to the August and December 2013 sales data, the record does not support Commerce's finding on remand that Shandong \"did not include [these] months of sales data from the period of review\" in its sales reconciliation, as Commerce found on remand. Remand Results at 17. The record shows that Shandong\n   <em>\n    timely\n   </em>\n   submitted a revised reconciliation with\n   <em>\n    changes\n   </em>\n   to its sales data for August and December 2013 in the July 2015 Submission. Moreover, Commerce found that the changes to August and December 2013 sales numbers amounted to a\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   decrease, approximately one percent, in the total reported sales to the United States. This being the case, Commerce's findings with respect to the sales reconciliation do not support a determination of facts available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is true, though, with respect to the unsolicited changes to the August and December 2013 sales data, that Shandong did not provide an explanation, as is required by the regulations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=19%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20351.301\">\n    19 C.F.R. \u00a7 351.301\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (\"If the factual information is being submitted to rebut, clarify, or correct factual information on the record, the submitter must provide a written explanation identifying the information which is already on the record that the factual information seeks to rebut, clarify, or correct, including the name of the interested party that submitted the information and the date on which the information was submitted.\"). As such, and because the revisions to the August and December 2013 sales data were submitted roughly a month before the fully extended deadline for the Preliminary Results, Commerce did not act unreasonably by declining to issue another supplemental questionnaire asking Shandong to explain its revisions. Shandong's failure to provide an explanation for\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   changes in the two months of sales data, though, was insufficient to justify Commerce's finding that none of the sales data was usable, nor was it sufficient to provide the sole basis for drawing an adverse inference with respect to all of the sales information on record. Indeed, since there does not seem to be any question about the accuracy of the sales data, it is not unreasonable for Commerce to accept an explanation on remand.

If the explanation is not sufficient, then, the Department may use facts available to fill in any gaps in that information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Based on the foregoing, it appears that the November and December 2014 sales data and the requested narrative explanation that the Department claims was missing from the record were on the record at the time of the Preliminary Results.

Without the objective and subjective findings required by\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel\n   </em>\n   , Commerce has failed to provide the court with a discernable reason for finding that Shandong was not doing its best to comply with Commerce's requests for information. Finally, it bears repeating that the use of adverse inferences when determining a respondent's rate is intended to create \"a deterrent to non-compliance,\" which as far as can be seen is not needed to encourage Shandong's efforts to supply requested information.\n   <em>\n    Ta Chen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11454948\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/298/1330/#p1340\">\n    298 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1340 (citing\n   <em>\n    De Cecco\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11218246\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/216/1027/#p1032\">\n    216 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1032 ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Accordingly, on remand, Commerce must use the sales information Shandong provided in making its comparison of normal value and the price at which the subject merchandise was sold in the United States, including (1) sales data from November and December 2014, although it is hard to see how information outside the period of review can be put to use, and (2) the narrative explanation Shandong provided to tie its sales reconciliation and supporting documentation to its financial statements.

Shandong's Affiliate Jining Dragon's Shooting Nails\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Related to Commerce's finding that necessary U.S. sales information was missing from the record, is the Department's finding that Shandong failed to provide \"sufficient information showing that [Jining Dragon] produced and sold only\n   <em>\n    non-subject\n   </em>\n   merchandise to the United States during the [period of review].\" Remand Results at 16 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   The Order excluded certain fasteners from its scope,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , \"fasteners suitable for use in powder-actuated hand tools, not threaded and threaded, which are currently classified under [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States subheadings] 7317.00.20 and 7317.00.30.\" Order,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=73%20Fed.%20Reg.%2044%2C961\">\n    73 Fed. Reg. at 44,961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before Commerce, Shandong argued that Jining Dragon's \"shooting nails\" fell within this exclusion. Based on this representation, Commerce conditionally withdrew its request that Shandong provide Jining Dragon's production and U.S. sales databases for the allegedly excluded shooting nails, but continued to seek information on whether the nails were, in fact, excluded from the scope of the Order. That is, based on the information provided regarding Jining Dragon's shooting nails, the Department indicated that it would \"consider whether it is necessary to request that [Jining Dragon] submit a Section C and D database.\" Commerce's Letter to Shandong re: Shandong's Request for Excusal (July 2, 2015), P.R. 194, ECF No. 52-31.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Ultimately, Commerce found that Shandong failed to show that the shooting nails met the criteria for exclusion from the Order. For Commerce, because Shandong failed to show that the shooting nails were excluded from the Order, it was required to provide production and sales information for Jining Dragon's U.S. sales of shooting nails during the period of review. In the Remand Results, Commerce stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   [Shandong] failed to provide requested details regarding sales and [factors of production] data for [Jining Dragon's] shooting nails, instead claiming that shooting nails were excluded from the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   without substantiating\n   its claim. As such, Commerce determined that [Shandong] failed to explain adequately why shooting nails produced and exported by [Jining Dragon] are outside the scope of the\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   , warranting the application of adverse inferences in selecting from the facts otherwise available. Therefore, pursuant to [ 19 U.S.C \u00a7 1677e(a)(2)(A), (B), and (C) ], Commerce finds that the application of facts available is warranted because [Shandong] failed to provide necessary information requested by Commerce, in the form and manner requested, and significantly impeded our ability to conduct the review. Moreover, because [Shandong's] deficiencies were so pervasive, impeding Commerce's ability to conduct its review, and [Shandong] did not cooperate to the best of its ability, Commerce determined that total [adverse facts available], consistent with [subsection 1677e(b) ], was warranted.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Remand Results at 17-18.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   National Nail maintains that Commerce never informed Shandong that it had failed to demonstrate to Commerce's satisfaction that Jining Dragon's shooting nails were excluded from the Order. According to National Nail, the Department failed to \"give [Shandong] any request or opportunity to submit the shooting nails sales and [factors of production] data.\" NN's Cmts. 9. In National Nail's view, Commerce \"inappropriately and arbitrarily jumped from giving [Shandong] a conditional excusal to not report its shooting nail data to giving [Shandong] total [adverse facts available].\" NN's Cmts. 9.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Commerce counters that it \"specifically requested [sales and factors of production] information [for the shooting nails], in addition to evidence demonstrating whether the shooting nails were subject merchandise--specifically, whether the shooting nails were used in a 'powder-actuated hand tool,' as required by the exclusion in the order.\" Def.'s Resp. Cmts. 13-14 (citing Final IDM at 52-53). Further, Commerce maintains that it \"also informed [Shandong] that it required answers to all other portions of the questionnaires pertaining to [Jining Dragon's] alleged shooting nails because the information submitted did not sufficiently address whether [its] nails were excluded from the order.\" Def.'s Resp. Cmts. 14 (citing Final IDM at 52-53). Shandong, however, did not provide the requested information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   The record here supports Commerce's decision to use facts available with respect to Jining Dragon's shooting nails. The Department asked for information about the shooting nails to determine whether or not they were within the scope of the Order,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , whether they were used in a \"powder-actuated hand tool.\" For example, in one of the supplemental questionnaires Commerce instructed, \"For two product codes of shooting nails ... please provide product specifications or model diagrams, of each product type's head style, point style, shank style, and\n   <em>\n    the hand tool with material used in the hand tool to shoot this nail, along with supporting documentation\n   </em>\n   .\" Final IDM at 54 (emphasis added). Shandong's responses to the supplemental questionnaires were insufficient because Shandong \"simply stated ... again without any supporting evidence that the shooting nails were used in a 'shooting gun' and that material used was 'gunpowder.' \" Final IDM at 54. Further, \"[w]hile [Shandong] again provided the same product specifications and sales packages for [its affiliate Jining Dragon's] two types of shooting nails, these documents did not contain any information regarding the hand tool or material used in the hand tool, as specifically requested by the Department.\" Final IDM at 54. Without the information the Department requested concerning\n   the hand tool used to shoot the nail, including the supporting documentation, Commerce could not determine whether the terms of the exclusion were satisfied.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, substantial record evidence supports Commerce's decision to use facts available to fill in necessary information that was missing from the record regarding shooting nails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   Additionally, Commerce's application of an adverse inference was reasonable because the record supports the conclusion that Shandong did not act to the best of its ability to cooperate with the Department's requests for shooting nails information under the objective and subjective standards in\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel\n   </em>\n   . That is, there can be little doubt that \"a reasonable and responsible [respondent]\" that sells a variety of steel nails in the United States, some of which it believed were not subject to the Order, would have known that it should maintain information that would support such an exclusion,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the kind of hand tool used to drive in the nail.\n   <em>\n    Nippon Steel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9109445\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/337/1373/#p1381\">\n    337 F.3d at 1382\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Here, Commerce reasonably sought information as to whether Jining Dragon's shooting nails were within the scope of the Order that surely was in Shandong's hands or in the hands of Jining Dragon from which it could be obtained. Indeed, in its case brief (\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , after the close of the fact-gathering stage and the publication of the Preliminary Results), Shandong conceded that it did not provide \"the technical description of the powder-actuated nail gun\" that Commerce requested, claiming that \"that information [was] not in the possession of [Shandong].\" Shandong's Case Br.

Accordingly, the decision to apply adverse facts available with respect to Shandong's shooting nails information is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Commerce notes the absence of reliable information as to shooting nails as a reason to apply total adverse facts available. While it is doubtful that the Department would contend that the lack of information on shooting nails alone was sufficient to apply total adverse facts available to Shandong's U.S. sales, there is little doubt that the absence of sales information for imports constituting 0.001 of total sales would be insufficient to support the use of total adverse facts available.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION and ORDER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Commerce's application of total adverse facts available in the Remand Results is neither supported by substantial evidence nor in accordance with law.
