D'Aquilla, District Attorney for the 20th Judicial District, individually and in his official capacity; J. Austin Daniel, Sheriff, West Feliciana Parish (\"Sheriff Daniel\"); and various unknown insurance companies and unknown defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the outset, the Court recognizes that the allegations set forth in Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    First Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   are disturbing and presented in vivid detail. At this stage of the matter, this Court is charged with accepting the pled facts as true. The Court also notes that this matter, as pled, is factually unique to the body of cases implicated by the alleged claims, defenses, and the instant motion. While the claims, defenses, and arguments raised are not new to this Court, the law as applied to the facts alleged is largely uncharted in this Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Plaintiff claims that, on December 1, 2016, Boeker raped her at his home on the grounds of the Louisiana State Penitentiary.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff claims that Boeker sexually assaulted her a second time on December 3, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff had a rape kit administered and completed on December 8, 2016, at Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges that the report on the rape kit noted bruising in the pattern of fingers and hand prints and a red, irritated cervix. Photographs were taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff pleads disturbing facts and circumstances of the alleged rape and sexual assault, the rape kit findings, and her alleged damages.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Boeker was arrested for second degree rape on December 20, 2016; however, he was never indicted or convicted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff alleges she was denied equal protection and due process under the law as a result of the failure of the DA and Sheriff Daniel to investigate Boeker's alleged crimes and obtain the rape kit, which Plaintiff claims demonstrates a conspiracy to protect Boeker. Plaintiff also claims her constitutional right have been violated by the DA and Sheriff Daniel's alleged policy of disproportionate\n   treatment of women and sexual assault victims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Prior to the grand jury hearing, Plaintiff avers that neither the DA nor Sheriff Daniel requested, picked-up, or examined her rape kit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the rape kit along with the photographic evidence contained therein did not become a part of the DA's investigative file and was never presented to the grand jury. Plaintiff also claims that, prior to the grand jury hearing, the DA did not interview or speak to Plaintiff because, according to DA in a public statement, he was \"uncomfortable\" doing so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff further claims that the DA marked up his file copy of the police report to point out purported discrepancies in Plaintiff's description of the events and pointedly noted \"plead 5\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   \" on the police report.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because it comprised part of the DA's investigatory file, the annotated and underlined police report was presented to the grand jury. Plaintiff also alleges that the DA colluded with the Sheriff to not investigate her rape claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The gravamen of the Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Complaint\n   </em>\n   is that the DA worked in concert with the Sherriff to significantly curtail the thoroughness of the investigative process in order to manipulate the grand jury outcome.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 21, 2017, Plaintiff filed this action against Boeker, the DA, and Sheriff Daniel seeking to hold them individually and jointly liable for damages resulting from the alleged rape, sexual assault, and what Plaintiff alleges as the lack of investigation into her criminal complaints against Boeker. Plaintiff also seeks declaratory and injunctive relief.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   In Plaintiff's\n   <em>\n    Amended Complaint\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Plaintiff asserted the following causes of action adverse to the following Defendants: (1) violation of the 14th Amendment (Equal Protection) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Louisiana Constitution Article I, Section 3 (Right to Individual Dignity) adverse to District Attorney D'Aquilla and Sheriff Daniel in their individual and official capacities;\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) violation of the 14th Amendment (Substantive Due Process) under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Louisiana Constitution Article I, Section 2 (Due Process) adverse to District Attorney D'Aquilla and Sheriff Daniel in their individual and official capacities;\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   (3) Civil Conspiracy to violate civil rights under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1985 adverse to all Defendants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (4) Abuse of Process under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   adverse to all Defendants;\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   (5) Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress, Negligent Infliction of Emotional Distress, Assault, Battery, False Imprisonment, Rape, and Sexual Battery under Louisiana State Law adverse to Defendant Boeker;\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (6) Direct Action Claims under Louisiana State Law adverse to all Defendant unknown insurance companies.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the motion before this Court, the DA seeks dismissal of Plaintiff's claims under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of standing and under Rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted on her substantive federal and state law claims. Plaintiff opposes the Defendant's motion, arguing that she has demonstrated Article III standing, that Defendant is not entitled to any immunity, and she has sufficiently and specifically pled plausible causes of action adverse to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

The plaintiff challenged the statute because it only applied to parents of children born of marriage. She also sought an injunction forbidding the district attorney from declining to prosecute the biological father of her child simply because they were unmarried. The case was dismissed for lack of standing on the nexus prong. The Supreme Court found that the plaintiff had \"an interest in the support of her child\" and suffered an injury,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , lack of payment of child support without a legal mechanism to enforce payment. However, the Court ruled that the plaintiff could not show the second prong of the standing requirement, namely, a \"direct nexus\" between her injury and the government action which she attacked.\n   <footnotemark>\n    55\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   The Court's prior decisions consistently hold that a citizen lacks standing to contest the policies of the prosecuting authority when he himself is neither prosecuted nor threatened with prosecution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Younger v.

Although\n   <em>\n    these cases arose in a somewhat different context\n   </em>\n   , they demonstrate that, in American jurisprudence at least, a private citizen lacks a judicially cognizable interest in the prosecution or nonprosecution of another. Appellant\n   <em>\n    does\n   </em>\n   have an interest in the support of her child. But given the special status of criminal prosecutions in our system, we hold that appellant has made an insufficient showing of a\n   <em>\n    direct nexus\n   </em>\n   between the vindication of her interest and the enforcement of the State's criminal laws.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Linda\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court pragmatically recognized that the plaintiff lacked a nexus between her injury/interest (support for her child) and enforcement of the law at issue because enforcement would likely place the father in jail unable to pay the child support that she was ultimately seeking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Turning to the present case, neither Plaintiff nor Defendant directed the Court to Fifth Circuit jurisprudence supporting a finding that the Plaintiff lacks standing in this matter. Likewise, the Court did not identify Fifth Circuit jurisprudence pertinent to the issue of standing under similar factual circumstances. The DA cites the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Parkhurst v. Tabor\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    58\n   </footnotemark>\n   which relies upon\n   <em>\n    Linda.\n   </em>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Parkhurst\n   </em>\n   , the biological mother and adoptive father of a minor child asserted claims under Section 1983 against Arkansas state prosecutors and the county, alleging a violation of their child's right to equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment based on the prosecutors' decision to forego prosecution of the child's biological father for sexual assault of the child. The Western District of Arkansas granted the prosecutor's Rule 12 motion. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, holding that the plaintiffs did not suffer an injury in fact and therefore lacked standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In its analysis, the Eighth Circuit cited to\n   <em>\n    Linda\n   </em>\n   , stating: \"[C]rime victims have standing to challenge allegedly discriminatory prosecutorial conduct only if those victims have a constitutional right to the nondiscriminatory prosecution of crime such that its deprivation constitutes injury in fact.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    59\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Parkhurst\n   </em>\n   court specifically recognized that \"crime victims have standing\" where there is a showing that the allegedly discriminatory treatment implicates the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    60\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Next, the\n   <em>\n    Parkhurst\n   </em>\n   court drew a distinction between crime victims who have standing to bring claims based on the alleged \"failure to protect\" rather than the alleged \"failure to prosecute\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   The Parkhursts point to several cases where crime victims were determined to have a right to challenge the allegedly discriminatory provision of police protection.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estate of Macias v.

Rather, Plaintiff seeks relief for the failure to investigate her claims, for the alleged conspiracy with the Sheriff not to investigate her claims, and for the alleged long-standing practice, policies and procedures that fostered the failure to investigate resulting in a discriminatory impact upon sexual assault victims and women in violation of the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    62\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The DA also relies on\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

As set forth above, there is jurisprudential support for the finding the Plaintiff has standing based on the alleged violation of the Equal Protection Clause. The Court will discuss the viability of the alleged constitutional violations in greater detail below.

Fitzsimmons\n   </em>\n   alleged that the defendants, state prosecutors who had participated in the early stages of the sheriff's department's investigation, entered into a pre-indictment conspiracy with the sheriff's deputies to create false evidence linking a boot owned by the plaintiff with a bootprint left at a murder scene.\n   <footnotemark>\n    121\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants asserted the defense of absolute immunity, but the Supreme Court determined that the defendants had failed to carry their burden of \"establishing that they were functioning as\n   'advocates' when they were endeavoring to determine whether the bootprint at the scene of the crime had been made by [the plaintiff's] foot.\" In reaching this conclusion, the Court recognized that, although \" 'the duties of a prosecutor in his role as advocate for the State involve actions preliminary to the initiation of a prosecution and actions apart from the courtroom,' [t]here is a difference between an advocate's role in evaluating evidence and interviewing witnesses as he prepares for trial, on the one hand, and the detective's role in searching for clues and corroboration that might give him probable cause to recommend that a suspect be arrested, on the other hand.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    122\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Supreme Court also noted in\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   that the conduct of the prosecutors was \"during the period before they convened a special grand jury,\" finding that the prosecutors' mission \"at that time was entirely investigative in character.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    123\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Court stated that it was \"well after\" the alleged fabrication of evidence that the grand jury was empaneled.\n   <footnotemark>\n    124\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the Court characterized the timing of the conduct in question as occurring before the prosecutors could properly claim to be acting as advocates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    125\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, the Court held the defendants were not shielded by absolute immunity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    126\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The DA also relies on\n   <em>\n    Charles v. Greenberg\n   </em>\n   , an Eastern District of Louisiana case, where the testing of a rape kit was at issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    127\n   </footnotemark>\n   In\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was exonerated and released from prison for a 1982 aggravated rape conviction after a DNA test of the rape kit revealed that he was not the perpetrator. Following his exoneration, the plaintiff filed suit under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   alleging that the prosecutor wrongfully opposed his post-indictment, pre-trial request to test the rape kit. The prosecutor defendants claimed absolute immunity. After setting forth the controlling standards in\n   <em>\n    Imbler\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Buckley\n   </em>\n   , the\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   court noted that the requests to have the rape kit tested were post-indictment, presented in court, and the prosecutors' opposition to these requests was\n   heard in court. This was found to be a part of the prosecutors' \"official duties\" and \"directly attached to the judicial process,\" thus, absolute immunity attached.\n   <footnotemark>\n    128\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The Court finds the holding in\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   inapposite to the facts presently before the Court. The challenges to the testing of the rape kit in\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   were not pre-indictment. Rather, the issue was litigated in open court as part of the pre-trial evidentiary proceedings following indictment. In\n   <em>\n    Charles\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's motion to test the rape kit was an effort to perpetuate exculpatory trial evidence. A prosecutor's in-court advocacy in opposing a request to test a rape kit is part of his/her prosecutorial duties. This is markedly different from the allegations presented herein which involve purported investigative omissions that occurred before the grand jury convened. Taking the allegations as true for purposes of this motion, the Court finds these acts and/or omissions were related to investigation as opposed to advocacy and thus not cloaked by absolute immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   The Court finds that the DA's alleged conduct in failing to request, obtain, and examine the rape kit; making notes on the police report; and failing to interview the Plaintiff prior to the grand jury hearing\n   <footnotemark>\n    129\n   </footnotemark>\n   were investigative functions for which absolute immunity does not apply. On the other hand, the alleged failure to call specific witnesses before the grand jury\n   <footnotemark>\n    130\n   </footnotemark>\n   is an advocacy or prosecutorial function for the which the DA is absolutely immune. Thus, the DA is shielded by absolute prosecutorial immunity for the prosecutorial function of determining how to conduct the grand jury hearing. Accordingly, the DA's\n   <em>\n    Motion to Dismiss\n   </em>\n   individual capacity claims brought against him based on absolute immunity is granted as to his prosecutorial functions and denied as to his alleged investigative conduct.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-189\">\n    Rec.

Rec. Doc. No. 74, p. 3. The DA relied on\n    <em>\n     Cook v.

The DA is correct that the Fifth Circuit in\n    <em>\n     Cook v. Houston Post\n    </em>\n    stated: \"Not all of an advocate's work is done in the courtroom. For a lawyer to properly try a case, he must confer with witnesses, and conduct some of his own factual investigation.\"\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1392055\" index=\"233\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/616/791/\">\n     616 F.2d at 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . However, the Court notes that: (1)\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    was decided in 1980, approximately 13 years before the Supreme Court decided\n    <em>\n     Buckley v. Fitzsimmons\n    </em>\n    ; and (2) the\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    opinion is ambiguous as to whether the witness interviews occurred before the grand jury hearing or not. The opinion states that the grand jury investigation had been in progress \"several months\" before the district attorney was assigned to the case (\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1392055\" index=\"234\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/616/791/\">\n     616 F.2d at\n    </extracted-citation>\n    793 ), and then stated that the district attorney would have been negligent if he had not interviewed witnesses \"before presenting the testimony to the grand jury.\"\n    <em>\n     Cook\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1392055\" index=\"235\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/616/791/\">\n     616 F.2d at 793\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .

Accordingly, the DA is not shielded from\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    liability by absolute prosecutorial immunity.

An \"official policy\" may be established in one of three ways: (1) \"when the appropriate officer or entity promulgates a generally applicable statement of policy and the subsequent act complained of is simply an implementation of that policy; (2) where no rule has been announced as 'policy' but federal law has been violated by an act of the policymaker itself; and (3) even where the policymaker has failed to act affirmatively at all, so long as the need to take some action to control the agents of the government 'is so obvious, and the inadequacy [of existing practice] so likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights, that the policymaker ... can reasonably be said to have been deliberately indifferent to the need.' \"\n    <footnotemark>\n     163\n    </footnotemark>\n    From the Plaintiff's\n    <em>\n     Amended Complaint\n    </em>\n    , it appears her allegations fit within the second and third categories.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Specifically, Plaintiff alleges that, on information and belief, the West Feliciana Parish District Attorney's Office does not currently, nor did it at the time of the alleged assaults and through June 2017, have a policy requiring rape kits and sexual assault examinations to be picked up and reviewed or sent to the state crime lab for testing.\n    <footnotemark>\n     164\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff further alleges that, with deliberate indifference, DA D'Aquilla failed to draft or implement procedures in the District Attorney's Office to ensure proper investigation of rape cases and proper review, examination, collection, and handling of rape kits and sexual assault examinations.\n    <footnotemark>\n     165\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff also alleges that, on information and belief, Defendant Boeker knew of DA D'Aquilla's \"long-standing refusal to properly investigate sexual assault crimes against women and/or female identified individuals,\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     166\n    </footnotemark>\n    and Defendants \"have a history of discriminating against women and/or individuals who identify as female. Defendants have failed to investigate or take seriously reports of\n    sexual assault from women and generally treat these allegations with less priority than other crimes not involving sexual assaults against women.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     167\n    </footnotemark>\n    Finally, Plaintiff alleges that \"[a] departmental policy established or enacted by ... Defendant D'Aquilla ... in their respective municipal organizations requiring collection and examination of rape kits would have prevented plaintiff's injury, and extreme emotional pain and suffering.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     168\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-133\">\n    Additionally, Plaintiff has alleged that DA D'Aquilla directly participated in the allegedly unconstitutional conduct. Plaintiff alleges that: the DA refused to examine or pick up her rape kit;\n    <footnotemark>\n     169\n    </footnotemark>\n    his mark-up of the police report highlighted only Plaintiff's possible discrepancies and cast doubt only on Plaintiff;\n    <footnotemark>\n     170\n    </footnotemark>\n    neither the DA nor any member of his staff met with Plaintiff in person prior to the grand jury hearing, nor did they ever speak to her about the alleged assaults;\n    <footnotemark>\n     171\n    </footnotemark>\n    at the grand jury hearing, the DA did not call the police officers who investigated the case or the nurse who conducted Plaintiff's sexual exam, and no expert from the coroner's office was called to testify about the rape kit;\n    <footnotemark>\n     172\n    </footnotemark>\n    the DA attempted to proceed to the grandy jury hearing without Plaintiff's testimony after he reneged on a promise to her lawyer that he would give her a continuance to prepare;\n    <footnotemark>\n     173\n    </footnotemark>\n    after a no true bill, the DA told reporters that the issue in the case was credibility and there were no photos or witness cooperation;\n    <footnotemark>\n     174\n    </footnotemark>\n    the DA told reporters he did not pick up or examine the rape kit because it was unnecessary because it would not speak to the issue of consent;\n    <footnotemark>\n     175\n    </footnotemark>\n    the DA told reporters that Defendant Boeker claimed it was consensual but \"kind of rough\" sex, a simple credibility call;\n    <footnotemark>\n     176\n    </footnotemark>\n    days after a news station reported that Plaintiff's rape kit was never retrieved or examined, the DA told the Advocate that his office had called the coroner's office and asked for the rape kit multiple times;\n    <footnotemark>\n     177\n    </footnotemark>\n    the DA told reporters that he presents everything in his file every time there is a grand jury;\n    <footnotemark>\n     178\n    </footnotemark>\n    and the DA met with Boeker and his attorney, who is related to the DA, after his arrest\n    <footnotemark>\n     179\n    </footnotemark>\n    and conspired with other Defendants, including Plaintiff's alleged rapist, to ensure that Boeker would not be investigated for rape.\n    <footnotemark>\n     180\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-134\">\n    These very specific factual allegations dispel the DA's argument that Plaintiff's allegations are conclusory or boilerplate. The Court must accept Plaintiff's allegations as true for the purpose of this motion, and Plaintiff's factual allegations are specific and, in many instances, purport to be quotes given to the media. Plaintiff is not required to prove her case at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, and the Court finds that her claim that it was policy or customary practice for the DA to fail to investigate or give credence to reports of sexual assault by women is plausible under the facts pled.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-135\">\n    Further, the facts pled, if proven, would constitute deliberate indifference rather than mere negligence on the part of the DA.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    <em>\n     e. Moving Force Behind Constitutional Violations\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    The DA maintains that Plaintiff has failed to state a claim because she has not alleged a constitutional violation. Plaintiff claims that the DA's conduct and policy violated her constitutional rights to equal protection and due process/access to the courts. The Court has determined as set forth above that Plaintiff has alleged a constitutional violation under the Equal Protection Clause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    <em>\n     f.

This policy, when enforced, caused a constitutional deprivation to Plaintiff. Even if Defendants' conduct did not rise to the level of an express policy, the practice of failing to properly collect and review rape kits and/or the practice of failing to investigate sexual assault allegations by women was so widespread and/or custom that, although not authorized by written law or express municipal policy, was so permanent and well settled as to constitute a custom or usage with the force of law.\n    <footnotemark>\n     186\n    </footnotemark>\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-143\">\n    As set forth above, to sustain a gender-based equal protection challenge, a plaintiff must show \"(1) the existence of a policy, practice, or custom of law enforcement to provide less protection to victims of domestic assault than to victims of other assaults; (2) that discrimination against women was a motivating factor; and (3) that the plaintiff was injured by the policy, custom or practice.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     187\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff allegations as detailed above satisfy this three-part\n    test. However, the Court finds that Plaintiff has failed to allege a \"class of one\" cause of action, which she pleads in the alternative. To state a class of one equal protection claim, a plaintiff must offer a comparator she contends is similarly situated, but treated more favorably for no rational purpose.\n    <footnotemark>\n     188\n    </footnotemark>\n    Plaintiff has not alleged a similarly situated comparator.
