Given the shortage of district judges and staff, this Court addresses only the arguments, evidence, and matters necessary to reach the decision in this order. The parties and counsel are encouraged to contact the offices of United States Senators Feinstein and Harris to address this Court's inability to accommodate the parties and this action. The parties are required to reconsider consent to conduct all further proceedings before a Magistrate Judge, whose schedules are far more realistic and accommodating to parties than that of U.S. Chief District Judge Lawrence J. O'Neill, who must prioritize criminal and older civil cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Civil trials set before Chief Judge O'Neill trail until he becomes available and are subject to suspension mid-trial to accommodate criminal matters. Civil trials are no longer reset to a later date if Chief Judge O'Neill is unavailable on the original date set for trial. Moreover, this Court's Fresno Division randomly and without advance notice reassigns civil actions to U.S. District Judges throughout the Nation to serve as visiting judges. In the absence of Magistrate Judge consent, this action is subject to reassignment to a U.S. District Judge from inside or outside the Eastern District of California.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     INTRODUCTION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 18, 2018, a City of Ceres police officer fatally shot fifteen-year-old Carmen Mendez following pursuit of a vehicle in which Mendez was a passenger.

Here, Carmen's mother is a necessary party, and her interest in the wrongful death claim will be impaired by the complete foreclosure of her ability to bring her own such claim in a separate suit under California law. Nonjoinder of Carmen's mother also presents a substantial probability of one or more suits concerning the same claims and issues being brought subsequent to final adjudication of this case. That burdens the courts, and new controversies among the parties might be invited. Therefore, the Court finds that joinder of a necessary party, Carmen's mother, is required in order to protect her interest and for reasons of judicial economy,\n   including the possibility of a separate suit or suits related to the wrongful death claim in this matter.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Defendants' motion to stay pending joinder is DENIED; however, the Court orders,\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   , joinder of Carmen's mother as a Plaintiff to the wrongful death claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     The Remaining Claims Under \u00a7 1983, and California's State Law and Constitution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    (1)\n    <em>\n     Complete Relief\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Regarding the remaining claims, the Court finds that complete relief can be afforded to those already party to the action, as the first portion of Rule 19 \"is concerned only with 'relief as between the persons already parties, not as between a party and the absent person whose joinder is sought.' \"\n   <em>\n    Eldredge v.

Plaintiffs and Defendants make no argument that current parties cannot be provided complete relief in relation to the present parties, and the Court finds nothing to support a determination otherwise. Relief available to current Plaintiffs vis-\u00e0-vis Defendants is in no way limited by the absence of Carmen's mother, and the same is true of Defendants vis-\u00e0-vis current Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     Legally Protected Interest\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Evaluating the second prong of 'necessity' as it relates to the remaining claims, the Court starts with Defendants' incompletely developed suggestion that the decedent's mother is a necessary party because she is a successor-in-interest to Carmen's estate. ECF No. 9-1 at 1-2. Defendants do not explain why, as a successor-in-interest, Carmen's mother is necessary, but the Court will begin by assuming that Defendants are suggesting that she has a legally protected interest in the proceedings. A successor-in-interest would be deemed necessary if both of the following are true: 1) the person has a legally protected interest in the subject of that action; and 2) either protection of that interest will be impaired by absence, or the person's absence will subject an existing party to multiple, inconsistent legal obligations with respect to that interest.

Indeed, as to the first claim for unreasonable force under \u00a7 1983 and the fifth claim for unreasonable force under California's Bane Act (the only claims brought on behalf of Carmen's estate by a successor-in-interest), should Carmen's father recover on behalf of the estate, Carmen's mother in turn may recover from the estate as an additional successor-in-interest. The simple reason that Carmen's mother is a successor-in-interest does not require her joinder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Court's analysis, however, would be incomplete if it rested here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (b)\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Res Judicata and Collateral Estoppel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The issue of joinder becomes murkier when the Court evaluates the necessity of Carmen's mother as it relates to the doctrines of collateral estoppel and res judicata.

Agedness alone is not problematic, so long as the aged cases fall into a pattern of sufficient duration, frequency, and consistency. But here, the Court is skeptical that the cases do fall into such a pattern. There is a gap of five years between the oldest cases and the 2013 case, and three years between the 2013 case and the 2016 pending/prior cases. The gaps in isolation may or may not be problematic, but taken together, the two gaps do present a deficiency, at least as currently pled, because they suggest a single incident in eight years' time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   As previously noted, isolated or sporadic events are not predicates for liability,\n   <em>\n    Trevino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7652336\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/99/911/#p918\">\n    99 F.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and the gap in time from the five oldest cases to the more recent cases suggest the absence of a pattern of violations. As a result, the cases ranging from 1998 to 2008 do not seem to support a pattern of timing such that the municipality and final policymakers would be on notice for events in 2018, when only a single incident occurred between 2008\n   and 2016 (the 2013 case). The filing dates of the recent examples, however, span 2016-2018, and the instant events occurred in 2018, which is clearly very close in time. The Court underscores, though, that it does not have incident dates before it to complete its analysis as to the actual temporal relation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    (2)\n    <em>\n     Factual Similarity of the Prior Incidents\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Plaintiffs have provided basic information on the ten alleged prior violations, allowing for some evaluation of factual similarity.

Here, Plaintiffs allege that the City, Police Department, and Smith \"were or should have been on notice regarding the need to discontinue, modify, and/or implement new and different versions of policies, customs, or practices because the inadequacies were so obvious.\" ECF No. \u00b6 31. Critically, this statement is not an actual averment as to what the City (or the other Defendants, for that matter) did or did not do in relation to the incidents Plaintiffs have listed in their complaint. Plaintiffs have included no information on investigations, or lack thereof; no information on disciplining or reprimanding of officers, or lack thereof; and so forth.\n   <em>\n    Starr\n   </em>\n   and its progeny have set a higher pleading standard than formerly applied in \u00a7 1983 actions, including\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims. A plaintiff must articulate theory and facts giving rise to a plausible inference of deliberate indifference, and here, there are no facts concerning subsequent action or inaction in the wake of the incidents alleged by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Taking a step back, the Court has employed three factors in evaluating whether Plaintiffs have alleged a sufficient pattern of prior constitutional violations to demonstrate plausibly deliberate indifference regarding training and supervision related to unreasonable force. The three factors employed-timing, similarity, and subsequent municipal action-are evaluated together. In this matter, the Court finds that the timing of at least five cases weighs against Plaintiffs as detailed above. At least four cases may be sufficiently close in time but exact incident dates are missing from the pleading. Regarding factual similarity, the Court finds that Plaintiffs have presented a pattern of cases in which significant force is alleged to have been used in situations where the force may plausibly be said to have been excessive, but the Court notes that context is missing from one case, some cases involve factually distinct circumstances, and other sets of facts, such as the tenure of Smith as chief, are simply missing. Finally, the Court observes a total absence of information regarding subsequent action or inaction by the municipality, other than one generalized statement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   Taking these three factors in their entirety, Plaintiffs have not alleged sufficiently a pattern of prior, similar constitutional violations that plausibly demonstrate deliberate indifference in training or supervision, such that the pattern permits inference of policy or lack of policy on excessive force.

Plaintiffs' reliance on the list of cases purporting to establish a pattern of constitutional violations fails because Plaintiffs have not contextualized the cases is a way that demonstrates plausibly Smith's knowledge of the alleged constitutional violations, his knowledge of the culpable actions of his subordinates, and his inaction in response, such that a deliberate inference of indifference can be made.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 C(2)(e)\n   <em>\n    above\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   For the reasons above, Defendants' motion to dismiss Brent Smith from claim one is GRANTED, with leave to amend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   <strong>\n    b.\n    <em>\n     Excessive Force under California's Constitution\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Defendants move to dismiss Smith from Plaintiffs' claim for excessive force brought under California's Constitution, but Defendants do not separately evaluate or provide argument specific to that claim.

Because Defendants have not addressed why, under principles of\n   <em>\n    respondeat superior\n   </em>\n   , Smith's alleged actions or omissions would not give rise to vicarious liability, and because the Court has no independent duty to evaluate this non-jurisdictional issue, the Court DENIES Defendants' motion to dismiss Smith from claim four.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   <strong>\n    c.\n    <em>\n     Excessive Force under the Bane Act\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Defendants also move to dismiss Smith from Plaintiffs' claim for excessive force brought under California's Bane Act, but again, Defendants do not separately evaluate or provide argument specific to that claim.

The Ninth Circuit's reasoning is, in part, that: \"A policy by the federal courts never to advance beyond existing state court precedent would vest in defendants the power to bar the successful adjudication of plaintiffs' claims in cases with novel issues; defendants could ensure a decision in their favor simply by removing the case to federal court.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1710121\" index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/819/875/#p879\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   Here, Plaintiffs have engaged in a full analysis of the viability of their claim pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Katzberg\n   </em>\n   , under which the California Supreme Court laid out the \"framework for determining the existence of a damages action to remedy an asserted constitutional violation.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"777228\" index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/29/300/\">\n    29 Cal. 4th at 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20482\">\n    127 Cal.Rptr.2d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=58%20P.3d%20339\">\n    58 P.3d 339\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Second, under a theory of right to familial association, companionship, and society, Plaintiffs bring a claim on behalf of Carmen's father, brothers, aunt, grandmother, and grandfather.

Cal. 2013) (explaining, in n.17, that\n    <em>\n     Kama\n    </em>\n    does not stand clearly for the proposition that law enforcement agencies in California cannot be sued in federal court but noting the number of decisions in the Eastern District of California citing\n    <em>\n     Kama\n    </em>\n    in support of exactly that). As the court in\n    <em>\n     Rodgers v. City of Pasadena\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n    , explained: \"[G]iven that in\n    <em>\n     Streit\n    </em>\n    , the Ninth Circuit specifically held that the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is subject to liability under Section 1983, whereas\n    <em>\n     Kama\n    </em>\n    concerned whether the Portland Police Bureau can be considered a 'person' under Section 844(a) of the Controlled Substances Act, the Court finds\n    <em>\n     Streit\n    </em>\n    to be more relevant and persuasive here. Accordingly, the Court declines to dismiss the [police department] on the grounds that it is improperly named as a distinct entity from the City.\" No. 2:16-cv-03616-CAS (Ex),\n    <extracted-citation index=\"210\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%207240135\">\n     2016 WL 7240135\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , at *3.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    The violations asserted in the five cases from 1998 to 2008 are: 1) a 1998-filed case alleging an officer fatally shot an unarmed, fleeing parolee in the back; 2) a 2003-filed case alleging officer assaulted, threatened, and pistol-whipped a non-threatening person while a fellow officer stood by without intervening; 3) a 2004-filed case alleging officers falsely arrested and used excessive force, including a taser, against a non-threatening disabled person; 4) a 2008-filed case alleging officer shot a fleeing person, and when he turned with his hands raised to surrender, continued shooting; and 5) a 2008-filed case alleging unlawfully entered a residence, repeatedly struck, battered, and assaulted multiple occupants, and unlawfully arrested them.
