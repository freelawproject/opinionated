Mr. Green was sentenced to life in prison and he appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Mr. Green's co-defendant, Anthony Russ, was thereafter acquitted of murder charges involving the same victim in a separate trial. Mr. Green then filed a motion in the Superior Court for a new trial while his direct appeal was pending, arguing that evidence presented during Mr. Russ's trial constituted newly discovered evidence of a third-party perpetrator. The Superior Court denied the motion and Mr. Green timely appealed that decision. The Massachusetts Appeals Court, after consolidating the two appeals, affirmed in an unpublished decision\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Supreme Judicial Court declined further appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Green now seeks a federal writ of habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on the basis that the Superior Court's denial of his motion for a new trial deprived him of due process and the right to present a defense. Mr. Green also argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed both to raise certain evidentiary objections and to offer evidence of a third-party perpetrator.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (A) Factual Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Incident and Investigation\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 18, 2007, shots were fired from at least two different guns into a residence\n   located at 36 General Patton Drive in Hyannis. During the shooting, a .40 caliber bullet struck and fatally wounded Jacques Sellers, who was present in the house.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Carrie Perry, a woman who was in the house at the time of the incident gave testimony at trial that she saw \"two young black Americans in jean shorts with hoodies on\" running in the middle of the road immediately after the shooting; she did not, however, see either man's face. Another woman, Courtney Doyle, testified that she was sitting in her parked car across the street at the time of the incident and that she saw two African American men, one under six feet tall, and one about five feet, ten inches tall, wearing a tan sweatshirt and a black sweatshirt respectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   During the investigation, police officers recovered shell casings from several .38 caliber and .40 caliber bullets and found several bullet holes in the front and side windows and in the house's siding. The police also used a canine unit to track suspects to 23 General Patton Drive, the residence of Todd Lampley. Mr. Lampley previously had been beaten by Rodney Ferguson, who was present at 36 General Patton Drive when the shooting took place.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   While police were searching the area, they also recovered a glove and a black hooded sweatshirt, both of which were later tested for DNA. The tests did not contain enough information to identify any particular person as the source of the DNA taken from the glove and excluded Mr. Green as the source of the DNA taken from the sweatshirt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    The Petitioner's Involvement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   As the investigation into the incident continued, Mr. Green, along with Anthony Russ, Todd Lampley, and Devarus Hampton, were identified by law enforcement officers as persons of interest. The investigators eventually focused on Mr. Green and Mr. Russ as the possible shooters. Mr. Green's girlfriend at the time, Jessica Schwenk, testified that on the day of the shooting, Mr. Green accompanied her to her grandmother's house in West Dennis. At some point during the evening, Mr. Green got a phone call and told Ms. Schwenk that his friend, Mr. Russ, needed him in Hyannis. After receiving the call, Mr. Green called Jill Parsons and asked her to bring him \"something he had left in her garage.\" The \"thing\" was a gun, which Ms. Parsons brought to a CVS in Yarmouth and gave to Mr. Green. Ms. Parsons testified that Mr. Green later told her he threw the gun in the ocean.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   After Mr. Green received the gun from Ms. Parsons, Ms. Schwenk drove Mr. Green to a hotel in Yarmouth and, following his instructions, then drove alone to General Patton Drive in Hyannis. She testified that she saw Mr. Green and Mr. Russ together on General Patton Drive, and that they instructed her to wait in the car on the next street over. A short while later, Mr. Green and Mr. Russ came back to her car and she drove them to the end of the road, where they ran into the woods. When he saw her later that night and the following day, Mr. Green told Ms. Schwenk that \"he shot the house\" because \"he was helping a friend.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Green was eventually arrested and indicted by a grand jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   During his incarceration, Mr. Green wrote letters to Ms. Schwenk, who was staying with her mother, Sandra Schwenk. After Ms. Schwenk was arrested on different charges, her mother and her mother's friend, Lisa Steele, read certain of the letters sent by Mr. Green to Ms. Schwenk. Lisa Steele then contacted a law enforcement friend, Lt. Det. Robert Melia of the Massachusetts State Police, and told him that she believed the letters contained incriminating information about the July 18, 2007 shooting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Ms. Steele eventually gave Det. Melia some of the letters, and Det. Melia advised her not to tamper with any of the remaining letters since they might contain material evidence in the Commonwealth's case against Mr. Green. Shortly thereafter, Sandra Schwenk gave the remaining letters to Ms. Schwenk's attorney, who, in turn, gave them to the police. Law enforcement officials never obtained a warrant for these letters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (B) Procedural Background and the Present Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    1.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State Court Proceedings\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On January 8, 2008, a Barnstable County grand jury indicted Mr. Green for murder in the second degree, assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, discharge of a firearm within 500 feet of a dwelling, unlawful possession of a firearm, and assault with a dangerous weapon. The prosecution proceeded on a joint venture theory, reflecting the contention that Mr. Green\n   could be found guilty even if the bullet he fired was not the one that ultimately struck and killed the victim.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

R. CRIM. P. 30(b) on the basis that, among other things, testimony presented by Devarus Hampton at the trial of Anthony Russ constituted newly discovered evidence and that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective. The Superior Court denied the motion for a new trial on November 6, 2014. Mr. Green appealed that decision, which resulted in the consolidation of the direct appeal of his conviction and the appeal of the denial of a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On August 4, 2017, the Appeals Court affirmed the convictions and the denial of a new trial. It held that Mr. Hampton's testimony did not constitute newly discovered evidence that would entitle Mr. Green to a new trial and that trial counsel was not constitutionally ineffective.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

In particular, the ALOFAR argued that the testimony of Devarus Hampton should be considered newly-discovered, and that the Superior Court's denial of Mr. Green's motion for a new trial on the basis that newly-discovered evidence regarding a third-party perpetrator violated his federal and state constitutional right to present a defense. Mr. Green also argued that trial counsel was otherwise constitutionally ineffective because of various actions he failed to take during Mr. Green's original trial, specifically by not addressing whether Mr. Lampley lied about his alibi; failing to confront and object to the prosecutor's allegedly misleading statements during closing arguments, including those statements about phone calls made to Mr. Green's cell phone; and, failing to seek the suppression of letters sent by Mr. Green to Ms. Schwenk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On November 6, 2017, the SJC denied further appellate review.\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551311,12551312,12551314,12551315,12551317,12551318,12551320,12551321,12551324,12551326,12551327,12551328,12551329,12551330,12551333,12551334,12551336,12551337,12551338,12551339,12551340,12551341,12551342,12551343,12551344,12551345,12551346,12551347\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/478/1104/\">\n    478 Mass. 1104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12551310,12551311,12551312,12551313,12551314,12551315,12551316,12551317,12551318,12551319,12551320,12551321,12551322,12551323,12551324,12551325,12551326,12551327,12551328,12551329,12551330,12551331,12551332,12551333,12551334,12551335,12551336,12551337,12551338,12551339,12551340,12551341,12551342,12551343,12551344,12551345,12551346,12551347\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/94/851/\">\n    94 N.E.3d 851\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mass. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    2.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    This Federal Habeas Corpus Petition\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Mr. Green timely filed the present petition for habeas corpus under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202254\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   on November 2, 2018.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petition raises two distinct bases for relief.

In particular, he argues, the state courts improperly held that testimony presented by Devarus Hampton at the trial of Anthony Russ was not newly discovered and, in any event, would not have affected the verdict. That decision, he says, deprived him of the right under Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to present a full defense and therefore, entitles him to a new trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As a preliminary matter, the Commonwealth argues that the Appeals Court's denial of a new trial on the basis of newly discovered evidence was a matter for state law and therefore, cannot be reviewed in a petition for habeas corpus.

Instead, Mr. Green argues that the Appeals Court's application was unreasonable given the evidence of the inconsistencies between Mr. Hampton's testimony at the trial of Mr. Green and at the trial of Mr. Russ. After a close review of the record, I cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   As the Appeals Court notes in its memorandum, Mr. Green had the opportunity to \"thoroughly cross-examine[ ]\" Mr. Hampton during his trial, and to have his counsel elicit testimony regarding Mr. Hampton's relationship with Mr. Lampley. During the course of trial, the Commonwealth made Mr. Hampton available by granting him broad immunity and the trial judge inquired of Mr. Hampton to ensure he understood the nature of that immunity before allowing cross-examination to proceed. Given Mr. Hampton's uneasy relationship with the truth, as evidenced by his later conviction for perjury, it is not clear to me that Mr. Green would have been able to elicit the kind of testimony he sought from\n   Mr. Hampton, either during his original trial or in a subsequent proceeding. Nor is it clear that Mr. Hampton's testimony would have been anything more than cumulative, especially because Mr. Lampley testified during Mr. Green's trial that he was aware of the police investigation and of the fact that a canine unit tracked suspects in the shooting to his residence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   I certainly cannot say that the judgment to this effect by the Superior Court judge, who actually observed Mr. Hampton on the stand, was manifestly unreasonable such that it should now be rejected by a federal court on habeas review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Moreover, if I accept Mr. Green's contention that the testimony of Mr. Hampton in the\n   <em>\n    Russ\n   </em>\n   trial should have been treated as newly discovered evidence, I still cannot accept his argument that the Appeals Court's determination regarding prejudice was arbitrary or unreasonable. Mr. Green is correct that the Appeals Court evaluated the question of prejudice by considering whether \"a jury exposed to [the newly discovered] evidence would have reached a different conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

Thus, I look only to the ALOFAR to determine whether Mr. Green has in substance fairly presented his ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the state courts for resolution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   I find that he has. Mr. Green, in his section concerning ineffective assistance in the ALOFAR, specifically pointed to trial counsel's failure to address the prosecutor's statements during closing arguments and to expert testimony regarding DNA analysis. He contended, albeit briefly, that his trial counsel's failure to present Lampley's admission that he had lied about his alibi falls within the definitions of ineffectiveness under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the federal constitution and Article 12 of the state Declarations of Rights. He also at least referenced trial counsel's failure to seek the suppression of the letters written to Ms. Schwenk as a basis for his ineffective assistance claim, though his actual discussion of the letters seems to focus more closely on the question of suppression itself, a question which the Appeals Court expressly considered on the merits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Consequently, I find Mr. Green had at least raised the bases for his ineffective assistance claim in his ALOFAR.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Though Mr. Green's focus in both sections of his ALOFAR is on Massachusetts state law governing ineffective assistance of counsel, he cited, albeit obliquely and in passing, to the federal standard governing this area. The First Circuit has also acknowledged that Massachusetts law explicitly incorporates federal law with respect to ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\n   <em>\n    Scarpa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1852502\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/38/1/#p6\">\n    38 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   8 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sleeper\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5638757\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/510/32/\">\n    510 F.3d 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39-40 n. 2 (1st Cir. 2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Consequently, I conclude that Mr. Green fairly presented his federal claim for ineffective assistance of counsel to the state courts and therefore, that I may consider this claim on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   The Supreme Court has long recognized \"that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists, and is needed in order to protect the fundamental right to a fair trial.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 685,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984). \"The right to counsel,\" it has explained,\n   \"plays a crucial role in the adversarial system ... since access to counsel's skill and knowledge is necessary to accord defendants the ample opportunity to meet the case of the prosecution to which they are entitled.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Consequently, criminal defendants are entitled not only to\n   <em>\n    a\n   </em>\n   lawyer, but an effective one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), a prisoner seeking to show that trial counsel was ineffective must demonstrate \"deficient performance by counsel resulting in prejudice.\"\n   <em>\n    Rompilla\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p380\">\n    545 U.S. 374\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 380,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p380\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p380\">\n    162 L.Ed.2d 360\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).

The determination of whether to believe the testimony elicited from Ms. Parsons and Ms. Schwenk regarding phones calls is a question left for the jury, and trial counsel's tactical decisions during closing arguments, even if unreasonable, did not constitute a \"breakdown in the adversary process that renders [the jury's verdict] unreliable.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p685\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Mr. Green has provided no indication that trial counsel's failure to object during the Commonwealth's closing arguments constituted anything more than a reasonable, tactical decision based on his professional judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   There is no indication in the record, and certainly Mr. Green does not point me to anything, to suggest that trial counsel did not discover the records or should have objected to their introduction into evidence.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

At most, then, Mr. Green's objection to trial counsel's conduct can be characterized as a general concern that trial counsel did not speak up and more aggressively argue to the jury that Mr. Green was not responsible for the phone calls and did not have access to the phone number registered to \"Mary Nunn Evans.\" In the absence of anything more, I cannot say that trial counsel acted in error. I certainly cannot say that trial counsel's conduct was so egregious as to constitute ineffective assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Moreover, a review of the transcript satisfies me that trial counsel was quite zealous in his various arguments in support of the defendant's litigation position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (C) The DNA Evidence\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Mr. Green also argues that trial counsel failed to object to a statement made by the Commonwealth's expert that Mr. Green could not \"be included or excluded from a DNA result\" taken from a sample found on a glove recovered at the scene of the crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The Appeals Court was clear that, under Massachusetts law, the admission of evidence of DNA from one glove in this case was, as a general proposition, improper because it was irrelevant.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

I do not, however, find that the Appeals Court's further determination that Mr. Green was not prejudiced by the admission of inconclusive DNA evidence was unreasonable or contrary to federal law. Indeed, the Appeals Court specifically held that there would have been \"no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice,\" even if the DNA evidence was improperly admitted.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

Consequently, even if trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to seek to exclude expert testimony that the DNA evidence was inconclusive, this error was, as the Appeals Court determined, harmless. Mr. Green does not make the necessary showing of prejudice to succeed on this basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   This lack of prejudice would not necessarily mean that trial counsel's failure to undertake exclusion of the evidence rendered him constitutionally ineffective. Indeed, trial counsel did object to the Commonwealth's statements during closing arguments that speculated as to the source of the DNA found on the glove. The fact that the objection was unsuccessful does not render trial counsel ineffective. Nor does his failure to seek the complete exclusion of expert testimony on the subject, especially when some of that testimony was exculpatory. Consequently, I cannot say that trial counsel's conduct was objectively unreasonable \"under prevailing professional norms.\"\n   <em>\n    Rompilla\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p380\">\n    545 U.S. at 380\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8209271\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/545/374/#p380\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (D) Mr. Lampley's Alibi\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Mr. Green argues that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective because he failed to adduce evidence that Mr. Lampley lied to police about his alibi for\n   the day of the shooting.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   In particular, Mr. Green argues that his trial counsel should have tried to introduce evidence either in the form of testimony or in the form of the polygraph report that Mr. Lampley lied about his whereabouts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   However, as with his other arguments relating to ineffective assistance of counsel, Mr. Green's argument here ultimately fails. As the Appeals Court pointed out, trial counsel did, in fact, call Mr. Lampley to testify and questioned him repeatedly about his statement to police that he lied about his alibi. Trial counsel also sought to refresh Mr. Lampley's recollection with the polygraph report to elicit the kind of testimony Mr. Green believed should have been provided to the jury, though the trial judge did not allow the admission of the report itself. Trial counsel represented in open court that he intended to call the officer who conducted Mr. Lampley's polygraph exam to testify about his impression of Mr. Lampley during the polygraph exam. But, after speaking to the officer, trial counsel believing that the officer had no recollection of the event and \"was not ready to offer anything\" by way of meaningful testimony; he ultimately chose not to call the officer.\n   <em>\n    Green\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20Mass.%20App.%20Ct.%201102\">\n    92 Mass.

However, even if Mr. Green could carry his burden and show that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to call the officer to testify or otherwise to push for the admission of polygraph report evidence that Mr. Lampley lied about his alibi, he still cannot demonstrate prejudice. Under Massachusetts law, the polygraph report was inadmissible as hearsay, and indeed, the trial judge stated clearly that he would not allow the parties to adduce evidence of a polygraph report under this rule. The report also would not have fallen into the exception for past recollections recorded because \"[t]he defendant has not shown that he can satisfy the third requirement - that is, that [the officer] could testify that the statement, 'examinee admitted to lying about his alibi, was true [when made].' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203317888\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (referencing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Nolan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"310337\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass/427/541/\">\n    427 Mass. 541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=694%20N.E.2d%20350\">\n    694 N.E.2d 350\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 352 (1998) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Furthermore, even if the testimony could be admitted, the Appeals Court held, and I do not disagree, that it would have been, at most, cumulative because trial counsel had already impeached Mr. Lampley through cross-examination.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at *4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Based on my reading of the record, I cannot say that the Appeals Court's judgment was patently unreasonable and that trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective\n   for failing to introduce statements by Mr. Lampley that he had lied about his alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     (E) The Letters\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   For the sake of completeness, I also briefly address Mr. Green's argument that trial counsel should have sought to exclude letters sent by Mr. Green to Ms. Schwenk during the period of his incarceration.

Mr. Green also never raised a\n    <em>\n     Brady\n    </em>\n    claim, so there is no suggestion that the Commonwealth had control over the inconsistencies in Mr. Hampton's testimony or of any other evidence that could have swayed the jury in Mr. Green's trial.

However, because the Appeals Court dealt with the suppression issue under the Fourth Amendment, as incorporated into Massachusetts state law, and because the letters were referenced in the ALOFAR in Mr. Green's discussion of the reasons he questioned trial counsel's effectiveness, I am prepared to accept the proposition that there is enough here to say that the question was at least presented to the SJC.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    The phone records for a phone number registered to \"Mary Nunn Evans,\" along with phone records for a phone that Ms. Schwenk testified belonged to her were introduced into evidence at trial.

Ms. Zaramba testified that the results from the glove yielded inconclusive results but that the results from the black hoodie excluded the three men. During Closing Arguments, the Prosecutor referenced Ms. Zaramba's testimony, stating that the DNA test on the glove was inconclusive, but pointed to one of the letters written by Mr. Green and offered into evidence which mentioned the glove. The Prosecutor suggested Mr. Green knew about the glove because it belonged to him and suggested that Mr. Green's statements in the letters were also \"completely consistent with the test that's inconclusive for it to be Mr. Green's [DNA] on the glove[.]\" Following closing arguments, Mr. Green's trial counsel objected to these statements as assuming facts not in evidence, but the objection was overruled.

Moreover, there was testimony that Mr. Lampley was near the scene of the shooting immediately after it took place. There is also some suggestion, though it was not put before the jury, that Mr. Lampley was not being entirely honest on the stand about his recollection of his interaction with police and the statements he made to law enforcement regarding his alibi.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
