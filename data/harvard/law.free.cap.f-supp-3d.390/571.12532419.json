C.A. No. 18-193 at D.I. 1; C.A. No. 18-194 at D.I. 1. WhitServe alleges that Defendants infringe U.S. Patent Nos. 5,895,468 (\"the #468 patent\") and 6,182,078 (\"the #078 patent\") which are titled, respectively, \"System Automating Delivery of Professional Services\" and \"System for Delivering Professional Services Over the Internet.\" The Court has jurisdiction pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and 1338(a). Defendants have moved to dismiss the complaints pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) on the grounds that the patents recite patent ineligible subject matter under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The only meaningful difference between claim 1 of the #468 patent and claim 1 of #078 patent is that claim 1 of the #078 patent does not include the last limitation of claim 1 of the #468 patent regarding \"automatically receiving a reply to the response form from the client.\" D.I. 1-2 at 8:4-22. Claim 24 of the #468 patent and claim 9 of the #078 patent are, in all meaningful respects, the same as claim 1 of the #468 patent, except directed towards a \"method\" instead of a \"device.\" D.I. 1-1 at 10:8-24; D.I. 1-2 at 9:13-10:9. Finally, dependent claim 3 in the #078 patent narrows the device of claim 1 by limiting the form of the device to a webpage. D.I. 1-2 at 8:24. Similarly, claim 11 of #078 patent narrows the method in claim 9 by requiring that the step for generating a client response form comprises \"generating of a webpage.\" D.I. 1-2 at 10:12-13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

In\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   , the Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part a district court's grant of summary judgment on patent ineligibility grounds.\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer v.

At step two, however, the Federal Circuit disagreed with the district court's conclusion that the claims recited only \"well-understood, routine, and conventional\" computer functions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1362\">\n    at 1368\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Thus, the written description in conjunction with certain claims raised a factual dispute regarding the presence of an inventive concept, which made summary judgement inappropriate at that time.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1362\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275489\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/881/1360/#p1362\">\n    at 1369-70\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In sum, under\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   , improvements in technology described in the written description and captured in the claims may create fact questions which\n   preclude finding a patent ineligible as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   , the district court granted a motion to dismiss on \u00a7 101 grounds and denied leave to amend.\n   <em>\n    Aatrix Software, Inc. v.

For example, the second amended complaint alleged that \"the claimed software uses less memory, results in faster processing speed, and reduces the risk of thrashing which makes the computer process forms more efficiently.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Similarly, allegations about the data file claimed \"an improvement in importing data from third-party software.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Because these allegations, taken as true, \"suggest[ed] that the claimed invention [was] directed to an improvement in the computer technology itself,\" the district court erred in finding, on a motion to dismiss, that the claimed invention was conventional and routine.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515907\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1121/#p1125\">\n    at 1127-28\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here,\n   <em>\n    Berkheimer\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Aatrix\n   </em>\n   are inapplicable because neither the patent nor the complaint alleges any improvement in technology. Rather, the patent describes improving the speed and efficiency with which humans deliver professional services by automating that practice through use of generic computer components performing routine functions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Prior Court and USPTO Decisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In opposing Defendants' motion, WhitServe suggests that this Court should decline to consider the patent eligibility of the asserted claims under \u00a7 101, because the issue has already been addressed by the USPTO and two other courts. D.I. 18 at 3-5. There are several problems, however, with WhitServe's assertion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   First, all of the USPTO proceedings WhitServe cites occurred before the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, were not based on the correct legal standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 3; D.I. 1-1; D.I. 1-2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Second, the Federal Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    WhitServe LLC v. Computer Packages, Inc.\n   </em>\n   was likewise issued before\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523131\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/10/#p39\">\n    694 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (Fed. Cir. 2012). More important, the only discussion of \u00a7 101 in that case is dicta that appears in the dissent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523131\" index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/10/#p39\">\n    694 F.3d 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 39 (Fed. Cir. 2012). Even if I were to consider the dicta, it sets forth a position unfavorable to WhitServe. Specifically, the dissent argued that there could be no infringement of the #468 and #078 patents (as the majority affirmed) because the patents are \"barred at the threshold by\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n    35 U.S.C. \u00a7 101\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20101\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal punctuation omitted) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Diamond v.

Specifically, the patents \"are directed to the abstract idea that it is useful to provide people with reminders of approaching due dates and deadlines.\"\n   <em>\n    WhitServe\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523131\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/10/#p39\">\n    694 F.3d at 39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Third, the district court in\n   <em>\n    WhitServe v. GoDaddy.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , No. 3:11-cv-948-JCH (D. Conn.) never substantively addressed the \u00a7 101 issue. Pre-\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the court denied GoDaddy's motion for summary judgment without an opinion and without providing any comment on the \u00a7 101 issue. C.A. No. 3:11-948 at D.I. 304. Post-\n   <em>\n    Alice\n   </em>\n   , the court denied leave to file a renewed motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523131\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/10/#p39\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at D.I. 337. Then, the case settled before the court determined patent eligibility at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3523131\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/694/10/#p39\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at D.I. 433. Because the patent eligibility of the #468 and #078 patents has not yet been decided under the current legal standard for \u00a7 101 by either the USPTO or other courts, there is no prior decision-binding\n   or otherwise-that I must take into consideration before rendering my decision. For these reasons, I find that this argument by WhitServe has no merit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, Defendants' motions to dismiss (C.A. No. 18-193 at D.I. 12; C.A. No. 18-194 at D.I. 10) are granted. An appropriate order will be entered.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-63\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, the citations herein are to WhitServe's complaint in C.A.

D.I. 18 at 3. But the Federal Circuit has previously determined, in a decision WhitServe favorably cites here, that \"Claim 1 of the #468 Patent is representative of the claims in the #468 Patent Family.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Whitserve, LLC v.
