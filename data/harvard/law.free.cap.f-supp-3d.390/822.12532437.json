Rosenthal, Chief United States District Judge\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   A public school officer in the Katy Independent School District's police department tased and handcuffed J.W., a 17-year-old special-education student. His mother, Lori Washington, sued the Katy Independent School District and School Resource Officer Elvin Paley for violating of J.W.'s federally protected rights. (Docket Entry Nos. 1, 12). After discovery, the Katy School District and Officer Paley moved for summary judgment, Ms. Washington responded, and the Katy School District and Officer Paley replied. (Docket Entry Nos. 28, 29, 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Based on the motion, response, and reply; the summary judgment record; the parties' arguments at the motion hearing; and the applicable law, the court grants the defendants' summary judgment motion for all claims except the \u00a7 1983 claim against Officer Paley. (Docket Entry No. 28). That claim remains.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The reasons for these rulings are detailed below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In November 2016, J.W. was enrolled at the Mayde Creek High School in the Katy\n   Independent School District. He was diagnosed as emotionally disturbed and intellectually disabled in ways that impacted \"his daily functioning, including his ability to communicate, control his emotions, and access regular educational services without accommodations.\" (Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 31-32). According to the police incident report, J.W. was around 6'2? and weighed 250 pounds. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-4 at 3, 11).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On November 30, 2016, J.W. was in a classroom playing a card game with another student. They started bickering, which developed into what J.W. described as \"being bullied and harassed.\" (Docket Entry No. 29-2 at \u00b6 6;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-6 at 2; Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6 34). According to an unsworn statement by Ashley Lucas, a school staff member, J.W. cursed and yelled, then punched the other student in the chest and knocked him out of his chair. (Docket Entry No. 28-6 at 2). J.W. left the classroom and went down the hallway, continuing to yell and curse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). J.W.'s teacher emailed Assistant Principal Denise Majewski, who was responsible for the school's special-education students, to alert her of the situation. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 2, 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.W. took himself to a \"chill out\" classroom that he used when he was upset. He found a student already there. (Docket Entry No. 29-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 8-9). Coach Larry Hamilton was standing outside that classroom talking with a student and saw J.W. throw a desk across the room, shouting that he \"hated\" the school. (Docket Entry No. 28-7). Hamilton saw J.W. kick the door, leave the occupied \"chill\" classroom, and continue down the hallway toward a door leading out of the school building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). School officials blocked him from leaving the building, and events escalated from there. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 2-3; Docket Entry No. 28-9 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   J.W.'s description of this first stage of the events is different. (Docket Entry No. 29-2). He did not mention in his declaration throwing a desk or cursing. He stated that after leaving the \"chill-out\" classroom, he walked \"towards a door leading to a breeze way between buildings on the campus,\" where he was stopped by a staff member who \"loosely block[ed] the doors.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 9-11). A female Katy Independent School District police officer arrived soon after. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 11). J.W. stated that he told the staff member blocking the doors that keeping him inside was just making him more upset. He asked to leave so that he could \"cool down.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 13, 14). Minutes later, he \"calmly walk[ed] toward the door nearest [him] and attempt[ed] to go outside,\" not touching anyone. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Assistant Principal Majewski learned of the situation when J.W. left the \"chill out room\" and was in the hallway. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 2). Officer Elvin Paley, a school resource officer, stated in his declaration that Assistant Principal Majewski radioed for assistance to come help keep J.W. inside the school building. (Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 3). When Assistant Principal Majewski arrived at the scene, a school security guard, John Oglesby, and Coach Hamilton were trying to talk J.W. out of leaving the building. Security guard Oglesby was blocking the door. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-9 at 2). Assistant Principal Majewski stated in her declaration that J.W. was \"direct[ing] profanity toward the staff,\" and that she was concerned about J.W. leaving because the staff \"would lose all control over him, and he might get injured.\" (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Officer Paley's body camera recorded J.W.'s interactions with the officers and school staff after that point. The recording shows J.W. pacing in front of the door\n   leading outside the school building and complaining to the school staff member blocking the door that he wants to leave so he could walk home and calm down. He is not yelling at the staff members, but the video recording shows him looking agitated and occasionally raising his voice. The recording then shows J.W. starting to push the door open. (Docket Entry No. 28-10 at 12:45:54). The staff member pushes back on the door to keep J.W. inside, but it does not appear that J.W. pushes the staff member, as the Katy School District contends. Within about five seconds of J.W. pushing on the door, Officer Paley moves toward J.W. and the staff member. Officer Paley's body camera then becomes dark as he pushes up against J.W.'s body. Both Officer Paley and the staff member tell J.W. to \"calm down\" several times. A male voice threatens J.W. with tasing. About 20 seconds later, the male voice says, \"You are not going to get through this door, just relax.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:05, 12:46:26). J.W. then begins screaming.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The video becomes clear again as Officer Paley moves away from J.W. The recording shows two individuals holding J.W. Approximately 10 seconds after Officer Paley tells J.W. to relax, Officer Paley tells the individuals holding J.W. to \"let him go,\" and fires the taser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:37). J.W. immediately screams and falls to his knees. About 5 seconds later, the video recording shows Officer Paley beginning to \"drive stun\" J.W. near his bottom right torso, and then on J.W.'s upper back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:41).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"Drive stun\" means to hold the taser against the body without deploying the prongs. J.W., still on his knees, then falls to the ground completely. The taser is used on J.W. for approximately 15 seconds. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:56). This use of the taser on J.W.'s upper back continues after J.W. is lying face down on the ground and not struggling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   After Officer Paley stops tasing J.W., Officer Angela Molina, another school resource officer, places handcuffs on J.W.'s wrists, behind his back. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:47:11). Less than a minute later, while J.W. lies panting on the ground, Officer Paley points the taser at J.W.'s head, yelling, \"I did not want to tase you, but you do not run shit around here, you understand?\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:47:50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   According to Officer Paley, he used the taser the second time to drive stun J.W. because the first time did not have enough effect. This second use of the taser brought J.W. to a prone position on the floor with his hands under his chest. (Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   J.W. stated that he began to scream and cry as Officer Paley tased him, and that Officer Paley kept tasing him \"approximately six to eight times\" even after he was on the ground. (Docket Entry No. 29-2 at \u00b6\u00b6 24, 26). According to J.W., when paramedics arrived, they had to remove a taser prong \"embedded ... near [his] right rib cage.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 47).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   J.W. thought he was under arrest. He urinated and defecated on himself after being tased. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 29, 34). J.W. stated that as he was being handcuffed, he began having difficulty breathing and, even after being moved to his side, he felt like he was going to die. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 36, 37). It was only when he was allowed to sit upright that he was able to \"take a big gulp of air.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 38).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Officer Paley stated that he called dispatch and asked for emergency medical services. (Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 9). Officer Paley also told security guard Oglesby to get the school nurse. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 8; Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3, \u00b6 5). Officer Paley's body camera video recording shows school nurse Shirley Willett treating J.W. The recording also shows the school officers and staff responding to J.W.'s reports of difficulty breathing. (Docket Entry No. 28-10;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 9; Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   EMS arrived around 1:00 p.m., about 15 minutes after the tasing. (Docket Entry No. 28-4 at 4, 14, 23; Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 10; Docket Entry No. 28-8 at \u00b6 5). J.W. was taken back to the school's security office around 1:30 p.m. (Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 10; Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3). According to Vice-Principal Majewski, she tried to contact Ms. Washington shortly after that. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3). J.W. stated that the school did not contact his mother until \"the female paramedic inform[ed] the school officials that they should have contacted [his] mother immediately.\" (Docket Entry No. 29-2 at \u00b6 46;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 43, 49). Vice-Principal Majewski stated that when she called Ms. Washington's phone, it would not accept new messages, J.W.'s emergency-contact number did not work, and emails to Ms. Washington went unanswered. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3). At 2:00 p.m., Ms. Washington called Vice-Principal Majewski and said that she was on her way to the school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Before Ms. Washington arrived, Vice-Principal Majewski received a call from the Westlake Emergency Medical Services explaining that another ambulance was going to the school, at Ms. Washington's request. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3). Ms. Washington had contacted EMS because Vice-Principal Majewski had not informed her that another ambulance had already been to the school and EMS had assessed J.W. (Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 86-87; Docket Entry No. 29-1 at \u00b6\u00b6 24-25). The second ambulance left the campus to take J.W. to the hospital at 3:05 p.m. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3). Neither party describes the treatment J.W. received at the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Ms. Washington alleges that J.W. was not a danger to himself or others when he was tased. She alleges that local school board policies allowed for detention only in limited circumstances and required no more than a disciplinary-infraction citation-not physical detention-for students who leave campus without permission. (Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 4, 30). She alleges that the Katy School District staff who worked with J.W. were aware that he was being bullied, and that they understood that \"walking it off\" was the best way for J.W. to cope with stressful situations. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35-37).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   J.W. missed school for several months after the tasing. Ms. Washington explained that she kept J.W. home \"due to fear for his safety while at school,\" and that J.W.'s \"private medical providers supported [that] decision.\" (Docket Entry No. 29-1 at \u00b6 34). She stated that \"J.W. suffer[ed] from intense anxiety and PTSD\" because of the tasing, \"has lost his trust for police officers,\" and was \"traumatized by the experience,\" asserting that the video recording showed that \"the taser touched J.W. seven times.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 35, 43, 45). She stated that school and Katy School District staff would not talk to her about the incident, but she was able to watch a video recording provided by the superintendent's office. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 35).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Ms. Washington and Vice-Principal Majewski agree that the staff and Ms. Washington were unable to schedule a meeting until April 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 36;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3-4). Ms. Washington stated that the staff abruptly cancelled that meeting when she arrived with an attorney. (Docket Entry No. 29-1 at \u00b6 37). According to Vice-Principal Majewski, she and other staff then tried to contact Ms. Washington, but Ms. Washington did not reliably or promptly respond. (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3-4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Vice-Principal Majewski stated that the scheduled April 2017 meeting was an Admission, Review, and Dismissal meeting, convened primarily to discuss J.W.'s absences, not to discuss the tasing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4). She explained that the school rescheduled the April meeting after deciding that the school's attorney should attend if Ms. Washington was going to have counsel present. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The rescheduled meeting occurred on May 22, 2017, approximately six months after the tasing. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). The amended complaint alleged that the school staff \"never scheduled the promised meeting to discuss the incident and continued to refuse Ms. Washington's requests to do so.\" (Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6 101).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Ms. Washington sues Officer Paley under \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1988 for discriminating against J.W. in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment; for violating J.W.'s substantive and procedural due process rights to dignity, privacy, and bodily integrity; for using excessive force against J.W.; and for depriving J.W. of his right to an education under Article I of the Texas Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. (Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6\u00b6 124-52). Ms. Washington alleges that the Katy School District is liable for unconstitutional policies, procedures, practices, and customs, including failing to train and supervise staff, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment; violating \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and failing to provide reasonable accommodations under Title II of the ADA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 119-23, 153-72). Ms. Washington also alleges that the Katy School District is liable for Officer Paley's and other Katy School District employees' actions under a ratification theory. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 173-76).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Each claim is analyzed below in light of the record and the applicable law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20 (citing Docket Entry No. 12 at \u00b6 3) ). The defendants primarily rely on Officer Paley's police report, which describes J.W.'s behavior and cursing, the staff's failed attempts to get J.W. to go back to his classroom, and J.W.'s failure to comply with verbal commands and physical attempts to keep him from leaving the school building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-21 (citing Docket Entry No. 28-4) ). The defendants also point to J.W.'s physical size to support Officer Paley's decision to use the taser. J.W. was bigger and heavier than Officers Paley and Molina. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21). Officer Paley's statement in the police report states that he had concluded that the school staff's attempts to subdue J.W. with \"soft and hard hand techniques were not effective\" before he decided to use the taser. (Docket Entry No. 28-4 at 4). The defendants contend that the video recording from Officer Paley's body camera supports his statements that before he used the taser and after J.W. \"pushed\" security guard Oglesby and resisted attempts to calm him down, Officer Paley went to the next step on the \"use of force continuum.\" (Docket Entry No. 28 at 20-22; Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Ms. Washington responds that the right to be free of excessive force was clearly established, including the right to be free of excessive force from an officer's use of a taser.

According to Ms. Washington, Officer Paley's actions were not objectively reasonable because J.W. did not commit a crime, there was no immediate safety risk to the officers, J.W. was not \"evading arrest because he was never under arrest,\" and J.W. \"was not disobeying any police orders or being non-compliant with police orders\" because he did not receive orders before the tasing.

Ohio Dec. 29, 2006) (an officer's use of force was reasonable when tasing a student who was creating a disturbance, did not comply with the officer's repeated orders, kicked and bit the officer, and was warned that she would be tased if she persisted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Ms. Washington looks outside the case law to argue that Officer Paley's use of force was objectively unreasonable because he did not follow school policies and procedures. (Docket Entry No. 29 at 27). She argues that the policies require school-security staff, including school resource officers like Officer Paley, to \"make a good-faith effort to divert a person suffering from a mental health crisis for treatment when that person is in the midst of a crisis.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16 (citing 29-5 at 8) ). She argues that Katy Independent School District School Board policies allow force \"when a student is out of control, but only 'to further educational purposes' or 'to maintain discipline in a group.' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She also asserts that the Texas Education Code forbids a \"discipline management practice [that is] calculated to inflict injury, cause harm, or demean the student.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing TEX. EDUC. CODE \u00a7 37.002(b)(1) ; 19 T.A.C. \u00a7 89.1053 ) ). Ms. Washington argues that the Katy Independent School District and Officer Paley violated these policies and procedures when J.W. was tased and restrained. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17). This argument does not address qualified immunity in a \u00a7 1983 action. The critical question is whether Officer Paley violated J.W.'s federally protected rights, not whether he followed school policies or state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   The record shows that J.W. refused to follow school staff members' and officers' instructions, was agitated and insistent on leaving, and that Officer Paley gave warnings before using the taser, but it is disputed that he pushed a staff member, so as to justify the taser use. And Officer Paley did not stop using the taser when J.W. stopped resisting. The record evidence of Officer Paley's interactions with J.W. shows genuine factual disputes material to deciding whether the tasing itself, its length, and its intensity, were objectively reasonable. These disputes preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   Officer Paley asserts that he decided to intervene only after he \"saw J.W. make physical contact with Guard Oglesby and Guard Oglesby start[ed] to fall backward.\" (Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 6). Officer Paley asserts that he first tried \"soft or hard hand techniques\" on J.W., while also telling J.W. to calm down, but those efforts did not work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Officer Paley states that he then \"told [J.W.] that [he] didn't want to tase him and that he needed to calm down...but J.W. just replied 'Do it, fucking it!' \" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Officer Paley, it was then that he decided to use the taser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6 7). When the first tasing did not work, he \"drive stunned\" J.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). Officer Paley does not mention two drive-stun applications. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2006%20WL%203833519\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ). Officer Paley's statement in the police report does not state whether he gave J.W. a warning, but it is consistent in recounting that he used the taser at least twice. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-4 at 4). The taser-download report shows one deployment,\n   but it lasted a total of 19 seconds. (Docket Entry No. 31-3 at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   Officer Molina's statement in the police report is consistent with Officer Paley's version of events. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 12). She notes that J.W. was told that he could not leave the school and became \"non-responsive to any of [the school officers' and officials'] communication with him.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She states that J.W. \"started pushing his way through Security Guard Oglesby.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). According to Officer Molina and Officer Paley \"instructed [J.W.] to calm down several times\" as he, security guard Oglesby, and Officer Molina all held J.W. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She states that \"Officer Paley told [J.W.] that he did not want to have to taser him and that he needed to calm down,\" to which J.W. \"replied 'do it, fucking do it' and pushed with extreme force through the doorway.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ). She states that Officer Paley used the taser twice, stopping after J.W. was lying on the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Vice-Principal Majewski's and security guard Oglesby's statements to the Katy Independent School District Police Department also state that Officer Paley gave J.W. a warning. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14, 16). Vice-Principal Majewski reiterates in her declaration that Officer Paley tased J.W. only after he \"tried to push his body against Officer Oglesby at the exit of the building,\" and that Officer Paley \"told J.W. several times that he would tase [J.W.] if [J.W.] continued.\" (Docket Entry No. 28-8 at 3, \u00b6 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   J.W.'s declaration tells a different story. He states that as he tried to leave the school building because he was feeling anxious and knew that only \"walking it off\" would calm him, \"the male official closest to [him] initiated physical contact ... and for no apparent reason attempted to block [him] from exiting the building.\" (Docket Entry No. 29-2 at \u00b6 17). J.W. asserts that \"Officer Paley then briskly walked towards [him] and \"start[ed] to tase [him] and had [him] against a pole in a chokehold.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 18-19). J.W. states that after the first taser use, while he was in pain and had turned his back away from the officers, Officer Paley used the taser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 21-22). According to J.W., Officer Paley continued to tase him even after he was on the ground, hitting him \"with his taser gun six to eight times,\" until a staff member told Officer Paley to stop. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at \u00b6\u00b6 23, 26).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The body-camera recording underscores factual disputes that are material to determining whether Officer Paley's tasing was reasonable. While the recording shows J.W. disagreeing with school staff about leaving, it is unclear that he pushed against a staff member or a security guard when trying to go through the door. (Docket Entry No. 28-10 at 12:45:54). In less than one minute after J.W. tried to exit, he begins screaming, is tased, falls to his knees, and has the taser held against him until he falls to the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:37). While Officer Paley stated that the first tasing had no effect on J.W., the video recording shows J.W. falling to his knees when Officer Paley \"drive stuns\" J.W. The drive stunning either continues or is repeated until J.W. lies completely flat. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:46:56-47:11). Officer Paley then aims the taser at J.W.'s head and threatens him for several seconds after J.W. is no longer moving and is flat on the ground. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:47:50).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   The questions on which the evidence conflicts include whether it was objectively reasonable to believe that the force used was needed to keep J.W. in the building, and, perhaps more critically, whether Officer Paley's continued use of the taser, including the \"drive stun\" technique, after J.W. fell to his knees was reasonable. These and related disputes preclude summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   <strong>\n    ii. The Decision to Place J.W. in Handcuffs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   The defendants argue that this court should follow cases concluding that similar procedures \"to immobilize and eventually handcuff suspects is both reasonable and not an excessive use of force.\" (Docket Entry No. 28 at 21 (citing\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez v.

Ms. Washington did not respond to this argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   As discussed above, courts have found that an officer's decision to handcuff a student is objectively reasonable if the student is a danger to the officers or others, including himself or herself, or if the student is actively resisting the officer's verbal and physical commands. The officer must stop applying force when the student has stopped resisting. The defendants cite witness declarations and the police report as evidence that attempts to calm J.W. had failed and school staff could not convince J.W. to stay inside the building. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-4). The summary judgment evidence also shows, and Ms. Washington has not pointed to conflicting evidence, that Officer Paley and school officials contacted medical help when J.W. said that he had difficulty breathing, and the officers positioned J.W. to prevent breathing problems. (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Docket Entry No. 28-1 at \u00b6 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Because Ms. Washington has not offered or identified summary judgment evidence to dispute the defendants' arguments and evidence, there is no genuine factual dispute material to concluding that Officer Paley's decision to handcuff J.W. and keep him on the floor did not violate J.W.'s Fourth Amendment rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

The force used against J.W. can be characterized as discipline because the summary judgment evidence supports that it was rationally related to the school's legitimate interest in maintaining order and keeping J.W. safe. Summary judgment evidence shows that J.W. was yelling and cursing at school staff members, had thrown a classroom desk, punched and pushed another student, was attempting to leave the building by himself during school hours, and refused school officials' efforts and orders to stay inside. Under\n   <em>\n    Fee\n   </em>\n   , Ms. Washington cannot maintain her due-process claims based on Officer Paley's use of force.

(Docket Entry Nos. 12, 29). Ms. Washington has not offered or identified summary judgment evidence showing that a nondisabled student would have been allowed to leave campus, and the defendants point to the Mayde High School Student Handbook, which forbids students from leaving school without permission during the school day.
