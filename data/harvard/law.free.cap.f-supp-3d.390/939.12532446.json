Collectively, these authorities militate in favor of strict adherence to the plain language of Section 502(a)(10), which on its face authorizes suits only by an employer that\n   <em>\n    has\n   </em>\n   contribution obligations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dominick's urges against reading too much into Section 502(a)(10)'s present-tense formulation, noting that Section 515 likewise uses the present tense to describe an employer's contribution obligations, even though all agree that a plan fiduciary may sue to collect delinquent contributions against a withdrawn employer with no ongoing obligations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Every employer who\n   <em>\n    is obligated\n   </em>\n   to make contributions to a multiemployer plan under the terms of the plan or under the terms of a collectively bargained agreement shall...make such contributions in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plan or such agreement\") (emphasis added). But the parallel Dominick's draws is inapt. As the Fund notes, Section 515 does not authorize or define the scope of a civil action. Instead, it defines the contribution obligations of an employer, which a fiduciary may enforce in a civil action under Section 502(g)(2). It simply does not follow from the observation that a present fiduciary may sue a withdrawn employer to enforce contribution obligations the employer incurred prior to its withdrawal that a withdrawn employer with\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   present contribution obligations is authorized to file suit under Section 502(a)(10), which by its plain terms empowers only \"an employer that has an obligation to contribute\" to bring a civil action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nor am I persuaded by Dominick's argument that a narrow reading of 502(a)(10) would \"perversely incentivize\" plan sponsors to expel contributing employers for the purpose of avoiding liability for violating a rehabilitation plan. Dkt. 24 at 6. First, expelling a contributing employer against the plan's interest would be independently actionable as a breach of fiduciary duty under Section 502(a)(2). Second, none of Dominick's cited authorities suggests that Congress passed Section 502(a)(10) as a means of deterring plan sponsors from violating any duties the plan owes to contributing employers, much less does any authority support construing Section 502(a)(10) more expansively than its plain language provides in order to achieve that purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In short, whatever the merits of Dominick's claims against the Fund, Section 502(a)(10) is not the vehicle for asserting them. As a withdrawn employer with no ongoing obligation to contribute to the Fund, Dominick's is outside the scope of parties authorized to bring suit under that section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At all events, however, the Rehabilitation Plan does not establish the substantive obligations Dominick's seeks to enforce with respect to the Voluntary Payments. Indeed, the only portion of the Rehabilitation Plan to mention the Voluntary Payments states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   If an employer chooses, they [sic] can pay a reduced Supplemental Contribution Rate increase over a collective bargaining period provided they [sic] make a single voluntary payment such that the amount of the single voluntary payment, when combined with the reduced Supplemental Contribution Rate increases, is equivalent to the amount expected to be paid under the required Supplemental Contribution Rate increase as outlined in this section over the term of the CBA, with such amount to be determined by the Trustees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Dkt. No. 1-5 at A-2. Dominick's acknowledges that the Rehabilitation Plan \"does not, on its face, address what happens to the\" Voluntary Payments in the event of Dominick's withdrawal.

At all\n   events, Dominick's evidently is not wholly without a remedy, as it points out that \"the parties have been actively disputing this and related matters since 2014,\" when Dominick's \"commenced arbitration to challenge the Fund's withdrawal liability assessment.\" Dkt. No. 24 at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Although ERISA preemption mandates dismissal of Dominick's state law claims, I note that Dominick's breach of contract claim fails for the independent reason that it is not supported by the complaint's allegations or attached materials. The most salient flaw in the contracts claim is that Dominick's has not identified any contract containing either the rights it asserts or the obligations it seeks to enforce. As noted above, Dominick's alleges that the Fund\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   agreed to accept Voluntary Payments from Dominick's pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Collective Bargaining Agreements, and as reflected in the Resolutions and Rehabilitation Plan.\n   <em>\n    Pursuant to that agreement\n   </em>\n   , the Fund is obligated to offset future payments required to be made to the Fund by Dominick's, or otherwise reimburse Dominick's.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Cmplt. at \u00b6 28 (emphasis added). Dominick's theory, it appears, is that the CBAs, the Resolutions, and the Rehabilitation Plan collectively embody the parties' \"agreement\" that the Fund would credit or refund any portion of the Voluntary Payments that exceeded its contribution obligations. Yet, neither the Resolutions nor the Rehabilitation Plan contains the hallmarks of an \"agreement\" between the parties, and neither can reasonably be read as imposing on the Fund the obligations Dominick's seeks to enforce. Meanwhile, despite attaching, quoting from, and referencing the CBAs extensively in its complaint, in its response brief Dominick's disavows any reliance on the CBAs to support its claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Dkt. 24 at 12 (\"Dominick's is not alleging a violation of the CBAs)\" and n. 12 (\"[t]he references to the [Voluntary Payments] in the CBAs are superfluous and put the parties in no different position than they would be in if the CBAs contained no such references.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Fund's motion to dismiss is granted.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    Dominick's states in its opposition that the CBAs' provisions relating to the Voluntary Payments \"are superfluous and put the parties in no different position than they would be in if the CBAs contained no such references.\" Dkt. 24 at 12, n. 12.
