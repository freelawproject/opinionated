FURMAN, United States District Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   In this multidistrict litigation, familiarity with which is presumed, investors allege\n   that seven stock exchanges (the \"Exchanges\") are violating the federal securities laws by providing services to high-frequency trading (\"HFT\") firms in a way that amounts to actionable \"market manipulation.\" In particular, the investors argue that by providing (or selling) HFT firms services that allow those firms to execute allegedly harmful trading strategies more successfully (thus harming the investors), the Exchanges have engaged in conduct that adds up to an unlawful manipulative scheme under Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") Rule 10b-5 and are therefore liable under Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 2015, this Court dismissed each of the consolidated cases in its entirety. (Of particular relevance here, the Court found that the Exchanges' alleged conduct did not rise to the level of unlawfully \"manipulative\" acts and that the Exchanges were protected from these lawsuits by a quasi-governmental immunity.) After some (but not all) of the plaintiffs appealed the dismissal of some (but not all) of their claims, the Court of Appeals ruled in favor of those plaintiffs and remanded to this Court for further consideration. The remaining defendants - the Exchanges - now move to dismiss what remains of the cases, renewing several of their original arguments. Given the Court of Appeals' ruling, and the standards applicable at this stage of the litigation, the Court concludes that Plaintiffs allege sufficient facts to survive the Exchanges' renewed motion to dismiss. Accordingly, the Court denies Defendants' motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the allegations in the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint (\"SAC\" or the \"Complaint\") - which the Court must accept as true for purposes of this Rule 12(b)(6) motion - and the \"other sources courts ordinarily examine when ruling on Rule 12(b)(6) motions to dismiss,\" including documents attached to the Complaint, statements or documents incorporated into the Complaint by reference, and matters of which judicial notice may be taken.\n   <em>\n    Tellabs, Inc. v.

Supp. 3d 342\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 348-53 (S.D.N.Y. 2015). Of particular relevance to the claims that remain are three services that the Exchanges sell to HFT firms:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   proprietary data feeds, \"co-location\" services, and \"complex order types.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The proprietary data feeds at issue here are certain \"enhanced\" or \"direct\" data feeds that the Exchanges offer as a subscription service to certain customers.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Docket No. 252 in 14-CV-2811 (\"SAC\"), \u00b6\u00b6 118-31. In general, they provide better or faster (or better\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   faster) data to customers who are willing to pay extra for it. All investors seeking to trade on the Exchanges have access (as they must) to a \"consolidated\" data feed that includes (1) the price at which the latest sale of each stock traded on the Exchanges occurred, the size of that sale, and the exchange on which it took place; (2) the current highest bid and lowest offer for each stock traded on the Exchanges, along with the number of shares available at those prices; and (3) the highest bid and lowest offer currently available across all the Exchanges and the exchange or exchanges on which those prices are available.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Barclays LX\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822989\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/126/342/#p348\">\n    126 F. Supp. 3d at 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Customers who pay for enhanced and direct data feeds receive more information, more quickly: Some such data feeds, for example, offer access to a greater \"depth[ ] of order book information,\" meaning that instead of the single best bid and offer for a given stock on a given exchange, an exchange may provide information about\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   bid and offer for a given stock through an enhanced data feed. SAC \u00b6 126. Further, because the Exchanges transmit these enhanced data feeds directly to subscribers, those subscribers typically receive the data (including the \"core\" data included in the consolidated feed)\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   the consolidated feed - which must first assemble information out of the raw data received from each contributing exchange - reaches other investors. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 118, 124.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Next, \"co-location\" services involve the Exchanges' practice of selling HFT firms the right to place their servers in close physical proximity to the Exchanges' own servers. By shortening the physical distance that trading signals have to travel, HFT firms are able to send trading signals to the Exchanges at faster speeds. SAC \u00b6\u00b6 108-09.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Finally, the Exchanges offer customers certain complex \"order types,\" which are \"preprogrammed commands\" that instruct an exchange how to handle a customer's buy and sell orders. More familiar, and standard, order types might instruct an exchange simply to execute a trade at the current market price (a \"market order\"), or to buy at or below - or sell at or above - a particular price (a \"limit order\"). Complex order types, by contrast, can involve more involved and customized steps. For example, a \"hide-and-light\" order, once placed, remains hidden from all observers on a given exchange - until, that is, the stock that is the subject of the order reaches a particular price, at which point the \"hide-and-light\" order \"lights,\" appearing at the front of the order queue just in time to execute a trade at that price before other limit orders that may have lost their place in line as the price moved away from them.

Plaintiffs allege that, as a result, they were induced to trade based on artificial price signals, only to see their trades execute at worse prices than advertised, and that the Exchanges' role in that overall\n   scheme makes them liable to Plaintiffs under Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5.\n   <em>\n    In re Barclays LX\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6822989\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/126/342/#p348\">\n    126 F.
