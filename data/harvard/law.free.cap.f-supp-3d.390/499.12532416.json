DOJ's FARA Unit, located within the Counterintelligence and Export Control Section of the National Security Division (\"NSD\"), is responsible for administrative enforcement of FARA. (Public Findlay Decl. \u00b6 17.) The FARA Unit also partners with local United States Attorney's Offices and other DOJ components to enforce FARA through civil enforcement proceedings or criminal proceedings for willful violations.

Manafort, Jr. (\"Manafort\"), Richard W. Gates III (\"Gates\") and Michael Flynn (\"Flynn\"). (Pl. Mem. at 1-5.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Between approximately 2005 and 2015, Manafort and Gates engaged in lobbying activities in the United States on behalf of the Ukrainian government, and various Ukrainian politicians and political parties, including the Ukrainian Party of Regions, through Manafort's consulting companies Davis Manafort Partners, Inc. (\"DMP\") and later DMP International, LLC (\"DMI\")). (Pls.' 56.1 Statement, ECF No. 52, \u00b6\u00b6 1-5.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Manafort and Gates used the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine, in part, to carry out their activities. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 5.) In March 2016, the Trump campaign hired Manafort as an adviser. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 9.) Manafort resigned from the campaign in August 2016 and, in June 2018, Manafort retroactively registered DMI under FARA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-14.) In 2018, Manafort pleaded guilty to, among other things, conspiracy to violate FARA by failing to register and by providing false statements in a document filed with FARA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recent FARA Cases, https://www.justice.gov/nsd-fara/recent-cases (last visited July 19, 2019) (\"Recent FARA Cases\"). Gates also pleaded guilty to, among other things, conspiracy to violate FARA by failing to register and by providing false statements in a document filed with FARA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, Michael Flynn and two associates founded the Flynn Intel Group. (Pls.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6 15.) The Flynn Intel Group was hired by Inovo BV to conduct lobbying efforts on behalf of the Turkish government. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 16.) In November 2016, Flynn was selected by President-Elect Trump to serve as National Security Advisor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 18.) Flynn resigned from that position in February 2017. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 20.) In March 2017, Flynn registered under FARA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 21.) In 2017, Flynn pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI pertaining to his communications with the Russian Ambassador to the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recent FARA Cases. \"In the Statement of Offense filed with his plea agreement, Flynn admitted to making materially false statements in multiple documents filed pursuant to FARA in conjunction with worked performed by him and his company for the principal benefit of the Republic of Turkey.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"364255\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/318/236/#p244\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Human Rights Accountability Global Initiative Fund (\"HRAGIF\") is a Delaware nongovernmental organization. (Pls.' 56.1 Statement \u00b6\u00b6 25, 29-30.) In a complaint filed by Hermitage Capital Management with the FARA Unit in July 2016, HRAGIF and Prevezon Holdings Limited (\"Prevezon\"), a Russian-owned, Cyprus-based company, were alleged to have conducted\n   lobbying in the United States on behalf of the Russian government in their effort to seek to amend and possibly repeal the Magnitsky Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   without complying with FARA's registration requirements.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Exs. A-D, ECF Nos. 13-1 to 13-4.) The first request sought copies of correspondence between employees and officials of the FARA Unit and employees and officials of the United States Congress related to the Enumerated Persons for specified time periods.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Am. Compl. Ex. A, ECF No. 13-1.) The second request sought copies of internal correspondence between employees and officials of the FARA Unit related to the Enumerated Persons for the specified time periods. (Am. Compl. Ex. B, ECF No. 13-2.) The third request sought copies of correspondence between employees and officials of the FARA Unit and representatives of the Enumerated Persons for the specified time periods. (Am. Compl. Ex. C, ECF No. 13-3.) The fourth request sought copies of correspondence between employees and officials of OIG, as well as correspondence between employees and officials of OIG and employees and officials of the FARA Unit or the United States Congress, related to the Enumerated Persons for the specified time periods. (Am. Compl. Ex. D, ECF No. 13-4.) Plaintiffs sought expedited processing for each of the requests, arguing that the information sought was \"of widespread and exceptional media interest and involve[d] questions which could affect public confidence about\n   [DOJ's] integrity in enforcing [FARA.]\" (Am. Compl. Exs. A-D, ECF Nos. 13-1 to 13-4.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On August 30, 2017, a Government Information Specialist from NSD acknowledged receipt of the three requests directed to the FARA Unit. (Am. Compl. Ex. E, ECF No. 13-5.) However, DOJ denied expedited processing, stating that Plaintiffs had not met the standard for a \"compelling need.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Plaintiffs appealed the denial of expedited processing as to the first and third requests. (Decl. of John Langford, dated Dec. 14, 2018 (\"Langford Decl.\") Exs. R &amp; S, ECF Nos. 51-17 &amp; 51-18.) On September 8, 2017, a Government Information Specialist from OIG acknowledged receipt of the request directed to it. (Langford Decl. Ex. U, ECF No. 51-20.) On October 18, 2017, DOJ granted Plaintiffs' appeal and remanded the requests to NSD to process \"as quickly as practicable.\" (Am. Compl. Ex. G, ECF No. 13-7.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On March 8, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the instant action to compel disclosure of responsive records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 5.) As of that date, Plaintiffs had not received any records or further communication from NSD or OIG regarding the requests. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 19, 22.) On March 13, 2018, OIG responded to the request directed to it, reporting that the agency had conducted a search for responsive records, but had found none. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Am. Compl. Ex. H, ECF No. 13-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Plaintiffs filed an Amended Complaint on April 3, 2018 (Am. Compl., ECF No. 13) and DOJ filed its Answer on April 26, 2018. (Answer, ECF No. 18.) As part of the Amended Complaint, Plaintiffs alleged that during the covered period the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism communicated with OIG on matters related to FARA, and thus, asserted that OIG's failure to locate any responsive records indicated that OIG failed to conduct a reasonable search. (Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 26-27.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following the filing of DOJ's Answer, the Court ordered DOJ to begin a rolling production of documents responsive to the two FOIA requests for which DOJ previously determined that expedited processing was warranted (the first and third requests) and, no later than May 10, 2018, to file a letter regarding the status of each of the four FOIA requests, as well as a timeline for completing production of documents responsive to the two expedited requests. (Order, dated April 26, 2018, ECF No. 19.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 10, 2018, DOJ filed a letter indicating that it had located approximately 300 documents responsive to the expedited requests, and was releasing 26 pages subject to redaction based on Exemptions 6 and 7(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Letter, dated May 10, 2018, ECF No. 20;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Public Findlay Decl. Ex. E.) As for the OIG request, DOJ stated that OIG previously did not search its controlled correspondence records, which was the location where correspondence with Congress would be held, but was conducting a follow-up search. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, DOJ sought additional time to review an additional set of records and conduct further searches, which the Court approved. (Order, dated May 15, 2018, ECF No. 22.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On June 1, 2018, DOJ reported that OIG located the Senate letter referenced in the Amended Complaint, which it stated had been misfiled, but had located no new records. (Letter, ECF No. 23.) On July 10, 2018, NSD issued its second response to\n   the three requests directed to the FARA unit, releasing 17 additional pages and stating that it was withholding 277 pages of documents in full pursuant to Exemptions 4, 6, 7(A), 7(C) and 7(F). (Public Findlay Decl. Ex. F.) On September 12, 2018, NSD issued its final response to the three FARA Unit requests, withholding 1,810 emails and one DVD of documents in full pursuant to Exemption 7(A)\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and reserving its right to assert additional exemptions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Public Findlay Decl. Ex. G.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On November 9, 2018, the parties filed a proposed Stipulation and Order, stipulating that DOJ had conducted an adequate search for the records responsive to all four of Plaintiffs' requests and reserving certain rights pending the outcome of their anticipated cross-motions for summary judgment as to the applicability of Exemption 7(A). (Proposed Stipulation, ECF No. 40.) The Court approved the proposed Stipulation the same day. (Memo Endorsement, dated Nov. 9, 2018, ECF No. 41.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On November 9, 2018, DOJ filed its motion for partial summary judgment as to the records withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(A). (Def.'s Notice of Mot., ECF No. 42.) In support of its motion DOJ filed a Declaration by Patrick N. Findlay, the Acting Chief and Special Counsel of the Office of Strategy Management and Development of NSD (Public Findlay Decl., ECF No. 43), a Memorandum of Law (ECF No. 44) and an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Declaration by Patrick N. Findlay for the Court's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Notice of Filing, ECF No. 45.) The public Findlay Declaration included a\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   classifying the withheld documents into six categories: (1) correspondence between DOJ and counsel for Paul Manafort, Richard Gates and DMP; (2) correspondence between DOJ and counsel to Michael Flynn and Flynn Intel Group; (3) exhibits to the Hermitage Capital Management complaint; (4) documents pertaining to one or more law enforcement investigations; (5) documents on a DVD found in FARA Unit files; and (6) internal DOJ emails. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Vaughn Index, Public Findlay Decl. Ex. H, ECF No. 43-8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs filed their cross-motion on December 14, 2018. (Cross Mot., ECF No. 49.) In support of their cross-motion, Plaintiffs filed a Memorandum of Law (ECF No. 50) and Declaration of John Langford (ECF No. 51), as well as a Local Rule 56.1 Statement. (ECF No. 52.) DOJ filed its opposition to Plaintiffs' cross-motion on February 15, 2019, including an\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Declaration of Patrick Findlay. (Opp., ECF No. 59; Notice of Filing, ECF No. 60.) Plaintiffs filed their reply on March 8, 2019. (Reply Mem., ECF No. 61.) The Court held oral argument on April 3, 2019. (Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 71.)\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Following oral argument, the Court ordered DOJ to re-review the records set forth in categories 1-3, 4 and 6 of the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index in light of relevant developments to date and to produce any additional documents, or portions thereof, that it no longer contended were subject to Exemption 7(A). (Order, dated April 3, 2019, ECF No. 67.) In addition, the Court ordered DOJ to review the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Findlay Declaration and Supplemental Findlay Declaration to determine whether any additional information contained in those Declarations could be publicly disclosed. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On June 3, 2019, DOJ filed a status letter stating that it had completed a re-review of records over which it asserted Exemption 7(A) to consider the impact (if any) of \"relevant developments\" as of April 3, 2019 and of the public release of the redacted Special Counsel's report, but that it had not changed its assertions of Exemption 7(A) as a result of the review. (Letter Motion, dated June 3, 2019, ECF No. 73.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 10, 2019, DOJ filed redacted versions of the previously\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Findlay Declaration and Supplemental Findlay Declaration, which provided additional public information regarding the types of documents withheld and DOJ's justification for continuing to withhold certain records in full.

Here, for the reasons set forth below, the Court finds that the\n   <em>\n    Vaughn\n   </em>\n   index, together with the public and redacted Findlay Declarations, provide sufficient detail for the Court to trace a rational link between the information contained in the records and the potential interference with law enforcement proceedings asserted by DOJ.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   First, with respect to category 4 records, Plaintiffs argue that the fact that the documents pertain to one or more law enforcement proceedings does not establish a connection with any interference and, that without more specific information, Plaintiffs cannot evaluate whether documents in this category properly fall under Exemption 7(A). (Pl. Mem. at 14-15.) However, as set forth above, DOJ publicly has confirmed that all of the withheld records relate to one or more pending or prospective enforcement proceedings. (Public Findlay Decl. \u00b6 19.) In the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Findlay Declaration, DOJ further explains the types of records included in category 4 and expounds upon the harms that are reasonably likely to occur.

In response, DOJ asserts that, because the reasons for withholding the documents \"relate[d] to their source and the circumstances of their provision to the FARA Unit,\" no further review is necessary. (Opp. at 14.) DOJ further asserts that revealing even basic information about the type of records or source of the DVD records could reasonably be expected to harm enforcement proceedings by tending to reveal the nature, scope, or direction of those proceedings.

Moreover, in the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Findlay Declaration, DOJ has further described the category 5 records and provided their source.

First, in the public Findlay Declaration DOJ asserts that premature disclosure of the withheld records could reveal the existence of law enforcement proceedings that are not officially acknowledged or publicly known, which could cause witnesses, subjects or targets to flee, destroy evidence and/or attempt to coordinate their actions or testimony. (Public Findlay Decl. \u00b6 21.) DOJ further asserts that disclosure of the withheld records could reveal the nature, scope and direction of enforcement proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 22.) For example, DOJ states that \"withheld records show that DOJ knew certain facts at certain times, or that DOJ sought specific pieces of information from specific sources.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) DOJ then asserts that \"[s]ophisticated witnesses, subjects or targets could use ... [this] information to disrupt an investigation by, for example, attempting to tamper with witnesses, alerting associates about potential government enforcement actions, destroying or altering evidence, or conforming their testimony to known information.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Finally, DOJ asserts that premature release of the withheld records could shed light on DOJ's investigative or prosecutorial strategy. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23.) In the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Findlay Declaration, DOJ expounds upon these harms.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Such \"predictive judgments of harm are entitled to deference, especially where, as here, an investigation concerns matters of national security.\"\n   <em>\n    Manning v.

(Pl. Mem. at 24-25.) In response, DOJ argues that the fact that some investigations are a matter of public knowledge does not abrogate DOJ's assertion of Exemption 7(A) because, for example, a given record may relate to more than one enforcement proceeding. (Opp. at 15-17.) DOJ also argues that the news articles and other sources cited by Plaintiffs are not official government statements and thus, are not relevant to the Court's analysis. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In their reply, Plaintiffs contend that DOJ erroneously conflates the applicability of Exemption 7(A) with the \"official acknowledgement\" doctrine, under\n   which disclosure may be compelled even over an agency's otherwise valid exemption claim if the government previously officially acknowledged the information,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    BuzzFeed,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528261\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/344/396/#p405\">\n    344 F.

(\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Redacted Findlay Decl., \u00b6\u00b6 8, 17), DOJ maintains that releasing the records reasonably is likely to cause interference with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Opp. at 16 (citing Findlay Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23).) In the\n   <em>\n    ex parte\n   </em>\n   Supplemental Findlay Declaration, DOJ supports its continued withholding of responsive records as of February 15, 2019. Further, in a letter to the Court dated June 3, 2019, DOJ confirmed that it completed a re-review of records withheld pursuant to Exemption 7(A) to consider the impact of relevant developments, including the public release of the redacted Special Counsel's report, but that it had not changed its assertions of exemption 7(A) as a result of the review.

(Opp. at 11 (citing Findlay Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 21-23, 25);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 12-13.) DOJ's argument appears to be that releasing portions of the records, which are finite in number and relate to a finite group of individuals and entities, would reveal whether and to what extent the withheld records relate to other investigations that are not officially acknowledged based on the records that remain withheld. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 13.) Thus, DOJ argues that, while it did not assert a\n   <em>\n    Glomar\n   </em>\n   response in this action,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   similar considerations apply. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def. Mem. at 13.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   The Court finds that DOJ adequately has shown that, despite recent developments, the withheld records are exempt in their entirety. Just because some investigations are publicly known does not mean that the release of documents related to those investigations are not likely to interfere with ongoing or pending law enforcement proceedings. As other courts have recognized, \"Exemption 7(A), by its terms, applies whenever production of law-enforcement information 'could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings'-full stop.\"\n   <em>\n    STS Energy Partners LP v.

After installing themselves at the former Hermitage companies, these individuals faked contracts between the Hermitage companies and certain sham companies that they also created. These contracts indicated that the former Hermitage companies owed the sham companies large sums of money. The sham companies then sought and won judgments against the former Hermitage companies to recoup these falsified losses; as a result, the Hermitage companies altered their balance books for the previous years to show a loss. The former Hermitage companies (still controlled by the fraudsters) then sought tax refunds based on their revised books, which the Russian government paid out. The corporate raiders then transferred these funds from the Hermitage companies to their personal bank accounts hidden across the globe.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n    Hermitage ... hired Magnitsky to investigate.
