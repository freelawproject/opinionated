COOPER, United States District Judge\n   Jack Dempsey once observed that \"the best defense is a good offense.\" In boxing, perhaps, but not always in litigation. This case proves the point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   For the past decade, Arizona-based securities brokerage Scottsdale Capital Advisors has been in the cross-hairs of its regulator, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\"FINRA\"). FINRA has fined, sanctioned, and censured Scottsdale and its officers multiple times for a host of violations involving Scottsdale's dealings in unregistered penny stocks. Scottsdale has vigorously defended itself against these actions, complaining that FINRA has unfairly targeted its segment of the securities industry. It has also gone on offense by suing FINRA in federal court. Its most recent suit failed in the District Court for the District of Maryland and then at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Scottsdale now turns to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Scottsdale's newest claim is not a precise mirror of its previous one. Here, it sues FINRA for alleged breaches of the membership agreement Scottsdale entered when joining the organization. But while Scottsdale brings an ostensible breach of contract claim, this Court's jurisdiction turns on the substance of that claim rather than the label affixed to it. Examining the substance, Scottsdale's allegations are all intertwined with FINRA's governance and regulatory decisions, which Congress has mandated be challenged administratively and reviewed by appellate courts. So, different label, same result: This Court lacks the power to hear Scottsdale's claims and will dismiss the case in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Scottsdale, as one such firm, has been a member of FINRA since 2002.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7. When it joined, Scottsdale entered into FINRA's standard membership agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 28. FINRA describes the membership agreement as a \"contractual relationship between [a member] and FINRA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citation omitted). FINRA's By-Laws are incorporated into the membership agreement, which expressly requires compliance with those By-Laws.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Scottsdale alleges that FINRA has violated its By-Laws and the Exchange Act in several ways. First, the composition of its board. The Exchange Act requires that FINRA \"assure fair representation of its members\" and \"not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of\" the Act. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o-3(b)(4), (9) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 31. Scottsdale contends that FINRA has violated this covenant by permitting members to elect only seven of its twenty-three governors. Compl. \u00b6 34. Aggravating that situation, according to Scottsdale, is the fact that only three of those seven seats can be filled by governors from \"small firms\" like Scottsdale.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Second, the use of internal guidance. Scottsdale alleges that FINRA has promulgated guidance containing its interpretation of SEC rules and regulations as well as federal statutes.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 39 (including example in which FINRA guidance \"directly target[ed] transactions involving microcap and low-priced securities\"). Per Scottsdale, this guidance is not issued pursuant to the procedures articulated in FINRA's By-Laws, nor does it conform to the requirements of the\n   Exchange Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 38. Nevertheless, Scottsdale claims, FINRA has taken the view that the guidance is binding on its members, with disciplinary consequences for failure to comply.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Scottsdale offers several examples where FINRA has \"wielded this guidance against its members,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 41, pursuing disciplinary actions \"based on its dim view of the microcap and low-priced securities market segment,\"\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 42. As Scottsdale frames it, \"FINRA's crusade against the microcap and low-priced securities market has directly impacted Scottsdale, which engages in that industry.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 48. Specifically, it complains that FINRA has targeted it for \"examinations, extensive document requests, and prosecutions, and sought to levy fines against it for its day-to-day business activities.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Third,\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   enforcement. Scottsdale alleges that FINRA has engaged in improper enforcement of FINRA Rule 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 52-61. That rule provides that each FINRA member \"in the conduct of its business[ ] shall observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.\" FINRA R. 2010;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 52. The SEC approved that rule in 2008 on the basis of Section 15A(b)(6) of the Exchange Act, which requires SROs to \"promote just and equitable principles of trade.\" Compl. \u00b6 53. The Complaint alleges that, in disciplinary proceedings against Scottsdale, FINRA \"propounded a contrary interpretation of FINRA Rule 2010\" when it accused Scottsdale of violating not the 1934 Exchange Act, but a section of the 1933 Securities Act.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. According to Scottsdale, this exceeds FINRA's authority because its By-Laws and rules require it to pursue only claims under the 1934 Act.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 54-61, 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   These actions, Scottsdale says, stifle its business and violate the membership agreement, which functions as a contract between the parties. As a result, it claims it has lost revenue and seeks damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 5-6;\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prayer for Relief \u00b6 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    FINRA's Discipline of Scottsdale and Scottsdale's Regulatory Efforts\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As Scottsdale acknowledges, it is the subject of ongoing FINRA disciplinary proceedings.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 54. In June 2017, a FINRA Hearing Panel fined Scottsdale and sanctioned individual officers over the sales of unregistered, non-exempt penny stock securities in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Mot. Dismiss (\"MTD\") Ex. A.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Scottsdale appealed that decision to FINRA's NAC, which affirmed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Scottsdale has appealed the NAC's decision to the SEC.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   That appeal is currently pending. Scottsdale also filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, seeking to enjoin the disciplinary proceedings. In that case, as it does here, Scottsdale alleged that FINRA acted beyond its legal authority when it sought to enforce provisions of the 1933 Securities Act, rather than the 1934 Exchange Act.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Scottsdale I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12175746\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/844/414/#p417\">\n    844 F.3d at 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The Complaint identifies three alleged breaches of contract: (1) that FINRA has exceeded its statutory authority in using its Rule 2010 to punish Scottsdale for violations of Section 5 of the Securities Act; (2) that FINRA has improperly issued guidance and relied on that guidance to unfairly discipline smaller member firms who are engaged in the microcap and low-priced securities business; and (3) that FINRA's board does not adequately represent industry members. Scottsdale ties each of these alleged misdeeds to one of FINRA's By-Laws. Scottsdale insists that FINRA acts beyond its authority in disciplining violations of the Securities Act because FINRA can only adopt rules that \"carry out the purposes of the [Exchange] Act\" and are consistent with \"applicable law.\" Opp'n at 3 (citing FINRA By-Laws, art.

In this regard, the ostensible breach of contract claim operates as a collateral attack on FINRA's disciplinary action. Consider, for example, Scottsdale's claim regarding Rule 2010. It alleges that FINRA improperly used that Rule to discipline Scottsdale,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 52-61, and asks the Court to (1) declare as much and (2) determine that, by taking that allegedly\n   <em>\n    ultra vires\n   </em>\n   action, FINRA violated its By-Laws and thus breached its contract with Scottsdale,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 1-2. Were the Court to do that, it would be tantamount to asserting that FINRA had no authority to discipline Scottsdale in the way it did. Again, this Court lacks power to do that.

Likewise, Scottsdale's sister firm has petitioned the SEC for a rulemaking to achieve a regulatory fix to many of the same issues animating this suit. Its petition-seeking changes to the composition of FINRA's Board of Governors and regulatory revisions to prevent FINRA from issuing what Scottsdale views as improper guidance-is currently before the agency.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   MTD Ex. B. Scottsdale cannot have its cake and eat it, too. It cannot at once insist that this suit seeks relief that falls outside the SEC's area of expertise and that is not otherwise available to it, while also seeking precisely that same relief before the SEC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Scottsdale's counterarguments fall flat. They all stem from one simple idea: that it is not challenging FINRA's rules and regulations but merely alleging a breach of contract between two private corporations. Opp'n at 1. Scottsdale repeats this line as if it were an incantation. But this mantra does not obscure the true nature of its claims.

In the process, it refused to consider Kaiser Steel's defense that the contract violated the Sherman Act and the National Labor Relations Act.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    The Supreme Court reversed, concluding \"that a federal court has a duty to determine whether a contract violates federal law before enforcing it.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n     at 83\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n     102 S.Ct. 851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Unlike this case,\n    <em>\n     Kaiser Steel\n    </em>\n    did not involve a purported contract between a regulatory corporation and a member firm, and the contract claim itself was not grounded in administrative law. Moreover, this is not an instance where the Court is otherwise enforcing a contract and declining to consider a proffered defense due to its relationship to administrative law. Finally, the\n    <em>\n     Kaiser Steel\n    </em>\n    Court concluded that the text of the statute at issue indicated that \"a court must reach the merits of an illegality defense in order to determine whether the contract clause at issue has any legal effect in the first place.\"\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n     at 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11303738\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/455/72/#p83\">\n     102 S.Ct. 851\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . These distinctions are fatal to Scottsdale's reliance on\n    <em>\n     Kaiser Steel\n    </em>\n    because that case did not involve any issues that, if adjudicated by the district court, would encroach on the exclusive administrative review mechanism that Congress had established.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Finally, Scottsdale points to\n    <em>\n     City of Providence, Rhode Island v. BATS Global Markets, Inc.\n    </em>\n    , to argue that its claim presents an exception to the general rule that suits related to regulatory actions subject to a statutory review scheme cannot be adjudicated by district courts.

While\n    <em>\n     City of Providence\n    </em>\n    , unlike the other cases Scottsdale invokes, at least involves an action against regulatory bodies subject to the Exchange Act, it is still inapposite in this context. The plaintiffs in\n    <em>\n     City of Providence\n    </em>\n    filed a securities-fraud class action against seven national securities exchanges.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263375\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/36/#p44\">\n     878 F.3d at 40\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The Second Circuit found that the plaintiffs were \"challeng[ing] particular actions taken by the defendants individually and not as part of a 'national market system plan' \" and therefore the claims were not subject to the Exchange Act's review scheme.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263375\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/36/#p44\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12263375\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/878/36/#p44\">\n     at 45\n    </extracted-citation>\n    .
