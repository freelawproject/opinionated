Under Rule 23(a)(1), the numerosity requirement, the class must be \"so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable.\" The class size in this case, 6,814 members, is sufficient to satisfy the numerosity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pruitt v.

In this case, Plaintiff alleges that Defendant mailed standardized \"form letters\" to members of the purported class which were materially false, deceptive, and misleading in violation of the FDCPA. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44, 49. Thus, a common question of fact arises as to whether each member of the purported class was mailed a standardized letter, and a common question of law arises as to whether the letters were materially false, deceptive, and misleading. Therefore, Rule 23(a)(2)'s commonality requirement has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Rule 23(a)(3)'s typicality requirement necessitates that \"the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class.\" The rule \"primarily directs the district court to focus on whether the named representatives' claims have the same essential characteristics as the claims of the class at large.\"\n   <em>\n    De La Fuente v.

Therefore, the typicality requirement has been satisfied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Finally, Rule 23(a)(4) requires that \"the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" This prerequisite is directed at \"concerns about the competency of class\n   counsel and conflicts of interest\" between the class and its representatives.\n   <em>\n    Dukes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    564 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   349 n.5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5930529,12450492\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/564/338/\">\n    131 S.Ct. 2541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In assessing adequacy of representation, the court must consider whether the named plaintiff \"(1) has antagonistic or conflicting claims with other members of the class; (2) has sufficient interest in the outcome of the case to ensure vigorous advocacy; and (3) has counsel that is competent, qualified, experienced and able to vigorously conduct the litigation.\"\n   <em>\n    Wahl v.

Ill. 2005). Plaintiff in this case shares the same injury with all other members of the purported class, and thus, there is no reason to believe that Plaintiff has antagonistic or conflicting claims with other members of the class. Additionally, Plaintiff has retained experienced counsel on the matter, who have the resources to vigorously conduct the litigation.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Thomasson Decl. \u00b6\u00b6 2-7, Dkt.

Rule 23(b) Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Having satisfied the four requirements of Rule 23(a) by a preponderance of the evidence, Plaintiff must satisfy at least one of Rule 23(b)'s provisions. In this case, Plaintiff relies on Rule 23(b)(3), which requires that the court find that \"the questions of law or fact common to the class members predominate over any questions affecting only individual members, and that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" The rule instructs the court that the \"matters pertinent to these findings include: (A) the class members' interests in individually controlling the prosecution or defense of separate actions; (B) the extent and nature of any litigation concerning the controversy already begun by or against class members; (C) the desirability or undesirability of concentrating the litigation of the claims in the particular forum; and (D) the likely difficulties in managing a class action.\" Fed.

The issue here-whether Defendant violated the FDCPA by sending form letters that were materially false, deceptive, and misleading to the purported class-predominates over any individual questions of the purported class members. Thus, Plaintiff has met her burden of establishing predominance under Rule 23(b)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Defendant saves its only arguments for the superiority component of Rule 23(b)(3). Defendant contends that a class action is not the superior method of litigating the issues presented here because recovery for individual class members would be, at most, de minimis. A plaintiff bringing an FDCPA case individually can recover statutory damages of $1,000, whereas a class member can only recover his proportionate share of \"the lesser of $500,000 or 1 per centum of the net worth of the debt collector.\" 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692k(a)(2)(B). Based on Defendant's responses to Plaintiff's Requests to Admit, Defendant denies having a net worth in excess of $100,000 and, thus, the maximum amount of class damages could not exceed $1,000.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Br., Dkt. No. 18, at 3 (citing Dkt. No. 17-1 at 5-6). As a result, if each of the estimated 6,814 class members\n   makes a claim, he or she would receive approximately 15\u00a2 in damages. Defendant argues that its small net worth, combined with the purported class size, renders a class action inferior to individual litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Seventh Circuit has indicated in dicta that \"a de minimis recovery (in monetary terms) should not automatically bar a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    Mace v.

This is because \"[t]he policy at the very core of the class action mechanism is to overcome the problem that small recoveries do not provide the incentive for any individual to bring a solo action prosecuting his or her rights.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court recognized that the FDCPA addresses this problem by authorizing awards of statutory damages of up to $1,000 and recovery of actual attorneys' fees. But this assumes \"the plaintiff will be aware of her rights, willing to subject herself to all the burdens of suing and able to find an attorney willing to take her case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court emphasized that \"[t]hese are considerations that cannot be dismissed lightly in assessing whether a class action or a series of individual lawsuits would be more appropriate for pursuing the FDCPA's objectives.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   But\n   <em>\n    Mace\n   </em>\n   did not say that the likelihood of only a de minimis recovery for class members is never a proper consideration in deciding whether to certify an FDCPA class under Rule 23 ; it said that \"a de minimis recovery (in monetary terms) should not automatically bar a class action.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p344\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"833947\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/109/338/#p344\">\n    at 344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Sys. of Green Bay, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12264311\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/880/362/\">\n    880 F.3d 362\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2018). On remand, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint and a motion for class certification. The defendant opposed the motion for class certification, arguing that class treatment was not superior to individual treatment. Given that liability had already been established as a matter of law and in light of the defendant's net worth, the court found that a class action would not be the superior method under which to resolve the individual class members' disputes. It explained that, because each class member would only recover $1.00 and would recover more by opting out of the class, there was virtually no incentive for anyone to remain a member of the class. That, along with the expense of mailing notices, the costs of administration, and the additional attorneys' fees that would be incurred, the court concluded class treatment was not a superior method\n   for adjudicating the plaintiffs' claims.\n   <em>\n    Boucher\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2019%20WL%201543988\">\n    2019 WL 1543988\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Even when liability is uncertain, it would seem reasonable to deny class certification when the award for individual members of the class is likely to be at most a de minimis recovery of less than the cost of a postage stamp. As the district court noted in\n   <em>\n    Gallego\n   </em>\n   , \"[s]uch an insignificant recovery is harmful to a putative plaintiff who might have prosecuted his claim individually but failed to opt out of the class, and it is meaningless to everyone else.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358690\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/506/#p510\">\n    102 F. Supp. 3d at 510\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The potential claimant who failed to opt out can recover only pennies, instead of seeking up to $1,000 in statutory damages, and most of those remaining are unlikely to bother taking the steps required to obtain the few pennies to which their claim entitles them. As the\n   <em>\n    Gallego\n   </em>\n   court also noted, class actions can generally be useful for vindicating claims with small individual recoveries by creating an incentive for attorneys to litigate them. But this incentive already exists in FDCPA cases, the court noted, since the FDCPA requires the defendant to pay the prevailing plaintiff's attorneys fees.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358690\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/506/#p510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   True, class certification reduces the possibility that the defendant will face multiple lawsuits raising the same issue. But where as here the violation is at most a technical one that does not result in actual damages to the recipient of the challenged collection letter, the possibility of multiple lawsuits is slim. Presumably, this is why Defendant opposes Plaintiff's motion for class certification. Class certification under these circumstances is likely to benefit only the attorneys whose fees would be expected to increase substantially if a suit on behalf of one person is transformed into a class action on behalf of 6,814. It is not the purpose of the FDCPA, however, to benefit attorneys. \"The prospect of mass indifference, a few profiteers, and a quick fee to clever lawyers is hardly the intended outcome for Rule 23 class actions.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358690\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/102/506/#p510\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   But in this case, unlike\n   <em>\n    Boucher\n   </em>\n   , Defendant has introduced no evidence as to its net worth. Citing\n   <em>\n    Tourgeman v. Nelson &amp; Kennard\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518160\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1105/\">\n    900 F.3d 1105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2018), Defendant argues that, because Plaintiff has failed to introduce evidence of Defendant's net worth, Plaintiff has failed to show that a class action is superior. But\n   <em>\n    Tourgeman\n   </em>\n   did not hold that a plaintiff must carry the burden of introducing net worth at the class certification phase; rather, it held that a plaintiff must carry the burden at trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518160\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1105/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518160\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/900/1105/\">\n    at 1108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In light of the statutory text and structure, we conclude that Congress intended the plaintiff to carry the burden at trial of introducing evidence of the defendant's net worth.\"). More importantly,\n   <em>\n    Tourgeman\n   </em>\n   was decided by the Ninth Circuit, and it is not clear that the Seventh Circuit would agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Carter v. United States\n   </em>\n   , for example, the Seventh Circuit addressed the question whether a damages cap on non-economic damages in a medical malpractice action was an affirmative defense that was waived if not asserted in an answer.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9111940\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/791/\">\n    333 F.3d 791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (7th Cir. 2003). The burden of proof for an affirmative defense, of course, is on the party asserting it.\n   <em>\n    Bauer v. J. B. Hunt Transport, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540766\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/759/#p763\">\n    150 F.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 763 (7th Cir. 1998) (\"The defendant, it is true, bears the burden of proof on any affirmative defense that it chooses to assert.\"). Although the court found it unnecessary to answer the question in\n   <em>\n    Carter\n   </em>\n   , it noted that \"[a] cap on damages is only a partial defense, but that is true of any defense that is limited to the amount of damages, and in that respect it is no different from comparative negligence, which clearly is an affirmative defense.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9111940\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/333/791/\">\n    333 F.3d at 796\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Other circuits have held that limitations on liability constitute affirmative defenses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Ingraham v. United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1369115\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/808/1075/#p1078\">\n    808 F.2d 1075\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1078-1079 (1987) ;\n   <em>\n    Jakobsen v. Mass. Port Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116607\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/520/810/#p813\">\n    520 F.2d 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 813 (1975).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   It makes sense to hold that a defendant's net worth limitation on liability in an FDCPA action is an affirmative defense on which the defendant has the burden of proof, not only because such a limitation is a matter of avoidance, but also because the defendant is in the best position to present evidence of its own net worth. Absent proof of the defendant debt collector's net worth, the $500,000 cap on class liability applies. It thus follows that Plaintiff was not required to produce evidence of net worth at this stage of the proceedings and instead the burden of proof on this issue belongs to Defendant. Defendant cites its response to Plaintiff's Rule 36 Requests to Admit, in which Defendant denied that its net worth exceeded $100,000 as the only evidence on its net worth. Dkt. No. 17-1 at 5-6. But the denial of an opposing party's Request to Admit is not evidence. A set of Requests To Admit is simply a procedural device for clarifying what is in dispute and what is not; a denial means the party must prove the fact for which an admission was sought. Fed. R. Civ. P. 36(b). Absent proof that Defendant's net worth is such that an award to individual class members of only pennies would result, I conclude based on the evidence and Rule 23 considerations that a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Plaintiff has fulfilled the requirements of Rule 23(a) and Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the foregoing reasons, Plaintiff's motion for class certification (Dkt. No. 15) is\n   <strong>\n    GRANTED\n   </strong>\n   . The Clerk is directed to schedule this matter for further proceedings to address the form of notice to the members of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED\n   </strong>\n   at Green Bay, Wisconsin this\n   <em>\n    7th\n   </em>\n   day of June, 2019.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
