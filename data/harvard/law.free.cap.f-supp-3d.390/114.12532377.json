(\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Pls.' Fifth Am. Compl. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 63.) The District's primary argument is that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim as a matter of law because the Panhandling Control Act is not a content-based statute, and therefore strict scrutiny does not apply.

(\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Order, ECF No. 69.) This Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that Order. In short, the Court has concluded that the District's Rule 12(b)(6) arguments are not viable at the motion-to-dismiss stage of this case, insofar as they attack the merits of Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge rather than the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' complaint. The Court has also found that, when accepted as true, Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a plausible Section 1983 First Amendment claim.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n      42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n     </extracted-citation>\n     .

In other words, a plaintiff's allegations of fact must be accepted as true at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and Plaintiffs' contentions regarding the character of the fora to which the Act applies are not clearly precluded as a matter of law such that the complaint's \"public forum\" assertions cannot support a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted, as the District appears to acknowledge.

Cir. 1996).))\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-45\">\n     As for the nature of the government's statutory prohibitions and its justifications for limiting speech in this manner, Plaintiffs allege that strict scrutiny applies, because the Panhandling Control Act is a content-based regulation insofar as it prohibits certain speech-i.e., immediate requests for money or things of value-in public areas, based on the message communicated. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 153-156.) Plaintiffs further allege that the Act cannot\n     <em>\n      survive\n     </em>\n     strict scrutiny, because the statutory restrictions are not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest. (\n     <em>\n      See id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6\u00b6 158-62.) Specifically, the complaint contends that there are less restrictive alternatives available to the government, such as \"enforcing existing generic criminal laws already on the books in this jurisdiction or enacting new criminal laws that directly target conduct that threatens the District's asserted interests rather than employing regulations that indirectly support those interests by directly burdening protected speech.\" (\n     <em>\n      Id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6 161;\n     <em>\n      see also id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6\u00b6 160-62.)\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-46\">\n     It is by now well established that government regulations are content-based if they \"appl[y] to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed[,]\"\n     <em>\n      Reed\n     </em>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">\n      135 S.

Thus, the complaint's First Amendment claims are plainly plausible, insofar as Plaintiffs assert that the Panhandling Control Act is both subject to strict scrutiny (because it prohibits requests for immediate donations of money in various public areas and not any other speech-i.e., it is a content-based restriction), and does not satisfy strict scrutiny (because other less restrictive alternatives are available).\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-47\">\n     This conclusion should not be taken to suggest that Plaintiffs have always clearly claimed that the Panhandling Control Act is unconstitutional. To put it mildly, the complaint in this case has developed in a haphazard manner, and the opaqueness of Plaintiffs' intentions with respect to having organized the allegations into \"arrest\" and \"prosecution\" class action claims makes the instant (sixth) pleading attempt far from a model of clarity. But the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have provided sufficient notice to the District, by plausibly alleging that all three of the challenged sections of the Panhandling Control Act are content-based regulations that limit protected speech in public forums, and that these regulations cannot survive strict scrutiny because there are less restrictive alternatives available to the D.C. government. (\n     <em>\n      See, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , 5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 150-62.)\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-48\">\n     <strong>\n      B.

Indeed, the motion squarely rejects the basic factual premises of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims-that the challenged provisions are content-based restrictions of speech in a public forum and do not survive strict scrutiny because they are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest-and it does so by arguing, explicitly, that the statutory provisions\n     <em>\n      are\n     </em>\n     constitutional (\n     <em>\n      see, e.g.\n     </em>\n     , Def.'s Mot. at 10), given that,\n     <em>\n      inter alia\n     </em>\n     , public transportation vehicles and Metro stations (which section 22-2302(b) covers) are \"nonpublic forums\" (\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 16-18); sections 22-2302(a) and (d) are \"content neutral\" restrictions (\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 18-22); and all three challenged provisions are \"narrowly tailored to serve compelling government interests\" (\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      id.\n     </em>\n     at 22-26).

As the proponent of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the District must demonstrate that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and its vigorous contention that Plaintiffs are\n     <em>\n      wrong\n     </em>\n     when they assert that the challenged provisions of the Panhandling Control Act regulate speech in public fora in a content-based fashion and are not narrowly tailored to achieve compelling government interests does no such thing.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-54\">\n     <strong>\n      C. At Present, It Does Not Appear That Claim 1 And Claim 3 Are Duplicative\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-55\">\n     The District also suggests that, at the very least, Claim 3 should be dismissed as duplicative of Claim 1. (\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Def.'s Mot. at 26-27; Def.s' Reply at 13-14.) This argument is not entirely baseless, because for reasons that have not yet been fully disclosed, Plaintiffs have opted to bifurcate their core constitutional claims for damages brought against the District into one claim brought by the named plaintiffs who were\n     <em>\n      arrested\n     </em>\n     pursuant to subsections 22-2302(a), (b), and (d) of Chapter 22 of the D.C. Code, (\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 172-83 (Claim 1)), and another claim brought by the named plaintiffs who were not only arrested but were also\n     <em>\n      prosecuted\n     </em>\n     for panhandling pursuant to those same sections of the D.C. Code (\n     <em>\n      see id.\n     </em>\n     at \u00b6\u00b6 196-201 (Claim 3)).\n     <footnotemark>\n      8\n     </footnotemark>\n     This structure is not intuitive, and may not be a model of clarity, as the Court has already expressed, but the Court is not convinced that it results in impermissible duplication of claims, and thus, both claims will be allowed to proceed, for now.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-56\">\n     To be sure, the District is correct that a district court may exercise its discretion to dismiss claims \"that stem from identical allegations, that are decided under identical legal standards, and for which identical relief is available.\"\n     <em>\n      Wultz v.

(\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     Pls.' Opp'n at 40-41). But the Court perceives that, despite the application of identical legal standards, there could be different relief-whether injunctive relief or money damages (\n     <em>\n      see\n     </em>\n     5AC at 30-31, \u00b6\u00b6 D, G, and H)-available for those who have been\n     <em>\n      prosecuted\n     </em>\n     for violating the alleged unconstitutional statutory provisions in contrast to those who have merely been\n     <em>\n      arrested\n     </em>\n     and detained, and any distinctions with respect to such relief might require the development of different facts related to the additional harms of prosecution and conviction.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     <em>\n      Steinberg v.

Therefore, the Court finds it premature to exercise its discretion to dismiss Claim 3 as duplicative at this time.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-57\">\n     <strong>\n      IV. CONCLUSION\n     </strong>\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-58\">\n     The District would have this Court decide\n     <em>\n      now\n     </em>\n     , at the motion-to-dismiss stage, whether or not Plaintiffs are correct that the challenged provisions of the D.C. Panhandling Control Act are content-based restrictions that are subject to strict scrutiny and cannot be sustained as narrowly tailored to further compelling government interests. For the reasons explained above, the District asks too much too early in the process of this litigation. Plaintiffs have plausibly\n     <em>\n      alleged\n     </em>\n     that the panhandling provisions at issue are content-based laws that restrict protected speech in public forums, and they maintain that the District had less restrictive, alternative means of achieving its stated objectives.
