According to Plaintiffs in the instant case, <em>Reed</em> compels the conclusion that the District of Columbia's Panhandling Control Act (\"the Act\"), <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2022-2301\">D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 22-2301</extracted-citation> - 2306, is constitutionally invalid. Plaintiffs were arrested for asking passersby for money in certain public places in the District of Columbia in contravention of three provisions of the Act (which criminalizes panhandling and no other types of solicitation), and much like the town residents in <em>Reed</em> , Plaintiffs maintain that the Act imposes content-based restrictions on speech that do not survive strict scrutiny. (<em>See</em> Fifth Am. Compl. (\"5AC\"), ECF No. 61, at \u00b6\u00b6 150-62.)</p><p id=\"p-9\">Before this Court at present is Defendant District of Columbia's (\"the District's\") Motion to Dismiss Plaintiffs' Fifth Amended Complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Pls.' Fifth Am. Compl. (\"Def.'s Mot.\"), ECF No. 63.) The District's primary argument is that Plaintiffs fail to state a claim as a matter of law because the Panhandling Control Act is not a content-based statute, and therefore strict scrutiny does not apply. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2022-2301\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2022-2301\"> at 18-22</extracted-citation>; <em>see also</em> Def.'s Reply in Support of Def.'s Mot. (\"Def.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 65, at 8-10.)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District further maintains that, even if the challenged subsections of the Panhandling Control Act are content-based regulations that have been applied to regulate conduct in a public forum, these statutory provisions are narrowly tailored to serve compelling government interests such that they survive strict scrutiny, and, therefore, comport with the First Amendment. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. at 22-26; Def.'s Reply at 10-13.)</p><p id=\"p-10\">On March 29, 2019, this Court issued an Order that <strong>DENIED</strong> Defendant's motion to dismiss. (<em>See</em> Order, ECF No. 69.) This Memorandum Opinion explains the reasons for that Order. In short, the Court has concluded that the District's Rule 12(b)(6) arguments are not viable at the motion-to-dismiss stage of this case, insofar as they attack the merits of Plaintiffs' constitutional challenge rather than the sufficiency of Plaintiffs' complaint. The Court has also found that, when accepted as true, Plaintiffs' allegations are sufficient to state a plausible Section 1983 First Amendment claim. <em>See</em> <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983</extracted-citation>.

The Panhandling Control Act defines panhandling as \"ask[ing], beg[ging], or solicit[ing] alms,\" and this definition \"includes the spoken, written, or printed word or such other act conducted for the purpose of obtaining an immediate donation of money or thing of value[.]\" <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2022-2301\">D.C.

Brown, Michael Lemeul Holland, Reginald Bryant, Marc Gatling, and Jomo Kenyatta Hall (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\") were each arrested for violating at least one of these provisions of the Panhandling Control Act.

Gatling was arrested by Metro Transit Police for panhandling in the <em>McFarlin</em> zone in violation of section 22-2302(b).

And Holland and Brown were arrested in violation of section 22-2302(d).

For present purposes, the facts pertaining to each plaintiff's post-arrest circumstances are not material; it suffices to note that all of the named plaintiffs were allegedly arrested by District or Metro law enforcement officers and were detained for some period of time, and that Brown, Holland, Bryant, and Gatling were further prosecuted in Superior Court for their panhandling offenses. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em> ) Hall represents that he desires to continue panhandling in the future but fears arrest.

Procedural History</strong></p><p id=\"p-18\">Plaintiffs have filed six iterations of their complaint over the past three and a half years. To understand the evolution of Plaintiffs' claims, and thus this Court's evaluation of the operative complaint that Defendant challenges in the instant motion to dismiss, a relatively comprehensive description of these pleadings is required.</p><p id=\"p-19\">Plaintiff Brown filed an initial, 12-page \"Class Action\" complaint on August 25, 2015. (Compl., ECF No. 1.) That complaint consisted of one claim styled as a \"facial\" First Amendment challenge to the Panhandling Control Act under Section 1983 of Title 42 of the United States Code (\" Section 1983\"), brought on behalf of Brown and all other individuals who had either been arrested, or been arrested and prosecuted, under the Panhandling Control Act. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 6-10</extracted-citation>.) On October 22, 2015, this Court granted the parties' consent motion to stay Plaintiffs' obligation to file a separate motion for class-action treatment pursuant to Local Rule 23.1(b)-a stay which remains in effect at present. (<em>See</em> Min. Order of Oct. 22, 2015.)</p><p id=\"p-20\">On December 9, 2015, Plaintiffs filed a 26-page first amended complaint as a matter of right, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a)(1)(B). (<em>See</em> First Am. Compl. (\"FAC\"), ECF No. 15; <em>see also</em> Min. Order of Oct. 28, 2015 (granting consent motion for extension of time to file an amended complaint).) The first amended complaint added Holland, Louis Sylvester White, Bryant, and Gatling as named plaintiffs, and included a new Section 1983 claim based on Plaintiffs' \"Right to Return of Money and Other Property.\" (<em>See</em> FAC at 1, 19-20.) As before, Plaintiffs styled this complaint as a \"Class Action.\" (<em>Id.</em> at 2.) The District filed a motion to dismiss the first amended complaint (<em>see</em> Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss FAC, ECF No. 18), arguing, <em>inter alia</em> , that the Panhandling Control Act is constitutional (<em>see</em> Mem. in Support of Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss FAC, ECF No. 18-1, at 15-27), and that Plaintiffs' new \"Right to Return\" claim failed to plead municipal liability or an underlying constitutional violation sufficiently (<em>see</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 27-31</extracted-citation>).</p><p id=\"p-21\">On July 12, 2016, this Court held a lengthy hearing regarding the District's motion to dismiss Plaintiffs' first amended complaint. (<em>See</em> Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 44.) After the hearing, the Court concluded that \"amending the complaint would aid the parties and the Court in determining whether the claims here can survive a motion to dismiss,\" and gave Plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint. (<em>See</em> Order, ECF No. 24, at 1.) The Court advised Plaintiffs to ensure that claims for relief complied with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8's requirements, and to plead sufficient facts to support standing for each form of relief sought. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 1-2</extracted-citation>.) In light of this ruling, the Court denied Defendant's motion to dismiss without prejudice as moot. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 2</extracted-citation>.)</p><p id=\"p-22\">On August 15, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a 44-page second amended class action complaint, which added two claims, purportedly pleaded \"in the alternative,\" relating to the named Plaintiffs' arrest and prosecution.</p><p id=\"p-23\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"120\" href=\"#p120\" id=\"p120\">*120</a>(<em>See</em> Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 25, at 24-31.) Defendant again moved to dismiss the complaint, this time adding arguments about Plaintiffs' lack of standing in addition to its prior positions regarding the legality of the Panhandling Control Act and the multiple deficiencies of the \"Right to Return\" claim. (<em>See generally</em> Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Second Am. Compl., ECF No. 27.) The Court granted Plaintiffs' subsequent motion for leave to file a third amended complaint, and as a result, denied Defendant's motion as moot. (<em>See</em> Minute Order of October 12, 2016; <em>see also</em> Pls.' Mot. to Amend the Second Am. Compl. and to File Third Am. Compl., ECF No. 29, at 4-6.)</p><p id=\"p-24\">On October 12, 2016, Plaintiffs filed a 45-page third amended complaint. (<em>See</em> Third Am. Compl., ECF No. 31.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This class action complaint included six claims against the District pursuant to Section 1983 : a First Amendment challenge to the Panhandling Control Act; two claims pleaded \"in the alternative\" challenging Plaintiffs' arrests as violative of the First Amendment; and three claims challenging Plaintiffs' arrests and detention under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 23-33</extracted-citation>.) Defendant filed its third motion to dismiss the complaint, renewing its arguments in opposition to the First Amendment challenge and further arguing that Plaintiffs had failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted based on the alleged Fourth and Fifth Amendment violations. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Third Am. Compl., ECF No. 33, at 1-2.)</p><p id=\"p-25\">On July 20, 2017, the Court held another lengthy hearing, after which it took Defendant's motion under advisement. (<em>See</em> Min. Entry of July 20, 2017.) On August 29, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss voluntarily one of the claims in the third amended complaint (<em>see</em> Pls.' Mot. to Dismiss Claim 3, ECF No. 41), and because voluntary dismissal of part of a complaint by a plaintiff who seeks to continue pursuing other claims in the case can only be achieved through amendment, the Court construed Plaintiffs' motion for voluntary dismissal of a claim as a motion for leave to amend, and so construed, granted the motion, over the District's objection (<em>see</em> Order, ECF No. 43, at 1-2). Having thereby provided Plaintiffs with another opportunity to amend their pleading, the Court then denied the District's motion to dismiss as moot. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 2</extracted-citation>.)</p><p id=\"p-26\">On September 19, 2017, Plaintiffs filed a 35-page fourth amended class action complaint. (<em>See</em> Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 47.) This complaint included one claim challenging the Panhandling Control Act under the First Amendment, and three claims pleaded \"in the alternative\" challenging Plaintiffs' arrests and detention in violation of the First, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments. (<em>See</em> <em><extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\">id.</extracted-citation></em><extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2022-2302\"> at 22-27</extracted-citation>.) Defendant filed yet another motion to dismiss, maintaining that the Panhandling Control Act is constitutional and arguing, <em>inter alia</em> , that Plaintiffs had not sufficiently pleaded municipal liability for the three alternative claims. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss Fourth Am. Compl., ECF No. 48, at 1-2.)</p><p id=\"p-27\">Several months later, Plaintiffs filed an opposed motion for leave to amend their complaint once more, this time based on the addition of a new named plaintiff as well as proposed clarification of their claims based on legal issues raised through the first three years of the case. (<em>See</em> Pls.' Mot. for Leave to Amend Fourth Am. Compl. and to File Fifth Am. Compl., ECF</p><p id=\"p-28\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"121\" href=\"#p121\" id=\"p121\">*121</a>No. 57, at 2.) On April 30, 2018, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for leave to amend, and denied Defendant's motion to dismiss, as moot, for the fourth and final time. (<em>See</em> Order, ECF No. 60, at 2.) In so ruling, the Court also specifically emphasized that \"<em>this will be the final amendment to the complaint that Plaintiffs are permitted to make</em> [.]\" (<em>Id.</em> (emphasis in original).)</p><p id=\"p-29\">On April 30, 2018, Plaintiffs filed the 31-page fifth amended class action complaint that is the operative pleading to date, and also the subject of the instant ruling. (<em>See</em> 5AC.) Plaintiffs' fifth amended complaint contains three claims challenging sections 22-2302(a), 22-2302(b), and 22-2302(d) of the Panhandling Control Act as violative of the First Amendment, each of which is brought pursuant to Section 1983, but only two of these claims are relevant here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> One is titled \"Arrest/Detention Claim\" and purportedly relates to the experiences of those named plaintiffs who were arrested and detained in alleged violation of one of the three challenged provisions of the Act.

However, in most cases, motions to dismiss are limited to the purported deficiencies of a plaintiff's communication of its allegations in the complaint-in other words, the adequacy of the notice.

Plausible Claims That Challenge Government Regulation On First Amendment Grounds</strong></p><p id=\"p-38\">Courts generally approach First Amendment challenges to statutes and regulations by (1) \"determining whether the First Amendment protects the speech at issue\"; (2) \"identifying the nature of the forum\"; and (3) \"assessing whether the [government's] justifications for restricting [the] speech satisfy the requisite standard.\" <em>Mahoney v.

Cir. 2011) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). This analysis involves both factual and legal determinations about the speech that is being regulated, the nature of the forum, the government's interests, and the tailoring of the imposition on protected speech. <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>In re Goode</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258404\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/553/#p559\">821 F.3d 553</extracted-citation>, 559 (5th Cir. 2016) (\"Whether the First Amendment has been violated is a mixed question of law and fact[.]\"); <em>Gerritsen v.

ANALYSIS</strong></p><p id=\"p-41\">The operative complaint in the instant action alleges that certain provisions of the D.C. Panhandling Control Act violate the First Amendment. As explained below, this Court concludes that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged plausible First Amendment claims upon which relief can be granted, and this is especially so in light of the overwhelming run of authority from across the country striking down similar panhandling regulations since the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Reed</em> . <em>See, e.g.</em> , <em>Norton v. City of Springfield, Ill.</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358185\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/411/#p411\">806 F.3d 411</extracted-citation>, 411-13 (7th Cir. 2015) (finding that an ordinance barring immediate requests for money is content-based and unlawful in light of <em>Reed</em> ); <em>Thayer v.

La. 2017) (explaining that \" <em>Reed</em> ... mandates strict scrutiny\" of panhandling regulations and striking down a similar ordinance). The District's Rule 12(b)(6) motion fails because Plaintiffs' complaint contains adequate allegations to support their First Amendment claims, and the District's Rule 12(b)(6) arguments relate solely to its disagreement with Plaintiffs' factual and legal assertions. This Court will not reach the merits of the parties' dispute now, nor will it conclude that Claim 1 or Claim 3 must be dismissed as duplicative, given that, as alleged, Plaintiffs appear to seek different relief with respect to each of these claims.</p><p id=\"p-42\"><strong>A. Plaintiffs Have Plausibly Alleged That The D.C. Panhandling Control Act Violates The First Amendment</strong></p><p id=\"p-43\">Plaintiffs' complaint plausibly alleges a viable First Amendment claim, for several reasons. First and foremost, with respect to the First Amendment's application to the speech at issue, Plaintiffs have alleged that \"[p]anhandling is expressive conduct that is protected [First] Amendment activity.\" (5AC at \u00b6 152.) Not only is it plausible that this is so, <em>see, e.g.</em> , <em>Norton</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4358185\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/806/411/#p411\">806 F.3d at 411-13</extracted-citation>, the District concedes as much (<em>see</em> Def.'s Mot. at 15).</p><p id=\"p-44\">In regard to the nature of the forum, Plaintiffs allege that all three of the challenged provisions of the D.C. Panhandling Control Act apply to public forums. (<em>See</em> 5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 41, 51-52, 56, 60-61, 69, 74, 82-83, 123, 163-64.) To the extent that there is a disagreement regarding this characterization as it relates to the <em>McFarlin</em> zones regulated by section 22-2302(b) (<em>compare</em> Def.'s Mot. at 17 (citing <em>McFarlin</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7860972\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/681/440/#p448\">681 A.2d at 448</extracted-citation> (holding that the above-ground areas within fifteen feet of escalator entrances to subway stations are not public forums)) <em>with</em> Pls.'

In other words, a plaintiff's allegations of fact must be accepted as true at the motion-to-dismiss stage, and Plaintiffs' contentions regarding the character of the fora to which the Act applies are not clearly precluded as a matter of law such that the complaint's \"public forum\" assertions cannot support a plausible claim upon which relief can be granted, as the District appears to acknowledge. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. at 17 (citing <em>Ellis v. District of Columbia</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1793369,3693579\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/84/1413/\">84 F.3d 1413</extracted-citation>, 1420 (D.C. Cir. 1996).))</p><p id=\"p-45\">As for the nature of the government's statutory prohibitions and its justifications for limiting speech in this manner, Plaintiffs allege that strict scrutiny applies, because the Panhandling Control Act is a content-based regulation insofar as it prohibits certain speech-i.e., immediate requests for money or things of value-in public areas, based on the message communicated. (<em>See</em> 5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 153-156.) Plaintiffs further allege that the Act cannot <em>survive</em> strict scrutiny, because the statutory restrictions are not narrowly tailored to promote a compelling governmental interest. (<em>See id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 158-62.) Specifically, the complaint contends that there are less restrictive alternatives available to the government, such as \"enforcing existing generic criminal laws already on the books in this jurisdiction or enacting new criminal laws that directly target conduct that threatens the District's asserted interests rather than employing regulations that indirectly support those interests by directly burdening protected speech.\" (<em>Id.</em> at \u00b6 161; <em>see also id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 160-62.)</p><p id=\"p-46\">It is by now well established that government regulations are content-based if they \"appl[y] to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed[,]\" <em>Reed</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12590246\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/135/2218/\">135 S.

Thus, the complaint's First Amendment claims are plainly plausible, insofar as Plaintiffs assert that the Panhandling Control Act is both subject to strict scrutiny (because it prohibits requests for immediate donations of money in various public areas and not any other speech-i.e., it is a content-based restriction), and does not satisfy strict scrutiny (because other less restrictive alternatives are available).</p><p id=\"p-47\">This conclusion should not be taken to suggest that Plaintiffs have always clearly claimed that the Panhandling Control Act is unconstitutional. To put it mildly, the complaint in this case has developed in a haphazard manner, and the opaqueness of Plaintiffs' intentions with respect to having organized the allegations into \"arrest\" and \"prosecution\" class action claims makes the instant (sixth) pleading attempt far from a model of clarity. But the Court is satisfied that Plaintiffs have provided sufficient notice to the District, by plausibly alleging that all three of the challenged sections of the Panhandling Control Act are content-based regulations that limit protected speech in public forums, and that these regulations cannot survive strict scrutiny because there are less restrictive alternatives available to the D.C. government. (<em>See, e.g.</em> , 5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 150-62.)</p><p id=\"p-48\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"126\" href=\"#p126\" id=\"p126\">*126</a><strong>B. The District's Arguments For Dismissal Are Not Relevant To The Applicable Legal Inquiry At The Motion-To-Dismiss Stage</strong></p><p id=\"p-49\">The District's arguments in support of its motion to dismiss relate primarily, if not exclusively, to its belief that Plaintiffs are mistaken because the Panhandling Control Act <em>does</em> satisfy the First Amendment as a matter of law. Indeed, the motion squarely rejects the basic factual premises of Plaintiffs' First Amendment claims-that the challenged provisions are content-based restrictions of speech in a public forum and do not survive strict scrutiny because they are not narrowly tailored to serve a compelling governmental interest-and it does so by arguing, explicitly, that the statutory provisions <em>are</em> constitutional (<em>see, e.g.</em> , Def.'s Mot. at 10), given that, <em>inter alia</em> , public transportation vehicles and Metro stations (which section 22-2302(b) covers) are \"nonpublic forums\" (<em>see</em> <em>id.</em> at 16-18); sections 22-2302(a) and (d) are \"content neutral\" restrictions (<em>see</em> <em>id.</em> at 18-22); and all three challenged provisions are \"narrowly tailored to serve compelling government interests\" (<em>see</em> <em>id.</em> at 22-26). Thus, rather than adhering to the cardinal characteristic of motions that properly test the sufficiency of the allegations of a complaint under Rule 12(b)(6), <em>see, e.g.</em> , <em>Democracy Partners v. Project Veritas Action Fund</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12522882\" index=\"82\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/285/109/#p121\">285 F. Supp. 3d 109</extracted-citation>, 121 (D.D.C. 2018) (explaining that \"[a]t [the motion-to-dismiss] stage of the proceedings, the factual allegations in the complaint must be taken as true\"), the District improperly implores the Court to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint based on a finding that Plaintiffs' allegations regarding the nature of the forum, the character of the challenged prohibitions, and the tailoring of the statutory restrictions are <em>false.</em></p><p id=\"p-50\">This Court must decline the District's invitation. It is clear beyond cavil that a defendant cannot ignore, or contradict, a complaint's factual allegations in a bid to seek its dismissal, no matter how strong the defendant's merits arguments might be. <em>See</em> <em>Fletcher v. U.S. Dep't of Justice</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4258539\" index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/17/89/#p92\">17 F.

And the District's abandonment of Rule 12(b)(6) first principles is especially egregious where, as here, the ultimate legality of a statute is based on complex and overlapping legal and factual determinations, <em>see, e.g.</em> , <em>Boardley</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3551549,3709973\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/615/508/\">615 F.3d at 519-25</extracted-citation> (demonstrating the extensiveness of this interrelated inquiry), with respect to which the District bears the burden of persuasion, <em>see</em> <em>Pursuing Am.'s Greatness v.

In time, it will have ample opportunity to meet this mark. But for now, the District may request dismissal of Plaintiffs'</p><p id=\"p-52\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"127\" href=\"#p127\" id=\"p127\">*127</a>claims only by challenging the legal <em>sufficiency</em> of Plaintiffs' pleading, as opposed to its <em>accuracy.</em> Yet, the District's arguments for dismissal of Plaintiffs' complaint are plainly and persistently aimed at the latter. (<em>See, e.g.</em> , Def.'s Mot. at 10; <em>see also</em> <em>id.</em> at 14-26; Def.'s Reply at 5-13.)</p><p id=\"p-53\">This Court need go no further. As the proponent of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), the District must demonstrate that Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, and its vigorous contention that Plaintiffs are <em>wrong</em> when they assert that the challenged provisions of the Panhandling Control Act regulate speech in public fora in a content-based fashion and are not narrowly tailored to achieve compelling government interests does no such thing.</p><p id=\"p-54\"><strong>C. At Present, It Does Not Appear That Claim 1 And Claim 3 Are Duplicative</strong></p><p id=\"p-55\">The District also suggests that, at the very least, Claim 3 should be dismissed as duplicative of Claim 1. (<em>See</em> Def.'s Mot. at 26-27; Def.s' Reply at 13-14.) This argument is not entirely baseless, because for reasons that have not yet been fully disclosed, Plaintiffs have opted to bifurcate their core constitutional claims for damages brought against the District into one claim brought by the named plaintiffs who were <em>arrested</em> pursuant to subsections 22-2302(a), (b), and (d) of Chapter 22 of the D.C. Code, (<em>see</em> 5AC at \u00b6\u00b6 172-83 (Claim 1)), and another claim brought by the named plaintiffs who were not only arrested but were also <em>prosecuted</em> for panhandling pursuant to those same sections of the D.C. Code (<em>see id.</em> at \u00b6\u00b6 196-201 (Claim 3)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> This structure is not intuitive, and may not be a model of clarity, as the Court has already expressed, but the Court is not convinced that it results in impermissible duplication of claims, and thus, both claims will be allowed to proceed, for now.</p><p id=\"p-56\">To be sure, the District is correct that a district court may exercise its discretion to dismiss claims \"that stem from identical allegations, that are decided under identical legal standards, and for which identical relief is available.\" <em>Wultz v. Islamic Rep. of Iran</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4270475\" index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/755/1/#p81\">755 F. Supp. 2d 1</extracted-citation>, 81 (D.D.C. 2010) (citation omitted); <em>see also</em> <em>DTCC Data Repository LLC v.

Supp. 3d 9</extracted-citation>, 18-19 (D.D.C. 2014). And it is true that an entirely coherent theory as to the differences between these legal claims has not yet been presented. (<em>See</em> Pls.' Opp'n at 40-41). But the Court perceives that, despite the application of identical legal standards, there could be different relief-whether injunctive relief or money damages (<em>see</em> 5AC at 30-31, \u00b6\u00b6 D, G, and H)-available for those who have been <em>prosecuted</em> for violating the alleged unconstitutional statutory provisions in contrast to those who have merely been <em>arrested</em> and detained, and any distinctions with respect to such relief might require the development of different facts related to the additional harms of prosecution and conviction. <em>See</em> <em>Steinberg v. Gray</em> , <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4185971\" index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/293/#p299\">815 F. Supp. 2d 293</extracted-citation>, 299 (D.D.C. 2011) (declining to dismiss claims as duplicative where different relief was requested). Therefore, the Court finds it premature to exercise its discretion to dismiss Claim 3 as duplicative at this time.</p><p id=\"p-57\"><a class=\"page-label\" data-citation-index=\"1\" data-label=\"128\" href=\"#p128\" id=\"p128\">*128</a><strong>IV. CONCLUSION</strong></p><p id=\"p-58\">The District would have this Court decide <em>now</em> , at the motion-to-dismiss stage, whether or not Plaintiffs are correct that the challenged provisions of the D.C. Panhandling Control Act are content-based restrictions that are subject to strict scrutiny and cannot be sustained as narrowly tailored to further compelling government interests. For the reasons explained above, the District asks too much too early in the process of this litigation. Plaintiffs have plausibly <em>alleged</em> that the panhandling provisions at issue are content-based laws that restrict protected speech in public forums, and they maintain that the District had less restrictive, alternative means of achieving its stated objectives. This is enough to state a First Amendment claim for which various forms of relief could be granted.</p><p id=\"p-59\">Accordingly, as set forth in the March 29, 2019 Order (<em>see</em> ECF No. 69), Defendant's motion to dismiss is <strong>DENIED</strong> .</p><p id=\"p-62\">Page-number citations to documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.</p><p id=\"p-63\">The statute further defines \"aggressive manner\" as \"[a]pproaching, speaking to, or following a person in a manner as would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily harm or the commission of a criminal act upon the person, or upon property in the person's immediate possession[,]\" \"[t]ouching another person without that person's consent in the course of asking for alms[,]\" \"[c]ontinuously asking, begging, or soliciting alms from a person after the person has made a negative response[,]\" or \"[i]ntentionally blocking or interfering with the safe or free passage of a person by any means, including unreasonably causing a person to take evasive action to avoid physical contact.\" <extracted-citation index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2022-2301\">D.C.
