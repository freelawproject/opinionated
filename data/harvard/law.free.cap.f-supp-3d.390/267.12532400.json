The plaintiff-counter defendant is Firemen's Insurance Company of Washington, D.C. (\"Firemen's\" or \"plaintiff\") and the defendant-counter claimant is ACE American Insurance Company (\"ACE\"). Before this Court is the motion of co-defendants Aerotek, Inc. (\"Aerotek\") and Thomas J. Story (\"Story\") to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, to transfer venue to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Parties and the Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Firemen's and ACE are insurance providers that offer various kinds of insurance to businesses, including commercial general liability insurance. Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. (\"Wegmans\"), an interested party, is a supermarket chain with numerous locations throughout New England headquartered in Rochester, New York. MP Masonry Inc. (\"MP Masonry\") is a subcontractor that provides commercial masonry services in the New England area. Aerotek is a global recruiting and staffing agency that situates employees with employers to\n   perform particular services. One of its employees was Story. Firemen's provides general liability insurance for MP Masonry under a policy that includes an \"additional insured\" endorsement to add any person or entity with which MP Masonry agrees contractually but only with respect to liability for bodily injury. ACE provides general liability insurance for Aerotek in a policy that allegedly includes Wegmans as an \"additional assured\" and affords \"insured contract\" coverage for the contractual defense and indemnity obligations owed by Aerotek to Wegmans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In February, 2012, Wegmans entered into a \"Temporary Labor Procurement Agreement\" with Aerotek (\"the Staffing Agreement\") whereby Aerotek became obligated to select and assign Aerotek employees (so-called \"Vendor Assigned Employees\") to perform services for Wegmans. In May, 2014, Wegmans entered into a \"Standard Contract for Construction\" with MP Masonry (\"the Construction Subcontract\") whereby MP Masonry agreed to perform masonry work at a Wegmans supermarket being constructed in Burlington, Massachusetts. Pursuant to the Staffing Agreement, Aerotek assigned several employees to provide construction supervision services for the project. Among those assigned employees was Story who acted as foreman for the construction project. A diagram may be worth a thousand words.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In July, 2014, Joseph Holguin (\"Holguin\"), an employee of MP Masonry, sustained serious injuries when a scaffold collapsed at the project site. He subsequently received substantial workers' compensation benefits. In August, 2015, Holguin and his wife filed claims for 1) negligence, 2) loss of consortium and 3) vicarious liability against Wegmans, Aerotek and Story. Only Wegmans and Story remain as defendants in the State Action. In that case, Wegmans has demanded that MP Masonry defend and indemnify it pursuant to an indemnification clause in the Construction Subcontract. Firemen's asserts that, on behalf of its insured (MP Masonry), it has paid over $78,000 in defense costs incurred thus far by Wegmans in the State Action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B. The Relevant Contractual Provisions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Staffing Agreement defines the relationship between Aerotek's assigned employees and Wegmans as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   [T]he relationship between both [Aerotek] and each of its Vendor Assigned Employees, respectively, vis-\u00e0-vis Wegmans hereunder is that of an independent contractor, and nothing set forth herein shall be deemed to render the parties as joint venturers, partners or employer and employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The Staffing Agreement also requires Aerotek to maintain commercial general liability insurance that names Wegmans as\n   an additional insured and obligates Aerotek to defend and indemnify Wegmans and its agents against any claims related to services provided under the agreement. Finally, the Staffing Agreement contains the following forum-selection clause:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [W]ith respect to any matter arising under this Agreement, the parties specifically consent and agree that the courts of the State of New York and/or the Federal Courts located in the State of New York will have exclusive jurisdiction over each of the parties and over the subject matter of any such proceedings, and that the venue of any such action will be in Monroe County, New York and/or the U.S. District Courts for the Western District of New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Similarly, the Construction Subcontract requires MP Masonry to maintain general liability insurance protecting itself and Wegmans as an additional insured against claims for bodily injury arising from services performed under the contract. The Construction Subcontract also obligates MP Masonry to defend and indemnify Wegmans and its agents, employees and representatives against all such claims. Finally, the Construction Subcontract provides that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [MP Masonry] hereby voluntarily and irrevocably submits itself to the jurisdiction and venue of any court of competent jurisdiction over the subject matter of this Agreement located within the State of New York ... [and] [a]ny litigation brought by [MP Masonry] based on or arising out of this Agreement shall be brought only in the Supreme Court of the State of New York sitting in Monroe County or in any Federal District Court in the City of Rochester, New York.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Procedural History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   In January, 2019, Firemen's filed this action for declaratory relief pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202201\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in an effort to recover from ACE, Aerotek and/or Story portions of the costs Firemen's incurred in the State Action. Specifically, Firemen's seeks declaratory judgments that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   1) Story does not qualify as an \"insured\" or \"additional insured\" under the Firemen's policy and thus Firemen's has no duty to defend or indemnify Story in the underlying State Action (Count I);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   2) Story is not an intended beneficiary of the contractual defense and indemnity obligations owed by MP Masonry to Wegmans under the terms of the Construction Subcontract and thus cannot seek to enforce those contractual obligations (Count II);\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   3) due to Wegman's status as an \"additional insured\" under the ACE policy, ACE must reimburse Firemen's for one half of any defense or indemnity costs that Firemen's has incurred or may be required to pay on behalf of Wegmans (Count III); and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   4) the contractual defense and indemnification obligations owed by Aerotek to Wegmans are covered by the ACE policy and that ACE be required to reimburse Firemen's for any defense or indemnity costs incurred by Firemen's or that it may be required to pay on behalf of Wegmans (Count V).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In addition to that declaratory relief, Firemen's also seeks monetary damages from Aerotek for the amount of defense and/or indemnity costs that Firemen's has incurred or may be required to pay on behalf of Wegmans (Count IV) as well as monetary damages from ACE to the extent that ACE fails to satisfy its declared obligations in Counts III and V.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   ACE has filed an answer to the complaint and counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments that ACE has no primary defense or coverage obligations to Wegmans under either the \"additional insured-designated person or organization\" or the \"additional insured where required by written contract\" endorsements in its policy and therefore owes no obligations to Firemen's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In March, 2019, defendants Aerotek and Story filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or, in the alternative, to transfer the case to the United States District Court for the Western District of New York. They submit that all of Firemen's claims arise out of and relate to the Staffing Agreement and the Construction Subcontract because each of those claims requires this Court to interpret and enforce the rights of the various parties under those agreements. Aerotek and Story therefore declare that Firemen's is bound by the mandatory forum-selection clauses contained therein and that this Court must either dismiss those claims or transfer this case to the pre-selected forum.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Firemen's concedes that the subject contracts contain valid forum-selection clauses but asserts that such clauses do not apply to four of its five claims which do not arise out of the contracts. With respect to Counts I and II against Story, Firemen's contends that it was not a party to the Construction Subcontract between Wegmans and MP Masonry and thus its claims against those parties are not subject to the forum-selection clause. Similarly, as to Counts III and V against ACE, Firemen's asserts that ACE was not a party to the Staffing Agreement between Wegmans and Aerotek and thus the forum-selection clause does not apply to Firemen's claims against ACE. Firemen's admits that Count IV against Aerotek for damages arises out of the Staffing Agreement between Wegmans and Aerotek such that the forum-selection clause of that contract applies but submits that to transfer only that one claim would be unreasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n    <em>\n     Motion to Transfer Pursuant to a Forum-Selection Clause\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Application\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Firemen's does not contest that the Staffing Agreement and the Construction Subcontract both contain a valid forum-selection clause or that those clauses are mandatory. The Court independently concludes that those provisions contain mandatory language requiring that any claim arising out of those contracts be brought in a New York state court or in the federal court in the Western District of New York (\"any such action will be in ...\" and \"[a]ny litigation ... shall be brought only in ...\"). Rather, plaintiff argues that four of its five claims do not arise out of those contracts because neither Firemen's nor ACE was a party to them. Plaintiff suggests that for a non-party to be bound by a forum-selection clause, it must have gained some direct benefit from the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The language in the relevant caselaw is not, however, that restrictive. Rather, a non-party may be bound by a forum-selection clause where that party is closely related to the\n   <em>\n    dispute\n   </em>\n   such that it becomes foreseeable that it will be bound.\n   <em>\n    Hugel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11953257\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/206/#p209\">\n    999 F.2d at 209\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, at least one court has specifically rejected the argument that a non-party must be a third-party beneficiary to the contract in order to be bound by a forum-selection clause.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11953257\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/999/206/#p209\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 209 n.7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   It was certainly foreseeable that both Firemen's and ACE (both of which provided general liability insurance to Wegmans via the contracts between Wegmans and their respective insureds) might have to indemnify Wegmans by virtue of the Construction Subcontract and the Staffing Agreement. The contractual relationship between Firemen's and MP Masonry and ACE and Aerotek respectively renders the insurance companies closely related to the present dispute because plaintiff's claims relate directly to the defense and indemnification obligations allegedly owed to Wegmans under the Construction Subcontract and the Staffing Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Moreover, all of Firemen's claims arise out of the two agreements. In Count I, plaintiff requests a declaration that Story does not qualify as an \"insured\" or \"additional insured\" under the policy issued to MP Masonry. In that count, Firemen's asserts that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   [t]here is no written contract or agreement obligating MP Masonry to have purported employees or agents of Wegmans (as opposed to Wegmans, itself) added as \"additional insureds\" to MP Masonry's insurance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   To make that determination, however, the Court will need to interpret the Construction Subcontract between Wegmans and MP Masonry which defines who qualifies as an additional insured under the contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Similarly, as to Count II, Firemen's requests a declaration that Story is not an intended beneficiary of the indemnification provision in the Construction Subcontract between Wegmans and MP Masonry and thus cannot enforce that provision. To resolve that issue, the Court will need to interpret and enforce provisions of both the Construction Subcontract (to determine whether Story is an agent, employee or representative of Wegmans under the indemnification provision) and the Staffing Agreement (to determine the intended relationship between Story and Wegmans under the description of \"Vendor Assignment\n   Employees\"). Both of those counts of the complaint \"arise\" from the contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Furthermore, in Counts III and V, Firemen's seeks declarations respectively that 1) Wegmans qualifies as an \"additional insured\" under the ACE policy and 2) the ACE policy affords \"insured contract\" coverage for the contractual defense and indemnification obligations owed by Aerotek to Wegmans under the Staffing Agreement. Firemen's contends that Wegmans was entitled to coverage under the ACE policy as an \"additional assured\" pursuant to the Staffing Agreement with Aerotek which defines the scope of the coverage and kind of insurance policy to which Wegmans is entitled as an \"additional insured\". A determination of the extent to which ACE must provide coverage to Wegmans (as either a \"primary\" insurer or through \"excess\" coverage) therefore requires an interpretation of the Staffing Agreement such that both of those counts \"arise\" from the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, plaintiff concedes that Count IV of the complaint seeking an award of damages for contractual defense and indemnification obligations owed by Aerotek to Wegmans arises out of the Staffing Agreement and is thus subject to that agreement's forum-selection clause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Plaintiff has not even argued that the forum-selection clauses in the subject contracts are unenforceable based on public-interest factors or that enforcement thereof would be unreasonable under the circumstances, let alone made a strong showing to that effect.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Atl.
