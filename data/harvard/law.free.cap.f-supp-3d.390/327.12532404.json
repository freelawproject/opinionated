A party opposing a motion for summary judgment must \"admit, deny, or qualify the facts supporting the motion for summary judgment by reference to each numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of facts.\" Loc. Rule 56(c). Facts which are properly supported \"shall be deemed admitted unless properly controverted.\" Loc. Rule 56(e) ;\n    <em>\n     P.R. Am. Ins. Co. v.
