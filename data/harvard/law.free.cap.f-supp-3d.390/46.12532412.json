However, to the extent that Amtrak is correct that the RLA preempts or precludes the plaintiff's race and gender discrimination claims, or at least renders some evidence regarding those claims inadmissible, harm would result from the Court's denial of reconsideration because the Court's decision in its July 10, 2018 Memorandum Opinion would conflict with established principles of law.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Univ. of Colo.
