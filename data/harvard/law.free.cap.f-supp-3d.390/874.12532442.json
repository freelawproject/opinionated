CRENSHAW, JR., CHIEF UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In these three consolidated actions,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants have filed a Motion for Summary Judgment on all of Plaintiffs' claims. (Case Nos. 2:17-cv-00079, Doc. No. 40; 2:17-cv-00080, Doc. No. 50; 2:18-cv-00022, Doc. No. 35). Those Motions have been fully briefed by the parties and, for the reasons that follow, will be granted with respect to Plaintiffs' federal claims, but the Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over their state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Just looking at Plaintiffs' counter-statement of facts, one might guess that this is a complicated class action, or a multi-district litigation (MDL) case. It is not. It is a case about three former employees of the City of Algood (\"Algood\" or \"City\"), Tennessee who claim they were unlawfully discharged. Nevertheless, and for reasons that could probably never be adequately explained, Plaintiffs have filed a 78-page, 438-paragraph Statement of Undisputed Facts (Doc. No. 79).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This Court's Local Rules provide that, in response to a motion for summary judgment and its accompanying statement of facts, \"the non-movant's response may contain a concise statement of any additional facts that the non-movant contends are material and as to which the non-movant contends there exists a genuine issue to be tried.\" L.R. 56.01(c). Despite Plaintiffs' claims to the contrary,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   the facts they\n   present are not concise, some are not additional, and many are simply not material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The first 12 pages and 66 paragraphs of Plaintiffs' statement consist of what can only be characterized as a lengthy summary of Justin Medlin's deposition testimony. This is followed by a 12-page, 71-paragraph summary of Vaughn Larson's deposition testimony, and then a 4 \u00bd-page, 40-paragraph summary of Karen Bohannon's deposition testimony. Next, the statement turns its attention to the individual Defendants' deposition testimony with 9 pages and 56 paragraphs devoted to Gary Harris, and then a 12 \u00bd-page 62-paragraph summary of Scott Bilbrey's testimony. This is followed by 72 pages consisting of 108 paragraphs that primarily summarize Keith Morrison's deposition testimony, but also includes excerpts from Algood's handbook, and the entirety of a letter from Plaintiffs' counsel that Morrison received from the City Attorney. The remaining 5 pages and 18 paragraphs are devoted to recounting a press conference where Plaintiffs' terminations\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   were announced, including setting forth verbatim a news story published February 24, 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As can be expected when \"factual\" statements are based almost exclusively upon deposition testimony, many of the statements are nothing more than opinions, beliefs and speculations. Other statements contain interpretations of law, masquerading as facts. None of this is proper, nor helpful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   No doubt, somewhere within Plaintiffs' colossal filing are actual, disputed facts that support their respective positions, but it is not the Court's duty to sift through that filing to determine what those may be.\n   <em>\n    See,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Emerson v.

June 14, 2019) (internal citation omitted) (explaining that, in considering the record, a court is \"not like a boar 'hunting for truffles,' ... or a gold prospector looking for nuggets\"). Instead, in determining whether genuine disputed material facts exist, the Court needs to know the time, not how to build a clock, and certainly not one the size of Big Ben.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court has reviewed all of the filings including Plaintiffs' Statement of Facts (\"PSOF\") and Defendants' responses thereto (Doc, No. 83) and Defendants' Statement of Facts (\"DSOF\") and Plaintiffs' responses thereto (Doc. No. 77). From those filings and based on the record as a whole, the following appear to be the relevant facts:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Medlin, Larson, and Bohannon all worked for the City of Algood. Medlin was a police officer and most recently a Detective Sergeant. Larson had dual roles, working as both the City Recorder and City Clerk. Bohannon worked for the Public Works Department as a water meter reader. (PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 47, 145, 319).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants, too, worked for the City. Gary Harris was a police officer who eventually became Chief of Police; Scott Bilbrey was the Mayor, and Keith Morrison was the City Manager. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 33, 35, 236).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In all, the City has approximately 30 employees, of whom a dozen or so work on the police force. (Doc. No. 78-1 Medlin\n   Depo. at 115). There are no contracts of employment, and the City Handbook explicitly states that it does not create any contractual rights. (DSOF \u00b6 5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During his employment with the City, Medlin spoke with Bohannon in person and via cell phone. Some of those conversations occurred while they were on duty. He also texted both Bohannon and Larson and sent sexually explicit images of his anatomy to both women, including pictures of his penis. (PSOF \u00b6 11). Medlin also used his cell phone to receive and store sexually explicit picture and messages that he received from Larson and Bohannon. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 3, 4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The parties dispute who owned the cell phone, with Defendants claiming it belonged to the City. Medlin asserts the cell phone was given to him by Harris after Harris purchased it from the City, and it was Medlin's belief that he could do with it as he pleased. (PSOF \u00b6 12). Regardless, it is undisputed that the City paid for the cellular service that Medlin used. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 15, 16).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Medlin's relationship with Bohannon and Larson extended beyond these sexually-charged conversations and electronic communications. He had a sexual relationship with both women. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10, 7). The sexual activity with Larson occurred off-duty. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 88). With Bohannon, the location and time of such activity was not so limited and discrete, as they had sexual relations several time at work while both were on duty and, at least one time, at City Hall. (PSOF \u00b6 10). In addition to those two women, Medlin sent sexually explicit texts and photos to at least four other women while he was on duty as an Algood police officer. (Doc. No. 55-1, Medlin Depo. at 22-24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   At some point, Harris received a complaint from his cousin, Tammy Sheldon, regarding a sexually explicit picture Medlin had sent her via Facebook. (PSOF \u00b6 204). On January 11, 2017, Medlin was summoned to a meeting with Harris, during which Harris told him that he had received a complaint and showed Medlin the picture. Harris also said that he had spoken with Morrison who instructed Harris to send Medlin home. (Doc. No. 78-1, Medlin Depo. at 72). At that time, Medlin was placed on paid leave pending an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   As the investigation unfolded, Medlin hired a lawyer and requested a hearing. The City agreed to that request and scheduled a pre-termination hearing. (DSOF \u00b6 9). However, on February 10, 2017, immediately before the hearing, Medlin submitted a resignation letter addressed to the City Attorney, and the hearing was cancelled. (PSOF \u00b6 3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Medlin claims he resigned because he \"felt like he had to ... get the benefits he would otherwise not be entitled to if he had been terminated,\" including pay for accrued leave time. (PSOF \u00b6 23). Medlin also believed that any hearing would be a mere formality because he would be fired no matter what he said. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 24). This belief apparently stemmed from the fact that, while Medlin had supported Harris' bid to become police chief, the two had since had a falling-out. In fact, Harris vowed to \"get rid\" of Medlin because Medlin was too close to City Council, and Harris believed that Medlin was responsible for an investigation into the alleged fixing of traffic tickets by Harris. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 25).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After Medlin's resignation, Bilbrey confronted Larson and Bohannon separately on February 21, 2017. Bilbrey met with Larson in her office and told her that \"sexting messages\" involving Medlin were going to be released to the public, the City had copies of those messages, and that anybody involved in the situation would be terminated. Larson asked to be presented\n   with proof supporting the allegations, and Bilbrey gave her printed copies of the messages that she and Medlin had exchanged. At the conclusion of the meeting, Bilbrey told Larson that she was terminated. The City Council ratified Larson's termination on March 14, 2017. (PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 101, 102; DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 20-23)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   A similar scenario played out in relation to Bohannon. Bilbrey met with her in her office at City Hall, informed her that Medlin had exchanged and stored inappropriate sexually explicit messages on his phone, told her that she was one of the individuals involved, and handed her printed copies of the messages that she had exchanged with Medlin. Bilbrey told Bohannon that she was terminated and that she should collect her things and leave. Bohannon complied. (PSOF 162-171; DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 13-14).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Bilbrey held a press conference and announced the investigation and its results.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This was a first for Bilbrey, as he had never before held a press conference in relation to the termination of an Algood employee. (PSOF \u00b6 54).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   During the press conference, Bilbrey stated that he would have fired Medlin had he not resigned and, while he did not mention either Larson or Bohannon, he stated that the City Clerk and a meter reader were fired. According to Plaintiffs, Bilbrey also made several false statements during the press conference, among them that (1) Medlin was colluding with city council members to oust Harris and appoint another person as chief; (2) certain police officers had been improperly fraternizing with council members; (3) Medlin had been involved with 10,000 women; (4) Medlin had affairs with married women; and (5) thousands of images were exchanged during the course of the \"sexting\" scandal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (PSOF \u00b6 53, 55-57; Doc. No. 80 at 16). The press conference was covered by the local media, including News Talk 94.1, which published an internet story about the press conference the next day. In it, the article quoted Bilbrey as saying Medlin had sexual relationships with multiple women, including two city employees and a city council woman, the investigation involved the use of a \"city-owned cell phone;\" that Harris had been the target of some sort of conspiracy involving city council members, and that Bilbrey believed \"there was wrongdoing done and a deliberate misuse of city devices.\" (PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 423-427).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Neither Larson nor Bohannon requested a hearing in relation to their termination. Nor did any of the Plaintiffs file a grievance. (DSOF \u00b6\u00b6 14-21). Instead, they filed separate lawsuits alleging primarily the same federal and state law claims. All allege that they were denied procedural and\n   substantive due process in accordance the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   They also allege violations of their First Amendment right to free speech and association. They also bring state law claims for false light invasion of privacy, and the intentional infliction of emotional distress. Finally, Medlin brings an additional claim for constructive discharge in violation of the Public Employee Political Freedom Act of 1980, Tenn. Code.

This Court, of course, has followed suit and declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over GTLA claims once the federal claims were dismissed.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    P.G. by &amp; through R.G. v. Rutherford Cty. Bd. of Educ.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12525538\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/313/891/#p906\">\n    313 F.

Given this, it would make little sense to retain Medlin's state law claims against the other Defendants and have the parties potentially battle on two fronts, or, for that matter, retain the other Plaintiffs'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   state law claims against all of the Defendants, given that they all arise from a common set of facts and allege the same violations of state law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    V.\n    <em>\n     Conclusion\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, Defendants' Motions for Summary Judgment (Case Nos. 2:17-cv-00079, Doc. No. 40; 2:17-cv-00080, Doc. No. 50; 2:18-cv-00022, Doc. No. 35) will be granted with respect to Plaintiffs' federal claims. The Court will decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Plaintiffs' state law claim and they will be dismissed without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   An appropriate Order will enter.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    Although virtually the same filings have been made in each case,\n    <em>\n     Medlin v. City of Algood\n     <em>\n      et al.\n     </em>\n    </em>\n    , No. 2:17-cv-00080 has been designated as the lead case. Therefore, the Court will cite to that docket sheet when referring to the underlying record.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    Plaintiffs acknowledge that the statement is \"extremely long,\" but claim it is \"concise\" because \"it attempts to encapsulate three separate cases\" and \"involves multiple federal and state law claims[.]\" (Doc. No. 79 at 1, n.1).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    For simplicity, the Court refers to all three Plaintiffs as having been terminated from their employment, even though Medlin resigned. He claims to have been constructively discharged, which is an issue that the Court need not decide because, even if true, he has failed to establish a viable federal claim.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    Prior to the press conference, Bilbrey was interviewed by the Cookeville\n    <em>\n     Herald Citizen\n    </em>\n    , a newspaper, during which he previewed what was to be addressed at the upcoming conference, and invited the public to attend. Bilbrey also sent an email to City employees announcing the press conference, stating that he was going to make the Algood's \"sexting scandal\" public, asserting that the conduct of the individuals involved was \"immoral and unethical,\" and claiming that \"city owned devices\" were used \"that citizens bear the burden of expense for.\" (PSOF \u00b6\u00b6 420-422, 434-437).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    As support for what occurred at the press conference, Plaintiffs rely primarily on their own deposition testimony, even though none of them attended it. For example, Medlin stated in his deposition that he was relying on \"whatever is on the Internet\" as the foundation for his claim that Bilbrey said something about 10,000 women. (Doc. No. 78-1, Medlin Depo. at 117). Nevertheless, Defendants concede the statements Bilbrey is alleged to have made for purposes of the summary judgment motions.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    They also allege denial of due process under the Fifth Amendment, but that Amendment only applies to actions by the federal government.\n    <em>\n     Pub.
