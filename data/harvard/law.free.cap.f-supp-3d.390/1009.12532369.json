The Project involved the construction of over 17,200 feet of pipeline, with pipe sizes ranging from 16, 24, 30, 36, 48, and 54 inches in diameter. In May 2013, Sunwestern conducted a pressure-test of the pipeline when several flanges (connections between pipe sections that include bolts and gaskets) came apart (the \"Incident\"). Although 10,000 feet of pipeline was previously pressure tested and accepted by the City, during the May 2013 test, the 48 and 54-inch pipes began to leak. The flange failure caused water to tear out gaskets (seals which fill the space between pipes to prevent leakage), seriously damaging the pipeline, components of the pipeline, and surrounding areas.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Although repairs on those damaged items were still necessary, the City terminated its contract with Sunwestern on November\n   21, 2013 and opted to complete necessary repairs with a new contractor. The City later claimed that Sunwestern had caused approximately $4,000,000.00 in damages. At this time, Sunwestern was covered by two separate polices from Cincinnati Indemnity Company (\"Cincinnati\"): a commercial general liability policy (the \"CGL Policy\") and an umbrella policy (the \"UMB Policy\"). Sunwestern also secured a performance bond for $4,852,050.25, the full amount of the contract it had with the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In January 2014, the City contacted Cincinnati and demanded that Cincinnati cover its claims. Cincinnati investigated the Incident in April 2014 and denied coverage on October 28, 2014, claiming that the Incident did not constitute an \"occurrence.\" (Doc. 59-7, pg. 2-13). The City later successfully made a claim against Sunwestern's performance bond for approximately $2,600,000.00. (Doc. 61-6, pg. 18). Sunwestern claims that Cincinnati improperly denied coverage. Cincinnati claims that Sunwestern is not entitled to coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Legal Standard\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Summary judgment is appropriate when, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, 'there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact.' \"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Sunwestern claims that the Incident occurred due to the City's engineering deficiencies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 60, pg. 3) (\"Sunwestern's position was that Tucson Water's engineering deficiency caused the problem, as it did not establish proper torque values for the bolts, and the red rubber gaskets it selected, were not adequate for the larger pipes.\"); (Doc. 58, pg. 12) (The City's position is that Sunwestern's \"improper torqueing of bolts\" led to the flange failures). There is no dispute that the Incident resulted from the inadequate installation of\n   pipe components. Whether that inadequate installation was due to the City's improper engineering or Sunwestern's own improper construction is immaterial for purposes of this summary judgment motion. Ultimately, the work was faulty and will be treated as such.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As has been previously noted, Sunwestern was covered by two separate policies during the time of the Incident: the CGL Policy and the UMB Policy. The Court will first address coverage under the CGL Policy, then address coverage under the UMB Policy in a separate section.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the type of damages covered, the CGL Policy provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   We will pay those sums that the insured becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" to which this insurance applies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   This insurance applies to \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" only if: (1) The \"bodily injury\" or \"property damage\" is caused by an \"occurrence.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Property damage\" is defined as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   a.

All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   b. Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically injured. All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur at the time of the \"occurrence\" that caused it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   \"Occurrence\" is defined as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   An accident, including continuous or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   (Doc. 59-1, pg. 20).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    1. Was There an Occurrence?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The threshold question is whether the Incident constitutes an occurrence as defined by the CGL Policy. If the Incident was not an occurrence, the Court need not analyze further since the CGL Policy only provides coverage for \"occurrences.\" Arizona courts have previously held that faulty workmanship, standing alone, is not an occurrence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Corp. v. Advance Roofing &amp; Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537883\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/163/476/\">\n    163 Ariz. 476\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537883\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/163/476/\">\n    788 P.2d 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1233 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1989) (\"In our opinion, the better reasoned authorities hold that mere faulty workmanship, standing alone, cannot constitute an occurrence as defined in the policy, nor would the cost of repairing the defect constitute property damages.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   However, subsequent cases note the \"distinction between faulty workmanship standing alone and faulty workmanship that causes damage to property.\"\n   <em>\n    Lennar Corp. v.

Ct. App. 2011). Therefore, the relevant inquiry is whether the Incident was faulty workmanship, standing alone, or whether it was faulty workmanship that resulted in property damage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The Court finds it helpful to provide an illustrative example. Company X builds a home but installs the roof shingles in a careless manner. The roof eventually begins to leak, causing water damage to the house's wood flooring. Since the faultily constructed roof caused property damage (water damage to the floor), that incident is an occurrence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4057752\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/227/238/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"Thus, the damage caused by the faulty work, not the faulty work itself, constituted an occurrence, and where no property damage was alleged as a result of the faulty work, there was no occurrence.\"). If the roof was faultily constructed, but never began to leak and never caused damage to the floor, it would not be an occurrence because\n   \"faulty workmanship, standing alone, cannot constitute an occurrence.\"\n   <em>\n    Advance Roofing &amp; Supply Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1537883\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/163/476/\">\n    788 P.2d at 1233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Cincinnati maintains throughout its briefing that the Incident does not constitute an occurrence because the \"damages claimed by the City related only to the cost of repairing and completing faulty work performed by Sunwestern. There was no claim for damage to 'other property' or for damage to other portions of the Project built by others. Thus, there was no 'occurrence' and, if there were, the 'your work' exclusion would apply defeating coverage.\" (Doc. 58, pg. 9);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 72, pg. 7) (\"Here, it is undisputed that the damages claimed by the City relate only to the cost of repairing faulty work performed by Sunwestern, and completing Sunwestern's unfinished work. There was no claim for damage to 'other property' or for damage to other portions of the Project built by others. Thus, there was no 'occurrence' under Sunwestern's CGL or UMB policies.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Cincinnati's argument fails. The relevant inquiry is not whether there was damage to \"other property\" or damage to \"other portions of the Project built by others.\" The relevant inquiry is whether Sunwestern's faulty workmanship resulted in property damage - and it is uncontroverted that it did. Like Company X's faulty roof leading to water damage to the floor, here, improper installation of pipe components led to damage to the pipeline and surrounding areas. The record establishes that flanges - the connections between sections of pipe including bolts and gaskets - were improperly installed.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 61, pg. 4) (\"When Sunwestern tested the lines and started bringing up the water pressure, several flanges [pipe connections] came apart. Flanges are the connections between the sections of pipe and include the bolts and gaskets.\"). Those flanges later failed, causing \"damaged gaskets, damaged pipe bedding, and water infiltration. When a gasket would fail, the water in the pipeline would drain into the trench. The water would have to be pumped out and the bedding would need to be replaced.\" (Doc. 61-6, pg. 47). Even Cincinnati acknowledges that the damage caused by the improperly installed flanges was not limited to the flanges itself.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 59, pg. 2) (\"There was damage to the pipes, flanges, pipe trenches, and pipe bedding, but no damage to property other than the Project.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   This is not a situation where Sunwestern is solely seeking to recover the cost of repairing its own defective work. Sunwestern has made a showing that serious property damage resulted from its defective work and consequential property damage resulting from faulty work is an occurrence under the CGL Policy.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Double AA Builders, Ltd. v. Preferred Contractors Insurance Company, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310322\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/304/\">\n    241 Ariz. 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12310322\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/241/304/\">\n    386 P.3d 1277\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1279 (Ariz.

Because Double AA does not seek to recover for damage resulting from the defective work, the 'your work' exclusion bars Double AA's recovery unless the 'subcontractor exception' to the exclusion applies.\");\n   <em>\n    Lennar Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3998978\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ariz/214/255/\">\n    151 P.3d at 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"In this case, however, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Advance Roofing\n   </em>\n   , the Pinnacle Hill plaintiffs alleged damage resulting at least in part from faulty workmanship, including cracks in the walls, baseboard separation, and floor tile grout cracks and separation ... The Pinnacle Hill plaintiffs, therefore, do not claim faulty work alone; they also claim that property damage resulted from the faulty work. This is sufficient to allege an occurrence under the policies at issue.\"). The\n   Court finds that the Incident is an occurrence under the CGL Policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <em>\n    2. Are There Any Applicable Exclusions in the CGL Policy?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Although the Incident is an \"occurrence,\" coverage may still be precluded based upon any applicable policy exclusions. Cincinnati alleges that exclusions j(5), j(6), and (l) apply to defeat coverage. Sunwestern alleges that those exclusions, when read together, create an ambiguity, and that \"[a]ny ambiguity should be read strictly in Sunwestern's favor.\" (Doc. 60, pg. 8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Exclusion j of the CGL Policy precludes \"Property damage\" to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (5) That particular part of real property on which you or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are performing operations, if the \"property damage\" arises out of those operations;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (6) That particular part of any property that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \"your work\" was incorrectly performed on it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   Paragraph (6) of this exclusion does not apply to \"property damage\" included in the \"products-completed operations hazard\".\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   \"Your work\" is defined as:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (1) Work or operations performed by you or on your behalf; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (2) Materials, parts or equipment furnished in connection with such work or operations.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   (Doc. 59-1, pg. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <em>\n    A. Exclusion j(6)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Exclusion j(6) precludes coverage for incorrectly performed work. However, exclusion j(6) also includes its own exclusion - the products-completed operations hazard. Exclusion j(6) does not apply to property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard, which is defined in the CGL Policy as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   \"Products-completed operations hazard\": a. Includes all \"bodily injury\" and \"property damage\" occurring away from premises you own or rent and arising out of \"your product\" or \"your work\" except:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   (1) Products that are still in your physical possession; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (2) Work that has not yet been completed or abandoned.

The Court agrees. Exclusion j(6) explicitly precludes coverage\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   for incorrectly performed work that has not been completed. Therefore, if Sunwestern completed the Project, exclusion j(6) would not apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   It is important to note that the damage excluded by j(6) appears to be limited only to the faulty work itself and does not exclude damage to non-defective property resulting from faulty workmanship. Specifically, j(6) excludes: \"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     That particular part of any property\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   that must be restored, repaired or replaced because \"your work\" was incorrectly performed on\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     it\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (emphasis added). The exclusion is limited in scope only to specific property that must be fixed because faulty work was incorrectly performed on\n   <em>\n    it.\n   </em>\n   Exclusion j(6) does not exclude coverage for property damage for non-defective property that results from faulty workmanship.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Desert Mountain Properties Ltd.

Although both parties reference exclusion j(5) in their briefings, neither party provides a particularly meaningful analysis of its applicability. In addressing exclusion j(5), Sunwestern claims: \"The damage here was\n   to personal property (piping, flanges and gaskets), not real property. Tucson Water does not own all the real property upon which the Tucson Water Project was built (SOF at \u00b6114(c)).\" (Doc. 73, pg. 7);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 60, pg. 12) (\"This claim relates to the damage to personal property, such as the piping, flanges and gaskets. The CGL policy does not define real property. Nor did Tucson Water own all the real property (SOF at \u00b6114(c)).\"). Cincinnati merely recites the text of exclusion j(5) and writes: \"The damages the City later sought from Sunwestern was for the cost to repair, replace, and complete the work called for under Sunwestern's contract. Therefore, paragraph (5) of the 'Damage to Property' exclusion applies.\" (Doc. 69, pg. 12).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Sunwestern lodges no objection to j(5) based upon an ambiguity in the CGL Policy, rather, Sunwestern denies exclusion j(5) applies because it specifically excludes coverage for property damage to \"real property\" as opposed to \"personal property\". Sunwestern contends that the damage that occurred was limited to \"personal property (piping, flanges and gaskets), not real property.\" (Doc. 73, pg. 7). The CGL Policy clearly makes a distinction between \"real property\" and \"personal property.\" For example, exclusion j(4) precludes coverage specifically for \"[p]ersonal property in the care, custody or control of an insured.\" (Doc. 59-1, pg. 24).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although the CGL Policy makes a clear distinction between \"personal property\" and \"real property,\" it neglects to provide a definition for either term. In Arizona, undefined words in an insurance contract are defined in the common-sense terms of the average layman rather than in technical terms.\n   <em>\n    Malanga v. Royal Indem.

The word \"real\" in \"real property\" evokes a comparison to the term \"real estate.\" With that phrase in mind, the Court construes the common-sense definition of \"real property\" to encompass land and any buildings or permanent fixtures erected upon that land, such as a house. In most ordinary residential real estate transactions, a buyer purchases a home, the fixtures in that home, and the land on which the home is located. What the buyer does not purchase is the previous owner's personal property, such as: electronics, furniture, vehicles, etc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In that same manner, Black's Law Dictionary defines real property as: \"[l]and and anything growing on, attached to, or erected on it, excluding anything that may be severed without injury to the land. Real property can be either corporeal (soil and buildings) or incorporeal (easements).\"\n   <em>\n    Property\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014). Therefore, the Court construes the phrase \"real property\" in exclusion j(5) as encompassing the pipeline, including the internal components (flanges and gaskets) since the common-sense understanding of the phrase \"real property\" refers to the actual land and structures affixed to that land.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   This interpretation is supported by the text in an endorsement to the CGL Policy which discusses \"real property\" and \"personal property\" and provides, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   If the Commercial Property Coverage Part or the Farm Property Coverage Form provides coverage for:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   1.

Extrapolating this definition to exclusion j(5), \"real property\" includes the pipeline and all components, i.e. the physical structure and all fixtures, and the land encompassing the pipeline; and \"personal property\" includes Sunwestern's: tools, construction machinery, heavy-duty construction vehicles, spare parts not affixed to the pipeline, and other miscellaneous inventory. Based on the information provided, the property damage caused by the Incident is damage to real property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Although Arizona courts have not specifically interpreted exclusion j(5), courts in other jurisdictions have, and tend to favor exclusion.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bradfield v.

More specifically, the Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   The Lukes maintain that there is a fatal ambiguity between Exclusion j(6) and [exclusion (l) ]. They interpret the provision stating that Exclusion j(6) \"does not apply to 'property damage' included in the 'products-completed operations hazard,' \" to mean that property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard is covered by the Policy. They therefore insist that [exclusion (l) ], which excludes coverage for certain property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard, directly contradicts that provision. In interpreting the exception to Exclusion j(6), the Court is not at liberty to add words that were omitted from the policy. The exception merely states that Exclusion j(6) does not apply to property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard. It does not say that property damage included in the products-completed operations hazard is therefore covered by the Policy.

Are There Any Applicable Exclusions in the UMB Policy?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As a threshold matter, the UMB Policy includes a provision identical to exclusion (l) in the CGL Policy in section I(B)(7) (\"exclusion (7)\"). (Doc. 59-2, pg. 7). For the reasons articulated above, exclusion (7) in the UMB Policy precludes property damage for Sunwestern's work that is included within the products-completed operations hazard, i.e. work that has been completed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The only remaining question is whether the UMB Policy includes an exclusion that precludes coverage for property damage to incomplete work. The UMB Policy has one such exclusion: exclusion (A)(1)(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Exclusion (A)(1)(b) excludes \"property damage\" to:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Property being transported, installed, erected, or worked upon by the insured or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on any insured's behalf.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   (Doc 59-3, pg. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   Sunwestern itself concedes that this exclusion encompasses property damage that occurs while work is still in progress and writes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   Sunwestern was unable to located [sic] any case law interpreting that provision. The above provision, however, addresses property damage occurring while work is occurring. It addresses property \"being\" transported, installed, etc. It does not address accidents or damages occurring after the work or part of the work has been installed. In this case, the accidents occurred after Sunwestern had installed the pipeline, gaskets, and flanges and during testing. The flanges were not \"being worked upon\". That provision must be read strictly against the insurer, as it is an exclusion. \"Nothing within that exclusion explicitly limits coverage to repairs needed after the work fails.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   (Doc. 60, pg. 13).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Sunwestern repeats that argument, nearly verbatim, in its Response (Doc. 67) and Reply (Doc. 73). Exclusion (A)(1)(b) unambiguously precludes \"property damage\" to property that is being actively worked on. While the Court agrees that it does not apply to work that has already been completed, even if the Project was \"completed,\" as has been previously discussed, exclusion (7) of the UMB Policy would preclude coverage. Alternatively, the UMB Policy contains an additional exclusion in section I(B)(5) (\"exclusion (5)\") that also operates to preclude coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Specifically, exclusion (5) precludes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   \"Property damage\" to property owned by any insured, including any costs or expenses incurred by you, or any other person, organization or entity, for repair, replacement, enhancement, restoration or maintenance of such property for any reason, including prevention of injury to a person or damage to another's property.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   (Doc. 59-2, pg. 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Sunwestern alleges that exclusion (5) does not apply because \"Sunwestern did not own the [Project].\" (Doc. 60, pg. 14). In its Response, Cincinnati provided evidence that the City was named as an additional insured in both the CGL and UMB Policies.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 69, pg. 15) (\"the City did own the Project and was an additional insured under both the CGL and UMB policies\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 70-2) (Certificate of Liability Insurance naming the City as an additional insured under the CGL and\n   UMB Policies and Affidavit from Cincinnati's Regional Manager of Casualty Claims authenticating the Certificate). Rather than rebutting Cincinnati's claim and evidentiary proof, Sunwestern merely repeats that \"Sunwestern did not own [the Project]\" in both its Response (Doc. 67, pg. 16) and Reply (Doc. 73, pg. 11). Based on the information provided, the Court is satisfied that: the City was an \"additional insured\" under the CGL and UMB Policies; the City owned the Project, and; exclusion (5) applies to preclude coverage for the Incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Therefore, neither the CGL Policy, nor the UMB Policy provides coverage for the Incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    4. Did Sunwestern Have a Reasonable Expectation of Coverage?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Sunwestern last argues that its \"principals and employees had a reasonable expectation that they would be covered for any claim regarding the condition of Sunwestern's work. They were told they had coverage for faulty workmanship and for completed operations. They had been covered for such claims by Cincinnati previously. Under those circumstances, Sunwestern's insurance with Cincinnati covers Tucson Water's claim.\" (Doc. 60, pg. 17).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Based on Sunwestern's allegations, it appears that its \"reasonable expectation\" of coverage stems from two places: (1) alleged statements by its insurance broker that \"they had coverage for faulty workmanship and for completed operations;\" and (2) a prior allegedly related incident where Cincinnati provided coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <em>\n    A. Insurance Broker Statements.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Much of Sunwestern's alleged expectation of coverage originated from statements made by its own insurance broker, Leon Byrd, and not from Cincinnati directly. Although Sunwestern incorrectly asserts that Mr. Byrd is Cincinnati's agent,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 61, pg. 31), the record indicates that Mr. Byrd is affiliated with an independent agency - The Mahoney Group.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   (Doc. 61-4, pg. 56); (Doc. 61-5, pg. 8); (Doc. 61-6, pg. 50). Mr. Byrd allegedly \"explained to Sunwestern each time the insurance renewed, Sunwestern had coverage for its work, for completed operations, and for failures of the work that Sunwestern performed.\" (Doc. 61, pg. 31).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   \"The reasonable expectations doctrine, as applied in Arizona, is a rule of construction that enables courts to negate boilerplate terms of an insurance agreement that take away coverage provided for elsewhere in the contract. The doctrine is applied in several situations; for instance, a court can negate a boilerplate term when that term could not be understood by a reasonably intelligent consumer or when an activity by the insurer creates an objective impression of coverage in the mind of a reasonable insured. The doctrine does not, however, operate to add coverage where such coverage is nowhere stated in the policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Gregorio v. GEICO Gen. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4186517\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/815/1097/#p1100\">\n    815 F. Supp. 2d 1097\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1100-01 (D. Ariz. 2011), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3623767\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-appx/535/545/\">\n    535 F. App'x 545\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (9th Cir. 2013). If Cincinnati had made statements to Sunwestern that it would be covered for its own failures, Sunwestern may have a persuasive argument that it had a reasonable expectation of coverage. Here, the expectation seems to have been created solely by Mr. Byrd and not Cincinnati. Based on Mr. Byrd's statements, the Court finds that Sunwestern did not have a reasonable expectation of coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    B. Prior Incident.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Sunwestern also alleges that it had a reasonable expectation of coverage based upon a prior incident where Cincinnati provided coverage. Sunwestern vaguely describes the incident in its statement of\n   facts and claims that in 2008, after it had completed a project for Metro Water, a pump failed. (Doc. 61, pg. 30). Metro Water made a claim against Sunwestern and Cincinnati later settled that claim.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 30-31. Sunwestern alleges that \"[a]fter the Metro Water claim, Sunwestern had an understanding that Cincinnati insured claims related to Sunwestern's work.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   According to Cincinnati, that \"case involved damages to a structure built by SunWestern [sic] for the Metropolitan Water District. After completion of the project, flooding damaged the building and associated electronic equipment installed by a subcontractor, and voided warrantees [sic] on the equipment.\" (Doc. 58, pg. 16-17). Although Cincinnati later settled that case based on completed operations coverage, it alleges that it is unsuitable for comparison because it involved damage to equipment installed by a subcontractor.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Rather than rebutting Cincinnati's detailed explanation of the Metro Water case, in its response to Cincinnati's Motion for Summary Judgment, Sunwestern merely reasserts that \"[it] had been covered for similar claims by Cincinnati previously\" without providing additional detail. (Doc. 67, pg. 17). Based on the information provided, the Court agrees that the Metro Water case is not an apt comparison and does not form the basis for Sunwestern to have a reasonable basis for coverage. As discussed earlier, exclusion (l) contains an explicit exception for work performed by a subcontractor. As the Metro Water case involved equipment installed by a subcontractor, it is unsurprising that Cincinnati was compelled to provide coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   The Court finds that this prior incident is distinguishable and does not create a reasonable expectation of coverage for the Incident.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Dannenfeldt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5871039\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/778/484/#p492\">\n    778 F.
