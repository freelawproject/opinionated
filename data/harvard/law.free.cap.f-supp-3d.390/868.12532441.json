Specifically, at the time Plaintiffs filed this action, they housed 4 chickens and 3 pygmy goats in accessory buildings on their property -- in violation of City ordinances -- and requested accommodations from the City for Mr. Young's disability, claiming that the animals provided emotional support to Mr. Young and assisted him in coping with his disability.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 138-43.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Following the City's denial of the requested accommodations,\n   <em>\n    see\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20636\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 141, Plaintiffs filed this action alleging violations of: (1) the Fair Housing Amendments Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203601\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq.\n   </em>\n   ; (2) Ohio Rev.

Defendants agreed to make a payment in the amount of $20,000 to Plaintiffs and their lawyer in consideration for a dismissal of all claims with prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   doc. 26-2.

On August 19, 2017, the Court substituted the conditional dismissal Order with an Order of dismissal and termination entry, dismissing the action with prejudice and retaining jurisdiction solely for the purpose of enforcing the terms of the settlement agreement. Doc. 19 at PageID 182.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Eleven months after this case was dismissed with prejudice, Defendants moved to enforce the settlement agreement. Doc. 26. On August 21, 2018, Plaintiffs responded to Defendants' motion to enforce by moving for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b). Doc. 33. Ultimately, the undersigned recommended that Defendants' motion to enforce be granted and that Plaintiffs' motion for relief from judgment be denied. Doc. 45. No party filed any objection to the Report and Recommendation, and it was adopted by Judge Black following a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review. Doc. 49. Defendants now move for the imposition of sanctions -- namely, attorney's fees and costs -- associated with their having to seek compliance with the parties' settlement agreement through enforcement by the Court.
