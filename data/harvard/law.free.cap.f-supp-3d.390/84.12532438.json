(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl., ECF No. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9). The IRS declined to produce any responsive records on the grounds that CoA Institute was requesting \"non-agency Congressional records that are not subject to the FOIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) CoA Institute then filed the complaint in the instant case, which alleges that the IRS has improperly withheld \"agency records\" and seeks a Court order requiring the agency to produce the documents that CoA Institute has requested.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   IRS's Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 11.) The IRS maintains that this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction to adjudicate CoA Institute's claim that the agency is violating federal law, because \"to the extent that such records exist,\" they \"are not 'agency records' subject to the FOIA's disclosure requirements.\" (Mem. in Supp. of IRS's Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Mem.\"), ECF No. 11-1, at 13.) In this regard, the IRS insists that this Court cannot exercise jurisdiction over CoA Institute's improper-withholding claim under the FOIA unless the Court first determines that the requested documents qualify as \"agency records\" for FOIA purposes; in other words, the agency conceives of its challenge to the character of the records at issue here as one that relates to this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20552\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (\"The Court lacks jurisdiction if the records at issue are not 'agency records.' \").) For the reasons explained fully below, this Court disagrees. The Court is confident that the IRS's not-agency-records challenge is one that pertains to the\n   <em>\n    merits\n   </em>\n   of CoA Institute's FOIA claim, rather than this Court's power to adjudicate the dispute and grant the requested relief, and the allegations of CoA Institute's complaint are more than sufficient to satisfy the minimal pleading requirements that are applicable to the initial stage of FOIA litigation. Therefore, the IRS's motion to dismiss CoA Institute's complaint under Rule 12(b)(1) for lack of jurisdiction (or otherwise) must be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .

To this end, the JCT routinely corresponds with the IRS concerning various matters. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Compl. \u00b6 1.) In mid-December of 2015, the IRS introduced guidance that \"requir[ed] the [agency] to treat nearly all JCT-related records as 'congressional records' not subject to the FOIA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 6 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).) CoA Institute-a \"non-profit strategic oversight group\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4)-promptly set out to challenge this new edict, which the group believed \"contradict[ed] FOIA jurisprudence relating to the definition of agency records\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 22, 2016, CoA Institute submitted to the IRS the two FOIA requests that are the subject of the instant case.

The IRS filed a motion to dismiss the complaint pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1) on February 21, 2017 (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   IRS's Mot. to Dismiss), and, in so doing, the agency relied on supporting declarations by Thomas Barthold, who is the JCT's Chief of Staff (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Thomas A. Barthold, ECF No. 11-2), and Scott Landes, who is a Supervisory Management and Program Analyst with the IRS (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Decl. of Scott S. Landes, ECF No. 11-3), as well as on various other supporting materials and evidence (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Joint Comm. on Taxation Policy Manual (July 1, 2007), ECF No. 11-4; Letter from Barthold to John Koskinen (Aug. 3, 2016), ECF No. 11-5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the IRS's motion was fully briefed, this Court held a motion hearing, during which it became clear that the agency's subject-matter jurisdiction argument rested entirely on the issue of whether or not the records that are responsive to CoA Institute's FOIA requests qualify as \"agency records\" that are subject to the FOIA, or \"congressional records\" that are not subject to the FOIA. (\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Hr'g Tr., ECF No. 17, at 18:8-19:22;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-23; Mem. in Opp'n to Def.'s Mot. to Dismiss, ECF No. 12, at 10-26; Def.'s Reply in Supp. of Its Mot. to Dismiss (\"Def.'s Reply\"), ECF No. 13, at 6-17.) According to the IRS, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction over CoA Institute's FOIA claim-and should therefore dismiss it under Rule 12(b)(1) -simply and solely because the requested records are congressional, not agency, records. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In response to this Court's inquiry regarding whether the IRS's motion to dismiss was properly brought under Rule 12(b)(1), as a challenge to this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction, or was, in fact, a challenge to the sufficiency of CoA Institute's complaint on the merits under Rule 12(b)(6) (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Hr'g Tr., at 18:20-19:6), the IRS requested the opportunity to submit supplemental briefing on that narrow question (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Consent Mot. for Suppl. Briefing, ECF No. 14, at 1), which the Court allowed (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Min. Order of Aug. 28, 2017;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   IRS's Suppl.

In its supplemental brief, the IRS continues to assert that its challenge to CoA Institute's complaint is jurisdictional per the FOIA statute, and thus that the agency's motion to dismiss should be considered under Rule 12(b)(1) and not Rule 12(b)(6). (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 7.) For its part, CoA Institute argues that the relevant \"jurisdictional\" language in the FOIA statute \"refers to the power of the court to order a specific kind of remedy, not to the court's authority to hear a case in the first instance\" (Pl.'s Suppl. Br. at 9),\n   and thus, \"the pending motion should be considered under Rule 12(b)(6)\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

(\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Def.'s Mem. at 13-17;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 13 (\"The Court lacks\n   jurisdiction if the records at issue are not 'agency records.' \" (citation omitted)); Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 8-18.) This assertion is misguided, and the Court squarely rejects the common but confused contention that Congress intended for a federal district court's subject-matter jurisdiction over a FOIA claim to turn on whether or not the agency has improperly withheld \"agency records,\" for the reasons explained below.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miller v.

For good measure, this Court has proceeded further, to construe the IRS's Rule 12 motion to dismiss as a challenge to the sufficiency of the CoA Institute's pleading under Rule 12(b)(6). And in this regard, too, the Court is satisfied that CoA Institute has pled a plausible violation of the FOIA, insofar as its complaint plainly alleges that \"[t]he IRS is an agency\" (Compl. \u00b6 5) to which CoA Institute submitted two detailed requests for records\n   <em>\n    (id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 7, 9), and in response to those requests, the IRS \"denied CoA Institute access to agency records to which it has a right under the FOIA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 30). Thus, the IRS's motion must be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

As mentioned above, here, the IRS has steadfastly interpreted the language of this judicial review provision to mean that a dispute regarding the characterization of the records at issue (i.e., whether or not what has been requested are \"agency records\") presents a threshold question of fact that relates to the Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Mem. at 13-17; Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 8-18.) But at least two Courts of Appeals (including the D.C.

And not only does the agency omit any precedents, it points to no language in section 552(a)(4)(B) or anywhere else in the FOIA in support of this position.

By contrast, the dispute here is a factual one about whether or not the records sought are \"agency records\" such that CoA Institute has presented a valid claim upon which relief can be granted pursuant to section 552(a)(4)(B). Consequently, the IRS's efforts to characterize today's dispute as implicating sovereign immunity, and thereby to suggest that the factual predicates therein necessarily relate to a court's subject-matter jurisdiction, are unsupported and therefore unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Nor has the IRS credibly distinguished the D.C.

See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3647626,3542541\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/566/219/\">\n    566 F.3d 219\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . According to the IRS, \"[t]he holding of\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   is limited to its unique facts and unusual procedural history and thus does not conflict\" with the agency's argument that the \"agency records\" issue implicates this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction. (Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 12.) In particular, the IRS emphasizes that the \"narrow\" issue in\n   <em>\n    CREW\n   </em>\n   was \"whether a subcomponent of the Executive Office of the President was not an 'agency' under the FOIA despite the fact that the Executive Office of the President is an agency under the FOIA\" (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   ), and, to be sure, that\n   <em>\n    exact\n   </em>\n   issue is not presented in the instant case. But the IRS has yet to explain how the \"agency\" question in CREW is materially different than the question that the IRS raises in the instant motion to dismiss-i.e., whether the records that CoA Institute has requested from the IRS are \"agency records\" under the FOIA, despite the fact that other records retained by the IRS qualify as \"agency records\" for FOIA purposes. Indeed, from the standpoint of evaluating section 552(a)(4)(B) as setting forth either jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional prerequisites to maintaining a FOIA action, both circumstances are identical.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bureau of Nat'l Affairs, Inc. v.

The IRS is correct to observe that, in\n   <em>\n    BNA\n   </em>\n   , the D.C.

(\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Sec. III.A,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   .)\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Allegations Of CoA Institute's Complaint, Which Must Be Accepted As True, Are Sufficient To Survive A Rule 12(b)(6) Motion To Dismiss\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The Court turns, finally, to the \"evidence\" that the IRS has presented along with its Rule 12(b)(1) motion to dismiss, which according to the agency, \"establishes that the JCT intends that its communications with the IRS and the IRS's responses are congressional records and not agency records.\" (Def.'s Reply at 5.) It may well turn out that the agency's proof establishes that there are no \"agency records\" at issue in this case, and thus, that CoA Institute's FOIA claims are meritless. But as the IRS appears to concede,\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   is \"a\n   <em>\n    factual\n   </em>\n   challenge[.]\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis in original).) And, at this stage of the litigation, this Court must accept CoA Institute's allegations of fact, as pleaded in its complaint, as if they are true.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Harris v. Dist. of Columbia Water &amp; Sewer Auth.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4280044,4274374\" index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/791/65/\">\n    791 F.3d 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68 (D.C. Cir. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Notably, the IRS's recognition that the \"agency records\" dispute presents a question of fact appears to be precisely why the agency has opted to double down on its attempt to cast the issue as a jurisdictional one (thereby enabling the Court to look at materials beyond the four corners of Plaintiff's pleading), and is also apparently why the IRS has eschewed the opportunity to assert that CoA Institute has failed to state a claim. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Def.'s Suppl. Br. at 8-12.) In other words, there is no dispute that,\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   the IRS's motion to dismiss is not properly construed as raising a jurisdictional question under Rule 12(b)(1), what remains at this early stage is the Court's authority merely to test the sufficiency of the allegations in CoA Institute's complaint under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    EEOC v.

After answering the complaint's allegations, the parties will be ordered to propose a schedule for briefing motions for summary judgment under Rule 56, and in that context, the agency will be free to argue that the state of the evidence is such that there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning the nature of the requested records-i.e., they are indisputably \"congressional records\" rather than \"agency records\"-and that, therefore, the agency is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Likewise, CoA Institute can put forward arguments and evidence to counter the IRS's legal arguments and demonstrate that there is no genuine dispute that the agency has transgressed its obligations under the FOIA. For now, it suffices to conclude that, accepting its allegations as true, CoA Institute has made a plausible claim for relief under the FOIA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As explained above, the IRS maintains that it has not \"denied CoA Institute access\n   to agency records to which it has a right under the FOIA\" (Compl. \u00b6 30), and it argues that, on this basis alone, this Court lacks subject-matter jurisdiction such that CoA Institute's FOIA complaint must be dismissed. But the character of the records at issue does not dictate this Court's subject-matter jurisdiction over the instant FOIA claim, and the IRS will have ample opportunity to dispute CoA Institute's claim when the agency addresses the merits of CoA Institute's complaint in a future motion for summary judgment. In the meantime, and for the purpose of the IRS's motion to dismiss, CoA Institute's allegations must be accepted as true, and they are manifestly sufficient to state a claim for violation of the FOIA. Therefore, as set forth in the accompanying Order, the IRS's motion to dismiss will be\n   <strong>\n    DENIED\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    Page-number citations to the documents that the parties have filed refer to the page numbers that the Court's electronic filing system automatically assigns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    The facts recited herein are gleaned from Plaintiff's complaint, and this Court has treated the complaint's allegations as true for the purpose of resolving the instant motion to dismiss.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Bell Atlantic Corp. v.
