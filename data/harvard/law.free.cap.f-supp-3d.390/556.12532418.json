The Defendant charter school objects generally to the amount of fees sought and seeks a reduction based upon its purported inability to pay. Plaintiffs' attorneys prevailed for their clients by providing competent and diligent representation in this multi-year, complicated, highly specialized state administrative and federal litigation, and they are entitled to reasonable fees. For the reasons that follow, I grant Plaintiffs' motions in large part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rayna P. and M.C., siblings, are children with disabilities. Their parents filed two separate suits in this Court on each child's behalf, appealing decisions by Delaware Special Education Due Process Hearing Officers under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). I granted the majority of parents' requested relief in both cases, thereby diverging significantly from the Due Process Panel decisions. In Rayna P.'s case, I decided that the Due Process Panel was wrong to cap relief at two years prior to May 27, 2014-the reasonable discovery date-because there is no retrospective limit on relief under the IDEA. I also granted one full day of compensatory education for every day she was present in school and 2.5\n   hours for each day she was absent. This contrasts with the Panel's denial of compensatory education for days on which Rayna P. was present in school and its grant of just 1 hour of compensatory education per day for days on which she was absent. I denied Rayna P.'s request for compensatory education for three summers of summer school (extended school year or ESY). In M.P.'s case, I decided that the Due Process Panel was wrong to excuse as \"reasonable\" a denial of free appropriate public education (FAPE) for a period of a year. I also increased the panel's allotted hourly rate for compensatory education from $17.50 to $70 and I rejected the Panel's order creating a four-year time limit on M.P.'s use of compensatory education funds, ordering instead that M.P. had until the end of his 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   year (he was 13 at the time I decided the case) to use the funds. But I upheld the Panel's denial of compensatory education for summer school (ESY).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

I find the items listed in Plaintiffs' attorneys' billing records sufficiently specific to allow me to determine whether the hours claimed are unreasonable for the work performed. Plaintiffs' attorneys bill for items such as \"research case law governing statute of limitations,\" \"review of file materials regarding strategy\" and \"preparation of correspondence to Hearing Officer,\" and \"in-person discussion with counsel.\" Such entries are sufficiently specific.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9046070\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/89/1031/#p1037\">\n    89 F.3d at 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that entries such as \"research,\" \"review,\" \"prepare,\" \"letter to,\" and \"conference with\" met standards of specificity).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    Hours Spent on Intraoffice Communications\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Defendants protest that Plaintiffs seek to generate an inordinate amount of presumably unnecessary \"fees for excessive intraoffice communications and fees for communications with clients, none of which would ordinarily be passed on to clients.\" I disagree. By Defendant's count, Plaintiffs' attorneys' billing records contain 768 references to \"intraoffice communications. While this number appears high at first glance, a closer look at Plaintiffs' billing records suggests an appropriate amount of time spent on internal communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Plaintiffs' billing records are organized by date, not by task or attorney. I note that this is far from ideal, requiring the court to expend time tallying the hours spent on intraoffice communications.\" Having undertaken that tally, I calculate that Plaintiffs' attorneys billed 183.48 hours in the Rayna P. matter and 187.025 hours in the M.P. matter for intraoffice communications over a course of 4.5 years or approximately 236 weeks of litigation. That amounts to approximately 1.5 hours per week. Plaintiffs explain that most of the intraoffice communications involved more junior attorneys consulting with more senior supervisory attorneys, an assertion supported by my review of the billing records. A junior attorney consulting more senior attorneys about a complicated special education matter for a total of 1.5 hours per week seems perfectly reasonable. The records reflect that lower-billing junior attorneys did the bulk of the work on both matters and relied on the work and contributions of senior-more expensive-attorneys only when necessary. That had the effect of\n   <em>\n    mini\n   </em>\n   mizing the total fees\n   generated. For these reasons I reject Defendant's argument that Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees should be discounted for time spent on intraoffice communications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <em>\n    Duplication Across Cases\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Defendant also suggests-again without identifying the numbers it relies upon to reach its mathematical conclusion-that only 54% of Plaintiffs' attorneys' work on these two cases was unique. That is, Defendants suggest that 46% of the work done on each individual case was identical to the work done on the other case and therefore redundant. I fail to see how this could be.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   \" 'A reduction for duplication is warranted only if the attorneys are\n   <em>\n    unreasonably\n   </em>\n   doing the\n   <em>\n    same\n   </em>\n   work.' \"\n   <em>\n    Damian J. v.

Defendant does not allege that such was the case here: that two or more attorneys unreasonably did the same work. Rather, Defendant seemingly argues that single attorneys were billing twice for identical work done on two very different cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"A reduction for duplication\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   [ ] warranted when a single attorney bills twice for the same work.\"\n   <em>\n    Sch.

Jan. 11, 2017) (emphasis added). But Rayna P. and M.P.'s cases were not identical and required similar but not identical work. Rayna P. and M.P. are two different children with distinct IDEA claims involving distinct facts, who were involved in two separate Due Process hearings, and then brought two separate cases before this Court appealing those hearing determinations. The only place there has been substantive overlap in legal work and briefing has been in this fee petition, which represents a small fraction of the overall multi-year litigation. I therefore cannot agree that Plaintiffs' attorneys engaged in much duplicative work in these two distinct cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   That being said and having reviewed the separate billing records for Rayna P. and M.P. in great detail, a question can fairly be raised about overlapping time entries with identical descriptions such as when Plaintiffs' attorneys corresponded with the children's parents. There are identical time logs for such entries across the two billing records (e.g., 0.13 hours for \"telephone communication with client\" billed by \"BS\" to Rayna P. on 5/15/2014 and 0.13 hours for \"telephone communication with client\" billed by \"BS\" to M.P., also on 5/15/2014). It makes sense that, with respect to such entries, Plaintiffs' attorneys or paralegals made one call to the children's parents about both cases and then split the time in half between the two billing records. I therefore credit counsel's assertion that, where the same task benefited both children, the time was divided between the billing records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   I do so with sensitivity to Defendant's assertion that \"it is also possible that substantially similar time entries reflect a double counting of the hours spent, particularly where the majority of the billing descriptions do not specify whether the work identified was performed\" just for Rayna P., M.P., or both.\n   <em>\n    Kirsch,\n   </em>\n   at *7. I am able to dismiss Defendant's assertion because Plaintiffs' attorneys dealt with this possibility by conceding that there may have been some inadvertent duplication, leading them to build in an across-the-board 5% discount in their fees to account for possible double billing. I am impressed by Plaintiffs' counsel's candor and persuaded that their 5% discounting appropriately and sufficiently accounts for any inadvertent double billing across these two distinct cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Hourly Rates\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing their attorneys' reasonable rate.\n   <em>\n    Maldonado\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11085540\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/256/181/#p184\">\n    256 F.3d at 184\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Defendant does not attack Mr. McAndrews' affidavit as unreliable, even though he is attesting to rates for attorneys in his own firm. This is a tacit recognition of both his expertise and his professional reputation for integrity, and I commend defense counsel for their professionalism in recognizing this. And, technically, he is not attesting to his own rate. But Mr. McAndrews' firm will be the recipient of any fee award, making it important to consider other evidence, and appropriate for the court to undertake an independent assessment of the rates prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Plaintiffs have provided the most recent-July 2018-fee schedule for Community Legal Services of Philadelphia (CLS).

Furthermore, Defendant does not challenge the hourly rates for all of Plaintiffs' attorneys but only of Attorneys Gehring, Konkler-Smith, Ryan, and Mahler. As to them, Defendant contends that the hourly rates sought are unreasonable, but it provides no counter-evidence of appropriate hourly rates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The CLS Fee Schedule outlines the fees charged by CLS in cases where the law permits the award of attorneys' fees.\n   <em>\n    See Cmty.

First, Defendant does not assert a regional difference between Philadelphia and Delaware, and fees should not be discounted for reasons not raised by the opposing party.\n   <em>\n    McKenna v. City of Phila.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4061656\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/582/447/#p459\">\n    582 F.3d 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 459 (3d Cir. 2009). Second, counsel for Plaintiffs practice in both Pennsylvania and Delaware and maintain offices in both states. In that regard, the firm for which defense counsel\n   practices is itself headquartered in Philadelphia, with a Wilmington regional office. This is consistent with the Court's perception of a regional market for legal services, encompassing Philadelphia, southern New Jersey, and Delaware. District judges in New Jersey have recognized this reality as well, applying the CLS schedule in their court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Westberry v.

Mar. 7, 2016), where the Court attempted to survey market rates for lawyers representing plaintiffs in IDEA cases and concluded that even where counsel's qualifications might warrant a fee in accordance with the CLS schedule, the private market for such cases would not support a rate higher than $450 per hour.\n   <em>\n    Accord,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.W. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203959073\">\n    2016 WL 3959073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (E.D. Pa. July 22, 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   But in arguing that the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   case should be viewed as controlling authority setting upward limits on fees in IDEA cases, the defense ignores precedent to the contrary.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    I.W. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%20147148\">\n    2016 WL 147148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *10 (E.D. Pa. Jan. 13, 2016) (awarding counsel fees at $600 per hour);\n   <em>\n    Kirsch\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%20131808\">\n    2017 WL 131808\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *6 (awarding hourly rates of $525, $500, and $475). And the model followed in\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   assumes a hypothetical marketplace of clients retaining counsel at hourly rates in a field of law which is, by its very nature, dependent on a combination of contingent fees and fee awards. Adopting that approach runs the risk of undervaluing the qualifications and contributions of counsel, which in turn can create disincentives for highly accomplished lawyers to pursue IDEA cases. Consequently, I am not inclined to give\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   particular weight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Thus, using the CLS Fee Schedule as an appropriate basis for comparison, I note that all except for Attorney Mahler's requested hourly rates fall well within that schedule. Attorney Gehring has 29 years of litigation experience, 7 of which were in special education law. He requests an hourly rate of $495. This is well\n   <em>\n    below\n   </em>\n   CLS's rate for attorneys with more than 25 years of experience ($650-700). Attorney Ryan has practiced law for 33 years and has 1.5 years of experience practicing special education law. She also requests an hourly rate of $495. Although her experience in special education is limited, I have reviewed her previous experience, which involved complex shareholder class actions at well-respected firms, culminating in the establishment of her own firm where she practiced for seven years before joining McAndrews Law Offices. I find this experience in sophisticated litigation worthy of recognition in determining her appropriate rate and note that at $495 it remains well\n   <em>\n    below\n   </em>\n   CLS's rate for attorneys with more than 25 years of experience ($650-700). These requested rates for Attorneys Gehring and Ryan are also within the range of rates awarded by my colleagues in the Circuit in\n   <em>\n    I.W.\n   </em>\n   and in\n   <em>\n    Kirsch\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Attorney Konkler-Goldsmith has 20 years of experience in special education law and her requested hourly rate of $495 is at the low end of the CLS schedule for attorneys with 16-20 years' experience ($475-530).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Attorney Mahler has 6-7 years of experience practicing special education law and a year of experience as a judicial law clerk. But her requested hourly rate of $395 is above the CLS schedule for attorneys with 6-10 years of experience ($280-360). But I do not have sufficient evidence in the record before me to permit a divergence from my guiding benchmark here: the CLS Fee Schedule. I therefore limit Attorney Mahler's hourly rate to $350, near the top end of the CLS Fee Schedule for attorneys with 6-10 years of experience to account for her special education specialization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    M.W. v. Sch. Dist. of Phila.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%203959073\">\n    2016 WL 3959073\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *5 (awarding an attorney $325 per hour two years ago when she had six years' special education experience). In choosing this rate, I am mindful of the reality detailed in the McAndrews affidavit, that very few attorneys are, within the geographic area of Delaware, both qualified and willing to handle special education cases, particularly on a contingency or statutory fee basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   I note again that Plaintiffs' billing records are organized by date, not by task or attorney. This left the Court to spend considerable time tallying the hours Attorney Mahler spent on the two cases. By my calculation, Ms. Maher spent 166.86 hours on Rayna P.'s case and 177.375 hours on M.P.'s case. Her proposed rate of $395 per hour therefore generated $65,909.70 in Rayna P.'s case and $70,063.13 in M.P.'s case. But under the $350 hourly rate that I deem appropriate for an attorney with her skills and experience, she is entitled to only $58,401.00 for Rayna P.'s case and only $62,081.25 for M.P.'s case. I will therefore deduct the difference-$7,508.7 in Rayna P.'s case and $7,981.88 in M.P.'s case-from the total attorneys' fee award requested by Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Downward Departure for Partial Success\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The lodestar \"is presumed to be the reasonable fee.\"\n   <em>\n    Blum,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338115\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/886/\">\n    465 U.S. at 897\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11338115\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/465/886/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 1541\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In securing representation from counsel, Plaintiffs entered into a representation agreement that provided for a contingency fee in the amount of one-third (1/3) of any monetary award obtained for the family and, separately, that counsel would be entitled to seek hourly fees from the Defendant pursuant to the IDEA's fee-shifting provision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Defendant suggests that counsel's separate recovery of fees under a contingency fee agreement with Plaintiffs should serve to reduce statutory attorney fees but does not develop that position with specific arguments. The existence of a contingent fee agreement does not by itself require reduction of a fee award.

In that regard, it is important to recognize that attorneys who practice in the field of special education have multiple responsibilities. They represent both children and parents and, in some instances, the interests of parents diverge. Counsel in such cases are often litigating past entitlements, while\n   giving contemporaneous advice as to a child's educational options, and at the same time helping them plan for future needs. In undertaking such representation on a contingent fee basis, counsel absorbs great risk. That includes not only the risk of an unsuccessful outcome with no compensation for counsel after substantial time invested, but also the financial risks that come from absorbing the overhead of a law practice as well as the costs advanced in pursuit of a case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In many instances, counsel carry those costs for a period of years, and case costs can be particularly daunting following\n   <em>\n    Arlington Cent. School District v. Murphy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500383\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/291/\">\n    548 U.S. 291\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500383\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/291/\">\n    126 S.Ct. 2455\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3500383\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/548/291/\">\n    165 L.Ed.2d 526\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006), which held that the costs for expert witnesses are, as a general rule, no longer compensable to a prevailing party. It also bears mention that the universe of cases in which counsel can seek a fee award was significantly narrowed by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Buckhannon Board and Care Home, Inc. v. West Virginia Department of Health and Human Resources,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    532 U.S. 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    121 S.Ct. 1835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9301812\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/532/598/\">\n    149 L.Ed.2d 855\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), which limited the recoverability of fees to cases resolved by a judicial order or a consent decree, rather than through settlement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In short, enforceable contingent fee agreements address risk in a way that statutory fee awards do not. They remain vital to the availability of counsel in IDEA cases. Consequently, the Supreme Court's conclusion in\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   is as important today as it was when the decision was issued. Counsel's compensation pursuant to a contingent fee agreement does not require a reduction in a statutory fee award. On the other hand, it is equally clear that\n   <em>\n    Blanchard\n   </em>\n   requires consideration of other compensation received by counsel. On the record here, notwithstanding the risks undertaken by counsel in any contingent case, I am persuaded that some reduction in statutory fees is appropriate because of other compensation received, specifically, a reduction of $27,832 in the case of M.P., and a reduction of $22,652 in the case of Rayna P.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   G.\n   <em>\n    Defendant's Ability to Pay\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Defendant argues that it has exhausted its ability to pay any fee award and that any judgment obtained by Plaintiffs' attorneys will affect the resources available to Defendant's other students.
