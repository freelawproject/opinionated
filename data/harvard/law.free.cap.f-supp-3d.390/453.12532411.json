The plaintiff, Wanda Lugo, filed claims for DIB and SSI on January 1, 2014 and November 12, 2015, respectively. An Administrative Law Judge (\"ALJ\") for the Social Security Administration (\"SSA\") denied the plaintiff's claims on the grounds that the plaintiff was not \"disabled\" under the Act. R. &amp; R. at 2. The Appeals Council denied review on January 16, 2018.

The record before the ALJ contained notes from only one clinical examination performed by Dr. Chang on March 16, 2016.

The Appeals Council's denial notice states, \"We find this evidence does not show a reasonable probability that it would change the outcome of the decision.\" R. &amp; R. at 36. However, as discussed above, the new evidence in this case satisfies the requirements for reconsideration because it calls into question the ALJ's reasons for finding that Dr. Chang's opinions lacked adequate support. Because the new evidence was material to the ALJ's findings, the Appeals Council's boilerplate language was not enough to explain the dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"[W]hen the Appeals Council denies review after considering the new evidence, the final decision necessarily includes the Appeals Council's conclusion that the ALJ's findings remained correct despite the new evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7633508\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/77/41/#p45\">\n    77 F.3d at 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted). Because of the new evidence, the ALJ's finding -- that there was insufficient clinical documentation to support Dr. Chang's opinions -- no longer remains correct. Thus, it was error for the Appeals Council to summarily affirm the ALJ's findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    3.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Commissioner also argues that remand is improper because Dr. Chang's clinical notes are not subject to the treating physician rule. \"The treating physician rule 'mandates that the medical opinion of the claimant's treating physician [be] given controlling weight if it is well supported by the medical findings and not inconsistent with other substantial record evidence.' \"\n   <em>\n    Botta v. Barnhart\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3939550\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/475/174/#p187\">\n    475 F. Supp. 2d 174\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 187 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Shaw v.

An ALJ must give \"good reasons\" for its decision not to follow the treating physician rule.\n   <em>\n    Clark v. Comm'r of Soc.

Moreover, \"[t]he Appeals Council must give the same degree of deference to [a treating physician's opinion] that an ALJ would be required to give.\"\n   <em>\n    Garcia v. Comm'r of Soc. Sec.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12272411\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/208/547/#p552\">\n    208 F. Supp. 3d 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552 (S.D.N.Y. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The Commissioner argues the that additional clinical notes are objective and do not constitute Dr. Chang's opinions and thus are not due special deference under the treating physician rule. Accordingly, the Commissioner argues that the Appeals Council was not required to give \"good reasons\" for failing to give Dr. Chang's clinical notes special weight. However, remand is appropriate in this case because the Appeals Council failed to provide a sufficient basis for rejecting the new evidence that was directly relevant to the ALJ's asserted reason for giving \"limited weight\" to the opinion of the treating physician.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    4.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The Commissioner also argues that remand is unwarranted on grounds that the new evidence is cumulative because it shows continued treatment for the same medical conditions rather than further deterioration of the plaintiff's condition. While the Commissioner may speculate that the Appeals Council denied review because the new evidence was cumulative, the Court may not accept the Commissioner's \"post hoc rationalizations\" for the Appeals Council's decision.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Snell v. Apfel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"727169\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/177/128/#p134\">\n    177 F.3d 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 134 (2d Cir. 1999) (\"A reviewing court may not accept appellate counsel's post hoc rationalizations for agency action.\" (quotation marks omitted)). The actual rationale of the decision of the Appeals Council was that the new evidence \"does not show a reasonable possibility that it would change the outcome of the decision.\" R. at 2. But that rationale fails to come to grips with the fact that the new evidence undercuts\n   the stated rationale of the ALJ. On remand, the Commissioner is free to consider the new evidence along with all the evidence in the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The plaintiff filed objections to Sections II - IV of the Report and Recommendation twenty days after Magistrate Judge Lehrburger issued the Report and Recommendation. Opp. at 8. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 72(b)(2) requires objections to be filed within fourteen days of the Report and Recommendation. Therefore, the plaintiff's objections are overruled as untimely. In any event, the objections are cursory and provide no basis for overturning the recommendation of the Magistrate Judge in Section II through Section IV of the Report and Recommendations. On remand, the Commissioner is free to consider how the new evidence affects the entirety of the ALJ's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Court has considered all of the arguments raised by the parties. To the extent not specifically addressed, the arguments are either moot or without merit. For the reasons explained above, the Magistrate Judge's Report and Recommendation is\n   <strong>\n    adopted\n   </strong>\n   in its entirety, the plaintiff's motion for judgment on the pleadings is\n   <strong>\n    granted,\n   </strong>\n   and the Commissioner's motion is\n   <strong>\n    denied.\n   </strong>\n   The case is\n   <strong>\n    remanded to the Commissioner\n   </strong>\n   for proceedings consistent with this Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    SO ORDERED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    The Magistrate Judge concluded that the treatment notes and the MRI report that were made after the ALJ's decision fell outside the period at issue and \"would not be relevant or material.\" R. &amp; R. at 36 n.14. The plaintiff does not question this decision, but it should be noted that medical records created after the period at issue may be relevant to the condition that existed during the period at issue.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Pollard\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9212849\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/377/183/#p193\">\n     377 F.3d at 194\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . In this case, the medical records from Dr. Chang indicated that the plaintiff's rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia continued to produce moderate to severe pain that was aggravated by \"any physical activity.\"\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.\n    </em>\n    , R. at 12.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Neither the Appeals Council nor the parties questioned whether there was good cause for failing to produce the additional treatment records by Dr. Chang that occurred before the ALJ's decision.
