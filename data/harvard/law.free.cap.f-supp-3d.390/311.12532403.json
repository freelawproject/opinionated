In accordance with the Scheduling Order and subsequent orders entered by this Court,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Bondholders renewed their previously-served discovery demands, and also served new discovery requests, upon ERS, the Commonwealth, the Puerto Rico Fiscal Agency and Financial Advisory Authority (\"AAFAF\") (ERS, the Commonwealth, and AAFAF, collectively, the \"Government Parties\"), and the Financial Oversight Management Board for Puerto Rico (the \"Oversight Board\"). As relevant here, the Bondholders sought discovery from the Government Parties regarding the planning and legislative intent behind House Joint Resolution 188 of 2017 (\"J.R. 188\") and Act No. 106, which together in 2017 implemented a \"pay as you go\" (\"PayGo\") system for Commonwealth employee pension contributions. Although the Government Parties produced some materials responsive to the Bondholders' discovery demands, they also withheld certain documents under the deliberative process privilege, executive privilege, attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, and common interest doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 21, 2019, the Bondholders filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion of Certain Secured Creditors\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    of the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to Compel Discovery\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 5972, the \"March 21 Motion\") seeking,\n   <em>\n    inter\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    alia\n   </em>\n   , an order compelling the Government Parties \"to produce a privilege log that provides the information necessary for the Bondholders and the Court to assess their claims of privilege.\" By\n   <em>\n    Order\n   </em>\n   dated April 2, 2019 (Docket Entry No. 6111), which resolved the March 21 Motion, Judge Dein permitted the Government Parties to serve categorical privilege logs, provided that the logs included certain enumerated information. The Government Parties served a categorical privilege log on April 10, 2019, a revised categorical privilege log on April 12 (the \"April 12 Log\"), and an individual entry log on April 14.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Government Parties' Response to Movants' Objection to Magistrate Judge's May 6, 2019 and May 15, 2019 Orders on Motions to Compel\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 7293, the \"Response\"), \u00b6 12.) The April 12 Log identified the following seven categories of withheld documents:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   1. Confidential communications with in-house counsel and/or outside counsel providing, requesting, and/or discussing legal advice in connection with anticipated and ongoing litigation with ERS bondholders.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2.

Confidential communications with in-house counsel and/or outside counsel providing, requesting, and/or discussing legal advice in connection with PayGo implementation, including treatment, calculation, invoicing, and collection of PayGo fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4.

Confidential, pre-decisional, deliberative communications regarding pension reform legislation, including circulating and commenting on interim drafts, analyses of, and presentations on conversion to PayGo, PayGo fee structure, and treatment of benefits in connection with Joint Resolution 188 (enacted June 25, 2017) and Act 106 (enacted August 23, 2017).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. Confidential, pre-decisional, deliberative communications and/or documents regarding the drafting of fiscal plans and budgetary reporting documents concerning the effect of PayGo on Commonwealth budget and collection of PayGo fees, including communications circulating and commenting on interim drafts and analyses.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   7. Confidential, pre-decisional, deliberative AAFAF communications with Hacienda concerning PayGo implementation, including treatment, calculation, invoicing, and collection of PayGo fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   (Docket Entry No. 6253-2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On April 15 and April 16, 2019, respectively, the Bondholders filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion of Certain Secured Creditors of the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to Compel Production of Documents in Privilege Log Categories 1 to 4 [Attorney-Client\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Privilege, Attorney Work Product, Common Interest]\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6253, the \"Attorney-Client Privilege Motion\") and the\n   <em>\n    Motion of Certain Creditors of the Employees Retirement System of the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to Compel Production of Documents in Privilege Log Categories 1, 5 to 7 [Deliberative Process Privilege and Executive Privilege]\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6320, the \"Deliberative Process Privilege Motion\" and, together with the Attorney-Client Privilege Motion, the \"Motions to Compel\"). Through the Motions to Compel, the Bondholders demanded production of all documents identified as privileged in the Government Parties' logs. After hearing oral argument on the Motions to Compel, Judge Dein, in the May 6 Order, largely upheld the Government Parties' privilege assertions. As to the Deliberative Process Privilege Motion, Judge Dein rejected the Bondholders' contentions that certain withheld documents were not subject to the deliberative process privilege because they were post-decisional and that any such privilege was waived as to communications between the Government Parties. (May 6 Order at 2-4.) Moreover, Judge Dein found that the Bondholders failed to demonstrate a substantial need for the withheld information. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5.) Judge Dein also overruled what she characterized as the Bondholders' \"procedural objections\" to the Government Parties' invocations of the deliberative process and executive privileges. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.) With respect to the parties' disputes concerning factual content in allegedly privileged documents and the breadth of executive privilege, Judge Dein determined that factual information may be protected from disclosure under the deliberative process privilege when it is intertwined with deliberative analysis, and that AAFAF could assert executive privilege in connection with its role as advisor to the Governor. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4-5.) Judge Dein nevertheless concluded that additional submissions were needed to determine whether the Government Parties properly withheld factual information and whether the executive privilege applied to AAFAF's advisors. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the Attorney-Client Motion to Compel, Judge Dein determined that the common interest doctrine applied to communications between ERS, the Commonwealth, and AAFAF, thereby overruling the Bondholders' objection based on adversity of interests between ERS and the Commonwealth, to the Government Parties' assertion of privilege over such materials. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8.) With respect to particular communications-and in consideration of the Bondholders' arguments that the Government Parties waived attorney-client privilege as to communications which included third parties, and that their application of the work product doctrine was too broad-Judge Dein directed the Government Parties to create document-by-document privilege logs for all documents in Category 3 of the April 12 Log and for all instances where the work product doctrine was asserted exclusive of any other privilege. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9-10.) Judge Dein reserved judgment on those issues, set a deadline of May 9, 2019, for the Government Parties to provide their supplemental submissions, and ordered the Bondholders to thereafter notify the Court as to whether their objections still stood. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4, 5, 9, 10.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Government Parties timely submitted the supplemental materials contemplated by the May 6 Order, including an individual entry log (the \"May 9 Log\") that listed all documents in Category 3 of the April 12 Log. (Response \u00b6 15.) On May 15, 2019, having received no objections from the Bondholders pertaining to the adequacy of those submissions, Judge Dein upheld\n   the remainder of the Government Parties' privilege claims. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 15 Order.) Relying on the declarations proffered by the Government Parties, Judge Dein ruled that the Government Parties correctly applied executive privilege to AAFAF's advisors and properly withheld factual information that could not be segregated from deliberative material in documents withheld pursuant to the deliberative process privilege. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2-5.) Additionally, Judge Dein held that the attorney-client privilege applied to documents that the Government Parties shared with third parties. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7.) Because no materials were withheld exclusively under the work product doctrine, Judge Dein declined to address the merits of the Bondholders' challenge to the Government Parties' work product claims. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 16, 2019, the Bondholders filed the\n   <em>\n    Motion to Compel Production of Documents Withheld as Privileged Based on Respondents' May 9, 2019, Submissions\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6984, the \"Renewed Motion to Compel\"). In the Renewed Motion to Compel, the Bondholders stated that the Government Parties' supplemental submissions had not overcome their objections and that Judge Dein had issued the May 15 Order before they had the opportunity to so notify the Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 4.) While the Renewed Motion to Compel was pending, the Bondholders filed the Objection, on May 20, 2019. Subsequently, by way of the May 30 Order, Judge Dein denied the Renewed Motion to Compel, thereby declining to alter her rulings in the May 6 Order and the May 15 Order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Pursuant to a briefing schedule set by this Court, the Government Parties filed their Response to the Objection on June 6, 2019, and the Bondholders filed their Reply on June 13, 2019.

The Bondholders further contend that Judge Dein erred because (v) the Government Parties have not established that the attorney-client privilege applies to documents shared with third-party non-lawyers (Reply \u00b6\u00b6 23-26), (vi) the common interest doctrine does not apply vis-\u00e0-vis ERS and the other Government Parties (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 27-28), and (vii) Judge Dein should have conducted a substantive analysis of the Government Parties' work product claims given the possibility that either this Court or the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit could overrule the Government Parties' other privilege assertions, and the Government Parties failed to demonstrate that the materials withheld on work product grounds were prepared for use in litigation (\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 29). For the reasons that follow, each of the Bondholders' objections is overruled, and the Discovery Orders are affirmed.

(May 6 Order at 5.) In compliance with the May 6 Order, the Government Parties submitted the\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Declaration of Mohammad Yassin Mahmud in Support of Assertion of Deliberative Process Privilege by AAFAF\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6887, the \"Mahmud Declaration\") and the\n   <em>\n    Supplemental Declaration of Philippe Mesa Pab\u00f3n in Support of Assertion of Deliberative\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Process Privilege by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 6888, the Pab\u00f3n Declaration). After evaluating the Mahmud Declaration and the Pab\u00f3n Declaration, together with those declarations originally submitted in support of the Deliberative Process Motion (Docket Entry Nos. 457, 458, 459, in Case No. 17-3566), Judge Dein concluded that the Government Parties \"sufficiently demonstrated that any factual information imbedded in the withheld documents is either itself deliberative or is so intertwined with deliberative information that disclosure is not appropriate.\" (May 15 Order at 4.) Judge Dein later reaffirmed that determination, opining that the Government Parties had \"provide[d] sufficient detail concerning the withheld documents to carry their burden and show that factual information is intertwined with the privileged deliberations.\" (May 30 Order at 10-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The Bondholders contend that it was clear error for Judge Dein to accept the Mahmud Declaration and the Pab\u00f3n Declaration as sufficient to sustain the Government Parties' claims of deliberative process privilege. (Objection \u00b6 31.) They further aver that Judge Dein applied the wrong legal standard in the May 30 Order by considering whether the factual material was related to the deliberations, rather than considering whether revealing the facts would reveal the deliberations. (Reply \u00b6 11.) The Bondholders' arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   As both sides acknowledge, the relevant inquiry \"is not merely whether the documents contain factual information-or even whether the document is predominantly comprised of findings of fact-but rather the degree to which the facts are indissolubly linked to the broader analysis.\"\n   <em>\n    Stalcup v.

This question \"hinges on whether the documents were 'prepared to facilitate and inform a final decision or deliberative function entrusted to the agency.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4264307\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/768/65/#p70\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Providence Journal Co. v.

Here, it was not clear error for Judge Dein to conclude that the materials over which the Government Parties asserted the deliberative process privilege contained facts that were intertwined with deliberative analysis such that they could not be segregated and produced. In so holding, Judge Dein evaluated the declarations of several government officials in conjunction with the April 22 Log and the May 9 Log and determined, as a factual matter, that the Government Parties properly invoked the deliberative process privilege. Indeed, Judge Dein thoroughly addressed, and rejected, the Bondholders' theory that the \"pre-measures\" financial information withheld could not conceivably reveal proposals under consideration by the Government Parties. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   May 30 Order at 11 (\"To the extent that financial information is being used, AAFAF has made clear that those numbers, both pre- and post-measures, are part and parcel of the policy alternatives being discussed.\").) Having independently reviewed the relevant submissions, this Court finds no clear error in Judge Dein's conclusion that the disclosure of any of the imbedded factual information would also reveal privileged deliberative material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The Bondholders' argument that Judge Dein applied the incorrect legal standard similarly lacks merit. By stating that the factual information withheld by the Government Parties was \"part and parcel of the policy alternatives being discussed\" and \"tied to the deliberative communications between the officials\" (May 30 Order at 11), Judge Dein did not, as the Bondholders suggest, consider merely \"whether the facts were related to the deliberations\" (Reply at \u00b6 11). Rather, citing\n   <em>\n    Stalcup\n   </em>\n   ,\n   Judge Dein ruled that the Government Parties \"provid[ed] sufficient detail concerning the withheld documents to carry their burden and show that factual information is intertwined with the privileged deliberations.\" (May 30 Order at 10-11.) The May 30 Order therefore reflects and applies the proper legal standard-whether revealing the facts would reveal the deliberations. Accordingly, the Bondholders' objection to Judge Dein's ruling concerning factual materials withheld by the Government Parties is overruled.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Documents Created After Certification of the 2017 Fiscal Plan\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The Bondholders further challenge Judge Dein's holding in the May 6 Order that the deliberative process privilege applies to documents created after March 13, 2017-the date on which the Oversight Board certified the Commonwealth Fiscal Plan (the \"Fiscal Plan\")-because the enactment of J.R. 188 and Act 106 involved deliberative decisions. (Objection \u00b6\u00b6 32-39.) According to the Bondholders, \"Judge Dein wrongly treated [J.R.] 188 and Act 106 as separate 'decisions' for purposes of the privilege even though those laws did no more than execute decisions that had already been made in the March 13, 2017 [F]iscal [P]lan.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 32.) The Bondholders' argument rests upon the notion that the Oversight Board's broad authority under PROMESA to establish Commonwealth fiscal policy obviated the need for post-certification deliberations with respect to J.R. 188 and Act 106. Hence, in the Bondholders view, \"[o]nce the Oversight Board certified the new [F]iscal [P]lan on March 13, 2017, the Commonwealth and ERS were required by PROMESA to comply, and there was nothing left for them to deliberate about.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36 (citing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202141\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2).) The Bondholders further assert that the degree to which any documents related solely to the implementation of J.R. 188 and Act 106-in contrast to those documents concerning the underlying policy decision to adopt PayGo-\"should have at least affected the [deliberative process] balancing analysis[,]\" and that Judge Dein committed clear error by failing to take this into account.

Here, it was not clear error for Judge Dein to consider the legislature's enactments of J.R. 188 and Act 106-rather than the Oversight Board's March 13, 2017, certification of the Fiscal Plan-to be \"specific agency decision[s]\" to which the withheld documents relate for purposes of this privilege analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This Court has previously recognized that PROMESA neither abrogated the Commonwealth government's power to legislate nor vested the Oversight Board with such legislative authority.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Fin.

Consequently, as a legal matter, the Oversight Board's certification of the Fiscal Plan could not have been the sole governmental decision that led to the Commonwealth's implementation of the PayGo pension system. Instead, as Judge Dein accurately stated during the May 2, 2019, hearing, \"the [F]iscal [P]lan was merely a broad framework that governed the Governor's and legislature's separate, more detailed budgeting, spending, and legislative decisions ....\" (Transcript of May 2, 2019 Hearing (Docket Entry No. 498 in Case No. 17-3566.) at 19:7-9.) Consistent with that characterization, following the Oversight Board's certification of the Fiscal Plan, the Government Parties did in fact engage in substantial deliberation and decision making in connection with the enactment and implementation of J.R. 188 and Act 106. (\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Response \u00b6 21 (summarizing the \"broad principles\" set forth in the Fiscal Plan),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 23 (enumerating the specific components of Act 106 not addressed in the Fiscal Plan).) Judge Dein thus correctly considered J.R. 188 and Act 106 \"agency decisions\" for the purpose of her deliberative process privilege analysis. Accordingly, this Court affirms Judge Dein's conclusions that deliberative decisions were made after March 13, 2017, and that the Government Parties properly withheld all materials reflecting those decisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Waiver of the Deliberative Process Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Bondholders also argue that it was clear error for Judge Dein to apply the deliberative process privilege to inter-agency memoranda on the basis that the Government Parties share a common goal. (Objection \u00b6 46.) Any deliberative privilege that may have attached, the Bondholders assert, was waived due to the Government Parties' inherently adverse relationships with one another. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In support of their position, the Bondholders point out that, at the outset of these Title III cases, the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities owed ERS more than $411 million in past due employer contributions.

Supp. 3d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 247 (D.D.C. 2017) (\"The deliberative process can ... span between two different agencies.\") (citation omitted). Here, as indicated in the Response, each of the Government Parties, as well as the Oversight Board, is an entity or instrumentality within the Commonwealth government. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Response \u00b6\u00b6 32-34.). As such, where the Government Parties share a common interest, they are entitled to invoke the deliberative process privilege with respect to materials shared with one another that pertain to that interest. In the May 6 Order, Judge Dein held that \"[a]lthough [the Government Parties'] interests may not always be aligned, in connection with the discovery sought for the Stay Relief Motion, they do share a common interest in effective pension reform for the benefit\n   of pensioners and are afforded the deliberative process privilege when acting in a concerted effort toward that goal.\" (May 6 Order at 3-4.) That determination was neither clearly erroneous nor contrary to law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The Bondholders' arguments predicated on the Commonwealth's and ERS's debtor-creditor relationship and the Oversight Board's status as a federal entity are unfounded and, hence, do not warrant a departure from Judge Dein's rulings. As to the former argument, although the Bondholders are correct that ERS is an independent trust separate from other Commonwealth agencies to which the Commonwealth was, at the start of these Title III cases, indebted in the amount of $411 million (Objection \u00b6 43 (citing 3 L.P.R.A. \u00a7 775 )), the Bondholders present no authority or other compelling argument in support of their position that, in light of these circumstances, there can be no common interest between the Commonwealth and ERS. Therefore, finding no clear error in Judge Dein's determination that the Commonwealth and ERS had a mutual interest in benefiting employees by assuring the flow of pension payments to retirees, nor any improper application of law in the conclusion that the interest permits them to invoke the deliberative process privilege over materials shared with one another, this Court overrules Respondents' objections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Turning to the latter argument, the Government Parties are correct that PROMESA describes the Oversight Board as \"an entity within the territorial government for which it is established ...[,]\" here, the Commonwealth government.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=48%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202121\">\n    48 U.S.C. \u00a7 2121\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1). The Bondholders nevertheless maintain that the First Circuit's holding in\n   <em>\n    Aurelius\n   </em>\n   -that the Oversight Board is a \"federal entity\"-renders the plain language of PROMESA inapplicable. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply \u00b6 20.) The Court finds the Bondholders' reading of\n   <em>\n    Aurelius\n   </em>\n   overbroad and misplaced. Nowhere in the First Circuit's decision is the term \"federal entity\" used to refer to the Oversight Board. Instead, the court held that the Oversight Board's members are \"federal officers\" and, more specifically, \"principal officers of the United States,\"-a term of art used almost exclusively in the context of Appointments Clause jurisprudence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Aurelius\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12520105\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/915/838/\">\n    915 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   850 &amp; 859-60 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Perez v.

As a result, it is far from established that\n   <em>\n    Aurelius\n   </em>\n   's reach extends beyond the Appointments Clause context and, in any event, it was certainly not clearly erroneous or contrary to law for Judge Dein to read the decision more narrowly. Accordingly, the Court rejects the Bondholders' contention that the Oversight Board's status as a \"federal entity\" negates its common interest with the Government Parties in the context of the deliberative process privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   D.\n   <em>\n    Substantial Need\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The Bondholders assert that, even if the deliberative process privilege were to apply, their substantial need for the materials at issue outweighs any harm that would result from disclosure. (Objection \u00b6 25.) Judge Dein erred, they maintain, in finding that \"[t]he factual information necessary for the Bondholders to present their position to the Court on [the Stay Relief Motion] has been produced,\" and for that reason declining to order disclosure of deliberative materials. (Objection \u00b6 26 (quoting May 6 Order at 5) (alterations in original).) The Bondholders insist that\n   \"[t]he deliberations underlying the decision to abandon the longstanding ERS system for the ostensibly new PayGo system are critically important\" for the following three reasons:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   First, there can be no stronger evidence of the equivalence of employer contributions and PayGo fees than evidence that the creators of the PayGo system considered them equivalent or took steps to make their equivalence. Second, the fact that the authors of the PayGo system expressed the intention to divert the Bondholders' collateral is compelling evidence that the PayGo fees are simply diverted employer contributions. Finally, evidence that a motivation behind PayGo was to avoid paying the Bondholders the value they were owed, while continuing to make employers contribute to the pension plan, is strong evidence that the PayGo plan is pretextual and that the employer contributions were never truly eliminated in the first place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 27.) They further submit that, \"[c]ontrary to Judge Dein's mistaken reasoning, these proofs are not simply about 'intent': evidence of how the PayGo system was designed is strongly probative of whether or not the Bondholders' collateral continues to exist.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The Bondholders' arguments are unavailing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   This Court recently held, in connection with the parties' dispute concerning the admissibility at the upcoming hearing on the Stay Relief Motion of testimony concerning a statement allegedly linking threatened elimination of ERS bondholders' collateral with the PayGo concept, that \"evidence of intent to circumvent rights in collateral is, at best, of marginal relevance to the central question to be considered at the Stay Relief Hearing: whether bondholders have any security interest in employer payments under the PayGo system established by the Pension Reform Legislation.\" (\n   <em>\n    Memorandum Order Granting Respondents' Urgent Motion In Limine\n   </em>\n   (Docket Entry No. 7222, the \"June 5 Order\") at 5.) As explained in the June 5 Order, the question of an ongoing security interest will turn principally on the interpretation and application of the terms of the applicable Bond Resolution and Commonwealth statutes. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) The centrality of these issues similarly blunts the Bondholders' ability to demonstrate that they have a substantial need for information covered by the deliberative process privilege. The potentiality that evidence of an intent on the part of Government Parties to eliminate Bondholders' secured interests could bolster their arguments concerning the legal effects of the relevant documents and legislation is insufficient to demonstrate the requisite substantial need for the deliberative information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   To be sure, the Bondholders identify numerous instances where courts have ordered production of deliberative materials regarding intent or other conditions of mind. (\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reply \u00b6 10.)

This Court is sensitive to the Bondholders' legitimate concerns in this regard. However, rather than categorically preclude the Government Parties from offering any evidence on this topic at this juncture, the Court denies the Bondholders' request for broad preclusion without prejudice to objections to proffers of particular items of evidence.

She also determined that the third parties \"served a critical role in translating complex information necessary to effectuate the restructuring.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Additionally, after Judge Dein directed the Government Parties to submit a supplemental, document-by-document privilege log to enable her to evaluate whether the communications in Category 3 served a legal or business purpose, she concluded that all the communications involving third parties over which attorney-client privilege was asserted either related to an ongoing litigation, related to the legality of policy or legislative proposals, or provided or reflected legal advice. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 8-9.) As the Government Parties correctly point out, the complex and unprecedented nature of Puerto Rico's restructuring \"require[s] that [they] retain advisors to help with this effort.\" (Response \u00b6 63.) Where, as here, \" 'the complexities of modern existence prevent attorneys from effectively handling clients' affairs without the help of others,' the attorney-client 'privilege must include all the persons who act as the attorney's agents.' \"\n   <em>\n    Cavallaro\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9506428\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/284/236/#p246\">\n    284 F.3d at 247\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v. Kovel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"218832\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/296/918/#p921\">\n    296 F.2d 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 921 (2d Cir. 1961) ). In short, it is readily apparent that Judge Dein scrutinized the applicable entries of the Government Parties' privilege logs-as this Court, too, has done-and reasonably determined that the third parties at issue served a necessary role acting as translators with respect to both legal advice and various government related issues. Her decision regarding that necessity was not clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Common Interest\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   The Bondholders also contend that Judge Dein applied the wrong legal standard in concluding that the common interest doctrine protects communications between ERS and the other Government Parties. (Objection \u00b6 52.) According to the Bondholders, Judge Dein erred by relying on a California bankruptcy case-\n   <em>\n    In re Mortg. &amp; Realty Tr.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940614\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/212/649/#p653\">\n    212 B.R. 649\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 653 (Bankr. C.D. Cal. 1997) -which held that the common interest privilege \"applies where the interests of the parties are not identical, and it applies even where the parties' interests are adverse in substantial respects.\" (Objection \u00b6 52 (quoting May 6 Order at 8).) The Bondholders explain that, in the First Circuit, \"[t]he term 'common interest' typically entails an identical (or nearly identical) legal interest as opposed to a merely similar interest.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"940614\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/br/212/649/#p653\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    FDIC v. Ogden Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"917840\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/202/454/#p461\">\n    202 F.3d 454\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 461 (1st Cir. 2000) ). They also claim that ERS and the other Government Parties cannot meet the First Circuit's more stringent standard. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 53.) The Bondholders again miss the mark.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Although the Bondholders are correct that the standard in the First Circuit for evaluating whether there is a common interest is stricter than the standard cited by Judge Dein, it does not follow that, in applying Judge Dein's reasoning to the more stringent standard, the result would\n   differ-it would not. Judge Dein recognized that \"ERS and the Commonwealth may be adverse in some respects,\" but \"with respect to the issues presently before the Court, they share a common interest in pension reform for the benefit of pensioners.\" (May 6 Order at 8.) Nothing in the May 6 Order or the other Discovery Orders suggests that the \"common interest in pension reform for the benefit of pensioners\" does not constitute a \"nearly identical legal interest\" sufficient to trigger the doctrine articulated in\n   <em>\n    FDIC\n   </em>\n   . Similarly, neither\n   <em>\n    FDIC\n   </em>\n   nor any other authority in the First Circuit mandates that parties have nearly identical interests\n   <em>\n    in all respects\n   </em>\n   for the common interest doctrine to attach. Here, the Government Parties all have identical interests in both maintaining retirees' benefits and \"restoring Puerto Rico to fiscal responsibility and prosperity.\" (Response \u00b6 71.) Therefore, it was neither clear error nor contrary to law for Judge Dein to recognize the common interest doctrine as applicable to the subject communications between ERS and the other Government Parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   <em>\n    Work Product Doctrine and Executive Privilege\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Finally, because this Court upholds Judge Dein's rulings with respect to the attorney-client privilege, it concurs in her determination that there is no need to address the validity of the Government Parties' work product claims.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lazare Kaplan Int'l, Inc. v.
