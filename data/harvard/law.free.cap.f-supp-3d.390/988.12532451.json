For the following reasons, Plaintiff's Motion for Summary Judgment is denied, Defendant's Motion for Summary Judgment is granted, and Plaintiff's Motion to Stay is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On September 16, 2016, Plaintiff Maureen Johnson was involved in a motor vehicle collision. At the time, Plaintiff was operating a 2005 Ford E150 Econoline Van, which was owned by her employer, TestAmerica Environmental Services, LLC. TestAmerica had automobile insurance coverage on the van through Travelers Insurance Company, which provided $1,000,000 in underinsured motorist (\"UIM\") coverage. Alma Xiloj, the individual driving the vehicle that collided with the van driven by Plaintiff, was insured by Trader's Insurance Company and her policy had a bodily injury liability limit of $25,000. In addition, Jeffrey Johnson, Plaintiff's husband, had an automobile insurance policy through Defendant Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois. The policy provided coverage for three vehicles: a 2013 Ford F150, a 2005 Ford Focus, and a 2015 Ford Explorer. These vehicles were not involved in the September 2016 collision. For each insured vehicle, the policy provided $250,000 for each person in underinsured motorist coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In January 2018, Plaintiff filed a lawsuit in Missouri state court against Xiloj. On May 22, 2018, Plaintiff entered into a covenant not to execute with Xiloj. Prior to agreeing to the covenant not to execute, Plaintiff sought Defendant's consent for her to accept $25,000, the applicable limit of Xiloj's policy. In the communication to Defendant, Plaintiff's counsel, in addition to asking for Defendant's consent, stated \"I presume you have no issues with this - since Traveler's is holding the primary policy.\" Doc. #27-9, at 2.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendant consented and also specified: \"As you mention, you would want to secure Travelers' consent as well as they are handling the UIM claim for [Plaintiff] under their primary policy.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1. In May 2018, a bench trial was held in the lawsuit against Xiloj. The state court entered a judgment in the amount of $5,000,000. As agreed, Trader's paid Plaintiff $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In June 2018, Plaintiff's counsel sent a letter to Defendant and Travelers demanding $1,000,000 from each company. In July 2018, Travelers tendered its UIM coverage limit of $1,000,000 to Plaintiff. Defendant determined its UIM coverage would apply on an excess basis because Travelers provided primary coverage. According to Defendant, Plaintiff's recovery of UIM insurance could not exceed the\n   highest applicable UIM coverage limit for any applicable policy. Travelers' UIM coverage limit of $1,000,000 was greater than the UIM coverage limit in the policy purchased from Defendant. Therefore, Defendant determined Plaintiff's maximum recovery of UIM insurance was $1,000,000. Because Plaintiff had already been paid $1,000,000, Defendant denied coverage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In August 2018, Plaintiff filed this matter seeking a determination of Defendant's obligations under the policy. Doc. #1. Both parties now move for summary judgment. Docs. #26, 35. Plaintiff also filed a motion to stay. Doc. #28.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, because Travelers also provided UIM coverage, Defendant's potential obligation to UIM did not arise until the liability limits of the Travelers' policy was exhausted by payment. Doc. #1-1, at 39. Second, because Plaintiff was driving a vehicle she did not own and Travelers provided UIM coverage on a primary basis, UIM coverage under Defendant's policy is \"excess\" to the UIM coverage provided by Travelers's policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Third, Defendant's \"maximum limit of liability\" and \"the most [it] will pay\" Plaintiff in UIM benefits for her bodily injury damages, regardless of the circumstances, is $250,000, which is the amount of UIM coverage for which Plaintiff's husband contracted.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9, 11, 40. Fourth, Plaintiff's recovery of UIM benefits for damages under \"all such policies\" (Travelers' and Defendant's policies) \"may equal but not exceed the highest applicable limit for any one vehicle under\" any policy.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41. Travelers' UIM coverage limit was $1,000,000, and as such, Plaintiff's recovery under both policies was limited to $1,000,000. Because Plaintiff received $1,000,000 from Travelers, she was paid the \"highest applicable limit\" and received the total amount of UIM benefits she could receive under the policy issued by Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   These provisions do not demonstrate \"duplicity, indistinctness or uncertainty in the meaning of the policy,\" and the policy is not \"reasonably open to different constructions.\"\n   <em>\n    Gulf Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10023217\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/936/810/#p814\">\n    936 S.W.2d at 814\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, and unlike the cases cited by Plaintiff in support of her summary judgment motion, the policy does not expressly promise UIM coverage in every circumstance and does not guarantee UIM coverage equal to or greater than the UIM coverage limit to which Plaintiff's husband contracted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Swadley v. Shelter Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12373227\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/513/355/#p357\">\n    513 S.W.3d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (Mo. banc 2017) (finding the policy was not ambiguous when it restricted \"UIM coverage to applying only when the underinsured motorist has liability coverage less than the UIM limit\"). The Court finds the policy is unambiguous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Plaintiff argues the UIM coverage is illusory in that she would never have UIM coverage through Defendant if any other UIM coverage was available. Doc. #27, at 11. But Plaintiff's argument is not accurate. Applying the policy to slightly modified facts in the case before the Court demonstrates this inaccuracy. For example, if the Travelers' policy provided UIM coverage limited to $50,000 (instead of $1,000,000), no other collective UIM insurance were applicable, and Travelers paid Plaintiff $50,000, Defendant would pay UIM benefits to Plaintiff. However, pursuant to the policy, Plaintiff's recovery would be limited to the \"highest applicable limit\" provided by either (Travelers' or Defendant's) policy. In this hypothetical, the highest applicable limit for UIM insurance would be $250,000, as set forth in Defendant's policy. Once Travelers paid its UIM liability limits to Plaintiff, Defendant would then be obligated to pay Plaintiff $200,000 in UIM insurance. Thus, Plaintiff would receive the benefit for which her husband contracted - i.e., a total of $250,000 in UIM insurance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Plaintiff also argues the second paragraph in the \"other insurance\" provision grants excess coverage. Doc. #27, at 19. Initially, Plaintiff relies on the first sentence of that paragraph, which states, \"[a]ny underinsured motorist coverage we provide with respect to a vehicle you do not own shall be excess over any collective underinsured motorist insurance providing coverage on a primary basis.\" Doc. #1-1, at 41. But this Court cannot limit its analysis to one sentence and consider the sentence in a vacuum.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Columbia Mut. Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11828187\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/967/74/#p77\">\n    967 S.W.2d at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The next sentence provides: \"However, the\n   <strong>\n    maximum limit of our liability shall not exceed the highest limit applicable to any one auto\n   </strong>\n   .\" Doc. #1-1, at 41 (emphasis added). This statement could not be clearer. The policy limits Plaintiff's UIM coverage to the \"highest limit\" of UIM coverage available from the applicable insurance policies. Tellingly, Plaintiff provides no argument as to how the statement could be reasonably open to different conclusions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Moreover, and contrary to Plaintiff's argument, the \"other insurance\" provision does not \"grant excess coverage.\" Instead, it declares that any UIM insurance Plaintiff may collect from Defendant will be \"excess over any collectible\" UIM insurance provided by a primary insurer, and the most Plaintiff will receive from Defendant in UIM insurance will not exceed \"the highest limit applicable to any one vehicle.\" Doc. #1-1, at 41. Travelers was the primary insurer, and its UIM coverage was limited to $1,000,000. Defendant's policy was limited to $250,000 in UIM coverage per vehicle; thus, the Travelers policy provided the \"highest limit applicable to any one auto.\" Plaintiff received that amount.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The UIM coverage in Defendant's policy \"provides a total amount of protection to be paid to the [insured] if other persons legally responsible for [the insured's] injuries have lesser liability limits than those provided under the [insured's] underinsured motorist coverage.\"\n   <em>\n    Rodriguez\n   </em>\n   , 808 S.W.2d at 382 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Goodwillie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%209718251\">\n    2007 WL 9718251\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2. Because Travelers' UIM coverage limit was $1,000,000, and therefore, above the UIM coverage limit in Defendant's policy, Plaintiff is not entitled to any UIM coverage from Defendant. Therefore, the Court grants Defendant's\n   motion for summary judgment and denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The Court's decision granting summary judgment in Defendant's favor on the first issue raised in the parties' briefs is dispositive, and thus, it is unnecessary for the Court to consider the other issues raised by the parties. However, there is at least one concern the Court has regarding Plaintiff's argument that she is entitled to stack\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   the UIM coverage of $250,000 for each of the three vehicles insured by Defendant for a total of $750,000 in UIM benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   If and only if the Court were to find intra-policy stacking was permitted by the policy, it is unclear which portion of the policy would entitle Plaintiff to recover an additional $750,000. Instead, the \"other insurance\" provision, as discussed above,\n   <em>\n    limits\n   </em>\n   Plaintiff's recovery for damages under \"all such policies or provisions\" providing UIM coverage. Doc. #1-1, at 41. Plaintiff's recovery of UIM benefits under all applicable policies \"may equal but not exceed the highest applicable limit for any one vehicle under any insurance providing [UIM] coverage on either a primary or excess basis.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2007%20WL%209718251\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Travelers' UIM coverage limit was $1,000,000, which, according to the policy issued by Defendant, limits Plaintiff's total recovery of UIM benefits to $1,000,000. So, even if the UIM coverage for the three insured vehicles could be stacked for a total of $750,000, that amount is less than the amount Plaintiff already received. Consequently, how Plaintiff would be entitled to and recover more than $1,000,000 in UIM benefits remains puzzling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   <strong>\n    III. MOTION TO STAY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Also pending is Plaintiff's motion to stay these proceedings until the Eighth Circuit decides\n   <em>\n    Strain v. Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois\n   </em>\n   , No. 18-1587 (8th Cir.).\n   <em>\n    Strain\n   </em>\n   involves identical policy language, and the Eighth Circuit will decide whether an insured may stack UIM coverage for three vehicles covered by Defendant's policy. Because the Court grants summary judgment on the first issue and does not consider intra-policy stacking, it is unnecessary to stay this matter pending the Eighth Circuit's decision in\n   <em>\n    Strain\n   </em>\n   . Therefore, Plaintiff's motion to stay is denied as moot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the Court grants Defendant's motion for summary judgment, denies Plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, and denies as moot Plaintiff's motion to stay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   IT IS SO ORDERED.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Unless otherwise noted, the facts in this section are uncontroverted by the parties.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    All references to page numbers indicate the pagination generated by ECF when a document is filed.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    The parties do not dispute Missouri law applies.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Other courts have reached the same conclusion when faced with similar policies.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Goodwillie v.
