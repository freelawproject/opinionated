Shah, United States District Judge\n   Certifications help consumers assess products. In the market for dental services, specialty boards issue certifications to dentists that meet certain criteria, and patients use those certifications to identify qualified dentists. Right now, allegedly, the only organization issuing certifications to dentists in the United States that specialize in oral implantology is one of the defendants, the American Board of Oral Implantology. This board has in turn received a certification from another defendant, the American Board of Dental Specialties (a certifier of certifiers). The plaintiffs-two entities that also issue certifications-allege that the defendants' market stronghold violates both \u00a7 1 and \u00a7 2 of the Sherman Act. They add that the defendants have disparaged plaintiffs' goods in violation of the Illinois Uniform Deceptive Trade Practices Act. The defendants say that nothing is preventing the plaintiffs from issuing their own certifications, and there is nothing illegal about defendants' conduct. They move to dismiss the complaint in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Facts\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   People that need dental implants have imperfect information; they need a capable dentist but often lack the time and know-how to distinguish between a hack and a crackerjack. They might rely on someone else's opinion, especially if that someone is particularly skilled at telling the two apart. In the dentistry field, that someone could be a \"specialty certifying board\"; a group that issues certifications to dentists who meet certain criteria (and pay the required fee).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 2-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The more that patients trust the specialty certifying board, the more dentists value their certifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1083\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Ordinarily, specialty certifying boards would compete based on the quality of the information they provide. But state governments have regulated this market by, among other things, restricting dentists'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   ability to advertise their certifications. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 48. Many states prohibit advertising a dental certification unless it was issued by a specialty certifying board that has been approved by the American Dental Association. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 3, 11, 12, 48, 49.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants include three entities that have changed this regulatory landscape. [1] \u00b6 63. The American Academy of Implant Dentistry is an Illinois corporation with its principle place of business in Suite 750B of a building in Chicago. [1] \u00b6 31. The Academy provides continuing education and training opportunities to its members, hosts conferences, and publishes an industry newsletter.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The American Board of Dental Specialties is an Illinois corporation based in Suite 750C. [1] \u00b6 29. Like the American Dental Association, the Board of Dental Specialties reviews and approves specialty boards that wish to issue certifications. [1] \u00b6 29. Since its creation in 1967, it has only approved one board in the field of oral implantology: the American Board of Oral Implantology. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 30, 60. The American Board of Oral Implantology is an Illinois corporation that issues certifications to dentists that practice oral implantology (and provides other continuing education services). [1] \u00b6 30. It is based in Suite 750.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3577795\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/526/1074/#p1083\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   These entities' efforts to change the status quo included lobbying and litigation. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 12, 63, 65. In New Jersey, the American Board of Dental Specialties petitioned the state's board of dentistry to relax its advertising restrictions. [1] \u00b6 65. Elsewhere, the Academy filed a lawsuit alleging that Indiana violated the Sherman Act when it delegated regulatory authority to the American Dental Association. [1] \u00b6 69. There are other examples, the earliest of which dates back to 2010.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 63, 64, 70, 71. In the process, the defendants told state legislatures and courts that, if granted the authority to approve specialty certifying boards themselves, they would be neutral and impartial. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 14, 70, 72.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants have also sought to influence public opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 73. During an interview, the Academy's general counsel (Frank Recker) said that the Board of Dental Specialties would \"not consider competition, political decisions, or turf wars,\" and that its decisions would not be \"made by a group of competitors who could be economically or politically affected by their own decisions.\" [1] \u00b6 73. Ronald Brown, the former secretary of the Board of Dental Specialties, wrote that \"[i]t is hoped for that the [Board of Dental Specialties] will take over from the ADA with respect to emerging dental specialties.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 74.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Their efforts have partially paid off: in at least six states, dentists are not restricted to advertising only ADA-approved certifications. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 13, 75;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   footnote 8\n   below. Until one of them-Ohio-finishes amending its rules, dentists there can only advertise their certifications if they were issued by specialty certifying boards approved by either the American Dental Association or the American Board of Dental Specialties. [40] at 13 n.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiffs are in the business of oral implantology certifications, too.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 7. Similar to the Academy, plaintiff International Congress of Oral Implantologists provides continuing education services. [1] \u00b6 7. It also issues certifications to oral implantologists. [1] \u00b6 44. In 2017, it formed plaintiff United States Board of Implantology, which wants to be approved by the American Board of Dental Specialties as a specialty certifying board (like the American Board of Oral Implantology) for dentists in the field of oral implantology. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 7, 45. It has designed its own rigorous process for determining whether an oral implantology specialist should receive a certification. [1] \u00b6 46.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The United States Board of Oral Implantology set out to obtain that approval in early 2018. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 16, 87. It submitted an application to the American Board of Dental Specialties that, according to the complaint, satisfied all of the relevant criteria (and included the $ 7,500 filing fee). [1] \u00b6 91. It heard back about a month later, when Cheryl Parker (the executive director of both the American Board of Dental Specialties and the Academy) replied in writing (copying Dr. Michael Mashni, president of the American Board of Dental Specialties) to say that they had \"suspended applications pending a comprehensive update to the application form.\" [1] \u00b6 92. She also returned the filing fee.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The United States Board of Oral Implantology demanded that the American Board of Dental Specialties complete the revisions quickly, [1] \u00b6\u00b6 21, 92-98, 100-102, and even offered to assist with the finalization of the application, [1] \u00b6 99, but the revised form did not arrive for eight months. [1] \u00b6 103. When it came, it included only minor changes to the substantive requirements of the original application, [1] \u00b6\u00b6 23, 88-89, 104, plus two procedural changes: (1) any new applications had to be submitted by February 1, 2019, and would not be considered until January of 2020,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 24, 105, and (2) any appeals would be limited to procedural issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 25, 106. The defendants say the United States Board of Oral Implantology has not submitted a new application. [42] at 7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The plaintiff's theory is that these actions harmed competition. They acknowledge that the defendants' lobbying and litigation efforts are protected, [1] \u00b6 76, but say that the way they have exercised their authority shows it \"was all a sham\" meant to further \"deceptive, anticompetitive, monopolistic behavior.\" [1] \u00b6 77. They also allege that the defendants have constructively denied their application, and that the delay itself is harmful.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 21, 84, 107; [40] at 18-19.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, they allege that the intent was to protect the American Board of Oral Implantology's monopoly on certifying dentists as oral implantology specialists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 19. Without the approval of the American Board of Dental Specialties to issue certifications, the United States Board of Oral Implantology will have trouble attracting customers because its certifications will not come with the usual benefits (e.g., the ability to advertise the certification, charge more for performing procedures, and receive reimbursements from insurance companies at increased rates). [1] \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26, 51, 110. And,\n   as a result, the United States Board of Oral Implantology will lose membership dues, certification fees, and revenues associated with providing other professional services.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 111. This in turn will affect membership in the International Congress of Implantologists, because members of the United States Board of Oral Implantology must also be members of the International Congress of Implantologists. [1] \u00b6 112.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Lastly, plaintiffs allege the defendants have made false and misleading representations of fact. [1] \u00b6 128. According to the complaint, defendants told graduates of a renowned implantology institute that the United States Board of Oral Implantology would never be recognized as an organization capable of certifying oral implantology specialists. [1] \u00b6 81. The American Board of Oral Implantology also published a newsletter in which its president (Kevin O'Grady) said that the United States Board of Oral Implantology does not have \"the experience, knowledge and history to administer a psychometrically and legally defensible examination.\" [1] \u00b6\u00b6 82, 128. O'Grady also allegedly urged members of the Academy to tell other dentists that the United States Board of Oral Implantology \"is not a 'bona fide credential.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   All of this-the constructive denial of the application, the lobbying and litigation, the statements to the press, and the creation of a \"front organization\" (presumably, the American Board of Dental Specialties), combined with the fact that the defendants are attempting to redirect internet traffic to their website by including the term \"ICOI\" in their website metatags-are, according to the complaint, part of a conspiracy to restrain trade and maintain a monopoly in the market for oral implantology specialty certifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 1-2, 5, 79.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Plaintiffs define the relevant markets as follows: \"(i) the market for certifying dentists as oral implantology specialists, and (ii) the markets to provide professional services associated with such certifications (e.g., continuing education courses, journal and other publication subscriptions, and conferences).\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 113. They allege that there are no effective or reasonable substitutes in either market,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 114, and that the relevant geographic market is the United States. [1] \u00b6 115.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

The defendants say this was not a denial of the application,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [34] at 15, but there is little difference between a denial and a declination to consider an application. And according to the complaint, it was all a ruse; their true intent was to permanently prevent the plaintiffs from entering the market. [1] \u00b6 19; [40] at 18-19. The harm here includes the refusal to consider the application, and that sets this case apart from those where the only\n   alleged harm is the anticipated denial of the application.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The return of the application is harm enough. Even if the plaintiffs had immediately submitted a new application under the revised guidelines, and even if the defendants had granted that application, plaintiffs still would have suffered a two-year delay.

There is no allegation that any one defendant is a wholly owned (or even partially owned) subsidiary of another. There is no explicit allegation that any of them share profits. Absent the alleged conspiracy, each would be independent decision makers pursuing related but distinct economic interests: the Academy's interests in obtaining new, dues-paying members would be distinct from the American Board of\n   Dental Specialties interest in receiving new, fee-generating applications from hopeful specialty certifying boards, which would be distinct from the American Board of Oral Implantology's interest in receiving new, fee-generating applications from hopeful oral implantology specialists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [40] at 26-27.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Insofar as the complaint alleges that they all operate \"as a single enterprise with common actors and common goals,\" it alleges that the conspiracy is what unites them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   There is a snag, but not a determinative one.

The first is the forming of the American Board of Dental Specialties.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3556136\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/550/544/#p555\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Leaving aside the observation that this was an action taken by the American Board of Oral Implantology and three non-defendants, [1] \u00b6 55, forming an independent entity to serve as a body that approves specialty certifying boards is not an action so unusual or indicative of restricted freedom that it gives rise to an inference of an anticompetitive agreement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   The only other allegedly parallel, non-protected action was the constructive denial of the United State Board of Oral Implantology's application. [40] at 22. But the complaint does not allege facts that suggest the defendants conspired together to accomplish that result; the American Board of Dental Specialties (along with defendants Parker and Mashni, discussed below) acted unilaterally.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 86-106. The complaint says that their conduct \"reveal[s] the hidden hands of [their] sponsors,\" [1] \u00b6 107, but does not explain how or why. At most, one other application was denied without citation to a \"legitimate, substantive\" reason, [40] at 29 n.18, but without knowing the total number of applications, these two instances fail to raise the inference that the decisions were anything other than routine, independent decisions by the certifying entity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The other allegations do not push the plaintiffs' theory from possible to plausible. Allegations about market share could be used to suggest a vertical conspiracy, but such allegations are more compelling in the horizontal-agreement context (when they are necessary to show the conspiracy could have been effective). In the context of a vertical agreement, the fact that the American Board of Oral Implantology has a 100% market share is at most consistent with the inference the plaintiffs seek to raise, rather than a necessary precondition; the defendants are in theory depending on the American Board of Dental Specialties to perpetuate the monopoly, so the fact that the American Board of Oral Implantology has power is beside the point. Nor is the market naturally \"ripe for collusion,\" at least not for the reason the plaintiffs say it is. The complaint does not explain in what way the American Board of Dental Specialties needed either the Academy or the American Board of Oral Implantology to restrict access to the relevant market.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [40] at 23. If there was a profit-sharing arrangement, the American Board of Dental Specialties might need the\n   American Board of Oral Implantology or the Academy to pass along the money it received from its applicants and members, respectively, but there is no such allegation. Nothing else about the market for certifications suggests it is uniquely suited to collusion (other than, perhaps, the fact that there are only a few entities-the ADA and the American Board of Dental Specialties-that are empowered to approve the boards that issue the certifications).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The defendants did make public statements critical of the United States Board of Oral Implantology, but those statements do not \"endorse[ ] an industry strategy to reduce ... output,\" or otherwise plausibly suggest concerted efforts to restrain trade.\n   <em>\n    Standard Iron Works v. ArcelorMittal\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178449\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/639/877/#p897\">\n    639 F.Supp.2d 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 897 (N.D. Ill. 2009). They simply reflect the belief that the United States Board of Oral Implantology's product was inferior. And even if the defendants had the opportunity to collude because they shared office space, [40] at 23-24, those allegations are less compelling in the context of a vertical conspiracy when there are plenty of \"legitimate reasons to exchange information.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Monsanto Co. v.

Taken together and as a whole, the allegations in the complaint fall short of plausibly suggesting a conspiracy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   For some of the defendants, the complaint is silent about their role in a conspiracy. Lozada is the vice president of the American Board of Oral Implantology, and has held positions at the Academy and American Board of Dental Specialties as well. [1] \u00b6 36. Gowey is the director of the American Board of Oral Implantology and the secretary of the American Board of Dental Specialties. [1] \u00b6 35. Together, the complaint alleges that they \"directed\" the conduct of the defendants, [1] \u00b6\u00b6 33-37, an accusation made somewhat more believable by the fact that they all shared office space. But that is it, and that is not enough. O'Grady is the president of the American Board of Oral Implantology (and a former president of both the Academy and the American Board of Dental Specialties). [1] \u00b6 34. To the degree the complaint alleges that he was involved in the conspiracy, it ties his liability to the allegedly derogatory remarks he made in a summer newsletter.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [40] at 25; [1] \u00b6 82. That, too, falls short of plausibly alleging that he conspired to violate the Sherman Act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The complaint does not fare much better with the other individual defendants. First, directors of an organization cannot conspire with their organization-that is covered by\n   <em>\n    Copperweld\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207619\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/752/#p759\">\n    467 U.S. at 769\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6207619\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/467/752/#p759\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"officers or employees of the same firm do not provide the plurality of actors imperative for a \u00a7 1 conspiracy\")-so Cherly Parker did not conspire with either the American Board of Dental Specialties or the Academy because she is a director of both. [1] \u00b6 33. And Dr. Mashni did not conspire with the American Board of Dental Specialties because he is its president. [1] \u00b6 37. At most, the complaint alleges that Parker participated in the denial of the United States Board of Implantology's application because she favored the Academy's interests over the American Board of Dental Specialties' interests. But a preference is not a suggestion of an agreement and is at most consistent with a conspiracy.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Iqbal,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    556 U.S. at 678\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3653744\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/556/662/#p677\">\n    129 S.Ct. 1937\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]here a complaint pleads facts that are merely consistent with a defendant's liability, it stops short of the line between possibility and plausibility of entitlement to relief\");\n   <em>\n    Standard Iron Works,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4178449\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/639/877/#p897\">\n    639 F.Supp.2d at 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[w]hile the complaint need not contain detailed 'defendant by defendant' allegations, it 'must allege that each individual\n   defendant joined the conspiracy and played some role in it because, at the heart of an antitrust conspiracy is an agreement and a conscious decision by each defendant to join it' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The Academy's alleged involvement is also minimal. It chartered the American Board of Oral Implantology in 1967, [1] \u00b6 6, and almost fifty years later, engaged in protected lobbying and litigation. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 13, 70. \"Generally,\" dentists have to make payments to both the specialty certifying board (the American Board of Oral Implantology) \"and/or\" its sponsoring organization (the Academy) in order to receive a certification,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 1, 4, so the Academy may have had a motive for preserving the market share of the American Board of Oral Implantology. And it shared office space with the other defendants, so it had an opportunity. But nothing it did suggests an agreement to restrict competition; it was all either protected activity or innocuous and consistent with competitive instinct.\n   <em>\n    In re Text Messaging Antitrust Litig.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6052985\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/630/622/#p629\">\n    630 F.3d at 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The allegations against the American Board of Oral Implantology are similarly modest. Allegedly, it has a monopoly in the market for oral implantology certifications.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6 5; [40] at 23. But it has that monopoly as a result of actions taken by a different entity (the American Board of Dental Specialties), and the complaint does not allege facts suggesting even basic details about the terms of an agreement the two might have shared. The complaint does allege that the American Board of Oral Implantology acted as \"puppet-master\" while pulling strings at the American Board of Dental Specialties, [1] \u00b6 19, but neglects to include facts that elaborate on what, exactly, that means. It also shares office space with the other defendants and has overlapping leadership, [1] \u00b6 62 (a)-(b), and one might imagine that its leaders sat down and agreed to restrict competition. But none of the Board of Oral Implantology's members played any role in the denial of the plaintiff board's application; Parker and Dr. Mashni are directors at the Academy and the American Board of Dental Specialties-not the American Board of Oral Implantology. [1] \u00b6\u00b6 33, 37. Again, their involvement in the conspiracy has not been plausibly alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The allegations against the American Board of Dental Specialties are more detailed, but they also depict unilateral rather than parallel activity. According to the complaint, the American Board of Dental Specialties duped states into believing it would operate neutrally but then exercised its discretion to protect the American Board of Oral Implantologists' monopoly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [1] \u00b6\u00b6 8, 30, 60 (the only specialty certifying boards that the American Board of Dental Specialties has ever approved are the four boards that helped found it). The American Board of Dental Specialties was also the only entity directly involved in the pretextual, constructive denial of the United States Board of Oral Implantology's application. [1] \u00b6 107. As far as cooperation, the complaint again alleges that it met and conspired with other entity defendants behind closed doors in Suite 750 of a building in Chicago, and that it was particularly easy to do so because the defendants have overlapping leadership. [1] \u00b6 62 (a)-(b). Cooperation was possible but not plausible.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Even if the complaint had sufficiently alleged a conspiracy, it does not allege a cognizable restraint on trade. \"There can be no restraint of trade without a restraint.\"\n   <em>\n    Schachar v.

If the certifying entity lacks the power to prevent (or has not prevented) the professional from practicing without a certification, there has been no antitrust violation. Here, plaintiffs represent a type of rival certifier suing the group that issues a certification that plaintiffs would like to have. But the defendants have not prevented any dentists from practicing implantology and they have not prevented plaintiffs from issuing their own certifications. And they lack the authority to prevent dentists from advertising those certifications once they are issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The lack of restraint is apparent. According to the complaint, in forty-four states, dentists cannot advertise any certifications, and in six, dentists can advertise certifications that are backed by specialty certifying boards approved by the American Board of Dental Specialties. [1] \u00b6 75. Absent is an allegation that dentists in those six states cannot also advertise certifications issued by the United States Board of Oral Implantology.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   At most, in Ohio, there are restraints on advertising certifications issued by plaintiffs that do not apply equally to certifications issued by defendants (and, apparently, those restrictions are temporary).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   [34] at 23. But even then, the culprit is the Ohio state government, not the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   There are no other restraints occurring in the markets set out in the complaint. The plaintiffs say that the restraints are occurring in \"(i) the market for certifying dentists as oral implantology specialists, and (ii) the markets to provide professional services associated with such certifications (e.g., continuing education courses, journal and other publication subscriptions, and conferences).\" [1] \u00b6 113. But they have failed to allege any restraint that prevents them from certifying dentists as oral implantology specialists and providing related professional services. Trade in that market occurs when dentists pay application fees to specialty certifying boards, and specialty certifying boards consider the dentists' credentials and, if justified, issue the certification. The defendants cannot prevent (and have not prevented, judging from the allegations in the complaint) dentists from paying an application fee to the\n   United States Board of Oral Implantology in return for one of its certifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The American Board of Dental Specialties has the power to place (or decline to place) its seal of approval on a specialty certifying board. So if the defendants have restrained trade, they have done so in a different market: that for issuing certifications that are backed by the American Board of Dental Specialties. The problem is that \"[p]roduct markets are not defined in terms of one trademark or another.\"\n   <em>\n    Generac Corp. v.

For the same reason, the product market cannot be defined here in terms of the backing of the American Board of Dental Specialties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The plaintiff's alleged harms derive from the defendants' \"towering reputation,\" another give-away that this is not an antitrust violation.\n   <em>\n    Lawline\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10520247\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/956/1378/#p1383\">\n    956 F.2d at 1384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The theory is that dentists will not value the plaintiffs' certifications if they are not backed by the American Board of Dental Specialties, and that this will cause the American Board of Oral Implantology to lose members (which will in turn cause the International Congress of Implantologists to lose members, too). [1] \u00b6\u00b6 111, 112. But that is just another way to say that the source of the harm is the American Board of Dental Specialties' reputation, and that is not enough.

[1] \u00b6\u00b6 127-130. First, the complaint alleges that the American Board of Oral Implantology published a newsletter in which O'Grady was quoted as saying that the United States Board of Oral Implantology does not have the \"experience, knowledge and history to administer a psychometrically and legally defensible examination.\" [1] \u00b6 82.

True, the American Board of Oral Implantology is an Illinois corporation with its headquarters in Chicago, [1] \u00b6\u00b6 30, 60, and the location where a document is drafted is relevant. O'Grady resides in Ohio and serves as president of the American Board of Oral Implantology. [1] \u00b6 34.
