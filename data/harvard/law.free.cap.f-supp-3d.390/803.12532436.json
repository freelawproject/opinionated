The Court rejects those arguments. Although this Court was unable to decide the full merits of the \u00a7 2 and constitutional claims in 2012 while the preclearance proceedings were pending, Plaintiffs were \"aggrieved persons\" under the VRA and their claims were ripe. If not, this Court would not have been instructed to order interim relief on those claims by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Perry v. Perez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446024,12186377\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/388/\">\n    565 U.S. 388\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446024,12186377\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/388/\">\n    132 S.Ct. 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446024,12186377\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/565/388/\">\n    181 L.Ed.2d 900\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). The Supreme Court held that this Court should examine Plaintiffs' \u00a7 2 and constitutional claims under a preliminary-injunction type standard and take care not to implement an unconstitutional interim plan. Thus, Plaintiffs' claims had to be resolved at least preliminarily and were ripe for consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Nor does the fact that the 2011 plans never went into effect and were repealed by the Legislature in 2013 when the new plans were enacted render the intentional vote dilution claims and the request for bail-in relief moot, as this Court has already decided.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , docket no. 1390 at 6. The Court will not repeat its prior analysis here. However, both sides argue that the recent Fifth Circuit opinion\n   <em>\n    Veasey v. Abbott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n    888 F.3d 792\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2018) supports their position on mootness.\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   was in a different procedural posture and does not control this case. But because Defendants and the United States also rely on\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   to argue that \u00a7 3(c) relief is foreclosed, the Court will examine\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   in detail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <em>\n    Veasey v. Abbott\n   </em>\n   concerned Texas's voter ID law. The State enacted SB14 in 2011, generally requiring voters to present one of five forms of government-issued identification in order to vote. A group of plaintiffs (Marc Veasey\n   <em>\n    et al.\n   </em>\n   ) challenged SB14 as intentionally racially discriminatory, and the district court permanently enjoined its implementation, finding both that it had unlawful effects under the \"effects test\" of \u00a7 2 of the VRA and because Texas enacted SB14 at least in part because of its adverse effect on minority voters.\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n    888 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   796 (citing\n   <em>\n    Veasey v.

Tex. 2014) ). On appeal, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the finding that SB14 had an unlawful disparate impact (sustaining the \u00a7 2 VRA effects claim) but reversed the discriminatory purpose determination, finding that the district court improperly relied on certain facts. The Fifth Circuit remanded for further proceedings, including a redetermination of the discriminatory purpose issue and entry of an interim remedy before the 2016 elections.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In August 2016, the district court entered an interim remedy agreed to by all parties, following the Fifth Circuit's direction to \"honor the State's policy preferences to implement a photo-ID system.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211006\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/627/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Under the interim remedy, voters who lacked an SB14 ID could cast a regular ballot upon completing a Declaration of Reasonable Impediment and presenting a specified form of identification.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4211006\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/71/627/#p694\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The interim remedy was used for the November 2016 election and remained in place pending further order of the court, with the understanding that all parties preserved\n   their right to seek or oppose further relief.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 796-97.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In February and March 2017, the Texas Legislature informed the district court about legislation being considered during the 2017 session \"to adjust SB 14 to comply with the Fifth Circuit's decision.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 797. However, the district court proceeded to issue an opinion on the SB14 discriminatory purpose claim on April 1, 2017, again finding that SB14 was enacted, at least in part, for a racially discriminatory purpose. SB5 was then enacted on May 31, 2017 as a legislative remedy to cure and replace SB14, and was fashioned after the interim remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Texas moved for reconsideration of the district court's discriminatory purpose finding in light of the amendment, and the plaintiffs never sought leave to amend their Complaint to add claims specifically challenging SB5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 797-98. The district court denied Texas's motion, and entered a remedial order permanently enjoining SB14 and SB5, vacating the interim remedy, and reinstating the pre-SB14 law that lacked any voter ID requirement. It held that the interim remedy was limited to addressing the VRA \u00a7 2 effects claim, and in light of its finding of discriminatory purpose, the interim relief was no longer appropriate and broader relief was warranted. Further, although it did not find that SB5 violated \u00a7 2 of the VRA, it reasoned that its finding of discriminatory intent warranted a wholesale injunction because SB5 was built upon the architecture of SB14. The district court then ordered commencement of a \u00a7 3(c) bail-in hearing and issued broad relief enjoining the State from enforcing SB14 and SB5.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 798.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On appeal, Texas argued that the case had become moot by the passage of SB5 in 2017, requiring\n   <em>\n    vacatur\n   </em>\n   of the court's finding of intentional discrimination on remand. The Fifth Circuit rejected the mootness argument. Although it recognized that ordinarily a statute would become moot by the passage of a superseding law and a prior ruling would be vacated, it noted that the case was not \"archetypal.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 799. Instead, the Fifth Circuit had remanded to the district court with instructions to assume the \"unwelcome obligation\" of devising an interim remedy to eliminate the \u00a7 2 violations, reconsider the discriminatory purpose finding without the facts the appellate court held inapposite, and be mindful that any new law subsequently passed would present new circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Fifth Circuit noted that the posture was similar to\n   <em>\n    Mississippi State Chapter, Operation PUSH, Inc. v. Mabus\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542019\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/400/\">\n    932 F.2d 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 1991), in which the court evaluated both the liability findings and the new law, and there was no suggestion of mootness arising from the passage of the responsive legislation, which was analyzed for its effectiveness as a proposed remedy. The Fifth Circuit recognized that the issues on appeal in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   were \"the status of the state's liability for intentional discrimination against indigent minority voters, and whether the district court abused its discretion in rejecting SB5 as a remedy for the Plaintiffs' claims.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10542019\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/932/400/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiffs in this case assert that the Fifth Circuit's holding that issues concerning liability regarding SB14 were not mooted by the passage of SB5 in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   supports a finding that their claims against the 2011 plans were not mooted by the passage of the 2013 plans. Defendants argue that language in the opinion concerning the typical effect of a new law-mooting claims against the old law and vacating prior opinions-supports a mootness finding. But as noted,\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   was in a different procedural posture from this case. The district court had made final liability determinations\n   shortly before the passage of the new law, and the district court was therefore already at the remedy stage when the new law was passed. The principal issue was the State's continuing liability based on those final liability findings concerning SB14, and whether the new law (SB5) was an appropriate remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In contrast, although this Court had made some preliminary determinations on liability, it had not made final determinations at the time the 2013 plans were enacted, and this case was not at the remedy phase. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   does not directly support Plaintiffs' position that their 2011 plan claims were not moot, though the Fifth Circuit did not dismiss the claims against SB14 and vacate the district court's findings on liability based on the passage of SB5, as suggested by Judge Higginbotham's concurrence. But\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   's general language on mootness does not undermine this Court's conclusion that the 2011 plan claims were never mooted, as Defendants argue, given the particular posture and claims presented here. Like\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   , this is also not the \"archetypal\" case, and the 2011 plan claims are not moot for the reasons this Court has explained in prior orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   That this is so is further supported by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Abbott v. Perez\n   </em>\n   , even though the Supreme Court expressed no direct opinion on the mootness issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Thus, the discriminatory intent of the Legislature in 2011 was necessarily examined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Upon examination, this Court found that the Texas Legislature intentionally discriminated in 2011 in numerous and significant ways. The Court then found that the Legislature intentionally maintained the racially discriminatory aspects of the 2011 Texas House and Congressional plans when it enacted the interim plans in 2013, and that its true purpose in enacting the plans was not to comply with the VRA but to insulate itself from further liability for the discriminatory aspects of the plans, including potential bail-in relief. Though the Supreme Court reversed this Court's holding that the Legislature intentionally discriminated in 2013, it never addressed or in any way called into question this Court's findings as to the Legislature's\n   discriminatory purpose in enacting the 2011 plans. Whether the Legislature violated the Fourteenth Amendment by intentionally discriminating against minority voters in 2011 has always remained a central issue of this litigation. Having found that it did, as required by the circumstances of this litigation, the Court must now determine whether bail-in relief is appropriate based on those findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Whether bail-in relief requires a final determination with accompanying relief?\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Defendants further contend that Plaintiffs may not obtain bail-in relief because it is only a supplemental remedy and may not be imposed until a plaintiff prevails on a live claim. Relatedly, they argue that the Court cannot find that \"violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment ... have occurred\" as a result of the 2011 plans because they were never used and Plaintiffs were never injured by them. Docket no. 1612 at 8-9. The Court rejects these arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The language of \u00a7 3(c) states that the Court may provide bail-in \"in addition to such relief as it may grant.\" This Court has granted Plaintiffs relief in the form of an injunction against the use of the 2011 plans\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the issuance of interim remedy plans.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, bail-in relief would be \"in addition to such relief.\" Moreover, no court has held that bail-in relief may be awarded only upon a final judgment on a claim presented in the case accompanied by an award of final equitable relief on that claim. In its prior briefing on the application of \u00a7 3(c) in this case, the United States stated that \"[n]othing in the statute's text supports Texas's argument that Section 3(c) relief can be imposed only after a final judgment of intentional discrimination\" and \"[s]o long as 'the court finds that violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief have occurred,' the court can impose relief under Section 3(c).\" Docket no. 827 at 5 n.4.

Surely it contemplates situations in which the court enjoins a challenged law from ever taking effect because it violates voting rights guaranteed by the Constitution and then issues additional bail-in relief to prevent future attempts to circumvent those same voting rights.

This Court found that Texas's 2011 Congressional and State House plans were both motivated by racially discriminatory purpose.

The Court further found that districts in many counties across Texas were the product of intentional discrimination/intentional vote dilution, including El Paso County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 27-28 (\"the Court finds that mapdrawers intentionally diluted the Latino vote in violation of \u00a7 2 of the VRA and the Fourteenth Amendment with regard to HD78\"); Bexar County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 32 (\"the Court finds that mapdrawers intentionally diluted the Latino vote in HD117 in violation of \u00a7 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment\"); Nueces County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 38-40 (mapdrawers intentionally eliminated HD33 in Nueces County and \"offset\" the loss of a Latino opportunity district by unnecessarily inflating the SSVR of an already performing district in Harris County, thus intentionally diluting Latino voting opportunity and also intentionally racially gerrymandered the remaining Nueces County districts to further undermine Latino voting strength); Hidalgo County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 43 (\"the Court finds that HD41 was drawn in part with racially discriminatory (dilutive) motive\" and that \"mapdrawers intentionally used race to draw the district to perform less favorably for Latinos\" such that \"the configuration of HD41 is racially discriminatory and constitutes intentional vote dilution in violation of \u00a7 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment\"); Harris County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 56 (\"The Court finds that there is persuasive evidence of intentional vote dilution in Harris County.\"); Dallas County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 66-67 (\"The Court does find ... that Plaintiffs have proven an improper use of race in western Dallas County to dilute Latino voting strength\" and \"intentional vote dilution in Dallas County violates \u00a7 2 and the Fourteenth Amendment.\"); Tarrant County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 71 (\"The Court finds that mapdrawers acted with racially discriminatory intent to dilute Latino voting strength in Tarrant County.\"); and Bell County,\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 78 (\"The Court thus finds evidence of intentional vote dilution in Bell County in violation of \u00a7 2 of the VRA and the Fourteenth Amendment.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In the Opinion on Plan C185, this Court found that in CD23 the State intentionally split the large Hispanic county of Maverick County and the City of Eagle Pass to exclude politically active Hispanics who would not support the Republican incumbent, while adding in all or parts of more Anglo counties, but nevertheless taking care to maintain SSVR and HCVAP levels above 50%. These actions were designed to maintain theoretical opportunity while simultaneously manipulating district population to decrease its potential effectiveness for Latinos. Docket no. 1390 at 20. Mapdrawers manipulated Latino cohesion and turnout to pursue the \"nudge factor\" proposal and create the fa\u00e7ade of a Latino opportunity district.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20-23. It was undisputed that Latino performance in CD23 decreased, and the Court found that CD23 was purposefully racially discriminatory.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23, 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, the Court found that \"race was used as a proxy for political affiliation, and that this was done intentionally to dilute minority voting strength.\" Docket no. 1390 at 131. Specifically, mapdrawers intentionally wasted minority (and therefore presumed Democrat) votes in CD30 by packing, while increasing Anglo (and therefore presumed Republican) voting strength in neighboring districts, and they further intentionally cracked minority population in the metroplex to limit minority population within the Republican districts to curb the effect of continued minority growth throughout the decade.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 131-33. The Court found persuasive evidence that mapdrawers intentionally \"packed and\n   cracked\" on the basis of race with the intent to dilute minority voting strength, and thus acted with intentionally racially discriminatory purpose.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 134.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court concludes that these findings of \"violations of the Fourteenth Amendment\" do qualify as triggers for \u00a7 3(c) bail-in relief. These are recent findings of purposeful racial discrimination by the State affecting significant numbers of minority voters statewide.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   3. findings of intentional discrimination in the\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   voter ID litigation and whether\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   precludes an award of bail-in in this case\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The next issue is whether the district court's recent findings of intentional discrimination in the\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   voter ID litigation may also be considered, and whether the holding in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   itself precludes bail-in relief in this case. On remand, the district court in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   found that Texas purposefully discriminated when it enacted the first voter ID bill (SB 14) in 2011. This finding was not disturbed on the second appeal. Rather, the Fifth Circuit held only that \"because SB 5 constitutes an effective remedy for the only deficiencies testified to in SB 14, and it essentially mirrors an agreed interim order for the same purpose, the State has acted promptly following this Court's mandate, and there is no equitable basis for subjecting Texas to ongoing federal election scrutiny under Section 3(c).\"\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n    888 F.3d at 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Contrary to Defendants' and the United States' assertions, the Fifth Circuit did not reject bail-in relief solely because the State acted promptly to enact the remedy plan that mirrored the interim relief, nor did it hold that any time the State does so, bail-in relief is precluded. Rather, the Fifth Circuit found bail-in relief inappropriate because the district court had ordered relief that was too broad and untailored. The Fifth Circuit expressly noted that the relief ordered \"far exceed[ed] the scope of the actual violations found by the court\" and that \"under the circumstances of th[e] case, the court had no legal or factual basis to invalidate SB 5, and its contemplation of Section 3(c) relief accordingly fail[ed] as well.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n    at 801\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Those circumstances included that \"SB 14 was racially discriminatory against only the subset of indigent minority voters and did not affect the vast majority of Texas voters of all races,\" and that courts \"are bound by the requirement to tailor injunctive relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Court emphasized that \"relief must be tailored\" more than once.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516733\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/888/792/\">\n    at 800\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, the district court found discriminatory intent, but it affected only a small subset of minority voters rather than the vast majority of Texas minority voters. In addition, the Fifth Circuit found no evidence of any continuing discriminatory effect on minority voters, rendering potential bail-in relief an untailored, overly broad remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   This case, in contrast, involves findings of intentionally discriminatory behavior affecting minority voters statewide rather than the subset of indigent minority voters. Numerous counties were drawn with the purpose to dilute minority voting strength in the Texas House plan, as well as CD23 and numerous congressional districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex in the Congressional plan. Though the Supreme Court may have found no discriminatory purpose in 2013, it did not undermine the findings of purposeful discrimination in 2011. These recent, statewide violations of the Fourteenth Amendment by the State are the type to appropriately trigger the bail-in remedy against the State, and the bail-in remedy sought by Plaintiffs would appropriately redress the violation. Thus,\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   does not foreclose bail-in relief in the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The United States further asserts that, because the discrimination findings in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   could not support bail-in relief in that case, they cannot be used to support it in this case. The Court disagrees. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   precludes consideration of the district court's findings of intentional discrimination as support for application of \u00a7 3(c) relief in this case. The discrimination finding in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   was insufficient to support 3(c) relief in that case because of its limited effect, but that purposeful discrimination may nevertheless be considered by this Court in deciding whether to award bail-in relief in this case. Although this Court would find it a stretch to award bail-in relief based solely on violations found in other cases, as the\n   <em>\n    Jeffers\n   </em>\n   court did, consideration of the\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   court's findings of intentional discrimination in the second step of the bail-in analysis is certainly appropriate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   4. recent findings of intentional discrimination by political subdivisions\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Plaintiffs also urge the Court to consider\n   <em>\n    Pati\u00f1o v.

On the issue of whether other constitutional violations could be considered as triggers, including those by political subdivisions, the\n   <em>\n    Jeffers\n   </em>\n   court held that the phrase \"violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment justifying equitable relief\" is \"not limited at all,\" such that if the plaintiffs succeeded in showing other constitutional violations besides those alleged in their attack on the apportionment plan made the basis of the suit, preclearance would not be ruled out if the violations were sufficiently serious and widespread to justify the drastic remedy of preclearance.\n   <em>\n    Jeffers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085134\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/740/585/#p587\">\n    740 F.

It further held that the statute does not require \"that the State or its officials must be guilty of the violations, but only that the violations must 'have occurred\n   <em>\n    within the territory\n   </em>\n   ' of the State.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085134\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/740/585/#p587\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4085134\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/740/585/#p587\">\n    at 600\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis in original).

Thus, it simply makes clear that political subdivisions such as cities may be subjected to \u00a7 3(c) relief based on their own violations, and does not mean that a State may be subjected to bail-in based on violations by its political subdivisions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   5. objections to preclearance by the Department of Justice in \u00a7 5 proceedings\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The fact that the Department of Justice has lodged numerous \u00a7 5 objections against Texas's redistricting plans over the years does not establish that violations of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment have occurred. A jurisdiction seeking preclearance must prove that its proposed voting change has neither the purpose nor the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color. The jurisdiction bears the burden of persuasion on both points.\n   <em>\n    Reno v. Bossier Parish Sch. Bd.

Thus, as in\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   , there are no findings of discriminatory intent or Fourteenth Amendment violations concerning the plan currently in place. The Supreme Court also held that the 2013 Legislature did not \"use criteria that arguably carried forward the effects of any discriminatory intent on the part of the 2011 Legislature,\" and essentially found the current plans to be free of constitutional infirmities.\n   <em>\n    Abbott v.

Although this Court may disagree about the lingering effects of discrimination from the 2011 plans, the clear import of the Supreme Court's opinion is that nothing further remains to be remedied, and this Court is bound to follow that opinion. In addition to considering whether any infirmities remain,\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   further instructs this Court to consider that the State acted promptly to adopt the interim plans to remedy any potential violations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Although the Court concluded above that it could and should also consider the intentional discrimination findings made in the underlying voter ID litigation itself, it does little to bolster the foundation for bail-in. While this was another recent act of intentional discrimination by the State, as the\n   <em>\n    Veasey\n   </em>\n   court noted, it affected only a small portion of minority voters (indigent minority voters), and there was no indication that its effects had not been fully remedied. Thus, the Court finds an insufficient basis upon which to award the requested bail-in relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   To be clear, however, the Court has grave concerns about Texas's past conduct. During the 2011 legislative session, Texas engaged in traditional means of vote dilution such as cracking and packing in drawing districts, and also utilized newer methods of dilution and suppression such as using the \"nudge factor\" and passing voter ID requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The existence of high levels of racially polarized voting across Texas cannot be disputed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   nor is there any indication that the levels of racially polarized voting are decreasing. This Court and others have recognized that \"the presence of racially polarized voting provides a strong incentive for intentional discrimination, commonly through vote dilution....\" Docket no. 1390 at 120 (quoting\n   <em>\n    N.C.

Given the fact of changing population demographics, the likelihood increases that the Texas Legislature will continue to find ways to attempt to engage in \"ingenious defiance of the Constitution\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   that necessitated the preclearance system in the first place.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the hearing on \u00a7 3(c) relief,\n   counsel for the State was asked whether the State would commit to conduct future redistricting proceedings by a fair and open process. Counsel responded that to answer the question, he needed to know how those terms are defined before committing to a specific process.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   That response is disappointing. Irrespective of whether an employee of the State's executive branch is empowered, in open court, to commit the Legislature to a particular process, we warn that, given the record produced in 2011, the State must implement a process that, by any reasonable definition, is \"fair and open\".\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Nevertheless, the Court concludes that ordering preclearance on the current record would be inappropriate, given the recent guidance from the Supreme Court and the Fifth Circuit.

And so what I mean by the process is what didn't take place the last time around. We didn't have hearings. We had hearings before a census map was released -- census data was released. So that was of no value to anybody. And then when hearings did take place, they were held in unusual locations with last-minute notices on holidays. So, you know, that's the kind of behavior the state engaged in last time, and I'm asking you to stipulate on behalf of the state, if you can so stipulate, that you won't do that again. And if you can't, then why shouldn't I award 3(c)relief?\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    MR. FREDERICK: Two responses. I can't stipulate because I do not -- because the terms are not defined. I don't know what I would be stipulating to. The reason that that can't support 3(c)relief is doing a bad job in a complicated process is so far from the necessary level of deliberate constitutional defiance that is necessary for preclearance that it just doesn't get close ....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    Docket no. 1629 (May 10, 2019 hearing transcript).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
