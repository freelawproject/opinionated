Pls.' Second Am. Collective Class Action Compl. (\"Compl.\") \u00b6\u00b6 55, 61, ECF No. 96. Most of the Plaintiffs travelled to Puerto Rico from the continental United States for the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 10-26, 222. Many of them leased their personal equipment to the Defendants for use in the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67-74. The Plaintiffs allege that they worked on the Project for about three months in Puerto Rico but received payment for only two weeks of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 84-90. They further allege that many obtained neither the return of their equipment nor the lease payments they were owed under the Equipment Rental Agreement.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. They allege that many of them remain \"stranded in Puerto Rico,\" unable to afford to travel home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Plaintiffs bring the present action seeking to recover unpaid wages, overtime compensation, damages, and attorneys' fees if they prevail on a series of claims including violations of the wage, hour, and anti-retaliation provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (\"FLSA\") and Puerto Rico employment laws, breach of contract, unjust enrichment, fraudulent inducement, conversion, and negligent bailment. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 151-245.

FACTS ALLEGED\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, Synergy, LLC (\"Synergy\"), a technology company, obtained a contract from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (\"FEMA\") for a project to assist with the enormous task of clean-up (the \"Project\"). Compl. \u00b6 55. In what began looking more like a Silicon Valley collaboration than a team of emergency relief experts, Synergy partnered with start-up technology firms ECO IQ, LLC (\"ECO IQ\"), Cloud IQ, LLC (\"Cloud IQ\"), Migo IQ, Inc. (\"Migo IQ\"), Radar_Apps, Inc. (\"Radar_Apps\"), and Mojo Transport, LLC (\"Mojo\") (collectively, including Synergy, the \"Technology Defendants\") to develop and deploy a smart phone application (the \"App\") that they planned to use to perform the multi-million-dollar contract. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 55-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Cloud IQ soon sub-contracted with J&amp;W Grading, Inc. (\"J&amp;W\"), a Virginia-based contractor owned by Ronnie Guthrie (\"Guthrie\"), to carry out the clean-up work on the ground.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 59-60. J&amp;W was not\n   able independently to supply the staff or equipment that the Technology Defendants lacked, so J&amp;W recruited the Plaintiffs (\"men and women from around the United States\") to work on the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 60-61. J&amp;W also arranged to rent the Plaintiffs' equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 67. To this end, J&amp;W entered into Equipment Rental Agreements with many of the individual Plaintiffs, which specified that J&amp;W would ship the equipment to Puerto Rico and make monthly rental payments to the Plaintiffs.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 67, 70-72.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Each Equipment Rental Agreement specifies that \"[t]he rent will be paid in installments of $ 3,000.00 each month, in advance, beginning on December 1, 2017 and will be paid on the 1st day of each succeeding month throughout the Term ....\" Compl., Ex. B, Equipment Rental Agreement (\"Equipment Rental Agreement\") \u00b6 4, ECF No. 96-2. Among other things, the Equipment Rental Agreements specify that the Equipment \"will remain the property of the Lessor,\" \"[t]he Lessee will not encumber the Equipment or allow [it] to be encumbered,\" and \"the Lessor will not disturb the Lessee's quiet and peaceful possession of the Equipment or the Lessee's unrestricted use of the Equipment for the purpose for which [it] was designed\" as long as there has been no default.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 13-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   J&amp;W entered into subcontractor agreements with the Plaintiffs when J&amp;W recruited them to join the clean-up effort in Puerto Rico. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 61-66, Ex. A, Master Subcontractor Agreement (\"Subcontractor Agreement\"), ECF No. 96-1. The Subcontractor Agreement lists J&amp;W as the \"Contractor,\" and refers to an unnamed \"prime contractor\" and \"project owner.\" Compl. \u00b6 62; Subcontractor Agreement 2-3, 11. The Plaintiffs allege that J&amp;W entered into this Subcontractor Agreement with them \"on behalf of the Technology Firm Defendants.\" Compl. \u00b6 62.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Subcontractor Agreement describes the scope of work for which the Plaintiffs were to be employed and the rates they were to be paid. Subcontractor Agreement 12-13. The Subcontractor Agreement promises \"[g]uaranteed payment to Subcontractor for first invoices in 21 days. Payments within 14 days thereafter. Payment via check or wired funds, whichever requested.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In January 2018, J&amp;W officially hired the Plaintiffs in Puerto Rico. Compl. \u00b6 76. The Plaintiffs signed multiple documents in a \"New Hire Package,\" including an I-9 Employment Eligibility Verification form, a W-4 tax form, and an \"Employee Use of Company Vehicles Agreement.\" Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 77-78 &amp; Ex. D, J&amp;W Grading New Hire Package (\"New Hire Package\") 2, ECF No. 96-4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Reality quickly set in. The Plaintiffs (including the majority who had flown to Puerto Rico for no reason other than to work on the Project) went three weeks with no work. Compl. \u00b6 83. During this time, they did not receive per diem payments in cash, but they did receive room and board on the island.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Project was delayed for multiple reasons, including that the Technology Defendants needed time to put their branding on the equipment that they had rented from the Plaintiffs\n   and to set up GPS and load tracking devices on the Plaintiffs' vehicles.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-82. The Plaintiffs speculate that these delays were because the Technology Defendants sought to employ the Project to market and test the App they were in the process of developing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 81-83.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At a meeting with all of the Plaintiffs on January 28, 2018, Jonathon Kotthoff (\"Kotthoff\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   who the Plaintiffs allege has an ownership stake in all of the Technology Defendants, described Migo IQ as the \"prime\" on the Project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 137. At this meeting, Migo IQ issued each Plaintiff an iPhone pre-loaded with the App.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The Plaintiffs were instructed to \"clock in and out on the App,\" and were informed that the Technology Defendants would \"monitor[ ] and control[ ]\" all of their work remotely through the App from a room in the \"main office\" called the \"bird house.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Plaintiffs further allege that at that meeting, \"Migo IQ and ECO IQ principals announced that they were all working under 'one flag' and 'one leadership structure' and were 'one team.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 138.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Between February and April 2018, the Plaintiffs performed the work for which they were hired: manual clean-up such as cutting down trees and hauling debris across the island.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 84. The Plaintiffs \"often\" worked over eight hours per day and over forty hours per week most weeks.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 85. They allege that they did not receive a meal period after the third and before the fifth consecutive hour of work.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 86.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Plaintiffs received their first paychecks after \"approximately six weeks\" in Puerto Rico, which included wages for one pay period (two weeks of work).\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 87. The Plaintiffs allege that the wages paid were \"far short from the amounts owed,\" in part because they did not include overtime pay.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After that one paycheck, the Plaintiffs maintain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-29\">\n   Guthrie repeatedly promised payment of all wages due and cited many, many reasons for the failure to pay. Guthrie would announce a specific payday coming in the near future, and all Plaintiffs would anxiously await that payday. The announced payday would come and go without payment by J&amp;W Grading or any Defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-30\">\n   In text messages to employees, Guthrie took responsibility for some of the issues ... Specifically, Guthrie texted: \"I have some blame. I take responsibility for it and will. That why i getting [sic] a 3 million dollar loan so i can pay everyone like i said i would.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6\u00b6 89-90.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   At some point in the spring of 2018, J&amp;W and Guthrie \"either withdrew from the Project or were terminated.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 91. J&amp;W and Guthrie \"made no arrangements to pay Plaintiffs\" or return their equipment prior to leaving the project.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 92.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The precise nature of the Plaintiffs' role on the Project after J&amp;W and Guthrie's departure is unclear to the Court. On the one hand, the Plaintiffs allege that \"[a]fter J&amp;W Grading was no longer on the clean-up project, principals of Synergy/ECO IQ, Migo IQ, Mojo Transport and Cloud IQ ... supervised, directed, and controlled the work schedules and conditions of employment of all Plaintiffs.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 142. Incongruously,\n   they allege that the \"Technology Firm Defendants offered to 'rehire' some Plaintiffs,\" suggesting that the working relationship did not continue unchanged after J&amp;W and Guthrie's departure.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 95.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Plaintiffs allege that the Technology Defendants \"threatened with termination and/or actually terminated and banned from working further on the clean-up project\" those who sought back wages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 94. Even those Plaintiffs who \"were hired by the Technology Firm defendants continued to work without pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   To date, the Plaintiffs have not received wages for the weeks they worked before J&amp;W's departure and have received no payments for their leased equipment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 97. They also have been unable to obtain return of their equipment in some cases because the \"Defendants refused to return the property until Plaintiffs reimbursed [them] for maritime taxes.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 98. Some of the Plaintiffs remain \"stranded in Puerto Rico,\" unable to afford the trip home.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 96. Those who have returned are losing income and work because they lack the equipment on which many of their personal businesses rely.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The Plaintiffs bring this action against J&amp;W and the Technology Defendants as well as the individuals they believe own those companies.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 36. They allege the following regarding ownership of the Technology Defendants:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   Plaintiffs are informed and believe that Defendants Jonathon Kotthoff and Carol Leese are the owners of all Defendants except J&amp;W Grading, Inc.

All this would seem to suggest that the statutory scheme in sections 171 through 177 is like\n    that in sections 271 through 288, and thus that if the Puerto Rico Supreme Court recognized a private cause of action under the latter section, it would find one in the former, too.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    This reasoning would prevail were it not for a provision in title 29's section 282 that provides\n    <em>\n     explicitly\n    </em>\n    for a private cause of action for individuals to enforce their rights under sections 271 through 288 pursuant to the procedure established by title 32, sections 3118 through 3132.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=P.R.%20Laws%20Ann.%20tit.%2029%2C%20%C2%A7%20282\">\n     P.R.

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     V\u00e9lez\n    </em>\n    buttresses reading section 282 to exclude a private cause of action under section 173, which stipulates no such thing, because the decision references section 173 only to invalidate the employer's potential defense that the employee had received daily meals and lodging.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    86 P.R. at 564-65.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    The Plaintiffs suggest that the Court ought interpret sections 171 through 177 to permit a private right of action because section 174 contemplates \"an action brought by a laborer against an employer for any amount due him\" when it prohibits the employer from bringing a counter claim in such an action. Compl. \u00b6 180. The fact that section 174 contemplates lawsuits for unpaid wages does not lead to the ineluctable conclusion that sections 171-177 establish the statutory authorization for such cases, however. In light of section 282's explicit authorization of private civil suits for unpaid wages pursuant to sections 271-288, the Court does not find the Plaintiffs' section 174 argument persuasive.
