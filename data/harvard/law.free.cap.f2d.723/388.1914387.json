Moody asserts that the preliminary injunction is not supported by the evidence before the district court and that the wording of the injunction is ambiguous and overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">The granting of a preliminary injunction rests in the sound discretion of the district court, and will be overturned only on a showing of abuse of that discretion. <em>Commonwealth Life Insurance Co. v. Neal, </em>669 F.2d 300, 303 (5th Cir.1982); <em>Foley v. Alabama State Bar, </em>648 F.2d 355 (5th Cir.1981). The factual findings made here by the district court are amply supported by evidence advanced by the appellee. <em>Matuszak v. Houston Oilers, Inc., </em>515 S.W.2d 725, 728 (Tex.Civ.App.1974). Moody\u2019s activities since the institution of this lawsuit must engender some suspicion that he is attempting to place assets beyond the reach of his judgment creditor. Under these circumstances, no abuse of discretion appears in the issuance of the preliminary injunction. Moody\u2019s assertion that his financial transactions, though legitimate, are too complex to be understood by appellee and, implicitly, by the district court, requires no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-16\">The preliminary injunction order issued by the district court meets the specificity requirements of Fed.R.Civ.P. 65(d). The judgment against Moody which appellee seeks to execute exceeds the aggregate value of Moody\u2019s reported assets; consequently it is appropriate for the preliminary injunction to extend to all of Moody\u2019s assets. Any waste, dissipation, or transfer of assets by Moody has a direct impact on appellee\u2019s potential ultimate recovery. <em>See Carter v. City of Houston, </em>255 S.W.2d 336, 338 (Tex.Civ.App.1953). A similar preliminary injunction was recently upheld by the Sixth Circuit in <em>USACO Coal Co. v. Carbomin Energy, Inc., </em>689 F.2d 94 (6th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-17\">Moody complains that the preliminary injunction makes no exemption for living expenses and day-to-day business transactions. The trial judge orally assured Moody that ordinary living expenses were not a subject of the injunction, and we are satisfied that Moody faces no threat of contempt on this account. As to everyday business expenses, we must read the trial court\u2019s failure to exempt them from the order to mean that Moody is prohibited from moving or expending any funds for business purposes.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In light of the facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>that Moody is evidently not engaged in any traditional business and that all of his reported assets are subject to the appellee\u2019s execution of judgment, even so strict a preliminary injunction does not constitute an abuse of discretion. If Moody can establish that his normal business activities will effect no diminution of the assets available to satisfy the judgment, he is free to move the trial court for modification of the preliminary injunction, something he has not done thus far.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">AFFIRMED. Costs to be borne by Appellant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b495-13\">. This question was placed explicitly before the district court at the preliminary injunction hearing, and counsel for appellee urged the court not to exempt such expenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-14\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>THE COURT: All right. What about the exempting transactions in the ordinary course of business?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-15\">MR. BLUMENTHAL: Your Honor, I think that there really ought not to be any ordinary course of business at this point except for living expenses. We have an eleven million dollar Judgment and execution ought \u2014 it\u2019s a six million dollar Judgment with interest, it\u2019s now in excess of eleven million dollars.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-25\">In view of this exchange we cannot suppose that the failure to exempt business expenses was accidental.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
