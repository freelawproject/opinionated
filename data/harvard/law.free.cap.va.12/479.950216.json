The plaintiffs then asked and had leave to withdraw their replication to <em>Goode\u2019s </em>plea. And at a subsequent term, <em>Goode </em>offered two additional pleas : 1. That the supposed bond in the declaration mentioned, was, on the day of its date, presented to <em>Goode </em>by Harrison, one of the obligees nominally, having no interest therein, he having declined acting as one of the commissioners to whom the writing was executed, for him <em>Goode </em>to sign and execute, and that <em>Goode </em>signed it, and left it in the custody of <em>Harrison </em>as an escrow, to be by him kept, on this express condition and none other, that before the delivery thereof to the plaintiffs, <em>Harrison </em>should procure <em>Jones </em>to sign and seal it as his act and deed, and thereby become jointly and equally bound with <em>Goode </em>as joint coobligor, and if <em>Jones </em>should not sign, seal and deliver it, as joint coobligor with <em>Goode, </em>then it was not to bind <em>Goode, </em>but was to be delivered and returned to him, and to be held null and void; and the plea averred that <em>Jones </em>did not sign, seal and deliver &amp;c. whereby the writing so left in <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>custody as an escrow, became and was wholly annulled &amp;c. and <em>so it was not Goode\u2019s deed. </em>Concluding to the country. 2. The other additional plea was like the first, except only that this plea, alleging, that the supposed bond was delivered to <em>Harrison </em>as an escrow, to be delivered to the plaintiffs upon condition that <em>Jones </em>also should execute it, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>that <em>Jones </em>never executed it, did not state that <em>Jlarri</em>was one of the obligees in the bond. This plea also concluded to the country. The former plea, and the two additional pleas, were not, any of them, verified by affidavit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-4\">The plaintiffs objected to the admission of these additional pleas, not specially because they were not verified by affidavit, but in general terms; the court allowed them; and the plaintiffs excepted. The plaintiffs then put in replications to the pleas, traversing the fact that the bond was delivered by <em>Goode </em>to <em>Harrison </em>as an escrow, as <em>Goode </em>alleged, and concluding to the country. And <em>Goode </em>joined the issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-5\">Upon the third trial of the cause, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs; <em>but upon the motion of Goode, </em>the court set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial, to which the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b502-6\">It appeared by the bill of exceptions, that at the two former trials, neither of which resulted in a verdict, <em>James </em>Harrison, one of the obligees in the bond, to whom the pleas alleged it had been delivered as an escrow, had been offered as a witness for <em>Goode, </em>that the plaintiffs objected to his competency, that the court overruled the objection, and that he was examined in person. At the term next preceding that at which the third trial was had (when the cause was continued) the court said, that the counsel had better look to the question whether <em>Harrison </em>was a competent witness, before the then next term, intimating that <em>Harrison might be </em>made competent. But <em>Goode </em>and his counsel made affidavit, that they understood the doubt suggested as to the competency of <em>Harrison </em>to refer to the fact of his being one of the obligees in the bond, not to any objection that could be removed by releases executed by <em>Goode </em>and <em>Harrison </em>to each other. At the third trial, the deposition of <em>Harrison, </em>which had been taken <em>de bene esse, </em>was offered in evidence for <em>Goode. </em>[This deposition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>stated, that <em>Harrison </em>did not act, but declined to act, as one of the commissioners of the county court of <em>Brunswick </em>for the sale of the land of <em>Rawlings\u2019s </em>estate : that, wishing to purchase the land for the benefit of his children, he applied to <em>Goode </em>and to <em>Jones </em>(his wife\u2019s brother) to purchase it for them; Goode, in the absence of <em>Jones, </em>consented to do so provided <em>Jones </em>would become jointly bound with him for the purchase money, and <em>Jones, </em>in <em>Goode\u2019s </em>absence, consented; and this was made known to the commissioners on the day of sale : that the land was cried out at the sale upon <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>bid, and bonds for the purchase money were prepared, to be executed by <em>Goode </em>and <em>Jones: </em>that <em>Harrison </em>presented the bonds to <em>Goode for </em>execution, who executed them upon the express condition that <em>Jones </em>also should execute them, which <em>Harrison </em>promised to have done, before delivery to the commissioners, (the bond on which this suit was brought was one of them): that <em>Harrison </em>sometime afterwards delivered the bonds to one of the commissioners with a full communication of the condition on which <em>Goode </em>had executed them, the commissioner agreeing to procure the execution thereof by <em>Jones ; </em>but he neglected it, and <em>Jones </em>died: that <em>Harrison </em>was to indemnify <em>Goode </em>and <em>Jones, </em>by paying the purchase money of the land himself, if he could, and in that case he was to have the property; if he could not make the payment, the land was to be made over to his wife and children, and to be held subject to the payment of the purchase money: and that <em>Harrison </em>put into <em>Goode\u2019s </em>hands, a bond of one <em>Devenport </em>for 1000 dollars, which <em>Goode </em>was to collect, and apply towards the payment of the purchase money; this was before <em>Jones\u2019s </em>death, when <em>Goode </em>expected <em>Jones </em>to join him in the bonds for the purchase money; and the witness supposed <em>Goode </em>still held <em>Devenport\u2019s </em>bond, or had collected it]. The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the reading of this deposition of <em>Harrison </em>as evidence for <em>Goode, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>court sustained the objection,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the evidence was ex-eluded, and a verdict was rendered for the plaintiffs. The ground on which <em>Goode </em>asked a new trial, was, that the exclusion of the evidence of <em>Harrison </em>as being a party interested in the cause, when it had been admitted on two former trials, and when it might have been obviated by mutual releases between <em>Goode </em>and <em>Harrison, </em>if the ground of objection to <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>competency had been understood and anticipated, operated as a surprise upon <em>Goode </em>at the trial; and the court also viewing it in that light, set aside the verdict, and ordered a new <em>trial; </em>to which the plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-5\">Before the fourth trial of the cause, <em>Goode </em>and <em>Harrison </em>executed mutual releases <em>to each other, of </em>all claims and responsibilities of either against or to the other, arising in any way out of the result of this suit, or of any other suit on the bonds of the same tenor taken for the purchase money of the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b504-6\">Upon the fourth trial of the cause, the deposition of <em>Harrison </em>(which had been taken again) was offered in evidence for <em>Goode, </em>and the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel objected to the admission of it on the ground that <em>Harrison </em>was interested and incompetent; but the court overruled the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>objection, and the deposition was read; to which the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted. The hill of exceptions set forth the new deposition of <em>Harrison, </em>and the mutual releases of <em>Goode </em>and <em>Harrison to </em>each other. [The new deposition shewed the same facts stated, in the former, and the following additional facts\u2014that the land (the purchase money for which was the consideration of the bond on which the suit was brought) had been since sold by <em>Harrison </em>to a new purchaser, with the knowledge of the commissioners who made the former sale and who were to convey the title to the purchaser, and with the knowledge also of <em>Jackson </em>for whose benefit this suit was brought, and who was the executor of <em>Rawlings </em>to whose estate the land belonged, and the agent of his widow and heirs or devisees; that <em>Jackson </em>declared himself perfectly satisfied with the new sale, of which he was to receive the proceeds, and told <em>Goode </em>that the affair was arranged, and he need not give himself any further trouble about it; and that, in consequence thereof, <em>Goode </em>gave <em>Harrison </em>a draft on <em>Devenport </em>for 400 dollars yet due of <em>DevenporPs </em>bond which <em>Harrison </em>had transferred to <em>Goodie </em>for his indemnity, and declared his readiness to make a settlement with <em>Harrison </em>of that transaction].</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b505-4\">The jury found a verdict for <em>Goode; </em>which the plaintiffs moved the court to set aside, and order a new trial; the court overruled the motion; and to that opinion the plaintiffs did not file exceptions. The court then gave judgment for <em>Goode </em>upon the verdict. And this court allowed the plaintiffs a <em>supersedeas </em>to the judgment.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b505-8\"><em>Macfarland </em>and <em>Rhodes, </em>for the plaintiff's,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APRb\">I. submitted, that the court erred in setting aside the verdict rendered for the plaintiffs on the third trial, and granting a new trial, on the ground that <em>Goode </em>had been surprised, by an opinion of the court on a <em>point of law </em>ruled at the trial; a kind of surprise which was no good ground <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>for disturbing the verdict; and besides, Goode, so far from being surprised, had been warned at the previous term, and would not take warning. And that the court erred too, in admitting <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>deposition in evidence for <em>Qoode; </em>for <em>Harrison </em>was the real purchaser of the land, though <em>Goode </em>gave his bond for the purchase money, and if <em>Goode </em>should be compelled to pay the debt, <em>Harrison </em>would be bound to repay the money to him; and <em>Harrison </em>was one of four plaintiffs on the record, who, if they succeeded, would be entitled to costs as well as to the debt, and <em>Harrison </em>would be bound to reimburse to <em>Goode </em>both debt and costs. The mutual release could not affect the costs, and did not extinguish the interest which <em>Harrison </em>had to protect <em>Goode </em>from the recovery of both debt and costs. II. They contended, that the court erred in admitting <em>Goode\u2019s </em>pleas: 1st, because (if for no other reason) they were, none of them, verified by his affidavit: they were special pleas of <em>non est factum, </em>1 Chitt. Plead. 479. 2 Id. 463. pleas which the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 33. p. 496. expressly provided should not be admitted unless the truth thereof be proved by the oath of the party. But 2ndly, they said, the pleas were in substance naught. The defence set up by them was, that the bond was signed and sealed by <em>Goode, </em>and by him delivered to <em>Harrison, </em>one of the obligees, as an escrow, upon condition that <em>Jones </em>should execute it as a joint coobligor with <em>Goode, </em>otherwise it should be void as to <em>Goode, </em>and <em>Jones </em>having never executed it, therefore it was not <em>Goode\u2019s </em>deed. Now, it could not be doubted, that a delivery of a bond to one of several obligees enured as a delivery to <em>all; </em>and the law was well settled, that a deed cannot be delivered <em>to a parly himself </em>as an escrow; that if a man make and deliver his sealed instrument to the party to whom it is made as an escrow to be his deed upon certain conditions, this is an absolute delivery, and the conditions are nugatory. They cited and examined Shep. Touchs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>58, 9. Harg. Co. Litt. 36 a. note 3. <em>Whiddon\u2019s case, </em>Cro.

The last case would probably be relied on as an authority for the defendant; but, they said, it was decided without a careful consideration of the authorities, and yet it would be found, on examination, not to contradict them. It was an action of covenant on a deed of composition between debtor and creditors, brought by creditors who executed it, on one of the covenants to them, against the surety for the payment of the composition ; who pleaded, that the deed was delivered as an <em>escrow, </em>upon condition that it should not be delivered to the plaintiffs, but should be void, unless it should be executed by certain other creditors, but they never executed it, and so it was not his deed; issue was joined on this plea; it appeared at the trial, that before the execution of the deed, it was agreed, in the presence of the surety who was to become bound for the payment of the composition, that it should be void unless all the creditors should execute it, and subsequently, though at the same interview, the surety executed the deed in the ordinary way without saying any thing at the precise time of the delivery; and the deed was delivered to one of the creditors, who was to get it executed by the others; and it was held, that the condition previously expressed, though not introduced into the act of delivery, was sufficient to make this a delivery of the deed as an escrow, and as it appeared that this condition was not complied with, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover. Now, they remarked, 1. that the question was not distinctly presented by the pleadings in that case, whether the plea was a good bar or not; the pleadings admitted that, if true, it was a bar: 2. that that deed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>was not, like this, a plain deed of grant or obligation; it was a deed of mutual and dependant covenants; a deed of composition whereby payments were to be made to all creditors, each and all of whom were to covenant on their part to release their claims, and if any should not release, the whole purpose of the deed would be defeated: 3. each of the creditors as covenantees had several and distinct interests; they were not joint parties : and 4. it did not appear, that the deed was delivered <em>to a party </em>as an escrow; it was indeed delivered to one of the <em>creditors ; </em>but he was not a party at the time of the delivery, unless he had then executed it, and it was not stated as part of the case that he had done so, and was a party. That case, therefore, not only stood alone, but it was not an authority in point to sustain the judgment in this case.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b508-5\"><em>Lyons </em>and <em>Stanard, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AJBH\">answered, I. that the unexpected opinion of the court at the third trial upon the question of the admissibility of <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>deposition, deprived <em>Goode of </em>that evidence, in itself conclusive of the truth of his plea, upon an objection which, if it had been anticipated, could easily have been obviated; and the final result of the case approved the justice of the court in setting aside the verdict rendered at the third trial. It was true the court had given an intimation of the objection to the competency of <em>Harrison\u2019s </em>evidence; but it was not just to say that <em>Goode </em>would not <em>take </em>the warning ; he did not <em>understand </em>it. Then, as to the question whether <em>Harrison </em>was a competent witness; if <em>Harrison </em>ever had any such interest in the cause as rendered him incompetent (which they denied), the deed of mutual release between him and <em>Goode </em>extinguished all and every interest he could have in the result of the controversy. Neither <em>Harrison, </em>nor the other nominal plaintiffs, had any interest in the costs; <em>Jackson </em>for whose benefit the suit was brought, not the plaintiffs in whose names he brought it, and who had no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>interest in it, was entitled to costs if he recovered judg- ,. ment, and responsible lor costs it he was cast. I.J. JL'he plea first pleaded was not, any more than the two additional pleas, verified by <em>Goode\u2019s </em>affidavit; yet that plea was received without objection, the plaintiffs joined issue upon it, and two trials were had of that issue ; and when the two additional pleas were offered, the plaintiffs did not object to them because they were not sworn to, but (as their bill of exceptions shewed) because they did not present a good bar. They never took exception to the pleas for want of the affidavit of the party in the court below, where the defect could, and doubtless would, have been supplied ; in effect, they waived the objection there; and it was too late now to make it here. Upon the merits, they maintained, that the pleas presented a good bar. The rule of law that a deed cannot be delivered as an escrow to the party to whom it is made, but only to a stranger to the contract\u2014that if a deed be delivered to a party to whom it is made as an escrow to be good upon certain conditions or otherwise to be void, the conditions are nugatory, and the delivery absolute\u2014had reference to deeds perfect and complete upon the face of them, and to deliveries thereof to a party or parties in interest entitled to the benefit. The rule was not, in its principle or its reason, at all applicable to a case like the present, of a bond which imported, upon its face, an incomplete contract when <em>Goode </em>parted with it, according to the intention of all parties, and required clearly, that it was to be completed by <em>Jones\u2019s </em>execution of it as a joint obligor, and this bond, so incomplete and so afterwards to be completed, delivered, not to a party having any beneficial interest in it, but to one of four nominal obligees, all of whom were naked trustees for the benefit of others. They enforced this distinction with great earnestness, and examined the authorities to shew that it was just and even necessary. But taking the case in the point of view in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 counsel regarded it, they relied on the case of <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Baker </em>as an authority directly in point for the defendant in this case: they said, it was even a stronger case than this. They then adverted to the \u00bfifference between the two additional pleas. The first of them stated, that <em>Harrison, </em>to whom the bond was delivered as an escrow, was one of the obligees, but alleged that he was only a nominal obligee, for that he did not act as one of the commissioners who sold the land for the pinchase money of which the bond was intended to be taken; he was not really an obligee even in trust for others; he was not, in truth, a party. But in the other additional plea, it is pleaded that the bond was delivered as an escrow to <em>Harrison, </em>without stating that he was one of the <em>obligees; non constat </em>from that plea, that the <em>Harrison </em>to whom .the bond was delivered as an' escrow, was the same <em>Harrison </em>who was named as one of the obligees. Issues were joined upon both the pleas; the jury found for <em>Goode </em>upon both issues ; and though the plaintiffs moved for a new trial, they took no exception to the opinion of the court overruling that motion. Upon the verdict on the last issue, <em>Goode </em>was entitled to judgment; and no exception being taken to the refusal of the court to set aside the verdict, as being contrary to evidence upon the last issue, this court could not look into the evidence to see whether or no the verdict was warranted by it; and if it could, yet seeing that substantial justice had been done, it would not disturb the verdict.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"pACB\"> There were two <em>other bonds </em>executed <em>by Goode to the same obligees, </em>for the same sum, and of the same tenor with this, only the money was payable at different dates.

On the other hand, if the plaintiffs recovered of <em>Goode, </em>and he paid the purchase money, he would have a right to the land; and then, <em>Hanison </em>would have a right, upon reimbursing the purchase money to <em>Goode </em>(part of wMch he had paid <em>by the </em>assignment of <em>Devenport\u2019s </em>bond) to demand a conveyance of the land by <em>Goode </em>to him; and <em>Hanison </em>would be accountable to <em>Goode </em>for the whole purchase money.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b510-4\">Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ap2\">I am not disposed to controvert the distinction between a deed delivered as an escrow to the party to the deed, and one that is delivered to a stranger.

Eliz. 884. the reason assigned by the court is, that if it were allowed, \u201c a bare averment, without any writing, would make void every deed.\u201d As already observed, I shall not controvert the propriety of this distinction. But I must say, that the reasoning on which it is founded, is not only very technical, but it is unsatisfactory to my mind; for it is not every tradition, or passing of a deed from the hands of one to the hands of another, that will constitute a legal delivery of it as a deed. Something at least is due to the intention with which the tradition is made; and such intention, on such an occasion, is generally gathered from our words, rather than from our actions. Therefore, I am not disposed to carry the doctrine farther than it has already been carried by the adjudged cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\">I have not observed a single case in which the doctrine has been applied to any deed which was not, on its face, perfect and complete, requiring nothing to be done to give it full efficacy as a deed according to the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>tion of the parties, hut the mere delivery of it as a deed. This is necessarily <em>the case, </em>where <em>the </em>tradition is to the party himself; for, in such case, the instrument becomes, by the mere tradition, <em>ipso facto, </em>the <em>present </em>deed of the parj;y. which could not be, if the deed were not in itself perfect and complete as an instrument, according to the intention of the parties, as gathered from the instrument itself. All the cases will accordingly be found to relate to conditions extrinsic and <em>dehors </em>the deed. Let these principles be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The deed on which this suit is brought, commences, \u201c We <em>John C. Goode </em>and <em>Benjamin B. Jones </em>are held and firmly bound &amp;c. in the just and full sum &amp;c. on or before &amp;c.\u201d and concludes \u201cwitness our hands and seals &amp;c.\u201d Then comes the signature of <em>Goode, </em>with a seal annexed; and under it, where the name of the other obligor ought to be, there is a seal, but no signature: and it is attested <em>\u201cJ. Rice, as to J. C. </em>Goode\u201d\u2014Gan any thing be more manifest, than that this deed was not intended to be the <em>several </em>deed of <em>Goode </em>? Is it not clear, that it was not intended to be even his <em>joint and several </em>deed ? It is purely and merely <em>joint; </em>importing a joint obligation with Jones\u2014and this was the intention of all the parties to the deed, at the time <em>Goode </em>signed and sealed it. A thousand witnesses would not prove this more strongly, than it is proved by the form and tenor of the instrument itself. This being the case, and the deed having been made part of the declaration by the <em>oyer </em>craved of it, a question might be made whether <em>Goode </em>might not have successfully demurred to the declaration ; or, if <em>oyer </em>had not been craved of the deed, whether he might not have successfully opposed its introduction as evidence, as being variant from the deed described in the declaration, which pleads it as the <em>several </em>obligation of <em>Goode. </em>The exigencies of this case do not require me, nor do I mean, to give any opinion on those points. But the question does arise, and I am <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>obliged to decide, whether the fact pleaded and proved by <em>Goode, </em>that the execution of the deed by <em>Jones </em>was to be the condition of its being obligatory on him, be one of those conditions which the law will disregard, merely because of the tradition by him of the instrument, in its present form, to one of the obligees ? I am clearly of opinion, that it is not. The case does not come within the reason of the rule. The fact alleged is not contrary to, but is consistent and conformable with the face of the instrument itself, and the act of the parties. Nor is there any of the danger relied on in the case in <em>Croke, </em>of defeating a solemn deed by mere averment ; for, as just observed, the averment in this case is consistent with the deed itself. There is also another most remarkable feature in this case, which eminently distinguishes it from all others: the fact on which <em>Goode </em>relies, is not only consistent with the tenor of the deed itself, but is admitted, and even sworn to, by that one of the obligees to whom the delivery was made ; who is also one of the plaintiffs in the cause, and who, notwithstanding, has become a voluntary witness on the part of the defendant. In such a case, it seems to be idle to talk of a rule, which is founded on the danger of admitting parol averments repugnant to the acts of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">I think the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Brooke and Stanard, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b513-6\">Allen, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A3o\">I concur in affirming the judgment, but not for the reason assigned. The second of the additional pleas alleges a delivery as an escrow to <em>Harrison, </em>without shewing that he was one of the obligees; to this plea there was a general replication, upon which issue was joined; and upon that issue, as well as on the others, there was a verdict for the defendant. The fact that <em>Harrison </em>was an obligee, came out in the evidence at the trial. But there was no exception to the refusal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>of the court to grant a new trial. And even if the evidence could <em>be </em>looked into, the same evidence which shewed that <em>Harrison </em>was an obligee, shewed also that the parties did not contemplate the delivery of the instrument as a deed. Under such circumstances, the court, in the proper exercise of its discretion, would have been ' justified in refusing a new trial. On this ground, I am for affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
