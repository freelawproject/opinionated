He denied, that he bought to save a debt, ,or indemnify - himself as a surety for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number><em>Woodson, </em>and said, indeed, that he did not remember that he was a surety for <em>Woodson </em>at the time. He dehied, that he knew, at the <em>time he received the deed of conveyance from Woodson, that the purchase money contracted to be paid by Woodson had not been paid by him, </em>and <em>he referred to his answer to the original bill on that point. </em>He added, that when he bought the land of <em>Woodson, </em>he <em>Woodson </em>was solvent; and the long delay of <em>Gibson </em>to assert any lien on the land, and the character of his former suit in which no attempt was made to subject the land to sale for the purchase money, was inconsistent with the present claim, or at least made it inequitable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-4\"><em>Woodson </em>also answered, and, after detailing the transaction between him and <em>Strong, </em>touching his purchase of this parcel of land, he said, that he had paid <em>William Randolph </em>from 1000 to 1200 dollars on account of his claim; that the wife\u2019s dower was still a subsisting charge; that, moreover, a suit was pending in the county court of <em>Prince Edward, </em>in favour of <em>White &amp;p co. </em>against <em>Thomas Gibson </em>and <em>Robert Gibson (Thomas </em>having been the original owner of the land), the object of which was to charge this very land with a debt due from <em>Thomas Gibson </em>to <em>White Sp co. </em>on the ground, that the conveyance by <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Robert Gibson </em>was made in fraud of <em>Thomas\u2019s </em>creditors; which suit had been instituted before the sale made by <em>Strong </em>to <em>Woodson, </em>though he did not recollect it, and it was unknown to <em>Redford </em>when he made his purchase : neither had <em>Redford </em>any knowledge of <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>present claim when he bought, and was not induced to purchase in order to save himself, the debt due to him being inconsiderable, and much the greater part of the purchase money having been paid in cash, or to <em>Wood-son\u2019s </em>orders.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b356-5\">As to the defendant <em>Strong, </em>the bill was taken for confessed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>It appeared, that the claim of <em>Randolph </em>was paid off on the 2nd June 1826, and then amounted, principal and interest, to 1260 dollars. And that the two writs of <em>ne ex cat </em>against <em>Strong </em>as <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>agent, in which <em>Wood-son </em>became surety for <em>Strong, </em>and received from him the 800 dollars to hold as indemnity, were discharged in June 1818.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-4\">The record of the suit of <em>White Sp co. </em>against <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Robert Gibson, </em>was also exhibited: it asserted a claim upon this land and other property, as having been fraudulently conveyed by <em>Thomas </em>to <em>Robert, </em>to defeat the creditors of <em>Thomas; </em>and it was still in full prosecution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-5\">There were also sundry exhibits and depositions on both sides, incoherent and inconclusive, upon the questions, whether <em>Woodson, </em>at the time of his sale to <em>Redford, </em>was solvent or not ? and whether <em>Redford </em>had notice, at that time, of the nonpayment of the purchase money by <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Gibson 1</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b357-6\">The cause was heard before the court of chancery of <em>Williamsburg </em>in January 1827; and the court declared, that <em>Redford, </em>in his answer to this bill, having said he was induced to make a purchase of the <em>High Hill </em>tract of land <em>from the character of the former suit, </em>and he having given his deposition in the former suit, wherein an amended bill had been filed charging that the purchase money had not been paid, a few months before ho gave the deposition, and two years before he obtained his deed for the land ,\u2022 and as his answers were imperfect in denying notice, and in not alleging payment before notice; from these facts, and all the evidence in the cause, the court was of opinion, that <em>Redford </em>had notice of the purchase money being still due to <em>Gibson, </em>before he paid <em>Woodson, </em>if indeed he had ever paid him; and that, therefore, the land was liable in the hands of <em>Redford, </em>for the purchase money which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>due from <em>Woodson. </em>Therefore, the court ordered accounts to ascertain what payments had been made, or incumbrances removed, by Woodson, and what was due from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-4\">After this decree was made, <em>Redford </em>filed an amended answer, wherein he positively and explicitly denied notice of the fact that the purchase money due from <em>Wood-son </em>to <em>Gibson </em>was unpaid at the date of the conveyance from <em>Woodson </em>to him, alleging, that the whole purchase money he had contracted to pay <em>Woodson, </em>was paid before <em>Woodson </em>made the conveyance. He affirmed, that the cash payment of 800 dollars was in fact made by <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Strong </em>the attorney of <em>Gibson. </em>And he referred to the suit of <em>White \u00a3f co. </em>against <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Robert Gibson, </em>the issue of which he could not anticipate, though he apprehended that the decree in it might aifect the land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b358-5\">To this answer <em>Gibson </em>put in a general replication. And the depositions of the defendant <em>Woodson </em>and of <em>Robei't G.

Therefore, the commissioner stated the account of principal and interest, allowing credit for the 1260 dollars paid to <em>Randolph </em>on the 2nd June 1826, and made the balance of the debt due to <em>Gibson, </em>principal and interest, on the 2nd December 1834, to be 3498 dollars 83 cents.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-5\">The court, at June term 1835, decreed that <em>Woodson </em>should pay <em>Gibson, </em>the sum of 3498 dollars 83 cents, with interest on 2200 dollars from the 2nd December 1834 till paid; and that unless <em>Woodson </em>or <em>Redford </em>should pay that sum, then the land called <em>High Hill </em>should be sold to pay the amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b359-6\">From which decree <em>Redford, </em>by petition to this court, asked an appeal; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3rI\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><em>Taylor </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Atxz\">contended, that he had no notice whatsoever of the nonpayment by <em>Wood-son </em>0f the 800 dollars, which, by the contract between <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Strong, </em>was \u201cto be paid down.\u201d It was true, that Gibson, in his former suit against <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Strong, </em>had by his original bill sought to set aside the transaction as fraudulent, and by an amended bill filed in July 1818, charged that the pinchase money remained yet unpaid; and it was true, that <em>Redford </em>was afterwards, in September 1818, examined as a witness in that cause touching a wholly distinct <em>point; it </em>was true too, that in <em>Redford1 s </em>answer to the present bill, he referred to the former suit, and spoke of it as one in which <em>Gibson </em>did not seek to charge the land with the purchase money. The answer shewed, indeed, that he was apprised of the object of the <em>original </em>bill, but that he was not apprised of the object of the <em>amended </em>bill ,* for it- accurately described the object of the <em>original, </em>and omitted all mention of that of the <em>amended bill; </em>and how could he be charged with notice of the <em>amended </em>bill, merely because he gave a deposition in the cause, on a distinct point, after the <em>amended </em>bill filed ? To charge a witness examined in relation to a single fact, and that a fact hardly- pertinent to the cause, with a knowledge of all the pleadings as they then were, would be straining presumption beyond reason and law. <em>Redford\u2019s </em>answers in this cause, had not been fairly considered and interpreted: they did all, with perfect consistency, and without equivocation or evasion, deny notice of the nonpayment of the purchase money by <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Gibson, </em>except that part thereof which was retained to meet mrs. <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>possibility of dower. They admitted that, according to the adjudications in the english court of chancery, if the purchase money had not been paid, and no security had been taken for it, though the conveyance expressed that it had been paid, the land in the hands of a subsequent purchaser, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>with notice of the nonpayment, might be charged with the amount due: it was an equitable lien which the court would enforce. It might be otherwise in Virginia, where all deeds were recorded, and a purchaser looked to the record to see what incumbrances there were upon the land. But, however that might be, they said, <em>Strong </em>was <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>attorney in fact, and <em>Strong\u2019s </em>acts were <em>Gibson\u2019s. </em>Now, <em>Strong </em>gave <em>Woodson </em>a receipt for the 800 dollars as so much paid to him; and though that money was returned to <em>Woodson </em>as a pledge to indemnify him as surety in the <em>ne exeat </em>bonds, still the receipt given to <em>Woodson </em>shewed, that the money was in fact paid. The land was relieved from the lien, and <em>Wood-son </em>was personally liable for the money upon the discharge of the writs of <em>ne exeat. </em>In this respect, the case resembled that of <em>White </em>v. <em>Wakefield, 7 </em>Sim. 401. 10 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 116. <em>Gibson, </em>having got his money for his land, gave it back to the vendee upon a wholly new contract. And if <em>Redford, </em>purchasing from <em>Woodson, </em>had been exactly informed of the facts, he would have been entitled to hold the land exempt from any lien for the 800 dollars. The court below erred also in holding that the 400 dollars retained for mrs. <em>Gibson\u2019s dower </em>was to be paid: <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Ld. Anson, </em>1 Sim. &amp;. Stu. 434. 1 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 221. Besides, there was no evidence that she was dead, but a letter from one <em>Dorsey </em>stating that she was; but the counsel said they had heard that she was living long subsequent to the date of that letter, and, at all events, the letter was no evidence of her death. And they submitted, that the court erred in making no provision for the satisfaction of the decree of <em>White fy co. </em>against this same land.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-6\"><em>Cooke </em>and <em>Patton, </em>for the appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUju\">entered into a critical examination of <em>Redford\u2019s </em>answers, for the purpose of shewing that he did not deny notice of the nonpayment of the purchase money by <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Gibson, </em>or, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>if he denied notice of the fact, he did not deny notice that <em>Gibson </em>claimed that it had not been paid. They coupled the circumstance of <em>Redford </em>having been examined as a witness in <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>suit against <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Strong, </em>after the amended bill was filed charging that the money had not been paid, with <em>Redford\u2019s </em>answer in this cause, in which he speaks of the nature of the former suit; and thence argued, that <em>Redford </em>was apprised, at the time of his purchase from <em>Woodson, </em>of the nonpayment of the purchase money due from <em>Wood-son </em>to Gibson. As to the rest, they said it was <em>clearly </em>settled, that the vendor of land, taking no security for the purchase money, had a lien on the land for the purchase money unpaid, which followed it in the hands of all volunteers and purchasers with notice : that the fact of the vendor having made a deed expressing on its face, that the whole purchase money was paid, or having made a deed and endorsed a receipt for the purchase money thereon, if in truth the money remained unpaid, did not relieve the land from the lien for it. <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>2 Ball &amp; Beat. 509. If a receipt for the money endorsed on the deed, could not relieve the land from the lien, how could a receipt on another piece of paper 'have that effect ? As to the 400 dollars which was retained for mrs. <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>dower, <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>lien extended to that: the vice chancellor\u2019s decree in <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Ld. Anson, </em>was reversed on appeal to the lord chancellor, 3 Russ. 488. 3 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 495. And this money was now due, for mrs. <em>Gibson </em>was dead: a letter was filed, giving an account of her death in 1828; the commissioner reported that she was dead, and no exception was taken to the report on this point. Then, as to the decree of <em>White Sf co. </em>against <em>Thomas </em>and <em>Robert Gibson, </em>the record of the suit, so far as it had then proceeded, was filed as an exhibit with <em>Woodson\u2019s </em>answer j and after the interlocutory order in this cause, the <em>decree </em>in that cause was filed as an exhibit before the commissioner. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>The decree was detached from the record, and it did not appear to be a decree in the same cause. But on examination of the decree, it would be found that it did not certainly direct the sale of this land.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b363-3\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AI8\">This is a bill filed to subject land sold and conveyed by <em>Gibson </em>to <em>Woodson </em>and by the latter to <em>Iiedford, </em>to the payment of the purchase money alleged to be due by <em>Woodson </em>to <em>Gibson. </em>That the lien of the vendor exists against the vendee and volunteers claiming under him, and against third persons who had notice that the purchase money was not paid, is laid down by all the elementary writers, and, I think, is now too clearly settled to be drawn in question. The lien, however, is the creature of a court of equity, formed upon a supposed intention of the parties; and wherever, from the circumstances of the case, it appears that the parties did not contemplate such a lien, it will not be established. There is strong reason in our country, where all incumbrances are required to be recorded, not to extend this secret equitable lien beyond the principles already established. The records are universally looked to with us, as disclosing all charges upon the property. Prudence dictates the propriety, in all cases, of retaining an express lien where the legal title is parted with. If the vendor, instead of adopting this course, chooses to rely upon his secret equitable lien, he should be cautious not to do any thing leading to the inference that no such lien was intended to be retained. If, from his acts, third persons may fairly infer that the personal credit of the vendee was looked to, it would be a fraud upon them to permit the lien to be set up against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">Gibson, then residing in Gem'gia, constituted <em>Strong </em>his attorney in fact, with full power to sell and convey the land in question, and receive the purchase money. On the 27th May 1815, <em>Strong </em>sold to <em>Woodson </em>and made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>him a deed. <em>Gibson </em>returned to <em>Virginia </em>in 1817, and in 1818 instituted a suit against his attorney <em>Strong </em>and <em>Woodson, </em>in which he sought to set aside the sale on the ground of fraud between his attorney and <em>Woodson : </em>he failed in his attempt to shew the fraud, and his bill was dismissed in 1823. <em>Strong </em>may be therefore dismissed from our view.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">What a man does by his authorized attorney, he does himself, and the case is to be contemplated, so far as third persons are concerned, as a transaction between <em>Gibson </em>himself and <em>Woodson. Gibson, </em>then, in <em>1815, </em>sold and conveyed the land to <em>Woodson, </em>and by his deed acknowledged the payment of the money. The admission in the deed, and a receipt for the purchase money endorsed on it, are not sufficient to repel the presumption of law that a lien was retained for the purchase money. The case of <em>Saunders </em>v. <em>Leslie, </em>cited at the bar, is a direct authority as to this point. On the day of the sale and conveyance, <em>Woodson </em>executed an instrument under seal, which sets out the terms of the contract. By this it appears, he was to give 2200 dollars for the <em>land; </em>of which 800 dollars is said to be paid down; 1000 dollars he retained to meet the claim of <em>Randolph, </em>then in suit, and 400 dollars on account of mrs. <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>dower interest. Of this agreement <em>Woodson </em>retained a counterpart, which he filed with his answer. On the same day, <em>Woodson </em>gave a receipt to <em>Strong, </em>acknowledging the receipt from <em>Strong </em>as attorney in fact of <em>Gibson, </em>of the sum of 800 dollars, which sum was deposited in his hands in consequence of his having become the surety of <em>Strong </em>in two bonds taken under two writs of <em>ne exeat </em>sued out against <em>Strong </em>by the creditors of <em>Gibson, </em>and the money was to remain in his hands to abide the decision of those cases. This is all the evidence we have touching the transactions of that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>It is contended by <em>Gibson\u2019s </em>counsel, that in truth no money was actually paid, and that <em>Woodson </em>has acquired the land without giving any thing at the time. The money retained to meet the <em>Randolph </em>claim, was paid to <em>Randolph </em>afterwards. And the controversy now relates to the 800 dollars, and the 400 dollars. The counsel may be correct in the inference that the sum of 800 dollars was not actually paid; but it is but an inference, from the evidence, and that against the terms of the agreement and receipt. It would, perhaps, be as reasonable to infer, that the creditors of <em>Gibson, </em>an absentee, learning that his attorney in fact, also a resident of a distant state, had sold his land and received part payment, sued out the writs, and compelled him to give the security. Whatever may have been the fact, in what attitude do these transactions place <em>Gibson </em>towards third persons, viewing them as his own acts ? (and in that aspect they must be contemplated). He sells his land, and makes a conveyance, in which the receipt of the purchase money is acknowledged: he takes on the same day an agreement from his vendee reciting the terms of the contract, in which the payment of this 800 dollars is admitted: and by another receipt, bearing the same date, it appears this money was deposited to remain with <em>Woodson </em>until the decision of certain suits. Suppose the money had been actually paid to Gibson, and in an hour afterwards, he had been held to bail in suits which he intended to controvert, and had deposited this money with his bail. Upon the payment of the money the lien was gone. Could the deposit with the bail, who happened to be the vendee, revive it ? The cases in which it has been held, that the receipt for the purchase money is not sufficient to repel the presumption of law, are cases where there was no change in the original contract : the vendor had taken the bond or agreement of the vendee for the payment of the purchase money at the times stipulated. But in a case like the present, how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>could the vendor have sued for this 800 dollars at law ? Not on the original contract, for that recited its payment. He must have recovered in an action for mo-ney had and received, and upon proving <em>that the writs </em>of <em>ne exeat </em>had been dismissed, as it appears they were, and exhibiting the receipt, his case would have been made out. The consideration, then, would have been the money deposited, and not the land sold. For this deposit he necessarily looked to the personal credit of Woodson; and if so, his lien was gone. For it never exists when the circumstances shew an intention not to rely on it. And as it regards a third person, a fair purchaser, would it not be grossly unjust to charge the property in his hands ? He sees in the hands of his immediate vendor, the deed, the counterpart of the agreement, and the receipt. Can he suppose, with these papers before him, that the land is still looked to for the security of the purchase money, in the face of the agreement acknowledging payment, and of a receipt shewing a deposit of the money with the vendee to meet a possible and distant liability ? No man, it seems to me, could have supposed he was incurring danger in purchasing under such circumstances. The case, it strikes me, is stronger against the lien than the case of <em>White </em>v. <em>Wakefield. </em>In that case, the purchase was made by one of several trustees, the money to be derived from a trust fund. The business was transacted by one of the trustees, and the vendor acknowledged the receipt of the whole of the purchase money in the deed, and by a receipt endorsed on it; but a portion of the money was retained by the trustee. There was an account between the vendor and acting trustee, shewing how the balance of the pinchase money was paid, and reciting that a sum was retained until the deeds were executed and legal matters completed, and that it was to bear interest. The vendor took a lease of the property, and so continued in possession. The case was decided against the lien, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>upon the ground, however, that the vendor had dealt in this way with one of the trustees without the knowledge or concurrence of the others. They had a right to suppose the trust fund had been properly applied, and it would have been a fraud on them to permit the lien under such circumstances to be set up against the estate. The case shows, that where, from the circumstances, third persons have a right to suppose personal credit is given, the lien will not be established against them, even although the vendor held possession of the estate under a contract of lease. As to the 800 dollars, therefore, I think the transactions shewed that no lien was retained or contemplated, and that whether <em>Redford </em>had notice of these transactions or not, is not material. Indeed, I have proceeded upon the concession, that the papers disclosing to him all <em>that </em>now appears to the court, were exhibited to him, and that Gibson, by putting it in the power of his vendee to exhibit them, has deprived himself of all right as against such vendee to charge the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The 400 dollars, retained by <em>Woodson </em>to indemnify himself against the claim of mrs. <em>Gibson </em>for dower, I think is a lien on the land. There is nothing in the circumstances indicating any intention to waive the lien as to this sum. The purchase money being an equitable lien, it devolves on the purchaser to shew circumstances indicating an intention not to insist on it. The postponement of the payment to an indefinite time, does not, it seems to me, of itself shew such intention. The authority of <em>Winter </em>v. <em>Ld. Anson, </em>relied on to shew that in such a case there was no lien, was reversed by the lord chancellor on appeal. There, <em>Mousley </em>purchased the estate of <em>Winter. </em>The conveyance expressed that the whole purchase money was paid <em>; </em>in fact, but a portion was paid; <em>Mousley </em>executed his bond for the remainder of the purchase money, payable within twelve months after the decease of <em>Winter. </em>The vice chancellor dismissed the bill. The case came up on an ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>peal before the lord chancellor, who said, \u201cIn general, where a bill, note, or bond is given for the whole or any part of the purchase money, <em>the vendor does not </em>lose his lien for so much of the money as remains unpaid. The circumstance, that the money is secured to be paid at a future day, does not affect the lien. I do not think that the lien is affected by the fact of the- period of payment being dependant on the life of the vendor. That circumstance does not appear to me to afford such clear and convincing evidence of the intention of the vendor to rely, not upon the security of <em>the </em>estate, but solely upon the personal credit of the vendee, as would be necessary in order to get rid of the lien. It would not be inconsistent with an express pledge, and I do not perceive why it is at variance with the lien resulting from the rules of a court of equity.\u201d In this case, the payment depended on the contingency of the wife surviving the husband and asserting her title to dower, and the agreement between the parties shewed it was held for the purpose of meeting that liability. Of this the purchaser had full notice, and admits it in his answer. I think, under such circumstances, he took the property subject to this charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">It is objected that there is no evidence in the record of the death of mrs. <em>Gibson. </em>There was a reference to a commissioner to ascertain the outstanding incumbrances: he reported that mrs. <em>Gibson </em>was dead, so that her dower claim constituted no charge on the estate; and to this report there is no exception on that account. The matter reported on was embraced in the scope of the enquiries submitted to the commissioner. The evidence upon which he proceeded, does not appear by his report: if upon the letter filed, although it is not proved so as to make it evidence, it may have been admitted; or other evidence of the fact may have been before him. If the correctness of his conclusion had been controverted by an exception, evidence upon the point <em>might </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>have been filed. It would be a surprise on the party, to \u2022 -t \u2022 . . permit the exception to be taken m the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"AJI\">I think, however, the court erred in not making some provision to secure the purchaser against the charge ereated by the decree in favour of <em>White fy co. </em>The purchaser was not entitled to a credit; for it does not appear certainly, that the land will be sold under the decree. Still there is enough in the proceedings in that case, to render it very probable that the land will eventually have to be sold to satisfy the claim. The charge is one which <em>Gibson </em>was bound to remove; it creates a cloud on the title, and a sale under such circumstances would necessarily be attended with a sacrifice. If the land is subjected to this charge, <em>Redford </em>would have a right to call upon <em>Woodson\u2019s </em>estate for indemnity. Under these circumstances, <em>Gibson </em>is not entitled to a decree against either <em>Woodson </em>or the land, until this incumbrance, which it was his duty to remove, is extinguished.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">Therefore, it seems to me, the decree should be reversed with costs, and the cause remanded for further proceedings, with instructions, that the land in the hands of the appellant <em>Redford </em>is liable to the payment of the 400 dollars only, retained in the hands of <em>Wood-son </em>to meet the claim of dower, with interest thereon from the time of the <em>purchase; </em>and that <em>Gibson </em>is not entitled to a decree for any part of the purchase money, until it shall be shewn that the land has been exonerated from any incumbrance growing out of the suit of <em>White Sf co. </em>against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">The <em>other judges </em>concurred\u2014Decree reversed, and cause remanded &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
