The deed recited, that <em>Peter </em>stood bound as endorser for <em>Edward </em>on two negotiable notes that had been discounted by the bank of <em>Virginia </em>at <em>Petersburg, </em>one for the sum of 4500 dollars, and the other for 1200 dollars, both of which had been executed in January preceding, and were renewable according to the course of business in the said bank at the end of every sixty days, at the pleasure of the president and directors of the bank ; and that <em>Peter </em>was bound as surety of <em>Edivard </em>in two administration bonds, one for the due administration of the estate of <em>Archibald Baugh, </em>and the other for the due administration of the estate of <em>Daniel Boisseau, </em>and was bound as surety in a forthcoming bond entered into on an execution sued out by <em>P. Martin </em>assignee of <em>William Gasquel </em>against the said <em>Edward, </em>and was bound as surety for the said <em>Edward </em>in several other bonds and notes, the amount whereof was not then recollected; and that <em>Edward </em>was indebted to <em>Peter, </em>by note or single bill dated .the 2nd May 1827, in the sum of 250 dollars, and to <em>Priscilla Boisseau, </em>by note or bill bearing even date with the deed, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>sum of 360 dollars, and was bound to pay her the sum of 66 . dollars 66 cents annually during her life; and that <em>Edward </em>was desirous to indemnify <em>Peter </em>and save imrirqess from all loss and damage by reason of his end\u00b0rsements as aforesaid, or any other he might make for the purpose of continuing the accommodation of the bank to <em>Edward </em>for the said two sums of money, or any part of them, or of either of them, and to secure <em>Peter </em>the said 250 dollars with all interest due or to become due thereon, and to secure the said <em>Priscilla </em>her annuity aforesaid, and 360 dollars, with all interest which should become due thereon. Therefore, the property, which included all the estate of Edjward, was conveyed to the trustee <em>Goode. Upon trust, </em>that whenever <em>Peter </em>should be compelled or called upon to pay all or any part of the two negotiable notes, or of any other note or notes which should be executed in order to continue the accommodation of <em>Edward </em>at the bank, or whenever <em>Peter </em>should be called upon to pay all or any part of any note or obligation in which he was bound as surety for <em>Edward, </em>or whenever <em>Edward </em>should make default in the payment of the 250 dollars with interest thereon to <em>Peter, </em>or of the 360 dollars with interest, or the annuity of 66 dollars 66 cents, to <em>Priscilla, </em>it should be lawful for <em>Goode, </em>the trustee, if required by <em>Peter </em>or by <em>Priscilla, </em>to make sale of the subject, or any part thereof, at such time and place as he should think best, after advertising &amp;c. and out of the proceeds of such sales, to pay and satisfy all charges of sale, and then to pay and satisfy to <em>Peter, </em>his executors, administrators and assigns, all and every sum or sums of money which he should have been compelled to pay as endorser or surety of <em>Edward, </em>and every sum of money with all interest that should be due to <em>Peter </em>or <em>Priscilla, </em>or to their respective executors, administrators and assigns; and so the said trustee should proceed to make sale of the said property, real and personal, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>apply the proceeds until <em>Peter </em>should be fully saved harmless as endorser and surety as aforesaid, and until <em>Peter </em>and <em>Priscilla </em>should be fully satisfied and paid all money which should be due them. And if the trustee should be compelled to make sales of the property during the lifetime of <em>Priscilla, </em>he should have power to vest so much of the proceeds of sale in productive stock, or to put out so much at interest, as would suffice to pay her the annuity of 66 dollars 66 cents for her life, and the principal to be applied after her death to the purposes of this trust. And the surplus of the said property, or of the proceeds of sale thereof, after the indemnification of <em>Peter </em>as endorser and surety, and after payment to him and <em>Priscilla </em>of the debts and annuity aforesaid, should be applied to indemnify <em>Richard Perry </em>as surety of <em>Edward Boisseau </em>administrator of <em>Archibald Baugh </em>deceased, and if any surplus should then remain, the same should be applied to indemnify <em>John Winston Jones, Thomas Howlett </em>and <em>William Hamblin, </em>the other sureties of <em>Edward </em>administrator of <em>Daniel Boisseau </em>deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b409-4\">In fact, <em>Peter Boisseau </em>was the first and <em>John F. May </em>the second endorser of a note for 4500 dollars, and <em>Peter </em>was the first and one <em>Robert Archer </em>was the second endorser of a note for 1200 dollars, both discounted at the bank of <em>Virginia </em>for the accommodation of <em>Edward Boisseau ; </em>and these notes becoming due on the 22nd January 1829, were not renewed, and the first note was protested, and the other was held by the bank, but no notice was given to <em>Peter Boisseau </em>of the dishonour of <em>either; so </em>that he was held exempt from all liability for the contents of either. See <em>May </em>v. <em>Boisseau, </em>and <em>Bank of Virginia </em>v. <em>Same, </em>8 Leigh 164. <em>Peter Boisseau, </em>therefore, never had any claim for indemnification against those two notes under the deed of trust of the 19th March 1829; he suffered no loss by reason of either of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A0E\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>The president and directors of the hank of <em>Yirginia </em>and <em>John F. \"May </em>exhibited their bill in the circuit superior court of <em>Henrico, </em>against the representative of <em>pgdward Boisseau, </em>Peter <em>Boisseau, Priscilla Boisseau, ^c^iarc^ Perry, John W.
