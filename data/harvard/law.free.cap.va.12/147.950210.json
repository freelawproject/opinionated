These slaves had been previously <em>the </em>property of the plaintiff\u2019s father : there was no evidence to shew on what terms they went to the plaintiff\u2019s residence : only the fact that they did go thither, appeared.

Code, ch. 111. $ 51. p. 432. Now, in this case, there was no proof whatever of any gift made by the father to the son, to which the possession of the son, even if possession had been proved, could be referred; and, allowing the utmost latitude of inference from the proofs of the son\u2019s possession, set out in the bill of exceptions, it was impossible to infer such an actual and abiding possession in the donee, as the statute required to support a parol gift of slaves. To sustain the judgment of the circuit superior court, this court must not only infer the fact of the parol gift of the father from the mere fact of the son\u2019s possession, but it must infer the fact of the son\u2019s possession from facts altogether equivocal and inconclusive. The son, it seemed, rested his claim on an alleged gift of his father made in 1816 or 1817, when he left his father\u2019s house, set up his blacksmith\u2019s shop fifteen miles off, and carried the slaves <em>Moses </em>and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>wife and child with him; hut the slaves remained in his possession only one year, and were then returned, and thenceforth remained in the father\u2019s possession till his death in 1832; and in 1827, the father exercised compiete ownership over them, and his right to them was acknowledged by the son; for he mortgaged the slaves to the son, to indemnify him against a suretyship the son had incurred for him, and the son declared his purpose to acquire the slaves under the mortgage. That transaction was a complete refutation of any gift prior to its date. Was any gift made subsequently to that date? Certainly, no direct proof of such gift was adduced. Did the son ever acquire the possession subsequently to 1827? The possession continued without change or interruption in the father till his death. As to the conversations stated to have occurred in 1830, between the coroner, <em>Tutt </em>the son, and <em>Tutt </em>the father, concerning the levying of the execution, between the father and the commissioner of the revenue in the same year, and between the negro-dealer and the father; he said, these proofs were too vague to warrant the inference of an actual gift by the father to the son, even of the slaves <em>Moses </em>and his wife Mirny, much more a gift of their six children. But if the <em>gift </em>could possibly be inferred from the facts, still proof of the <em>actual possession </em>of the donee under the gift, was <em>wanting; and </em>without such possession, the gift was invalid.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b172-6\">Patton, for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArO\">contended, that the parol gift under which he claimed, and his possession under the gift;, were fairly inferrible from the facts proved at the trial. This was not a controversy between the creditors of the donor and the donee, but between the donee and the administrator of the donor: neither the donor nor his representative could avail himself of any such want of formality in the gift, or the want of such a change in the possession visible to the world, as might render the transaction void as against the donor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>creditors. The question was, whether there was a valid gift of the slaves as between the parties ? <em>Tutt </em>the father made a simple unqualified delivery to <em>Tutt </em>the son, of the slaves <em>Moses </em>and his wife and child, in 1816 or 181.7 ; and this was a perfectly reasonable advancement from the father to the son: the son removed the slaves to a distance, and employed and held them in his service, till it suited his purposes or his pleasure, to break up his blacksmith\u2019s shop, and to abandon his new residence. This, he argued, was proof enough of the original gift, accompanied by possession in the donee, and therefore complete. It was true, the slaves were after-wards returned, not however to the father, but to the father\u2019s residence, and lived on the father\u2019s farm; but then it was to be considered, that the son returned to the father\u2019s house about the same time, and he also resided there, having the superintendence of all the slaves on the farm, including the slaves in question. His control over the slaves which were the property of his father, was exercised as his father\u2019s agent; but his control over the slaves in question, which were his own property, was referrible to his own rights, and was a continuance of his possession. When a father and son live together on the same farm, and both have slaves on the farm, it was most reasonable, that the possession of each parcel of slaves should be regarded as following the rights of the respective parties. As to the circumstance of the father\u2019s making the deed of trust in 1827, whereby he conveyed these slaves to a trustee for the indemnification of the son against the suretyship he had incurred for the father\u2019s debts : that could not be regarded as a waiver by the son of his rights under the previous gift of the father, or as an acknowledgment of the father\u2019s right of property in the slaves; for it did not appear that the son was apprised of the execution of the deed of trust at the time; and his subsequent wish to purchase the slaves under the deed of trust, might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>fairly attributed to his wish to avoid an unpleasant controversy with his father. That <em>Tutt, </em>the father, did not, at the time he executed that deed, or ever afterwards, ^ ^ jn or control over the slaves in question, that, on the contrary, he acknowledged the absolute right of <em>Tutt </em>the son to them as his own property, was, he said, proved beyond question, by his admission in, 1830, that these slaves (for there were no others that could have been referred to) were not liable to exectu tions for his debts; by his insisting, that they should be listed on the books of the commissioner of the revenue as the son\u2019s property, so that he should pay the taxes upon them, and the charging of them to the son accordingly; and by the father\u2019s declaration, frequently repeated in the course of several years, that he had no such slaves as these to sell, but that his sop had a blacksmith, \u201cthe man <em>Moses, </em>and his family,\u201d which he, might sell, if he pleased. <em>Royston &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Hankey, </em>3 Moore &amp; Scott, 381. 30 Eng, C. L. R. 308. It was a material circumstance, that <em>Tutt, </em>the son, had reco-r vered the slave <em>Moses </em>in an action of <em>detinue </em>against <em>Slaughter </em>in his lifetime, upon the same title, upon which <em>he now </em>claimed the value of the six children of <em>Moses: </em>that recovery ought to conclude the question here. <em>Shelton </em>v. <em>Barbour, </em>2 Wash. 64.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b174-5\">But supposing the question of <em>title more doubtful than </em>it was, yet, he said, the verdict of the jury ought not to be disturbed. This was a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was against evidence; and it was well settled, that, in spch a case, a new trial ought to be granted only where the verdict is a plain deviation, from right and justice; never in a doubtful case, merely because the court, if of the jury, would have given a different verdict; <em>per Roane, </em>J. in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>3 Call 319. <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>5 Leigh 598. <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Callison, </em>6 Leigh 230. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Hundley, 7 </em>Leigh 119. <em>Mahon </em>v. <em>Johnston, </em>Id. 317.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b175-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number><em>Leigh, </em>in the reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A00\">insisted, that the verdict here was a plain deviation from right and justice. But, he said, the question was, whether it was not against law ? whether, upon the facts stated in the bill of exceptions, and certified by the court as the facts established by the evidence at the trial, the jury was warranted in inferring a gift, valid in law, by the father to the son, of the slaves in question? He said, it had been well understood, since the case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>6 Munf. 125. that appeals from judgments overruling motions for a new trial, could never present <em>any question of fact </em>(properly so called) to this court; any question as to the weight of evidence, or the credit of witnesses, which the jury, and the court that tried the cause, could judge of better than an appellate court. If the court that tried the cause should overrule the motion for a new trial, its duty was to state and certify the facts, which; in its opinion, were proved at the trial ,* and then the question in this court, upon an appeal from the judgment, was, whether the jury, in their verdict, drew improper, or failed to draw proper, inferences from the fitcts proved? And this has been regarded here as a question of law, upon which this court has exactly the same materials for forming a correct judgment as the court below had. He cited <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, 1 </em>Leigh 340. <em>Ewing </em>v. <em>Ewing, </em>2 Leigh 337. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Van-meter, </em>9 Leigh 18. <em>Rohr </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>Id. 30.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b167-16\"> He had been counsel in the cause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b175-4\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A_5\">Upon the facts stated in the bill of exceptions, and certified by the court as all the facts proved at the trial, it seems to me, that the court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial. A gift of slaves, to be valid, must either be by deed or will properly proved and recorded, or else the possession must have passed from the donor to the donee, and remained with the donee or some person claiming under him.</p>\n<p id=\"ADH\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>The first fact relied upon to establish the gift is, that in 1816 or 1817, <em>Tutt </em>the son, then a very young man, removed to a place in the same county, about fifteen miles from his father\u2019s house, and opened a blacksmith\u2019s shop, in which the slave <em>Moses </em>worked as a smith; the wife of the negro and one child were with him. They remained about a year, when the shop was broken up, and the negroes returned to the farm of <em>Tutt </em>the father. There was no evidence to shew the terms on which the son held the negroes during this period; the fact alone appeared, that they were in his possession, as stated. Would this proof, standing alone, justify the inference of a gift, and delivery of possession consummating it ? It does not strike me as being sufficient. It was remarked by judge <em>Tucker </em>in the case of <em>Mahon </em>v. Johnston, that \u201cwhere the gift is without value received, it is but reasonable, that the party who is to be deprived of his property without an equivalent, should be clearly proved to have actually parted with it. This can never be done, where the evidence to establish the gift is altogether equivocal; and such is always the case with mere evidence of <em>possession </em>in a transaction between a father and a child,- such possession being equally consistent with the idea of a loan, or gift, and both loans and gifts, under such circumstances, being common, the fact of possession does not prove much.\u201d These remarks seem to me to be sound, and that much mischief might ensue, if it were ever to be established that the mere possession by a child of a slave theretofore belonging to the father, should afford sufficient evidence of a gift. The act is equivocal of itself,- and unconnected with other circumstances it proves nothing ; it is every day\u2019s practice for the parent to permit the child to hold possession of a slave for his accommodation, without intending to part with the property, or deprive himself of the power to dispose of it according to his own pleasure, when he comes to distribute his estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>The circumstances attending the transaction in this case, would rather lead to the inference of a loan than a gift. The son was a very young man, and unmarried. It does not appear, that he returned immediately to his father\u2019s house on the breaking up of his shop; he crossed the mountains, it appeared, and lived some time there, and then returned to his father\u2019s ; but whether this was before or after opening the shop did not distinctly appear. But, as it did appear he was very young when he opened the shop, the inference is strong, that it was on abandoning the business that he crossed the mountains. The whole seems to have been an experiment by a young man, in which the father aided him, probably with the intention of giving him the slaves, if it turned out successful; but there is nothing to warrant the inference of a gift at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">The slaves returned to the father\u2019s plantation, which was large, and on which there were many slaves. The son also returned, and managed for the father. To all appearance, the slaves in question were as much the slaves of the father as the other slaves on the plantation. And in November 1827, the father executed two bonds to a creditor, in which the son joined as a surety; and on the same day, the father executed a deed of trust of the slaves in question, to indemnify the son against loss as his surety. The son afterwards told the trustee, that he hoped to borrow money to pay the debts, to have the slaves sold, and buy them himself. He did not, to the trustee, a near neighbour and friend, set up any claim to the slaves. If the father had executed a deed of trust on the slaves to secure the <em>creditors, </em>the circumstance might not have had much influence: the son, though asserting a claim, might have consented to the slaves being pledged to secure a debt for which he himself had become responsible. But that is not this case. The deed was given for his own indemnification. He could not then have asserted a claim to the negroes by virtue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>of any supposed donation in 1816 or 1817; for he would, 7 . <em>n i \u2022 m </em>that case, have taken a deed of trust of his <em>own </em>property to secure himself. It is not expressly stated, that \u201e , .. . he knew of the deed ,\u2022 but he ivas then living Avith his father, and the deed is stated to bear date on the same day he became surety in the bonds. And whether apprized of the execution of the deed at the time or not, he kneAV of it afterwards ahd before the debt was satisfied, and expressed a hope of being able to borrow the money to pay the debts, and an intention to pinchase at the sale under the deed of trust. The execution of the deed of trust, and the conduct of the son in regard <em>to </em>it, are decisive against any right as growing out of the short possession held by him in 1816 or 1817. He must rely exclusively on the subsequent transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"AJO\">Is there any fact certified, <em>which </em>proves, or from which the jury could fairly have inferred, a valid gift ? In 1830, an officer went to the house of the father to levy an execution against him to a large amount. The son observed, it should not be levied on the slaves belonging to him, but did not name the slaves. The father, hearing this, said there was enough of other property. Prior to 1830, all the slaves had been given in, to the commissioner of the revenue, in the father\u2019s name, sometimes by the father, sometimes by the son: in that year, the father told the commissioner, that the property had theretofore been listed in his name, but it must now be separated, and <em>\u201c </em>the boys\u201d must give in their oivn property. He did not, nor did any one else, say what was his,- or what belonged to <em>\u201c </em>the boysbut a change was made, and the son was charged with some slaves. A witness had frequently, for the last ten or twelve years before the trial, suggested to the father that a blacksmith would sell well, and asked whether he had such slave to sell, or suggested he might make such a sale ; to which the father replied <em>he </em>had none, but that the plaintiff had a blacksmith, a man Moses, and his family, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>which he might sell if he pleased. These are all the facts bearing directly on the question of the gift after the deed of trust. And taking them most favourably for the son, it seems to me, we cannot construe them as amounting to a gift, without overturning the well settled principles of law. To the validity of such a gift, possession is essential. This possession should not be colourable, but real. The possession of the donor, in the words of judge Carr, in <em>Durham, </em>v. Dunkly, 6 Rand. 141. should be broken up. According to the facts of this case, there was, subsequent to the deed of trust, no such actual change of possession. To the world, the slaves continued in the situation they had remained in for years before. There was nothing to distinguish them from the other slaves on the father\u2019s farm. The father still remained the visible owner. The possession remained unchanged. It is then unnecessary to enquire, whether, if there had been proof of a subsequent change of possession, the facts would establish a gift. For unless the donee has obtained possession, no proof of an intention to give, or of declarations that a gift had been made, would suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">It was argued, that as the jury and court below have, upon these facts, decided in favour of the plaintiff below, the deviation should be gross and palpable, before this court should interfere with the verdict: and <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, Brugh v. Shanks, </em>and <em>Mays </em>v. <em>Callison, </em>arc cited. <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>the leading case on this subject, and referred to in all the subsequent cases as giving the rule, was decided before the case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>in which this court established the rule, since rigidly adhered to, except in one or two instances not affecting the principle, that a bill of exceptions to a judgment overruling a motion for a new trial, ought not to state the evidence, but the facts appearing to the court to have been proved. The grounds upon which this rule was established are familiar. \u201c The appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>court (it is said), sees the evidence on record only; and on paper the credit of every witness, not positively impeached, is the same.\u201d The inferior court, <em>\u201c </em>while it r can fa^hfully transmit to this the actual words spoken py the witness, can give it no <em>fac simile </em>of the manner\u201d of the witnesses. It is further stated to be an important principle, that the revising court should have the same lights, and act on the same data, as the court below; and that where this advantage is wanting in the appellate court, the judgment of the court below will preponderate. These remarks of judge <em>Roane </em>in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>are unanswerable, when confined to the subject to which he applied them. He was discussing the propriety of the appellate court\u2019s reviewing the verdict and judgment of the trying court, upon the evidence as given before the jury. But I do not perceive their force, or the application of the principle laid down in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>when the <em>facts, </em>and not the <em>evidence, </em>are certified. And I incline to think they were relied on in the case of <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>and other cases since the case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>without sufficiently adverting to the change which that case has made. Thus, judge <em>Carr, </em>in <em>Brugh </em>v. <em>Shanks, </em>after quoting the decision in <em>Ross </em>v. <em>Overton, </em>observes, \u201c These remarks are applied to the court which presides at the trial, and has all the advantages (possessed by the jury) of seeing and hearing the witnesses: how much more strongly do they apply to the appellate court, deprived of these all important aids in'eviscerating truth?\u201d But when the facts are certified, this court has nothing to do with the credit of the witnesses. The truth has been eviscerated for it. The appellate court acts upon an admitted state of facts; it takes them as the conceded facts, upon which the court and jury have proceeded; and so taking them, what is to prevent it from arriving at a correct conclusion ? Having all the 'facts, the question is, whether the court and jury drew a correct conclusion from them ? <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>And what better opportunity is possessed by the court . . and jury, than the revising court ? Their opportunities of deciding whether facts are or are not established by , . _ . . . the evidence, are certainly far superior. Hut having advanced that far, and arrived at the facts, the conclusion of law upon the facts may as well be drawn by the revising as the inferior coiu\u2019t. This, it seems to me, is the fair construction of the case of <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway. </em>The important principle is, that the revising court should have the same lights, and act upon the same <em>data, </em>as the inferior court. And therefore judge <em>Roane </em>held it improper to set out the <em>evidence </em>in the bill of exceptions. But when the facts are stated, he observes, \u201cthe appellate court does not in that case depart from or overrule the decision of the trying court, as to the weight of testimony, or the credit due to any witness. It only acts upon his own certificate and acknowledgment of his opinion upon the subject.\u201d A bill of exceptions setting out the facts, he observes, \u201c briefly states them, as they appeared to the judge, and are admitted by him to have been proved; and, in consequence of such his admission, the appellate court founds its decision upon the same facts as those which governed the court below.\u201d If the appellate court has the same lights and proceeds upon the same data, as the jury and the trying court, there would seem to be no sufficient reason why it should not draw its own conclusions, uninfluenced by the judgment and verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-10\">A different practice is calculated to do injustice. The exceptor is compelled to take the certificate of facts from the tribunal which has pronounced against him. With every disposition to do equal justice, it is the natural tendency of the human mind to give prominence, and sometimes imperceptibly to attach undue importance, to evidence which has influenced its own decision. And if, upon the facts so certified, the party is to be met in the appellate court with every presumption against him, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>the right to appeal from the decision overruling the motion for a new trial, becomes but a mockery.</p>\n<p id=\"Am0\">This view is supported by the decision of this court <em>Qarr;ngfon Y. Bennett. </em>That was an action on a bond, to which the defence of gaming was set up. A doubt arose whether the bill of exceptions set out the <em>evidence, </em>or <em>the facts proved; </em>a majority of the court considered it as setting out the facts proved. There was no direct proof that the bond was given on a gaming consideration. And judge <em>Carr, </em>after citing <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>said, \u201c that the appellate court must act on the facts stated, as upon a special verdict, and is to infer or imply nothing:\u201d that the evidence went strongly to shew that the bond was for a gaming debt; but that the jury had said otherwise, and the court agreed with <em>them; that </em>they both heard the witness, and their decision must have been governed by the credit given to him. The other judges differed. Judge <em>Green </em>observed, that \u201c in a case where there was no direct evidence to prove the <em>fact </em>in issue, but only proof of other facts from which the matter in issue might or might not be inferred; if the court, instead of stating the proved facts, from which such an inference might arise, were required to state its own inference, this would be, <em>not </em>to <em>state the fact </em>or <em>facts </em>proved, but <em>the judgment </em>of the court as to their effect ,\u2022 and there would be nothing for the appellate court to decide upon. Yet the jury and the court below may err as essentially, and as fatally to the rights of the parties, in their inferences of other facts from the admitted facts, as in respect to the law arising from the facts proved.\u201d The opinion of judge <em>Coalter </em>was to the same effect. And the court in that case, from the proved facts, inferred the fact that the bond was. given for the gaming debt, contrary to the finding of the jury and the judgment of the trying court: thereby, in effect, determining, that with the facts before it, it must pronounce its own judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>upon them; that having the same lights it must deduce its own inferences. If the facts proved did not establish the fact necessary to a just conclusion, but such further fact was to be inferred from the facts proved, and those facts left it entirely <em>uncertain </em>whether the further fact could <em>fairly </em>be inferred; there, I think, respect should be paid to the verdict and judgment of the trying court, because a fair presumption might arise, that the fact necessary to warrant or repel the inference, had been omitted in the certificate of facts; and because that should be held as rightly determined which the facts did not shew to be wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">I am of opinion, that upon the facts stated, we have all the power and authority of the jury and court below, and that the facts stated do not warrant the verdict in this case. I think the judgment should be reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">Cabell and Brooke, J. concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b183-8\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Aay\">Concurring as I do in the opinion just delivered by my brother Allen, that the verdict in this case is unsupported by the facts certified by the court, and that the judgment should be reversed and a new trial awarded, I think it proper to say, that I cannot altogether acquiesce in his views as to the principles which should govern this appellate tribunal on questions of new trial, where the jury and the inferior court have concurred in their opinions against the party asking it. There is, perhaps, after all, but a shade of difference; but I deem it right, until we can have a full court to settle the question, to prevent the conclusion which might be drawn from my silence, that I yield entire concurrence in the opinions which have been expressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">Where the facts certified to this court under the rule established in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway, </em>present but a naked question of <em>lato, </em>there seems to be no difference of opi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>nion. In such, a case, this court would not be influenced by the opinion of the jury or inferior court as to the law of the case, and would grant a new trial or not, raccording to its own opinion of the law arising upon the facts stated. <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Vanmeter, </em>cited at the bar, rests on this principle. But it sometimes happens, that from the. facts stated, some other fact must be inferred, in order to make out the case of the party. As in trover, though the <em>conversion </em>may not in terms be proved, yet facts may be proved from which the jury may have inferred a conversion. So, in <em>Carrington </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>gaming was not distinctly proved to be the considera- ' tion of the contract, <em>yet from </em>the facts stated, the jury might have inferred it. And so in this case of a gift. Facts are here proved, from which the jury doubtless inferred a <em>gift; </em>and the only question is as to the correctness of this inference. Indeed, in all these cases, the question presents itself, not whether the verdict is right in point of <em>laio, </em>but whether the jury have fairly inferred <em>the </em>issue, or <em>main fact </em>in the cause, from the facts which have been actually proved with a view to establish it. .Where such a case presents itself, my brethren seem to think, that little weight is to be attributed. to the opinions of the court and jury, though they admit that they would lean in favour of the verdict, if they felt doubts upon their own minds in relation to the.propriety of the inference to be drawn. On the other hand, it seems to me, that although the decision in <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Hardaway </em>removes one great difficulty, by substituting a .certificate of the facts,. for. a certificate of the <em>evidence, it </em>is still reasonable .to. presume, that the -jury and the trying court may often have superior means of arriving at a correct inference from the facts found, arising out of incidents at the trial which may be omitted, or could not easily be committed to the court\u2019s certificate. The prevarication of an unwilling witness might, lead the jury who heard, him, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>draw stronger inferences from the facts extorted from him, than this court might be disposed to draw from the naked fact appearing upon the record. I therefore think, that the true rule still is, that where the jury and the court below concur, this court should not grant a new trial upon the ground that false inferences have been drawn from the facts found, \u201c unless in a case of plain deviation, and not in a doubtful one, merely because the court, if of the jury, would have given a different verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Judgment reversed, and cause sent back for a new-trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
