They said that <em>Boyd, </em>the administrator of <em>David Pierce, </em>would, perhaps, compel them to pay the amount of the judgment recovered against them, though they believed he would not press the collection unless the exigencies of <em>Pierce's </em>estate should require it, but would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>await the termination of this suit.

That this was not a proper case for subrogation; for the sureties, when they exhibited the bill, had not paid the debt due on the judgment of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator; and he could not be required to cede to the sureties his rights and remedies against the principal debtor, until they paid the debt. <em>Enders </em>v. <em>Brune, </em>4 Rand. 438. It might be true, that the sureties paid the debt pending the suit: but they did not allege in their bill, that they had, but, on the contrary, they stated that they had not paid it. But there was no proof of the payment, unless <em>Boyd\u2019s </em>receipt for it, without proof of its execution, was sufficient to establish the fact; and, indeed, as the fact was not in issue, there could not regularly be any such proof. 2. They said, the lien of the judgment was a legal lien on <em>English\u2019s </em>land, depending on the right of the creditor to sue out an <em>elegit, </em>and that would have entitled him to extend a moiety of the land. The <em>elegit </em>would have given the creditor all that he was entitled to: there was no circumstance in the case, which could furnish a ground for the interference of equity; and if the circumstances did furnish ground for equitable relief, the relief could not be extended beyond a moiety of the proceeds of sale of the land. <em>Stuart </em>v. <em>Hamilton\u2019s ex\u2019ors, 8 </em>Leigh 503. The decree gave the sureties full payment of the debt, which exceeded a moiety of the proceeds of the sale. 3. The bill of exchange for 2000 dollars, was taken for part of the proceeds of the trust subject sold under the deed of July 1835, and was delivered to <em>Fulton; </em>and that sum would have sufficed to discharge the debt for which <em>Matthews </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>and <em>Jackson </em>were bound. They had an undoubted lien on that fund; and <em>Pierce's </em>administrator had a lien on <em>English's </em>land by the judgment; but <em>Kent </em>had only a lien on the land by the deed of November 1836. Now, where one creditor had two securities, and another had only one of those securities, the first must exhaust the security which the other has not, before he could be allowed to resort to the security which the other has in common with him. They cited <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Nutt, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 326. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>6 Ves. 714. <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 123. It could not be pretended, that the fund mortgaged by the deed of July 1835, for the indemnification of <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>was exhausted, until the 2000 dollars due by the bill of exchange should be applied, or proved unavailing. If <em>Kent </em>were to pay off this judgment, he would be entitled, by subrogation, to the bill of exchange. It is supposed to be worthless; be it so; yet <em>Fulton </em>received it as part of the proceeds of the trust subject; and if he, or his <em>cestuis que trust, </em>had impaired or lost their security, either he or they must abide the loss. <em>Jackson, </em>one of the plaintiffs, was the agent of <em>Fulton </em>for the sale of the trust slaves: it was he who received <em>the bill of </em>exchange instead of money, or purchased it with part of the trust fund; though it was delivered by <em>English </em>to <em>Fulton. </em>4. They said, there was 1000 dollars paid by <em>Fulton </em>to <em>English, </em>or retained by <em>English </em>with <em>Fulton's </em>consent, and with the knowledge, and of course acquiescence, of the plaintiffs; and this sum of 1000 dollars ought, at all events, in favour of <em>Kent, </em>to be credited against the judgment of <em>Pierce's </em>administrator against the plaintiffs. If that 1000 dollars was part of the proceeds of the three slaves, which <em>English </em>carried to the southwest, and sold, along with the trust subject, it ought to have been deducted out of the 2000 dollars due by the bill of exchange, which <em>English </em>brought back and delivered to <em>Fulton, </em>instead of being deducted, as it was, out <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>of the cash received for the trust subject. 5. The trust fund that came into <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>hands, ought, by the terms of his trust, to have been divided, rateably, among the creditors secured by the mortgage ; but, with the consent of <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>the whole of it was paid to the other creditors; no dividend was paid to them; and, as between them and <em>Kent, </em>their just dividend ought to be credited upon the judgment of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator. They voluntarily gave up so much which they were entitled to receive, and could have no right to claim the same amount out of the proceeds of the sale of land mortgaged to <em>Kent. </em>Lastly, they said, the decree was plainly wrong in its details: it gave interest upon interest.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b603-5\"><em>M\u2019Comas, for </em>the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APn\">said, 3. That a surety had an undoubted right to resort to equity against the principal debtor and the creditor, to compel the creditor to collect the debt of the principal, and the principal to pay the debt, out of the lands he held subject to it, or out of any other means he had. <em>Ranelagh </em>v. <em>Hayes, </em>1 Vern. 189. <em>Nisbet </em>v. <em>Smith, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 579. Story\u2019s Eq. 327. 730. The very case of <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>cited for the appellant, proved the proposition. Now this, he said, was the precise object of the bill in this case. The money had not been then paid, and therefore the plaintiffs asked that it might be paid out of the proceeds of the land : but they foresaw that they might be compelled to pay it before the termination of the suit; and, in that case, under their prayer for general relief, they were entitled to subrogation. 2. Equity had jurisdiction to give relief, and to decree the payment of the whole amount of the judgment recovered against <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Jackson, </em>out of the proceeds of sale of the land bound by the judgment; for which he cited <em>Mut. </em>Ass. <em>Society </em>v. <em>Stanard, </em>5 Munf. 539. <em>Blow </em>v. <em>Maynard, 2 </em>Leigh 29. and <em>Haleys </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>1 Leigh 140. Then, 3. as to the bill of exchange, neither <em>Matthews </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>and <em>Jackson, </em>nor <em>Fulton </em>the trustee, were in any default in failing to collect the bill of exchange, or to get it cashed ; every effort to get it cashed had been made by <em>Fulton ; </em>and then by <em>English ; </em>and <em>English </em>after-wards undertook to transfer the bill of exchange to other parties. Certainly, if this fund was available, it ought to be applied, in the first instance, to the discharge of the judgment of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator; but it had not yet been collected, and probably never might be ; and the judgment creditor was not bound to wait till its fate could be ascertained, before he resorted to the lien of the judgment on <em>English\u2019s </em>land for satisfaction <em>; </em>for which he referred to <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Simpson, </em>cited for the appellant. 4. As to the 1000 dollars which <em>Fulton </em>allowed <em>English </em>to <em>retain; </em>that, he argued, was part of the proceeds of the three slaves which <em>English </em>carried out along with the trust subject, and sold. 5. The trust fund that came into <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>hands was applied to the payment of other creditors, and no dividend was paid to <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator; but it was paid to creditors who had acquired a lien on <em>English\u2019s </em>land by judgments of the same date with that of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator, and who, if they had not been paid, would have had the same right to have recourse against <em>English\u2019s </em>land, which <em>Mattheios </em>and <em>Jackson </em>now had, and they therefore stood in the shoes of those other creditors. If the money had been distributed <em>pro rata, </em>the other creditors would have been party plaintiffs <em>here; </em>and it was immaterial, whether the whole of the judgment of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator remained to be satisfied, or whether the other creditors were entitled to satisfaction to the same amount. And he prayed the court to consider, as to the objections founded on the hill of exchange, the 1000 dollars which <em>English </em>was allowed to retain, and the payment of the whole trust money to other creditors than <em>Matthews </em>and Jackson\u2014that all these transactions occurred months before <em>Kent </em>got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Ms lien ; and if they had released the whole trust sub- . ject in <em>Fulton\u2019s </em>hands, they would still have retained their lien on the land, and <em>Kents </em>lien must have been subordinate to it. He acknowledged that the decree was erroneous in the details ; that it ought to have been for 1753 dollars 53 cents, with interest on 1325 dollars part thereof, being the principal debt, from the 24th February 1840; but this was a mere inadvertence, which nowise affected the principles in controversy between the parties, and might be corrected without disturbing the principles of the decree.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"ARv\"> The following was the state of the account\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">\u201c Principal of judgment, - 1325 00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-8\">Interest on same, from November 13.1833 to February 24.1840, - 499 29</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-9\">Costs,.....11 17</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-10\">1835 46</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-11\">Deduct amount paid July 11.1837, - 25 20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-12\">amount paid September 6.1837, 44 53</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-13\">amount paid May 18.1838, - 12 20</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-14\">- 81 93</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-15\">Due,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-16\">$1753 53\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-17\">It is plain, that of the balance of 1753 dollars 53 cents, only 1325 was principal, and that the residue was interest and costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b605-6\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A4l\">The right of a surety to the aid of a court of equity, to compel the principal to pay the debt, and thereby exonerate him, is sustained by numerous decisions (some of which were cited at the bar) and rests on the soundest principles of natural justice. This is so free from doubt, that lord <em>Thurlow, </em>in the case of <em>Nisbet </em>v. Smith, said it had never been disputed. And the surety is entitled to resort for his indemnity to all the securities which the creditor holds. These rights combined, manifestly sustain the claim of the surety, seeking the aid of equity for his exoneration by compelling payment from the principal, to make the existing liens and securities of the creditor subservient to that end. Such is the nature of the claim set up by the bill in this case. It is true, the right of subrogation is asserted in the body of the hill, but the prayer is, in effect, that the lien of the creditor shall be upheld and dedicated to the protection and exoneration of the sureties, and for general relief. I do not doubt that the bill presents a fit case for relief in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">The title to this relief is encountered by various objections, founded on the facts developed by the pleadings and proofs, which have been urged by the appellant\u2019s counsel with earnestness and ability.</p>\n<p id=\"AdV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>It is objected, that an amount sufficient for the indemnification of the sureties, part of the subject mortgaged for that purpose by the deed of trust of July 1835, remains unadministered, and that that subject should be exhausted, before the lien of the judgment on the land should be enforced, to the disappointment of the appellant, who is the subsequent incumbrancer of the land : in effect, that as the appellees, who claim under the elder incumbrance, have two funds for their indemnity, and the appellant is the junior incumbrancer on one of them, the appellees should not have that one charged with their claim, till the other shall be applied and exhausted. If both funds were equally accessible and available, or could be made so by the court, the equity to apply the fund not directly charged by the junior incumbrancer, would be plain and incontestable. But that is not the case here. The productiveness of the unadministered subject of the trust of July 1835, is, in all probability, precarious as to the amount, and the time when it may be realized is indefinite. If the objection were sustained, it would leave the claimant under the junior and subordinate title, predominant over the elder and superior: it would give the junior and subordinate incumbrancer possession of a certain and adequate fund, while the elder and superior would be put upon the tedious and perhaps fruitless pursuit of satisfaction from a doubtful and discredited security. This is forbidden by the general principles of equity: the general rule -entitles the elder and superior claim to satisfaction out of the fund most certainly productive and most accessible, whenever the junior can, by subrogation or otherwise, have the benefit of the fund liberated by such satisfaction. Here, if any thing shall in future be realized from the remaining subject of the trust of July 1835, Kent, the junior incumbrancer, having the subject embraced by his incumbrance withdrawn from him to satisfy the elder and superior claim of <em>Matthews </em>and Jackson, will be entitled to indemnification from it.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>It is further objected, that the sales of the trust slaves mortgaged by the deed of July 1835, produced enough for the full indemnification of the appellees, and that, as between the parties to this controversy, the claim of the appellees rests on the ground they Avould have occupied, if the whole amount produced had been duly applied; because, it is said, by their consent or acquiescence, 1000 dollars, part of the proceeds of sale, was retained by <em>English, </em>and by the improvidence of one of them, acting as agent to make the sale of the slaves, and the subsequent assent or acquiescence of them both, the bill of exchange Avas received, instead of money, as part of the proceeds of sale. To the first member of the objection, a ready and effectual answer is furnished by adverting to the position of the parties at the time when the proceeds of the sale of the slaves Avere accounted for, and the rights and obligations of the parties to that transaction. The settlement between <em>Eulton </em>the trustee, <em>Jackson </em>the agent of sale, and <em>English </em>who accompanied the agent and cooperated with him in making the sale, was made in March 1836. At that time, judgments had been rendered for the debt for which <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Jackson </em>were sureties, and for the other debts secured by the same deed of trust; and the security furnished by the deed of trust was reinforced by the liens of those judgments on <em>English\u2019s </em>land. And at that time, <em>Kent </em>had no lien on the land; the deed of trust under which he claims was not executed till November following. <em>Kent, </em>consequently, had no rights to be affected by any arrangement between <em>English </em>and the creditors claiming under the mortgage of the slaves, whereby a part of the proceeds of the trust slaves Avas permitted to be applied to the use or to other responsibilities of <em>English. </em>The utmost effect of the permission, was a surrender of the lien of the creditors on so much of the fund thus diverted from the purposes of the trust, and no wise impaired the lien of the creditors on the residue of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>trust subject, or on <em>English's </em>land. Nay, a total release the security of the deed of trust of the slaves, would not, in any degree, have impaired the lien of the judgments, in favour of <em>Kent, </em>who had then no lien with which that of the judgments interfered. These remarks supply an answer to the other part of the objection, founded on the receipt of the bill of exchange. That was a transaction of English, or, at least, one in which he participated, and of which he could not complain: the receipt of the trustee for it was given to <em>English. </em>At the time it was received, the creditors might have consented to substitute the bill of exchange in place of money for their security, and to permit <em>English </em>to apply the money to other uses or responsibilities, even though it had distinctly appeared that the whole proceeds of sales of the slaves had been received in money, without impairing the liens of their judgments, so far as the appellant, who had then no lien, was concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">Another objection is, that the lien of the judgment, in its utmost extent, covered only a moiety of <em>English's </em>land, and <em>that </em>the utmost <em>that </em>ought to have been decreed by the court to the exoneration or indemnity of <em>Matthews </em>and Jackson, was a moiety of the net proceeds of sale. My impression is that the appellant\u2019s counsel were right in the principle on which they founded this objection; but though this be so, it is <em>my </em>distinct opinion, that this case does not present a fit occasion for the application of the principle. If the judgment under which the appellees claim, had been the only one of the claims secured by the mortgage of the slaves for which there was a lien on the land, the case would be one for the application of the principle, or for a judicial ascertainment of its soundness. But, in this case, all the other claims secured by the mortgage of the slaves, were liens on the land, and many, if not all, the judgments for them which gave those liens, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>rendered at the same court (September 1835) at which the judgment was recovered against <em>Matthews </em>and Jack<em>son ; </em>and by those liens the whole land was chargeable and liable to extent. Those claims charged the entirety of the proceeds of sales of the mortgaged slaves. The application of the proceeds of either subject to satisfy one or more of the claims, with or without the consent of the creditors holding the other claims, left the unsatisfied claimants incumbrancers on the residue of both the subjects, and clothed with all the rights of the satisfied claimants, necessary to secure the application of that residue to the other claims. The moment that a part of the proceeds of the slaves, which might have been applied to the partial indemnity of the appellees, was applied to the satisfaction of other claims which equally bound and might have been satisfied out of the <em>land, </em>a title vested in the appellees, sustained by plain equity, to have the unapplied lien on the land appropriated to supply the deficiency caused by withdrawing from their indemnity the proceeds of the slaves. And the lien, which the appellant subsequently acquired by the deed of November 1836, cannot control or impair this elder and superior equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\">The balance due on the judgment of <em>Pierce\u2019s </em>administrator was 1753 dollars 53 cents, with interest on 1325 dollars, principal, from the 24th February 1840, and such is the balance shewn by the commissioner\u2019s report. That was the measure of the lien on the land, whether the proceeds of the land were applied by the decree to the exoneration of the sureties <em>Matthews </em>and <em>Jackson </em>by decreeing payment to the creditor, or to their indemnity by decreeing payment to them in reimbursement of the money they paid in satisfaction of the judgment. The court, however, by mistake, assumed that the report shewed that 1753 dollars 53 cents, with interest on the <em>whole sum </em>from the 24th February 1840, was due on the judgment, and charged the proceeds of the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>accordingly. This mistake, I doubt not, might and would have been corrected by application to the court below; and if the appellees had caused such correction to be made, they would, under the statute 1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 108. p. 512. have been entitled to an affirmance of the decree. My impression is, that as <em>that </em>has not been done, this court should correct the error, by reversing the decree <em>pro tanto, </em>giving costs to the appellant, or at least, not giving them to the appellees. But my brethren thinking that the decree should be affirmed, with the correction, and with costs to the appellees as the parties substantially prevailing, such must be the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Decree corrected, and affirmed, with costs to the appellees as the parties substantially prevailing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
