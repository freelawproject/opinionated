The lessors of the plaintiff were the heirs at law of <em>Mary Randolph. </em>And the question referred to the court by the special verdict, was, Whether, upon the facts therein stated, the title of <em>Mary Randolph </em>in the land which the deed of January 1798 purported to convey, passed thereby to <em>George Hairston, </em>the bargainee ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b467-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>The circuit superior court held that it did not, and gave judgment for the plaintiff.

The regularity of the proceeding must he tested by its conformity with the provisions of the statute of 1814-'T5, ch. 28. &lt;$&gt; 3. which was the law of the land at the time. But for <em>the </em>purpose <em>of </em>understanding the spirit of our legislation on the subject of conveyances of real estate by <em>femes covert, </em>it may be well to look back to former statutes <em>in pari materia, </em>and especially to compare the provisions of the statute of 1814-\u201915 with those of the statute of 1785, ch. 62. the construction of which has been the subject of adjudication.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>It will be found, on examination of the series of statutes on the subject, that all of them previous to that of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>1785 only required that the <em>feme covert </em>should he examined by the court, or by the justices under the <em>dedimus potestatem, </em>privily and apart from her husband, and that she should give her free consent to the same, without requiring that the deed should be shewn and explained to her by the court, or by the commissioners: her free consent was all that was to be ascertained, and when ascertained by commissioners was all that they were to certify. The statute of 1785 was the first which required, that in the privy examination of a <em>feme covert, </em>the deed should be <em>shewn and explained to her, </em>either by one of the judges of the court, or by the justices acting under the <em>dedimus potestatem, </em>and that upon such privy examination she should declare that she freely and willingly executed the <em>deed; </em>and when made by commissioners, that they should certify <em>such </em>privy examination by <em>them, </em>and such declaration made, and consent that it might be recorded, yielded by her, and return the certificate with the commission and thereunto annexed: the act of 1785 contained directions to the court, or the commissioners, how they should make the privy examination of the <em>feme covert, </em>and what they should do for the protection of her from the coercion of her husband, fraud or imposition; but-it did not prescribe any form of the certificate of the commissioners when the privy examination was made by them in the country. The alterations made by the statute of 1814 consisted in the following particulars: 1. It dispensed with the necessity of a commission for making examinations of <em>femes covert </em>to deeds executed by husband and wife, and authorized two justices, without any such commission, to make such privy examinations: the former statutes required a <em>dedimus potestatem </em>in each particular case ; this statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>was a general <em>dedimus potestatem </em>to all justices of the peace to malee privy examinations in all cases. 2. The statute of 1814 gave (what that of 1785 did not give) a form of the certificate to be made by the justices of their privy examination of <em>femes covert </em>to deeds of husband and wife, and indicated the particular duties of the justices only by the form given for then- certificate ; yet it required them to certify the <em>feme covert\u2019s </em>privy examination and acknowledgment of the deed, not in that precise form, but <em>to that effect. </em>And 3. the statute of 1785 was very explicit in directing that the deed should be shewn and explained to the <em>feme covert </em>at the time of her privy examination, and by a judge of the court, or by the commissioners, before whom the proceeding was had: but the statute of 1814, in the form of the certificate it prescribed for the justices acting in the country, only required that the <em>feme </em>covert, \u201cbeing examined by them privily and apart from her husband, and having the deed fully explained to her, should acknowledge the same\u201d &amp;c. without saying (at least, without distinctly saying) when or by whom it should be explained to her. If it was enough under the statute of 1785, much more is it enough under the statute of 1814, that it should appear from the certificate, that the <em>feme covert </em>had, at the time of her examination, knowledge of the contents and purpose of the deed, no matter how, when or from whom, she acquired that knowledge, and, having such knowledge, gave her free consent to the deed, uninfluenced by the power of her husband.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfA\">The main objection to the certificate of the aldermen of <em>Richmond </em>of February 1816, <em>endorsed </em>on the deed of January 1798, is, that it does not thereby appear, that mrs. <em>Randolph </em>was privily examined by them and had the deed fully explained to her. It appears by the certificate, that she personally appeared before the aldermen, separately and apart from her husband, and acknowledged that she had willingly executed the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>deed on her part (this very deed, namely, which her hnsband and she had executed to <em>Hairston </em>in 1798) and wished not to retract it. She appeared <em>\u201c </em>separately and apart from her husband:\u201d <em>separately </em>is tantamount to <em>privily, </em>for the <em>privy </em>examination of a <em>feme covert </em>does not mean a <em>private </em>or <em>secret </em>one, but only an examination in the absence of her husband, when she is under the protection of the justices and free from his control. She <em>\u201c </em>acknowledged, that she had willingly executed the said deed;\u201d that is, she acknowledged in 1816, that she had, eighteen years before, willingly executed this deed to <em>Hairston; </em>she could not have made such an acknowledgment, unless she remembered the transaction, or had recently read the deed, or it had been otherwise explained to her; unless, in short, she was acquainted with the contents and purpose of the deed. She acknowledged that she had executed the deed \u201c <em>on her part:\u201d </em>shewing, that she knew it was a deed of her husband and herself; which she could not have known without having seen and understood the instrument. She acknowledged, that \u201c she wished not to retract\u201d the deed: how could she have had any wish on the subject, without knowing what the deed was ? There is not the least reason to doubt the fairness of the transaction. The certificate leaves no doubt, that mrs. <em>Randolph </em>in fact knew what she was doing, and, with full knowledge of the deed, gave her free consent to it. If the court should be of this opinion, and should yet think that these are inferences of fact from the certificate, and inferences which may be confirmed or refuted by proof of the degree of mrs. <em>Randolph\u2019s </em>intelligence or ignorance, or other circumstances, and that therefore these inferences ought to have been found by the jury; this will only shew, that the special verdict is imperfect, and that a <em>venire de novo </em>ought to be directed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b471-6\">The case of <em>Harvey &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Borden, </em>2 Wash. 156. arose under the statute of 1748, ch. 1. \u00a7 6. which re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>quired that the commission, for making the privy examination of a <em>feme covert </em>to a deed of husband and wife should be directed to two or more commissioners, <em>being justices of the peace ; </em>and in that case, it did not appear from the commission, or from the certificate of the commissioners who made the privy examination of the <em>feme </em>covert, or from any part of the record, that the commissioners were justices of the peace : and this court held, that though such commissioners should <em>in fact </em>be justices of the peace, yet it was not necessary, that it should be stated in the commission, or in their certificate of the execution thereof, that they were justices; and moreover, that, in the absence of proof to the contrary, the court ought to presume that they were justices. So, in <em>Ware </em>v. Carey, 2 Call 263. the commission for the privy examination of the <em>feme covert, </em>was directed \u201c to-gentlemen,\u201d and was executed by two persons who did not state, in their certificate, that they were justices of the peace, nor did it appear by the record that they were so ; but the certificate of the execution of the commission being returned to the county court and recorded, it was held, that it sufficiently appeared, that the <em>feme covert </em>had duly executed and acknowledged the deed. In those cases, the objections to the proceeding affected the very competency of the commissioners to the care of whom the law confided the rights of the <em>feme covert; </em>and though their competency did nowise appear, the court held that the deeds were well executed and duly acknowledged. The cases of <em>Langhorne </em>v. <em>Hobson, </em>4 Leigh 224. and <em>Tod </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>Id. 498. arose under the statute of 1792. In the first of them, the commission for the privy examination of the <em>feme covert </em>did not require the justices to <em>shew and explain the deed to her, </em>as the statute required they <em>should; </em>but the certificate of the execution of the commission stated, that she was examined privily and apart from her husband, and that she acknowledged the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>deed, and declared that she did so freely and voluntarily &amp;c. \u201c <em>the commissioners having read the deed to her,\u201d </em>without stating that they had <em>shewn </em>and <em>explained </em>it to her: and this certificate was held sufficient evidence of a good execution of the deed by the <em>feme covert. </em>In <em>Tod </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>the commission did not direct the justices <em>to shew and explain the deed </em>to the <em>feme covert, </em>nor did they certify that they had <em>shewn and explained it to </em>her; but they certified, that she made her acknowledgment to them of the conveyance of <em>the </em>land (mentioning the quantity) contained in <em>the </em>deed, freely and voluntarily &amp;c. <em>Carr, </em>J. held, that the due execution of the deed by the <em>feme covert </em>sufficiently appeared by the certificate, 1. because, though the statute required that the deed should be shewn and explained to her by the commissioners, it did not require that they should certify that they had done so ; and 2. because it appeared by the certificate, that she knew the contents and purpose of the deed, for she acknowledged the conveyance of the very quantity of land thereby conveyed. <em>Tucker, </em>P. concurred in the same result, but only because the certificate shewed that the <em>feme covert </em>acknowledged <em>the </em>conveyance of <em>the very land </em>contained in <em>the deed; </em>and so, her knowledge of the nature of the act she was doing appeared from the certificate. But, certainly, her knowledge of the deed was only an inference from the facts stated in the certificate. These cases shew, that wherever a <em>feme covert </em>has given her free consent to a deed, in which she has joined with her husband, with knowledge of the deed, however acquired, and whether manifested directly or circumstantially by the certificate of her privy examination, the statutes, the commission for taking the privy examination, and the certificate of the execution thereof, have all been liberally construed to support the conveyance, not strictly, to invalidate it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b473-5\">All the statutes on this subject, from the earliest to the latest, have been mainly intended, to provide, at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>once, a method by which married women should be en- . . , abled to convey their interests m real estate, and, at the same time, to secure to them the deliberate exercise of their own free will in making such alienations. If it appear from the certificate of the wife\u2019s privy examination to a deed of husband and wife, that she gave her free consent thereto, uninfluenced by the power of her husband, and (in the language of the president of this court in <em>Tod </em>v. Baylor) with knowledge of the nature of the act she was doing; that has been always held sufficient under the former statutes. It is submitted, that it results by inevitable inference from the certificate of the privy examination in this case, that mrs. <em>Randolph </em>voluntarily joined her husband in the execution of the deed, and knew its <em>contents and purpose </em>at the time of her acknowledgment of <em>it; </em>and that this certificate would have been sufficient under any of the statutes previous to that of 1814, and is equally sufficient under that statute.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-6\"><em>Howard </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>for the defendants in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzM\"><em>\u201c </em>At the common law, <em>a feme covert </em>could make no deed. By statute, she can make a valid deed, if it be executed under those forms and with those solemnities required by law; but if any of these be omitted or mistaken, <em>the </em>deed is void j\u201d <em>per Carr, J. </em>in <em>Currie </em>v. <em>Page, </em>2 Leigh 620. Has this deed been executed by mrs. <em>Randolph </em>under those forms and with those solemnities required by the statute of 1814? or has any of those forms and solemnities been omitted or mistaken? A mere comparison of <em>the </em>certificate of <em>the </em>aldermen of <em>Richmond </em>of February 1816 with the provisions of the statute of 1814 were enough to shew, that the certificate does not shew a compliance with the requisitions of the statute. Indeed, if the court shall go the length of holding this certificate good, it may as well say at once, that an acknowledgment of a deed by a <em>feme covert, </em>in exactly the same terms as an acknowledgment by a person <em>sui </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>juris, will be valid and binding. Passing by the omissions in the certificate to state, that mrs. <em>Randolph </em>appeared before the magistrates of <em>Richmond </em>in their corporation, and that she, at the time of her appearance before them, acknowledged the deed as her act and deed; the certificate is plainly and materially defective in not stating that she was examined privily and apart from her husband (or privily examined at all) and that she had the deed fully explained to her. These substantial requisites of the statute could not be complied with by shewing that she knew what land the deed conveyed and to whom; though, by the way, the certificate shews neither. The object of the privy examination is something more: the statute constitutes the justices the advisers and protectors of the <em>feme </em>covert, and makes it their duty to inform her of her rights, and of the consequences of her joining or omitting to join her husband in the deed. If mrs. <em>Randolph </em>had been informed, that notwithstanding her husband\u2019s deed, she, or her children after her death, would be entitled absolutely to the property, her conduct might have been very different from what it was without such information. <em>A </em>deed conveying land of her own inheritance, might in ignorance of her rights and of the consequences, have been executed by her for a trivial consideration, or none at all: but when she was well informed, she might have altogether refused to execute or acknowledge it. Now, we cannot collect from this certificate, that any such information was communicated to or possessed by her. Every thing in the certificate may be perfectly true, and yet she may have executed the deed with no other knowledge but that which she derived from her husband ; for nothing appears except that she made the acknowledgment separately and apart from him. Her husband might not have been present, and yet she may have only been asked, whether she acknowledged that she had willingly executed the deed and wished not to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>tract it, and have given an affirmative answer to that question. For aught that appears, she was not asked, whether or no she was apprised of the contents and purPose the deed. It has been strenuously argued, that <em>s]je mus( </em>have known every thing which it behooved the commissioners to inform her of\u2014the contents, the nature, the effect, of the deed. Suppose it possible, or probable, or indeed that it was proved, that she <em>in fact </em>had such knowledge; still, it does not appear <em>from this </em>certificate, of what is called her privy examination, that she <em>had; </em>unless her mere acknowledgment, that she had willingly executed the deed, and that she wished not to retract it, is sufficient evidence of her knowledge. Such an inference is not in itself necessary, or even fair. It is the inference which the law would draw from the mere acknowledgment of the execution of a deed by a person <em>sui juris, </em>but which, in the case of a <em>married woman\u2019s </em>acknowledgment of a deed, the law repels. The certificate of privy examination, and that duly recorded, is the only evidence of her execution of the deed, which the law respects. It has no consideration of the personal character of the <em>feme covert; </em>and pays no regard to her intelligence, prudence or discretion, or, on the other hand, to her ignorance or thoughtlessness: it regards all married women, without discrimination, as <em>sub potestate viri, </em>extends its guardian care to all alike, and requires the same solemnities in every case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b476-6\">As to the former statutes on the subject, little light can be thrown on our question by adverting to any of them but the statute of 1792, which immediately preceded that of 1814, under which this proceeding was had. The act of 1792 required, that in making the privy examination of a wife to a deed of husband and wife, the deed should be shewn and explained to her, at the time, by the commissioners; yet it did not require, that the commissioners should <em>certify </em>that they had shewn and explained the deed to her; as was expressly held by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number><em>Carr, </em>J. in <em>Tod </em>v. <em>Baylor. </em>But it cannot be doubted, that the statute of 1814 expressly requires, that the justices <em>shall certify, </em>in substance, that the <em>feme covert </em>had the deed fully explained to her. By the statute of 1814, then, the certificate in this case is naught. It is useless to enquire, whether or no it might have been held good, if the proceeding had been had under the statute of 1792? though, if it were necessary, it might be maintained, that the certificate contained no evidence of a compliance with the requisitions of the statute of 1792.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b477-5\">There are statutory provisions in <em>Pennsylvania </em>and in <em>Maryland,</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>made for the same purpose, and substantially to the same <em>effect; </em>and these have been the subject of frequent adjudications in the courts of those states; and it has been settled, that the <em>certificate </em>of the privy examination of a <em>feme covert, </em>must shew a compliance with the requisitions of the law in all particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>lars.

The statute of 1814 requires, that the certificate of the privy examination of a <em>feme covert </em>to a deed of husband and wife, shall be entered in the book of records immediately below and following the record of the deed. But, in this instance, the record of the certificate was detached from the record of the deed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-5\"><em>Leigh, </em>in reply. The statute of <em>Pennsylvania </em>is like our statute of 1792: the <em>Pennsylvania </em>statute requires that the judge or justice, in taking the privy examination and acknowledgment of a <em>feme covert, </em>shall read or otherwise make known the full contents of the deed to <em>her; </em>and our statute of 1792, that the deed should be shewn and explained to her by the justices; neither statute requiring, in terms, that the certificate of the privy examination and acknowledgment should shew upon its face that the wife was informed of the contents and purpose of the deed. It is obvious, that the deci- &lt; sions of this court upon our statute, are contrary to the decisions of the courts of <em>Pennsylvania </em>upon their law : these, therefore, are of no authority here. In 1826, after the judgment in <em>Watson </em>v. <em>Mercer &amp; al. </em>in the supreme court of <em>Pennsylvania, </em>the legislature of that state passed an act curing any informality or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgments of <em>femes covert </em>in the certificates thereof; though this provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>was confined to cases occurring before the 1st Septemher 1826. See <em>Watson &amp; al. </em>v. Mercer, 8 Peters 88. The <em>Maryland </em>cases that have been cited are yet more clearly irreconcilable with the adjudications of this court. As to the objection to the registry of the certificate of privy examination in the case at bar, it does not affect the merits: for, if this court shall affirm the judgment of the circuit superior court, on the single ground, that the registry of the certificate of the privy examination was not entered immediately below and following the deed, a new registry of the deed, and of the certificate immediately subjoined, may even now be made, and that will perfect <em>Hairston\u2019s </em>title, which will prevail in a new ejectment.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> See the statutes of 1674, act 7. 2 Hen.

The certificate of the justices must shew, that the <em>feme </em>personally appeared before <em>them; </em>that she was examined privily and apart from her husband, and having the deed fully explained to her, she acknowledged it to be her act and deed, and declared she had willingly signed, sealed and delivered the same, and that she wished not to retract it. It is conceded, that though the form of the certificate is given, if it is to the same effect, though not in the same words, it is sufficient. But the certificate must shew, that every thing was done, which is required by the law to be done. In the language of president <em>Tucker </em>in <em>Tod </em>v. Baylor, <em>\u201c </em>Though wo do not require the certificate to be in the express language of the law, neither do we dispense with any part of the law. We only consider the language used, as if it was the very language of the law.\u201d The certificate, in the case under consideration, varies from the form prescribed, in several <em>respects; </em>but enough appears upon its face, to shew <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>that the law was substantially complied with except in one particular: the justices do not certify that the deed was fully explained to the feme, nor is there any thing in the certificate from which, in my opinion, we are authorized to infer, that at the time of the acknowledgment of the deed she had knowledge of its contents. It has been argued with much ingenuity, that, as it appears from the certificate, that she acknowledged she had willingly executed said deed on her part, that implies a consent, and that she could not consent to that of which she was ignorant. The argument strikes me as more specious than sound. We can easily imagine that a wife might be readily brought to yield her consent to an act of this kind desired by her husband, though ignorant of its. character. But with the plain requisitions of the statute before us, such speculations are unnecessary. At common law, she could not convey. The statute points out a mode by which a valid conveyance may be made. It is an innovation on the common law, and its terms must be substantially complied with. By it, the certificate must in some form shew, not only that she acknowledged the conveyance, and that she willingly signed, sealed and delivered the same, and wished not to retract it, but that it was explained to her. The explanation is to be made, that she may have knowledge of the contents; but if the acknowledgment implies consent, and consent implies knowledge, then the simple acknowledgment would have been sufficient, and the other requirements would be supererogatory. The case of <em>Tod </em>v. <em>Baylor </em>was relied on as an authority in favour of this certificate. It arose under the act of 1792. That act provided, that the wife being examined privily and apart from her husband by the commissioners, should declare, that she willingly signed and sealed the said writing, to be then shewn and explained to her by them, and consents to its being recorded ; and that the commissioners should return a certificate of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>privy examination, and of such declaration made and con-___ ... n . . sent yielded. That statute did not, <em>m </em>terms, require that it should appear in the certificate, that the deed was explained to her. And upon this construction of the law, judge <em>Carr </em>based his opinion: \u201cIt is clear,\u201d he says, \u201c the commissioners are directed to shew and explain the deed to her, on her privy examination ; but this need not be certified; for the law expressly limits the certificate to the privy examination, the declaration, and the consent.\u201d Judge <em>Cabell </em>gave no opinion, nor did judge <em>Brooke </em>as to this point. Tucker, P. in reviewing the statute, seems to concur with judge <em>Carr </em>as to what must appear on the certificate. The words \u201c to be then shewn and explained to her,\u201d he remarks, \u201cstand out, as it were, from the rest of the clause, and seem merely directory.\u201d In another part of his opinion, he states that her knowledge of the nature of the act done, should appear from the certificate ; and then proceeds to argue that the certificate there, did shew her knowledge of the nature of the act done. It appeared from the certificate, that she acknowledged the conveyance of <em>the </em>land contained in <em>the </em>deed; and how, he asks, could the commissioners certify that fact, unless she knew that <em>that </em>deed did convey <em>that </em>land ? It was by reference to the land, the precise quantity, to the fact that that deed conveyed that quantity, that the wife\u2019s knowledge of the nature of the act done appeared on the face of the certificate. Take the case either way, it is no authority for the proposition noiv contended for. Either the act of 1792 did not require the fact to appear, as judge <em>Carr </em>held, and therefore the certificate was sufficient; or if it did require that her knowledge of the act done should appear, as may be implied from one part of the president\u2019s opinion, the certificate shewed such knowledge. But he/did not maintain, that such knowledge of the nature of the act done would have appeared, if the commissioners had merely certified that the deed was ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>knowledged before them. In that case, they did certify her acknowledgment of the conveyance, that it was done freely and voluntarily, without the threats or persuasions of her husband, and that she was willing the same ]3e recorded; yet it was not upon any of these expressions the judge predicated her knowledge of the act done: the certificate went further, it certified her acknowledgment of the conveyance of the very land contained in the deed, and from this her knowledge appeared on the face of the certificate. The statute of 1814 requires, in terms, that the certificate shall shew, that the deed was explained to her. But here, nothing but a simple acknowledgment of the deed appeai-s. The case of <em>Tod </em>v. Baylor, considered under another aspect, is authority in support of the view I take of our existing law. The statute of 1792 provided that where husband and wife had <em>sealed and delivered </em>a writing,\u2014and the wife appeared in <em>court, </em>and on her privy examination, she should acknowledge she had <em>sealed and delivered See. </em>but if she should appear before <em>commissioners, </em>then she should declare she had willingly <em>signed and sealed </em>said writing. At common law, the sealing and delivery are the essence of the execution, and constitute the deed. The statute in the commencing clause so treats <em>it\u2014\u201c </em>where husband and wife have <em>sealed and delivered a </em>writing,\u201d and makes the acknowledgment of <em>sealing and delivery, </em>if made in <em>court, </em>sufficient. But when it comes to provide for an acknowledgment before commissioners, another term was inserted; she was to declare she had <em>signed and sealed. </em>In <em>Tod </em>v. <em>Baylor, </em>one of the deeds was not <em>signed, </em>and judges <em>Brooke </em>and <em>Tucker </em>held that signing could not be dispensed with, against the express language of the statute; and judge <em>Carr, </em>though he doubted on this point, yielded to the opinion of his brethren. So, in this case, the certificate must in eifect shew that the deed was <em>explained; </em>acknowledgment alone was not considered by the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>lature as shewing this, or they would not have required it in addition to the acknowledgment; nor, in <em>Tod </em>v. Baylor, was it held to amount to knowledge of the nature of the act done. How, then, (in the language of the judges in that case, when treating of the signing,) can we dispense with the express language of the statute ?</p>\n<p id=\"b483-3\">There is good reason for requiring a substantial compliance with all the requisitions of the statute. The statute of fines, 18 Ed. 1. provided, that \u201cif a woman <em>covert </em>be one of the parties, then she must be examined by four of said justices, and if she doth not assent thereunto, the fine shall not be levied.\u201d <em>Coke, </em>in his commentary on this statute, 2 Inst. 514. says, \u201c the examination must be solely and secretly, and the effect thereof is, whether she be content of her own free will, without any menace or threat, to levy a fine of these parcels, and <em>name them unto her, every thing distinctly contained in the writ, so as she perfectly understand what she doth.\" </em>This statute had received, therefore, a construction in practice, which required an explanation to the wife, and her knowledge of the nature of the act done. The first of our statutes, that of 1674, after reciting that the legal way of passing estates where the inheritance is in a <em>feme covert, </em>was by fine and recovery, but we having no fines and recoveries in this country, it was usual to take the acknowledgment of the husband and wife in the general and county courts, proceeds to enact that such acknowledgment should be good and effectual against the husband and wife, as if the same had been done by fine and recovery. The same reference is made to the fine and recovery in subsequent statutes down to the statute of 1748 inclusive. The examinations under most of those statutes being made in court, the practice no doubt conformed to that which was required under the statute of fines. It was unnecessary to give more specific directions, as the courts ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>quainted with the practice which that statute had given rise to, would, acting under a similar statute, conform to it. But when the commission was authorized, the law was made more specific. The commission pointed out qlejr \u00bfnties to the commissioners; and they were required to shew by their certificate, a performance of such as were deemed most essential. The statute of 1814 dispensed with the commission. The law itself is a commission to any two justices to make the privy examination and take the acknowledgment of the <em>feme; </em>not only to any two justices of this commonwealth, but of the whole union. The statute gives the form of the certificate, and requires it to he in that form, or to that effect. The certificate they are required to make, points out to the justices the duties they are to perform. It. comes in the place of the knowledge the courts were presumed to possess of the practice under the statute of fines, and of the instructions to the commissioners, communicated by the commission. Whilst a compliance with all the terms of the law, is required to appear on the face of the certificate, we have a reasonable assurance that the leading object of the statute will be secured ; that is, the providing the wife with an opportunity, after a full understanding of the nature of the act she is about to do, of exercising her own free will.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">The certificate in the present case does not, in terms, state that the deed was explained to the wife; and there is nothing on the face of it to the same effect, which justifies the inference that it was explained, or that she had knowledge of the nature of the act she was <em>doing; </em>on the contrary, every word of the certificate may be true, and yet she may never have read the deed, or heard its contents. Therefore, I think, the certificate is defective and the deed not valid as to her.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">Stanard, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b485-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Cabell, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AnY\">In the case of a deed executed by a person not under the disability of coverture, the law infers, <em>prima </em>facie, that the party executing it had sufficient knowledge of the nature and effect of the deed, and that he acted freely and voluntarily. Therefore, nothing farther is required, than proof of the mere execution of the deed. But the law makes no such inference in the case of married women, who, being under the power and dominion of their husbands, may sometimes be coerced to do that which they would not willingly do ; and, even where there is no coercion, they may be deceived as to the nature and effect of the act proposed to be done, by the representations of their husbands, in which the3q generally, repose an unsuspecting confidence. To guard the wife against these dangers, the law is not satisfied with her mere acknowledgment of the deed. Such acknowledgment does not and ought not to imply, that che acted either voluntarily, or with proper knowledge. It may, in fact, have been made in terror of her husband, or in ignorance of the nature and effect of the deed. The law, therefore, has wisely ordained that, to give validity to the deed of a married woman, it must appear, that in executing the deed, she acted both understandingly and willingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">The certificate before us is fatally defective. It does not appear that mrs. <em>Randolph </em>was acquainted with the nature and effect of the deed. The certificate does not state, that the deed was explained to her by the justices; nor does it state any circumstance, from which her knowledge of its contents can be fairly inferred.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
