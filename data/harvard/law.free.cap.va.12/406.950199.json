The bill then further stated, that <em>Johnson </em>the garnishee was insolvent, so that it would be unsafe to entrust the goods and effects longer in his hands; and prayed that the court would order the same to be delivered up to them <em>(Erskine Sp Eichelberger) </em>upon their giving proper security, or that the sheriff should take and hold the same, till further order.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">An injunction was accordingly awarded, till further order.

They said, that, in point of fact, <em>Sta</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number><em>leyw </em>as not a nonresident against -whom the process of foreign attachment properly lay, for that his absence from <em>Virginia </em>was only temporary, he having left home on business, leaving his family here, residing in a house he rented, and he had not, at the time, any settled residence out of the commonwealth: and that <em>Johnson </em>was not properly made a home defendant and charged as garnishee ; that the goods and merchandize were stock in a trade carried on by the wife of <em>Staley </em>(who was himself an artizan in the <em>\u00dc. States </em>armory at <em>Harper\u2019s Ferry) </em>and the businesss was managed entirely by the wife ; that <em>Johnson </em>was a young man employed by her to assist in the business, under her direction, and had no possession or custody of the goods; and so, the plaintiffs acquired no lien on the goods by the service of their process on <em>Johnson </em>as garnishee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">Depositions were filed touching the questions of fact raised by the answer\u2014Whether <em>Staley </em>was, in truth, a nonresident against whom the process of foreign attachment well lay ? And whether <em>Johnson </em>had charge and possession of the goods and effects of <em>Staley </em>as his regular constituted agent, as the plaintiffs alleged, or, as the defendants alleged, was only employed to assist in the business as a salesman and clerk, under the direction of <em>Staley\u2019s </em>wife ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">The court, upon the motion of <em>Hamilton Cost, </em>dissolved the injunction; thereby deciding, that <em>Hamilton Cost </em>were entitled to have the proceeds of the attached effects of <em>Staley </em>applied to the satisfaction of their judgment, in preference to any claim or lien of <em>Erskine fy Eichelberger </em>under their foreign attachment. And it appeared from the opinion of the court (which was inserted in the record) that it held, upon the evidence, that <em>Staley </em>was not in fact a nonresident against whom the proceeding by foreign attachment was proper; and if he was, yet that <em>Hamilton fy Cost\u2019s </em>attachment in their action at law, and the proceedings, judgment and order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>consequent upon it, gave them a right to the proceeds of the attached effects, which the court of chancery ought not, at the instance of <em>Erskine Sp </em>Eichelberger, to distUl\u2019b.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><em>Erskine &lt;f Eichelberger </em>applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-5\">The cause was argued here, by <em>Lyons </em>and <em>Stanard </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Robinson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-6\">I. The questions of fact were argued upon the evidence\u2014namely, whether <em>Staley </em>was in fact a nonresident of the commonwealth at the time of the foreign attachment sued out by <em>Erskine Sp Eichelberger ? </em>and whether <em>Johnson </em>was his agent having possession of his goods and effects, and so was properly charged as garnishee ? This court held, that the affirmative, upon both points, was proved.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-7\">II. The counsel for the appellants said, it ivas well established, that a <em>subpoena </em>in chancery against an absent debtor, with such a restraining order upon the home defendant thereon endorsed by the clerk, as was endorsed on the <em>subpoena </em>in this case, was, according to the regular practice, a substitute for the order of court authorized by the letter of the statute regulating attachments and suits against absent defendants, and affected the goods, effects and credits of the absent debtor in the hands of the home defendants or garnishees, in the same manner and to the same extent, as a formal order of the court to the same purpose <em>would; </em>and that such process operated, from the date of the service thereof on the home defendant or garnishee, as a lien on the goods, effects and credits of the absent debtor in the garnishee\u2019s hands, so far, at least, as to arrest them in his hands, and to inhibit and overreach any transfer afterwards made by the debtor himself, though made <em>bona fide </em>and for valuable consideration. <em>M\u2019Kim &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Fultons, </em>6 Call 106. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number><em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jenny &amp; al. </em>4 Hen. &amp; Munf. 440. <em>Williamson &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Bowie &amp; al. </em>6 Munf. 176. The question, then, was, whether the foreign attachment operated <em>only </em>as between the attaching creditor and the parties, the absent debtor and the garnishee, to avoid transfers made by them ? or, whether it did not also overreach transfers of the attached effects made by operation of law ? Whether, if any other creditor of the absent debtor should think proper to sue out an attachment against the estate of the absent debtor, in an action against him at law, to force an appearance, and should get judgment pending the foreign attachment, or should have any other legal process levied on the same goods and effects, he could have the attached effects applied to the satisfaction of his judgment, without regard to the rights of the attaching creditor under the foreign attachment previously served ? They said, the case of <em>Williamson &amp; al. </em>v. <em>Bowie &amp; al. </em>was alone decisive of the point for the appellants : for the court there established the principle, that the effect of the foreign attachment was not to be ascertained by analogy to the doctrine of a <em>lis pendens </em>binding on purchasers without actual notice, but \u201c by analogy to attachments against absconding debtors, whose credits as well as effects may be arrested, and alienation thereof prevented;\u201d by \u201c analogy to attachments against absconding debtors,\u201d in which cases it never was doubted, that the attachment first served had priority over all the rest. They said, the foreign attachment was a proceeding <em>in rem, (per Carr, </em>J. in <em>Kelso </em>v. <em>Blackburn, </em>3 Leigh 306.) a proceeding against the absent debtor\u2019s effects in the hands of the garnishee at home, given when the proceeding <em>in personam, </em>by reason of his nonresidence, would be impracticable or unavailing. The statute put the debtor\u2019s effects in the custody of the court for the benefit of the attaching creditor; and it authorized the court to make any proper <em>order; to </em>require security of the garnishee for the safekeeping of the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>perty to satisfy the debt; or, to order it to be immediately delivered to the attaching creditor upon his giving security for the return thereof to such persons and in such manner as the court should direct; or, to put it into the hands of a receiver; or, to direct an immediate sale, and the proceeds to be held subject to future order. Neither was there any way in which the <em>garnishee </em>could get a right to dispose of it, but by giving bond with surety and thus creating a personal and adequate responsibility to the attaching creditor for the value; or any way in which the <em>absent debtor </em>could get control over the attached effects, but by appearing and giving security to abide the decree. The statute gave the power to the court, and in giving the power imposed on it the duty, to take the attached effects into its own custody and care, and to hold them for the satisfaction of the attaching creditor\u2019s claim, if it should be found just; and it could not be material in what form the court exercised its power, or (more properly speaking) performed its duty\u2014whether by ordering the attached effects to be delivered to a receiver, or to the attaching creditor himself upon his giving security to restore and account for them as the court should direct, or by leaving them in the hands of the garnishee upon his giving security to have them forthcoming to satisfy the decree, or without requiring security leaving them in his hands upon his own personal responsibility. The lien of the attaching creditor was immediate upon the service of his process, and as complete as any lien could be. <em>Erskine &amp; Eichelberger </em>acquired, by the service of their foreign attachment on <em>Johnson, </em>the garnishee, a lien on the effects of the absent debtor <em>Staley </em>in his hands: <em>Staley </em>could not demand them of the garnishee, nor transfer them to any other person: the garnishee could not rightfully sell or dispose of them, or apply them to the satisfaction of any other creditor. When <em>Hamilton Sf Cost </em>levied their attachment in their action at law against <em>Staley </em>to force <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number><em>his </em>appearance, on his effects then in the hands of <em>Johnson, </em>they acquired only such rights as <em>Staley </em>their debtor, and <em>Johnson </em>the garnishee, had in the property: they could acquire no more. Now, the rights of <em>Staley </em>and of <em>Johnson </em>in the effects, were subject to the previous lien of <em>Erskine &amp; Eichelberger </em>under their foreign attachment. In the case of several attaching creditors, prosecuting foreign attachments in chancery against the same absent debtor, and seeking satisfaction out of the same property of their common debtor, if there should not be enough to satisfy all, it had been the practice of the court, upon general principles of equity, to distribute the fund among all, <em>pro rata, </em>without regarding priority of time in the suing out or in the service of the several attachments: but it had never been thought, until the decree was pronounced in this, case, that a creditor suing out an attachment at law, and getting judgment there, pending a foreign attachment in chancery against the same debtor, duly served before the attachment at law was even issued, much more levied, was entitled to priority over the foreign attaching creditor, for full satisfaction of his claim. They maintained, that whichever jurisdiction first attached on the subject, to that jurisdiction the disposition of it belonged; whichever attachment was first served, to that attachment the preference was due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-7\"><em>Robinson, </em>for the appellees,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AIe\">first adverted to the cases cited for the appellants. He said, the case of <em>M\u2019Kim al. </em>v. <em>Eultons </em>merely decided that a foreign attachment issued by the clerk, and served, should not be discharged at the instance of the absent debtor, without requiring bond and security to perform the decree. In <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Jenny &amp; al. </em>chancellor <em>Taylor </em>expressed the opinion, that in the case of a foreign attachment in chancery, the plaintiff might make an endorsement on his <em>subpoena </em>in the terms of the statute, and that would be sufficient <em>notice </em>to the home defendant not to part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>with the absent debtor\u2019s effects in his hands without leave of the court. <em>Williamson &amp; </em>al. v. <em>Bowie &amp; </em>al. was the case of an assignment by the absent debtors, of a debt due them from the home defendant or garnishee, after service on the garnishee of the <em>subpoena </em>with the restraining order endorsed in the usual form; and this comt held, that the <em>subpoena, </em>so endorsed and served, operated, agreeably to the practice in this state, to stop the payment by the garnishee of the moneys due from him to the absent defendants, and to inhibit a transfer thereof from them (the absent defendants) to others, from the time of the service of that process on him (the garnishee). Those cases, then, did not touch the question presented in this case : they only decided that if an order should be made by the court, to restrain the garnishee from paying, conveying away or secreting the debts by him owing to, or the effects in his hands of, the absent debtor, a subsequent assignment by the absent debtor of such debts or effects would be invalid, and an assignment after service of the <em>subpoena </em>with the restraining order thereon endorsed, would be equally invalid. In going to that length, the court had authority for its decisions in the well established doctrine as to the effect of a <em>lis </em>pendens\u2014that the purchase of the subject matter in controversy, <em>pendente lite, </em>does not vary the rights of the parties in the pending suit: the court would not permit an absent debtor, after service of a <em>subpoena </em>in a foreign attachment, to assign his debts or effects attached by the creditor, and thus to evade and disappoint the decree in the cause. And in going thus far, the court has gone quite as far as was necessary to effect the object and policy of the statute; the purpose of which, declared in the preamble, was, to provide a remedy for \u201ccreditors who have experienced great difficulties in the recovery of debts from persons residing out of the jurisdiction of the commonwealth, but who have effects here sufficient to satisfy and pay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>such debts.\u201d Now, the construction which the appel1 ants\u2019 counsel contended for, would make the statute work beside and beyond its declared purpose and policy: it would make the resort of one creditor to the foreign attachment in chancery have the effect of anticipating and defeating the plain legal remedies of all other creditors, for the recovery of debts from a debtor within the commonwealth, or having estate within it which may he attached. The law was surely not dictated by any partiality or preference for one creditor over others, or for a creditor pursuing his remedy in equity, over a creditor pursuing his plain remedy at law. Such a construction would give the statute the effect of hindering and defeating the recovery of just debts by legal means. Ho submitted that a construction so contrary to the declared purpose and policy of the statute could not be right. Then, by the enacting words of the statute, the foreign attachment was only \u201cto restrain the defendants in this country, from paying, conveying away or secreting, the debts by them owing to, or the effects in their hands of, such absent defendantsnot to interfere with or prevent the <em>operation of the law </em>to take such effects of the absent debtor out of the hands of the garnishees : not to disappoint the greater or more judicious and more successful diligence of other creditors in pursuing their legal remedies. If the court had made a formal order, and even required security of the garnishee to hold the effects in his hands subject to its future order, and he had nevertheless parted with the effects to the absent debtor himself or to any others; what would have been the remedy ? Clearly, all that could have been done would have been to render a personal decree against the garnishee (and his surety, if any) for the value of the effects parted with. The service of the <em>subpoena </em>with the restraining order endorsed, on the garnishee, could not have any other or greater effect than the formal order of the court: it could he no<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thing more than a notice to the garnishee not to pay or par(; ^ith the debts or effects in his hands, and that if he should do so, it would be at his peril; at the peril, namely, of a personal liability for what he should part with, in case the plaintiff should succeed. If he should encounter this peril, if he should part with the goods, and they should be taken under an execution sued out against the debtor; then, he said, they must he sold under the execution; since, while the attaching creditor in equity had acquired by his notice to the garnishee, only a right to charge, not the specific goods, but him personally, the creditor in the execution would have had the specific goods taken into the custody of the law, and acquired a lien on the goods themselves. It would be strange, indeed, that a debtor\u2019s goods, not previously assigned away by him, nor levied on by any officer under any process, should not be liable to be taken under an execution against the debtor; and exempted from such liability, merely because another creditor had a pending suit in equity against the same debtor to recover another debt, and that creditor, if he should get a decree, might wish to have those goods applied to satisfy his decree. It should be borne in mind, that the statute of <em>Virginia </em>giving the foreign attachment did not command the officer to attach the specific effects of the absent debtor found in the hands of the home defendant, but only to serve the process on the garnishee personally ; differing, in this respect, from the law of foreign attachment of <em>Pennsylvania </em>(and of some other states) under which the specific goods themselves might be attached; Serg. on Attachm. p. <em>10-12. 202. Morgan </em>v. <em>Watmough, </em>5 Wheat. 125.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-4\">The proposition contended for by the appellants\u2019 counsel would be contrary to all the analogies of the law. Thus, it was laid down by <em>Coke, </em>and never doubted, that \u201cif an action of debt be brought against the heir and he alieneth hanging the writ, yet shall the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>which he had at the time of the original purchased, be charged, for that the action was brought against the heir in respect of the land :\u201d Co.

In <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Drewe, </em>4 East 523. where a writ of sequestration had been issued by the court of chancery in June 1800, and the writ had been delivered shortly afterwards to the sequestrators, but the sequestration had never been laid on; and a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>was delivered to the sheriff in January 1802, who, being apprised of the writ of sequestration issued against, but never executed on, the debtor\u2019s goods, returned <em>nulla bona; </em>whereupou, <em>Payne, </em>the <em>fi. fa. </em>creditor, brought this action against <em>Drewe, </em>the sheriff, for a false return: it was held, that the sequestration was no excuse to the sheriff for not levying the <em>fi,. fa. </em>on the goods, and he was held liable for a false return. - Now, it had been decided by lord <em>Nottingham, \u201c </em>that a sequestration binds from the very time of <em>awarding </em>the commission, and not only from the time of <em>executing </em>it and its being laid on by the commissioner:\u201d but lord <em>Ellenborough </em>explained the sense and extent of that rule to be, that the sequestration bound the property as against the party himself against whom the sequestration issued and all claiming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>by assignment from or representation through or under him, but it did not so vest the property in the goods absolutely, as to defeat a sale made by the sheriff under execution ; Id. p. 537-8. And he concluded by laying down this general principle, <em>\u201c </em>that where there are several authorities equally competent to bind the goods of a party when executed by the proper officer, they shall be considered as (effectually, and for all purposes) bound by the authority <em>which first actually attaches upon them in point of </em>execution, and under which an execution shall have been first executed.\u201d In <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Hanley, </em>4 J. J. Marsh. 622. slaves of the absent debtor had been taken in the custody of the sheriff, and a judgment having been obtained at law by another creditor, an execution was sued out upon it and levied on the same slaves. In this state of things, an injunction was asked and awarded to inhibit the sale under the execution. But the plaintiff in equity, though the sheriff had had actual custody of the goods under his process, did not think it enough to rely on that prior custody: he charged, that the proceeding at law was a fraudulent contrivance to secure the proceeds of the property for the absent debtor; this charge of fraud being denied by the answer; and the court of appeals of <em>Kentucky </em>held, that the bill should be dismissed. So, in our case, if there had been an allegation, that the proceeding of <em>Hamilton \u00e9p Cost </em>was a fraudulent contrivance to secure the proceeds of the goods to the absent debtor <em>&gt;Staley, </em>the interference of the court of equity to stay their proceeding, might properly have been asked. But in the absence of any such allegation, in the absence too of any proceeding wherein any particular goods had been taken into the custody of the officer of the court of chancery, there was nothing to prevent the levy of <em>Hamilton \u00e9p Cost\u2019s </em>attachment on the goods, or the sale of the attached goods under the order of the court of law directing the sale.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b441-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>He submitted, that there was no ground whatever for , . ' . , . the interference ol the court ot equity, at the instance of <em>Erskine f </em>Eichelberger, by way of injunction. There was certainly no ground for such interference, if the property of the goods had not been altered by the service of their process of foreign attachment on <em>Johnson </em>the garnishee ; and if it had been so altered, then whoever had the right of property might have proceeded at law against the sheriff.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b428-5\"> The proceedings of <em>Erskine if Eichelberger </em>were founded on the statute regulating attachments and suits against absent defendants, 1 Rev.

The foreign attachment was first <em>executed; </em>and the only question of interest presented by the case, is, whether a creditor coming in by operation of law, after the service of the <em>subpoena </em>in chancery on the home defendant, is entitled to priority ?</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">This court has decided, in the case of <em>M\u2019Kim &amp; al </em>v. Pultons, that the endorsement by the clerk, according to the practice of the country, is sufficient to restrain the application of the effects to any other use, and is a substitute for the formal order required by the words of the statute; and that case, and the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Bowie, </em>decide, that a <em>subpoena </em>so endorsed, operates, from the date of its service, to inhibit any alienation by the absent debtor. According to these adjudications, the lien acquired by the service of the <em>subpoena </em>cannot be defeated by any act of the debtor, except in the manner prescribed by the statute; namely, the giving bond to abide by the decree. This being the law, it would seem to follow, almost as a necessary consequence, that no subsequent creditor coming in, not by the act of the party, but under the operation of law, can defeat the lien. As a general rule, the creditor is entitled to those rights only, which the debtor held. Even in the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>of a fraudulent deed, though it is good as between the parties, it is void as against the <em>creditor; </em>as to him the property remains in the debtor, as if no deed had been executed. Therefore, when it is conceded, that the debtor, by no transfer or incumbrance, can defeat the lien of the attachment; that assignees coming in under him must take subject to the rights of the attaching creditor ; if it is held, that a creditor coming in afterwards by operation of law is to be first satisfied, he will acquire rights which the debtor himself had not. If the statute is to receive such a construction, cases might, and, in practice, probably would occur, presenting strange anomalies. The attaching creditor\u2019s lien is superior to the claim of the <em>bona fide </em>assignee; the right of the <em>bona fide </em>assignee is confessedly superior to that of a creditor whose execution has not been delivered to the sheriff before the assignment or transfer; but if the principle contended for by the appellees is law, the creditor by execution, who is subordinate to the assignee, is to be preferred to the attaching creditor, whose claim is superior to that of the assignee.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-4\">It was argued, that the lien created by the service of the attachment in chancery, results from an application of the doctrine of <em>Us pendens: </em>that this authorizes the court to prevent the party himself from defeating the creditor by any alienation of the subject, but does not extend to the case of a creditor coming in by act of law. The proceeding by foreign attachment is a proceeding <em>in rem: </em>the jurisdiction rests upon the fact, that the absent debtor has effects subject to the control of the court; and if no effects are found, the court has no authority to proceed. But when its jurisdiction once attaches, the court, according to well settled principles, may go on to do justice. If, however, the effects of the absent debtor may be taken from under its control by another creditor coming with a <em>fi. fa., </em>the foundation upon which its jurisdiction rested will have been swept <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>awav, and the plaintiff will be without remedy. So that, even admitting we were to look to the doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>for the source of the lien of the attaching creditor, it seems to me, in a case like this of a proceeding <em>in </em>rem, where the jurisdiction of the court depends upon the existence of effects subject to its control, if that jurisdiction has once properly attached, it can never be ousted either by the act of the party himself or of any third person. The terms of the statute, it seems to me, will admit of no other construction: \u201c the court may order the debts to be paid, and effects to be delivered, to the plaintiff, upon his giving security for the return thereof, to such person and in such manner as the court shall direct.\u201d He holds them subject to the order of the court alone. Would it be any defence in an action upon the bond given by him to return them, to say they were taken from him by a subsequent execution ? On the contrary, is it not a necessary implication from the statute, that as he is to return them in pursuance of the direction of the court, until such direction is given he must hold them? Again, it is provided, that \u201cif the plaintiff shall refuse or not be able to give such security\u201d (as may be required on pronouncing a final decree in his favour) \u201cthe effects shall remain under the direction of the court, in the hands of a receiver or otherwise, for so long time, and finally be disposed of in such manner, as to the court shall seem just.\u201d The statute here speaks of the goods <em>remaining </em>under the direction of the court: they must then have been <em>taken </em>under its direction, and this <em>by </em>the service of the <em>subpoena. </em>The law also intended to protect the rights of the creditor whose poverty prevented him from giving the security required in the final decree. Time by the law is given to the absent defendant to shew cause against the decree. The effects can be held by the court until the period expires, and then, I presume, as the decree has become absolute, there could be no doubt of the propriety of applying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>effects to the discharge of the decree, -without requiring <em>' </em>security. But under the construction contended for, it would be in the power of any creditor getting a judgment at law, to levy on these effects, and so deprive the attaching creditor of the fruit of his decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">The argument is not reported in the case of <em>Williamson </em>v. <em>Boioie; </em>but from the opinion of the court, it would appear that it was there contended that the lien resulted from the doctrine of <em>lis pendens. </em>But the court, as I understand their language, overruled the proposition: \u201c Not deciding (it said) as a general proposition, what is to be considered, in this country, a <em>lis pendens, </em>binding on purchasers without actual notice, yet considering this case by analogy to attachments against absconding debtors, whose credits as well as effects may be arrested, and alienations thereof prevented\u201d &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It was contended, that as there was no actual seizure, no levy on specific effects, which were thus placed under the custody of law, the <em>property </em>in the goods remained in the debtor, and being in him other creditors might levy on them. But granting that no actual seizure is made so as to divert the property of the debtor, the consequence deduced does not follow. The legal property of goods may remain in one, subject to the equitable lien of another; and third persons coming in under the first, must occupy his position and hold subject to the lien. For many purposes the property of the goods may rest in the debtor, notwithstanding the service of the attachment. Thus, in several attachments against the same absconding debtor, the attachments are levied successively on the same goods as his property, and they are paid according to the dates of their respective levies. So with executions. And in the case of foreign attachment, where the real estate is proceeded against, there is no seizure, no divesting of title, and from the nature of the subject cannot be.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>But, in truth, I look upon the service of the attach-merit as -equivalent to an actual levy. The effects may remain in the hands of the garnishee, but under the control of the court: he acquires a special property in them as agent of the court: and this property is sufficient to protect him against the claims of the owner : it is his duty so to protect himself; and upon his failure, a personal decree will go against him. The property of the goods is so far divested as to prevent a recovery by the party. And this distinguishes the case from <em>Payne </em>v. Drewe, which has been so much pressed on the court. There, a writ of sequestration had been issued out of chancery, which was held up by the sequestrators some eighteen months. In the mean time, a <em>fi. fa. </em>came to the hands of the sheriff, who seized the goods and made an inventory of them, but afterwards quitted possession and returned <em>nulla </em>bona; and the writ of sequestration was relied on as a protection against the suit of the creditor for a false return. Lord <em>Ellenborough, </em>without deciding what was the effect of a writ of sequestration, but conceding that it had the same obligatory effect as the <em>award </em>of an execution at common law, which binds from the <em>teste </em>of the writ, proceeded to enquire into the extent to which goods are bound by the award of the writ; and held, that it did not so vest the property in the goods absolutely, as to defeat a sale made by the sheriff under an execution; that the property of the goods was not altered, but continued in the defendant till execution executed. And this, it seems to me, is very clear from this consideration, that if no levy is made before the return day, the goods cease to be bound, and an alienation made whilst the writ was in force, could not be overreached by a levy on a subsequent writ. The writ, when executed, related at common law to the time of tlie <em>teste, </em>and now to the time of the delivery, so as to overreach intermediate alienations. Having decided that the sheriff could have levied, and made a valid sale, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>notwithstanding the writ of sequestration in the hands of the sequestrators, he proceeded to shew, that, under the special circumstances of that case, the sheriff would not have been liable to the action of the party grieved. If, however, I am right in supposing that a foreign attachment is tantamount to an actual levy, that it places the effects under the control of the court, and so far vests the property in the garnishee or agent of the court, as to defeat all claims or transfers of the defendant,\u2014 the case stands upon wholly different grounds. So, in the case of two writs of <em>fi. fa. </em>the sheriff is bound to execute the writ first delivered, but if he do otherwise and execute and sell under the second, the property of the goods is bound by the sale. The remedy of the creditor in the first execution, is against the sheriff. And this for reasons of public policy: \u201c for sales made by the sheriff ought not to be defeated, for if they are, no man will buy goods levied upon an execution.\u201d <em>Smalcombe </em>v. <em>Cross, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">The analogy derived from the case of <em>Foreman </em>v. <em>Loyd </em>wholly fails. That case, as appears by the language of all the judges, depended entirely upon the construction of the 10th section of the statute concerning executions. The mischief there intended to be remedied, was the alienation by debtors in execution to defeat the claim of the creditor. The first clause of the section was held to be limited to sales by the debtor himself, excluding involuntary judgments; and the words of the second clause, providing that a <em>ca. sa. </em>executed shall bind the real estate from the levy, were merely intended to effectuate the intention of the first clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">On the facts in this case, I think the proceeding by way of foreign attachment was fully warranted; and that the application to the court to injoin the sale under the order of sale in <em>Hamilton f Cost\u2019s </em>action at law, was regular, and indeed the only remedy the plaintiffs in the foreign attachment could resort to.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>I think, therefore, the court below erred in dissolving the injunction. It should have continued the injunction until the case of foreign attachment was disposed of, and then have perpetuated it, in whole or in part, or dissolved it, as the result of that case should shew to he proper; giving to the appellants, the plaintiffs in the foreign attachment, priority of satisfaction if they should succeed in establishing their claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed, and cause remanded &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
