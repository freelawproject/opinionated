And then he pleaded, 1. Conditions performed ; and 2. That after the bond had been assigned to <em>Miller, </em>and before it was assigned by <em>Miller </em>to <em>Bradley, </em>the defendant and his wife executed a deed conveying the land to <em>Miller, </em>and acknowledged the same before two justices of the peace of the county of <em>Washington, Virginia, </em>and tendered the deed so executed and acknowledged to <em>Miller, </em>who was then and there the proper person to receive it, he then holding the bond, and that <em>Miller </em>refused to receive the deed; and the plea averred, that the land conveyed by the deed was the same land mentioned in the condition of the bond. General replications were put in to the pleas, and issues were made up.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b643-9\">At the trial of the issues, <em>Shaffer </em>offered in evidence to support his first plea, a deed with the certificates annexed of the acknowledgment thereof, to the introduction of which the plaintiff objected, and the court refused to admit it, on the ground that the defendant was bound to shew that the deed, with the certificates thereto annexed, was sufficient to convey the land, ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>cording to the laws of <em>Tennessee, </em>and as those laws were not laid before the court, it could not judicially know that the deed was sufficient. The defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b644-9\">The jury having, upon all the evidence, found a verdict for the defendant, the plaintiff moved the court for a new trial, which motion the court <em>overruled; </em>and the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions, stating the facts proved at the trial\u2014That the plaintiff, having given in evidence the title bond, which was assigned by <em>Wallace </em>to Miller, and by <em>Miller </em>to <em>Bradley, </em>further proved on his part, that neither <em>Lawrence Scott </em>nor the defendant owned, or ever had owned, any land in <em>Morgan </em>county, <em>Tennessee, </em>on the <em>Clear Fork of Cumberland; </em>that the tract of land described in a grant from the state <em>of Tennessee </em>to the defendant, and in the deed offered by the defendant in support of his pleas, (the same mentioned in the first bill of exceptions,) was situated at the forks of <em>Cook\u2019s </em>and <em>Crabtree\u2019s </em>creeks, streams flowing into <em>Emery\u2019s </em>river, a branch of <em>Clinch\u2019s </em>river; and that the consideration paid by <em>Wallace, </em>on his contract with the defendant, was 200 dollars, part of the price of a slave. And the defendant, on his part, introduced a grant from the state of <em>Tennessee </em>to him, in pursuance of an entry made in the entrytaker\u2019s office in <em>Morgan </em>county by <em>Charles Atkins, </em>of 200 acres, lying in the said county, on the waters of <em>Clear Creek, </em>describing the same by metes and bounds; and he proved, by <em>one </em>witness, that the land granted to him was equal or superior in quality to lands on the waters of the <em>Clear Fork of Cumberland, </em>and that it lay within about four miles of the waters of that stream: and he then proved, in mitigation of damages, that he and his wife acknowledged the deed mentioned in the first bill of exceptions, and excluded, before two justices of the peace of <em>Washington, Virginia, </em>conveying the land granted to him to <em>Miller, </em>and that <em>Miller, </em>who then held the title <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>bond, was satisfied with and agreed to accept the deed, and to surrender the title bond, saying he had before doubted <em>Shaffer\u2019s </em>ability to make him a good title, but he now perceived he could do so : that the deed, however, was not delivered to <em>Miller, </em>but was left with one of the justices before whom it was acknowledged, and was never applied for by <em>Miller, </em>who refused to accept it, or to surrender the title bond, and soon after assigned the bond to <em>Bradley: </em>that the land covered by the grant to <em>Shaffer, </em>and which was described and intended to be conveyed by the deed of <em>Shaffer </em>and wife to <em>Miller, </em>was the same land which was sold by <em>Lawrence Scott </em>to <em>Shaffer, </em>and which was included in <em>Shaffer\u2019s </em>grant; and that the consideration of <em>Bradley\u2019s </em>purchase of the title bond from <em>Miller, </em>was 1060 acres of hilly land of little value, being not worth more than <em>six and a quarter cents </em>per acre. It was then proved by seven witnesses for the plaintiff, that the land described in the defendant\u2019s grant was not nearer than eight or ten miles to the <em>Clear Fork of Cumberland, </em>and that it was inferior in value to lands on that stream, the whole tract not being worth more than 50 dollars. Whereupon, the court said, that the grant issued by the state of <em>Tennessee </em>to <em>Shaffer, </em>assignee of <em>Atkins, </em>for 200 acres of land, described the tract as lying on the waters of <em>Clear Creek, </em>which, in the absence of all testimony on the subject, the court took to be the same as the <em>Clear Fork of Cumberland </em>river; that the waters of that creek probably interlocked with those of <em>Cook\u2019s </em>and <em>Crab-tree\u2019s </em>creeks, on which many of the witnesses said the land lay; but, however that might be, there was no allegation or proof that any of the parties had ever seen the land sold, or the county in which it lay: that, from a knowledge of the country, lands on the <em>Clear Fork of Cumberland </em>were more desirable, or more valuable, than lands on <em>Cook\u2019s </em>and <em>Crabtree\u2019s creeks, </em>and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>purchase was made in reference to the locality of the lands on the first mentioned of the streams; yet it was manifest to the court, that it was a mistake in the description, that the land lay on the <em>Clear Fork of Cam]jeriang. </em>that if the truth had been known, it would not have affected the contract, which was a loose one, mainly dependant, for its description, on the fact that the land sold was the 200 acres purchased of <em>Lawrence Scott; </em>that it was manifest from the testimony, that the land attempted to be conveyed by <em>Shaffer\u2019s </em>deed to Miller, was the only land ever purchased of <em>Scott, </em>and was the land sold to <em>Wallace, </em>and whether it lay on the <em>Clear Fork </em>or not, did not, under the circumstances, seem to be material, since it was evident, that neither <em>Wallace </em>nor his <em>assignee </em>was influenced in his purchase by the locality of the land, and it appeared doubtful which was the most valuable, land lying on the <em>Clear Fork, </em>or land on <em>Cook\u2019s </em>and <em>Crabtree\u2019s creeks: </em>that the goodness of the title was the main object in the purchase. That it appeared, that <em>Miller, </em>while the contract was his, accepted the deed executed to him by <em>Shaffer </em>and wife ; and if that had appeared when the court decided against the admission of the deed in evidence, a different decision would probably have been made on the ground of the acceptance; but the deed was offered and rejected before any proof of <em>Miller\u2019s </em>acceptance of it was given. Upon the whole case, the court, thinking that substantial justice had been done by the verdict, refused to set it aside, and overruled <em>the </em>plaintiff\u2019s motion for a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b646-6\">The court then gave judgment for the defendant according to the verdict; to which this court allowed the plaintiff a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-7\"><em>Johnston for </em>plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b646-8\"><em>Fulton </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b647-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>\n<em>Per curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AOL\">The circuit superior court erred in overruling the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a <em>new </em>trial. The verdiet of the jury was not sustained by the evidence, the plea of <em>conditions performed </em>being altogether unsupported. No evidence appears to have been introduced even tending to prove the making of a deed to <em>Wallace, </em>to whom, by the condition of the title bond, it was to have been made. The imperfect proof of the execution of a deed to <em>Miller, </em>was not evidence under the plea of <em>conditions performed ; </em>nor would the deed have been evidence under that plea, if the proof had been complete. As to the second plea of the defendant, it was manifestly bad, since <em>Miller, </em>though the owner of the title bond, was not the person to whom the title was to have been <em>conveyed; </em>and, therefore, he had a right to refuse to accept it, as he is alleged in the plea to have done.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-4\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
