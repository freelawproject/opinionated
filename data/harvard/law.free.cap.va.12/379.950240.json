Pittman Sp co. </em>against <em>John Sp Henry Brien, </em>the absent debtors, and <em>Brown, </em>the garnishee. The bill alleged, that <em>John Sf Henry Brien </em>owed <em>Pittman Sp co. </em>the sum of 1599 dollars with interest &amp;c. and were not residents of <em>Virginia; </em>that they owned land in <em>Jefferson </em>called the <em>Ore Banks, </em>and another piece of land on which <em>Brenner\u2019s </em>ferry was located, and they had considerable effects in the hands of <em>Brown: </em>therefore, the bill prayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>a decree for the debt due to the plaintiffs; and that the lands and the effects of the absent defendants might be attached and made subject to the claim. But there was no affidavit (as the statute, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1. p. 474. requires) that the defendants <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>were absent from the commonwealth, or that upon enquiry at their usual place of abode they could not be found so as to be served with process.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-8\">The process was served on Brown, the garnishee; and the order of publication against <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>having been published, and proof of the debt claimed by <em>Pittman Sp co. </em>against <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>being offered ; the court proceeded to decree, that <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>should pay <em>Pittman Sp co. </em>the sum of 1599 dollars with interest &amp;c. and costs, and that <em>Brown </em>should out of then funds and effects in his hands pay the same; and the court appointed three commissioners, who or any two, being first sworn, should value the lands of <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>in <em>Jefferson, </em>and also enquire what funds in personal estate they had within the power of the court, out of which the plaintiffs might have satisfaction of their claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b400-9\">The report being accordingly made, shewing that <em>Brown </em>had goods in his hands of <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>of 800 or 1000 dollars value, and six horses and six carts valued at about 500 dollars, and that their land at the <em>Ore Banks </em>was worth about 5500 dollars, and the other parcel at <em>Brenner\u2019s </em>ferry was worth about 500 dollars; the court decreed, that, unless the absent defendants should pay the debt decreed the plaintiffs before the day of sale thereinafter appointed, <em>John M\u2019Endree, </em>who was appointed a commissioner for the purpose, should sell the personal property, and, after satisfying two prior claims, should apply the residue to the payment of the claim here decreed; and, after exhausting the proceeds of the sale of the personalty, that he should sell the said two parcels of land, for cash, to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>highest bidder, after advertising the time, place and terms of sale four for weeks successively in one of the newspapers printed in the county of <em>Jefferson. </em>And the court ordered the commissioner to pay the plaintiffs out of the proceeds of the personal property, as far as it would reach, so much of the debt, interest and costs as the same would suffice to pay; and that he should deliver the personal property to the purchasers, and make a deed to the purchaser of the realty, and make a report to the court. But it was ordered, that the plaintiffs should not have the benefit of this decree for the payment of the debt claimed by them until they should have entered into bond with surety, in the clerk\u2019s office of the court, in a penalty equal <em>to double the amount of the sum decreed to be </em>paid, with such condition as the law requires in the case of absent defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-4\"><em>Pittman Sp co. </em>executed the bond with surety. And shortly after, <em>John Brien </em>appeared and obtained leave to file his answer, upon giving security for costs, so as nowise to withdraw the property attached from the lien of the attachment. This answer stated, that the debt was justly due <em>Pittman Sp co. </em>and that he himself was not an inhabitant'\u2014and that the lands in <em>Jefferson </em>were held by the defendants <em>John </em>and <em>Henry </em>(who owned four parts out of six) and <em>Luke Brien </em>(who owned the other two parts of six). And thereupon, the court ordered the commissioner to make sale only of the undivided interests of <em>John Sp Henry Brien </em>in the lands.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b401-5\">Before the commissioner proceeded to execute the decree, the <em>Briens </em>applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree ; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b401-11\">The cause was argued here by <em>Berry </em>for the appellants, and <em>Robinson </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b401-12\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"Ays\">delivered the opinion of the court\u2014That there was error in proceeding to decree against the ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>sentees, without affidavit that the said defendants were <em>. </em>out of the country, or that upon enquiry at their usual places of abode, they could not be found, so as to be served with process. The proceeding by foreign attachment being an innovation upon the common law, and liable to much abuse, the mode of proceeding prescribed by the statute should be adhered to. Although such affidavit as to the defendant <em>John Brien, </em>has been rendered unnecessary by his answer, admitting he is not an inhabitant of the commonwealth, that answer does not admit the nonresidence of the other defendant, and would not be evidence against him as to this fact if it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">The court is further of opinion, that it was error to decree a sale of the lands until bond with good security in double the value of the lands had been filed. The law which requires a valuation of the lands by discreet commissioners acting under oath, was intended to furnish the court with the evidence by which complete indemnity could be provided for the defendant, in the event of the decree being afterwards set aside. The measure of such indemnity is not the amount of the debt decreed, but the value of the land sold and possibly sacrificed. Though where the debt is small and the property valuable, it is in the power of, and may be proper for, the court to direct the sale of one or more of separate tracts, or of a portion of an entire tract, if a portion can be sold without material injury to the residue, of which fact the court should be satisfied; yet, in all cases, bond should be required in double the value of the land actually decreed to be sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">The court is further of opinion, that under the discretion vested by our statute in the courts, as a general rule, real property of value should be sold on a reasonable credit, unless under very peculiar circumstances; and that nothing appearing in the record to take this case out of the general rule, it was error to decree a sale for cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The court is further of opinion, that it was irregular to direct payment of the money to the creditor, and the execution of a deed to the purchaser, in the decree for sale. Before such direction is given, a report of the sale should he made, to enable the parties interested to shew cause against it, and that the court may see that its decree has been properly executed. Payment of the proceeds to the creditor, and the execution of a deed to the purchaser, should be decreed only after the confirmation of the report of sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-8\">Therefore, Decree reversed with costs, and cause remanded &lt;fcc.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
