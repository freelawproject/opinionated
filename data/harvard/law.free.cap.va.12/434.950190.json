The sale was made on the 9th October 1829; and <em>John Pullen </em>became the purchaser at 105 dollars cash, which he immediately paid; whereupon the trustee, on the same day, conveyed the house and lot to him in fee simple, referring to the deed of <em>Mullen </em>and wife to him, which, as before stated, was a conveyance of the fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b455-6\">In November 1837, <em>Mullen </em>and wife exhibited a bill in chancery against <em>P'ullen </em>and <em>Chew, </em>in the circuit superior court of <em>Spotsylvania, </em>stating that after the execution of the deed of trust of May 1829, one <em>Clarke </em>offered them 350 dollars for the house and lot, if a good title to the same could be conveyed ,\u2022 upon which they consulted counsel, who, upon examining the deed from <em>Coyle </em>to the plaintiff <em>Ann, </em>advised that, as the property was thereby conveyed to her and <em>her offsprings, </em>instead of <em>her heirs, </em>a good title could not be made without a decree of a court of chancery. That, on the 9th October 1829, the debt secured by the deed of trust being unpaid, the trustee <em>Chew </em>sold the lot at public auction for cash; but acting under the impression that the plaintiff <em>Ann </em>was only entitled, by the deed from <em>Coyle, </em>to a life estate in the lot, he sold the property <em>for her life only; </em>and being thus sold, it produced only 105 dollars. That sum was indeed less than the value of the property for the life of the plaintiff: the lot was sold without any previous advertisement in the newspapers <em>; </em>and if any notice of the sale was given, it must have been very short, since the debt became due on the 4th October, and the sale was made on the 9th of the same month. That <em>Pullen </em>was the purchaser at the trustee\u2019s sale: and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>plaintiffs had recently heard with surprise, that though he had <em>bought the lot for the life of </em>the female plaintiff only, he claimed the absolute fee simple, and contended, that it had been so conveyed to him by <em>the </em>trustee; upon which, having caused an examination to be made of the trustee\u2019s deed, they found that that deed did in fact convey to <em>Pullen </em>the absolute fee, without any restriction of the estate to the life of the female plaintiff according to the declared and known conditions and terms of the sale actually made. That this difference between the subject <em>sold, </em>and the subject <em>conveyed, </em>by the trustee, arose from his mistake or oversight; the trustee, being of opinion that the female plaintiff was entitled only to a life estate, inferred that her deed to him and his deed to <em>Pullen </em>would convey no more than she had a right to convey. That it was, however, certain, that only an estate for the life of the female plaintiff was sold to <em>Pullen ; </em>the trustee <em>Chew, </em>and the auctioneer <em>Buck, </em>both so declared; and the plaintiffs were now advised, that the deed of <em>Coyle </em>gave the female plaintiff a clear estate in fee simple, and that such a particular estate having been sold by the trustee for more than enough to satisfy her husband\u2019s debt, the reversionary interest, in equity at least, remained in her, and she was entitled to have the sale set aside, or the reversion reconveyed to her. And that the plaintiffs, acting under the advice of their counsel, caused a deed to be prepared, whereby <em>Pullen </em>might convey the reversion back to them, which they presented to him for execution, but he refused to execute the same; he persisted in his claim of the absolute fee simple. Therefore, <em>Mullen </em>and wife prayed that the sale might be set aside and annulled, and an account taken of rents and profits since the sale ; <em>or, </em>that <em>Pullen </em>might be decreed to convey to the female plaintiff and her heirs, the remainder in fee 'expectant on her life ; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>No answer was filed in the cause, and the bill was taken <em>pro confesso. </em>The depositions of <em>Buck </em>the auctioneer, of <em>Chew </em>the trustee, and of a mr. Caldwell, proved all the allegations of the bill (except only, that counsel had advised that mrs. <em>Mullen </em>had not the fee simple) and especially, that only an estate for the life of mrs. <em>Mullen </em>was sold. <em>Caldwell </em>was of opinion, that the fee simple would have sold for double the price for which the life estate was sold to <em>Pullen.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-4\">The court decreed, that the sale made by the trustee to <em>Pullen </em>should be set aside : and directed an account of rents and profits received by <em>Pullen, </em>and of the permanent improvements put by him on the lot since his purchase. And upon the coming in of the report, whereby it appeared, that the rents and profits exceeded the value of the permanent improvements by the sum of 110 dollars 95 cents, the court decreed, that upon <em>Mullen </em>and wife paying <em>Pullen </em>53 dollars 95 cents (being the balance due of the purchase money he had paid in October 1829 with interest thereon, after deducting the net money he had received for rents and profits), <em>Pullen </em>should reconvey the house and lot to <em>Mullen </em>and wife ; and, in case <em>Mullen </em>and wife should be unable or should fail to make or tender such payment, liberty was reserved to them, or to <em>Pullen, </em>to apply to the court for a sale of the property, in order that <em>Pullen </em>might receive the balance due to him, and <em>Mullen </em>and wife might receive their property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b457-5\"><em>Pullen </em>asked of this court an appeal from the decree ; which was allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b457-6\"><em>Patton, </em>for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AR8\">1. The suit was prematurely brought. The sale of the property <em>for the life of mrs. Mullen </em>was confessedly made; and, as she is still alive, no injury is done to any body by <em>Pullen's </em>holding the estate; nor will it be until after her death, that <em>Pullen's </em>claim to the fee simple will intercept the just rights <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>of her heirs. Suppose (as the court helow seems to have supposed) that <em>Coyle's </em>deed to mrs. <em>Mullen </em>and her offsprings, gave her and them an estate in common, still sAe cannot complain of this sale to Pullen, and her <em>off-SpringS </em>do not complain: they are not parties to the suit, and the court can give no decree touching their right or title. In truth, the only bill which she could have filed, was a bill to perpetuate testimony. But 2. if mrs. <em>Mullen </em>had a right to come into equity, her relief should be limited to the correction of the mistake she complains of\u2014the conveyance of the fee simple to <em>Pullen, </em>instead of an estate for her life, which was sold to him. Even in case of an executory contract, where a party sells more than he had a right to sell, if the purchaser insists on specific performance of the contract so far as the vendor is able to execute it, equity decrees it ; lord <em>Eldon's </em>opinion in <em>Mortlock </em>v. <em>Buller, </em>10 Ves. 315. Here, <em>Mullen </em>and wife conveyed a fee to <em>Chew; Chew </em>sold only an estate for mrs. <em>Mullen's </em>life to <em>Pullen ; </em>but he conveyed him the fee simple, and surely the conveyance passes the <em>estate for the life of mrs. Mullen. </em>Complete justice would have been done, by decreeing that <em>Pullen </em>should release the remainder in fee expectant on mrs. <em>Mullen's </em>life. 3. When <em>Mullen </em>and wife conveyed to <em>Chew, </em>they thought they had the fee, and therefore they conveyed the estate to <em>Chew </em>and his heirs. The trustee did not sell the whole estate; he thought <em>he had </em>only an estate for mrs. <em>Mullen\u2019s </em>life, and he directed the auctioneer to make proclamation that an estate for life only was to be sold. But he had previously written or printed an advertisement, that the \u201chouse and lot\u201d would be sold \u201c in pursuance of the deed of trust.\u201d Now, the advertisement is the proper evidence of the terms of the contract. I understand the rule of law to be well established, that written particulars of a sale will not be affected by parol declarations of the auctioneer made at the sale. The lord chancellor said so, in terms, in <em>Buck-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number><em>master </em>v. <em>Harrop, </em>13 Ves. 471. 473. In <em>Higginson </em>v. <em>Clowes, </em>15 Ves. 516. and <em>Jenkinson </em>v. <em>Pepys </em>(cited there, and in <em>Townshend </em>v. <em>Stangroom, </em>6 Ves. 330.) declarations of the auctioneer, merely explaining an ambiguity in the printed particulars, were rejected. <em>Rich </em>v. <em>Jacksone, </em>4 Bro. C. C. 514. <em>Gunnis </em>v. <em>Erhart, </em>1 H. Blacks. 289. But suppose the mistake proved in this case; yet it is clear, that the trustee <em>Chew </em>intended to sell and convey the whole estate which was conveyed to him by the deed of trust, though he thought it conveyed only mrs. <em>Mullen\u2019s </em>life estate. Ilis deed, therefore, was written exactly as he intended to write it. The contract is completely executed. Our question is, whether such a mistake can be corrected by bill in equity ? An executed contract cannot be varied by parol, any more than an executory one: the rule is <em>a fortiori, </em>in the case of the contract executed. In the case of a sale of land, if the contract is executed, it cannot be rescinded in equity, except on the ground of fraud distinctly charged and proved. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>3 Rand. 504. The mistake committed by the trustee was an ignorance of <em>law </em>and not of <em>fact, </em>as to the extent of his rights ; and this is certainly remediless in equity as well as at <em>law; Brown </em>v. <em>Armistead, </em>6 Rand. 594. <em>Mayor &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Judah, </em>5 Leigh 305. I suppose, with the counsel for the appellees, that mrs. <em>Mullen </em>had a fee simple, or that she took under the deed of <em>Coyle </em>a fee tail, which the statute for abolishing entails converted into a fee simple. But perhaps this is not so clear; Co. Litt. 20 a. b.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b459-5\"><em>Moncure, </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AWR\">The deed from <em>Coyle </em>to <em>Ann Curtis </em>passed a fee simple to her. The deed gives the subject to her \u201cfor the use of herself and her off-springs <em>foreverhabendum </em>\u201c to her and her offsprings forever.\u201d The word \u201coffsprings\u201d is clearly a word of limitation, not a word of purchase ; it is equivalent to the word \u201c issue,\u201d or the words \u201c heirs of her body forever.\u201d Then, the appellees are entitled to relief in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>case on the ground of <em>mistake; </em>which, is a well settled, if no|; a well defined, head of equitable relief. The whole fee was conveyed by <em>Mullen </em>and wife to <em>Chew </em>the trustee; he sold only an estate <em>for her life; </em>but by some mistake, either of law or of fact, he conveyed not the life estate he had sold, but the whole fee, to <em>Pullen. </em>Of the true state of facts, there is no doubt. Parol evidence is admissible to prove mistakes in written instruments; and \u201cif strong and irrefragable\u201d (to use lord <em>Thurlow's </em>words in <em>Shelburne </em>v. <em>Inchiquin, 1 </em>Bro. C. C. 341.) it is sufficient of itself to justify the court in correcting the mistake or setting aside the contract. In <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Pain, </em>1 Ves. 456. lord <em>Hardwicke </em>said, \u201c How can a mistake in an agreement be proved but by parol evidence ? It is not used to contradict the face of the instrument, but to prove a mistake therein.\u201d The following authorities not only establish the general proposition that parol evidence is admissible and may be sufficient in such cases, but are also peculiarly applicable to the present case; <em>Gillespie v. Moon, 2 </em>Johns. Ch. Rep. 585. <em>De Riemer </em>v. <em>Cantillon, </em>4 Id. 85. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 Dick. 301. The cases on this question exhibit some conflict and contrariety, owing to various causes: many of those in which parol evidence has been excluded, are cases under the statute of frauds, or for specific performance, or where the effect of admitting the evidence would be to contradict or vary a written agreement, not to establish an equity <em>dehors </em>the instrument. It is said, that the mistake in this case, if any, was a mistake of law and not of fact. It was a mistake about title, which was compounded of law and fact. If the mistake had been in the <em>agreement, </em>it might be necessary to enquire whether it was a mistake of law or of fact; but here, the mistake was not in the <em>agreement, </em>but in the <em>deed </em>which was made to cany the agreement into execution. The distinction is established by the best authority. In <em>Hunt </em>v. <em>Rousma</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number><em>niere's adm\u2019r, </em>1 Peters 13. it is laid down as incontrovertible, that \u201c where an instrument is drawn and executed which professes or is intended to carry into execution an agreement, whether by writing or by parol, previously entered into, but which by mistake of the draftsman, either as to fact or law, does not fulfil, or which violates, the manifest intention of the parties to the agreement, equity will correct the mistake, so as to produce a conformity of the instrument to the agreement.\u201d See also <em>Brown &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Bonner, </em>8 Leigh 1. Tf the deed of <em>Chew </em>to <em>Pullen </em>was a valid conveyance to the extent of the life estate of mrs. <em>Mullen </em>which was sold, still the suit was not prematurely brought. <em>Mullen </em>and wife were entitled to have the remainder in fee released to them. The mistake is the ground of the suit; and so soon as that was committed, a right accrued to them to have it corrected. The equitable ti tie is in mrs. <em>Mullen ; </em>the naked legal title in Pullen, to whom it was conveyed by mistake. The holder of the equity may at once pursue the legal title. Though not an estate in possession, it is a vested and valuable right, of which the owner may make present use, and of which therefore she should not be deprived. But here, the sale was made by a trustee, and under the circumstances was absolutely void. The doctrine of <em>caveat cmptor </em>applies in full force to a purchaser under a deed of trust: he must take care, that the provisions of the deed have been strictly pursued, and the sale fairly made. <em>Quarles </em>v. <em>Lacy, </em>4 Munf. 251. <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Tidball, </em>Gilm. 130. <em>Gay </em>v. <em>Hancock, </em>1 Rand. 72. <em>Chowning </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>Id. 306. <em>Gibson\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 Leigh 370. Now, 1. this sale was made on insufficient notice. The deed required <em>public notice. </em>The notice was not advertised in a newspaper of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>but only by sending a notice through the town on the day of sale; and the sale was made within four or five days after the default of payment. Yet the sale was of real es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>tate and for cash. The sale was of the property of a wife to pay the debt of her husband; a circumstance, which required longer and more public notice to prevent the sacrifice, which, as might have been expected, re-suited from the sale. 2. The deed conveyed the whole fee simple, but the trustee sold only an estate for the life of mrs. <em>Mullen. </em>If the trustee had a right to sell less than the fee simple, there might have been some semblance of propriety in selling the estate for the life of the <em>husband </em>who owed the debt; or he might have rented out the property for three years, which would have discharged the debt. Indeed, the sale of the estate for the wife\u2019s life was so obviously improper and unjust, that it would never have been made but for the mistake of the trustee as to the quantity of estate conveyed to him. 3. If the trustee sold the estate as <em>a life estate of mrs. </em>Mullen, and yet conveyed, and intended to convey, the whole estate vested in him, whether the absolute fee or the life estate, this was plainly a breach of trust; for if there was a doubt, it was the duty of the trustee to resort to a court of equity to clear it away. The effect of the breaches of trust, is to avoid the sale; <em>Taylor v. </em>King, 6 Munf. 358. <em>Denning </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 332. <em>Gibson\u2019s heirs </em>v. <em>Jones &amp; ux. </em>5 Leigh 370. It is true, that <em>Mullen </em>and wife offered to take a release of the remainder hi fee ; which, however, <em>Pullen, </em>who had purchased only an estate for mrs. <em>Mullen\u2019s </em>life, refused to accede to. They would have preferred that to a long and expensive litigation; and <em>Pullen </em>by refusing to release the remainder, when he knew he had purchased only the life estate, was guilty of a fraud, whereby he deprived himself of all claim to favour, which might otherwise have been extended to him by a court of equity, as an innocent purchaser. The prayer of the bill is in the alternative\u2014for a cancellation of the sale\u2014 or for a release of the remainder\u2014or for general relief; and, even if there had been no prayer for a cancellation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>of the sale, the court might have decreed it under the prayer for general relief. <em>Bailey </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>8 Wend. 339. By the cancellation of the sale, <em>Pullen </em>loses nothing hut a speculation: for in the account which has been taken, all his payments, and all his expenditures, have been allowed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b463-5\"><em>Patton, </em>in reply. There was no breach of trust. If the trustee sold the absolute fee, he acted in strict conformity with the deed of trust which conveyed the fee; and this is what I say he did. If he sold, and intended to sell, an estate for mrs. <em>Mullen\u2019s </em>life, he did so under a belief that her deed conveyed no more to him. How can a breach of trust be imputed to him ? If he mistook the extent of the estate vested in him, and sold less than he might have sold, and paid the debt, what right have <em>Mullen </em>and wife to complain, that this misapprehension, resulting to their benefit, was a breach of trust? The appellees\u2019 counsel complains, that it was a breach of trust not to have sold the whole fee simple ; and then, that it was a breach of trust, to sell more than there was any necessity to sell to pay the debt. The life estate is not alleged or proved to have been worth more than <em>Pullen </em>gave for it: and it paid the debt, and left a surplus of 30 dollars, which <em>Mullen </em>and wife received without objection to the sale, and kept for eight years without any complaint. There is, then, no ground to impute breach of trust, or abuse of trust, to the trustee. The utmost relief to which <em>Mullen </em>and wife can be entitled, is to a conveyance of the remainder in fee expectant on mrs. <em>Mullen\u2019s life; </em>so as to give <em>Pullen </em>that which he really bought, and no more. I contend, however, that the mistake is one which equity cannot relieve.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b463-6\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Ar1\">It is expressly charged in the bill, that at the sale made by the trustee, he sold, and the appellant purchased, the life estate only of the female appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>lee ; and the appellant, by failing to answer and permitting the bill to be taken for confessed, has admitted the truth of these allegations: such admission dispenses with the enquiry, whether it would have been competent to introduce parol evidence to prove a mistake made in the deed of the trustee, conveying the whole estate, instead of an estate for the life of mrs. <em>Mullen. </em>It was not premature in the .appellees to apply to a court of equity to correct this mistake, and to procure a reconveyance from the appellant of all interest vested in him by the deed from the trustee beyond the life estate. But after the lapse of time which has intervened between the sale and the institution of this suit, during which period the appellant has held possession, and made valuable improvements, without any objection or complaint on the part of the appellees that the trustee had proceeded irregularly or transcended his authority, it is now too late to disturb the sale, on account of any such supposed irregularity or want of <em>authority; </em>and the court should have done no more than correct the mistake by directing a reconveyance from the appellant to mrs. <em>Mullen, </em>of all interest vested in him by the deed from the trustee beyond her life estate. Therefore, the decree is erroneous, and is reversed with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\">And this court proceeding to pronounce such decree as the circuit superior court ought to have pronounced, it is decreed and ordered, that the appellant do, by a proper conveyance duly executed and acknowledged, release and convey to mrs. <em>Mullen </em>all interest in the house and lot in the proceedings mentioned, vested in him by the deed of the trustee, beyond the life estate of mrs. <em>Mullen, </em>and also that -the said appellant do pay unto the appellees their costs by them about their suit in the circuit superior court expended.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
