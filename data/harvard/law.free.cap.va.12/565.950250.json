The <em>first </em>count alleged, that the defendant <em>Henley Chapman </em>and one <em>John Chapman </em>having sold to <em>Matthew Alexander </em>a parcel of land lying on <em>Second Creek </em>in the county of <em>Monroe, </em>Alexander, having sold part of the land to his son <em>James, </em>reserving the residue thereof on which there was a valuable mill seat and water power, by his will devised the residue, on which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>-was the mill seat, to the plaintiff Ross, upon condition that he should pay 250 dollars to <em>Henley </em>and <em>John Chapman, </em>for which <em>Alexander </em>was bound. And <em>Ross, </em>apprehending that the mill seat might be rendered valueless, by the exercise of a privilege, <em>supposed to exist </em>in one <em>Summers, </em>to erect a dam 11 feet 6 inches high on the stream below, declined to pay the 250 dollars, unless the defendant <em>Henley Chapman </em>would indemnify him against all injury he might sustain in any machinery he might erect at the fall on the land devised to him, if <em>Summers </em>should <em>have and exercise </em>the right of erecting his dam 11 feet 6 inches high, and that dam, when erected, should injure <em>Ross\u2019s </em>machinery. And, thereupon, it was agreed between the plaintiff <em>Ross </em>and the defendant <em>Henley Chapman, </em>that if <em>Ross </em>would pay the 250 dollars, <em>Henley </em>would indemnify and remunerate <em>Ross </em>for any injury that should result from the exercise of the <em>real or supposed </em>right of <em>Summers </em>to build a dam across the stream below, whereby <em>Ross\u2019s </em>machinery and water power should be impaired in value. And <em>Ross, </em>trusting to <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>promise of indemnity, paid the 250 dollars, and erected mills at the water fall on the land devised to him, of the value of 2000 dollars. And that <em>Summers </em>proceeded, <em>rightfully and lawfully, </em>to erect a dam on the stream below, not more than 11 feet 6 inches high, whereby a reflux of the waters was produced, which drowned the wheels of <em>Ross\u2019s </em>mills, and rendered his machinery useless, so that <em>Ross </em>had been compelled to abandon his mills and mill seat, and so had lost his whole machinery, and all profit from the same. 2. The <em>second </em>count alleged that <em>Alexander </em>devised to <em>Ross </em>a parcel of land lying on <em>Second Creek </em>in <em>Monroe, </em>on which there was a valuable mill seat, on condition, that <em>Ross </em>should pay <em>Henley </em>and <em>John Chapman </em>250 dollars, for which <em>Alexander </em>was <em>bound; </em>and that <em>Ross, </em>apprehending that the land and mill seat might be rendered of little or no value by the exercise of an <em>acknow</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number><em>lodged right </em>on. the part of one <em>Summers </em>to erect a mill dam of a certain height on the stream below, which might overflow the fall on the land so devised to <em>Ross, </em>and any machinery he might put there, refused to pay the 250 dollars, unless the defendant <em>Henley Chapman </em>would agree to indemnify him against all injury which might result to his mil] seat and machinery, from the dam of <em>Summers, </em>should he afterwards exercise the right, <em>real or pretended, </em>of erecting a dam below of a certain height. And thereupon, it was agreed between <em>Ross </em>and <em>Chapman, </em>that <em>Ross </em>should pay the 250 dollars, and that <em>Chapman </em>would indemnify him against all injury which should result to him from the reflux of the waters from <em>Summers's </em>dam on any machinery that <em>Ross </em>should erect at the mill seat on the land devised to him. And under this agreement, <em>Ross </em>paid the 250 dollars, and built mills at the mill seat on the land devised to him, of the value of 2000 dollars. And <em>Summers </em>erected a mill dam below, <em>as he lawfully might, </em>which dammed back the waters on <em>Ross's </em>mill seat, and drowned his wheels and machinery, so that they were of no value, and <em>Ross </em>was compelled to abandon them &amp;c. 3. The <em>third </em>count alleged, that in consideration that <em>Ross </em>would pay <em>Henley </em>and <em>John Chapman </em>250 dollars, <em>Henley </em>agreed to indemnify him against any injury that might result io certain machinery which he proposed to build on <em>Second Creek </em>in <em>Monroe, </em>from the reflux of the waters to be caused by a mill dam which <em>it was supposed </em>one <em>Summers </em>intended, to build on the stream below, not more than 11 feet 6 inches high. And <em>Ross, </em>trusting to <em>Chapman's </em>promise and agreement, erected valuable mills and machinery on the stream, and well and truly performed the agreement on his part, by paying the 250 dollars. And <em>Summers </em>erected a dam on the stream below, at a place where his old dam stood, not more than 11 feet 6 inches high, which caused a reflux of the waters, whereby the mill wheels of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number><em>Ross\u2019s </em>mills were drowned, so that they were of no value, and he had been compelled to abandon them &amp;c. 4. The <em>fourth </em>count alleged, that <em>Matthew Alexander </em>having devised to <em>Ross </em>a parcel of land on <em>Second Creek </em>in Monroe, which he had reserved to himself out of the purchase of a larger parcel by him and <em>James Alexander </em>from <em>John </em>and <em>Henley Chapman, </em>on which parcel so devised to Ross, there was a mill seat which constituted its chief value j and having devised the same to <em>Ross </em>upon condition that he should pay <em>to </em>the <em>Chap-mans </em>250 dollars, being one half of the amount due from <em>Matthew </em>and <em>James Alexander; </em>and <em>Ross </em>considering the land so devised to him of little or no value, except for machinery, and desiring to erect machinery thereon, and being informed that one <em>Summers asserted a right </em>to erect a dam 11 feet 6 inches high on the stream below ; therefore, he declined to accept the devise so made to him, and to become responsible for the 250 dollars, unless he should be indemnified and saved harmless from injury to his machinery, to be caused by the exercise of the right claimed by <em>Summers </em>to erect a dam 11 feet 6 inches high on the stream below, and the consequent reflux of the waters. Whereupon, at the special instance and request of the defendant <em>Henley Chapman, </em>it was agreed between <em>Ross </em>and <em>Henley, </em>that if <em>Ross </em>would accept the devise made <em>to him in </em>the will of <em>Alexander, </em>and would pay the 250 dollars, he <em>Henley </em>would indemnify <em>Ross, </em>and save him harmless, from all injury which might result to the mills and machinery he intended to build, from the damming up of the waters of the stream by <em>Summers, </em>provided <em>Summers\u2019s </em>dam should not be more than 11 feet 6 inches high. And <em>Ross, </em>under the agreement and trusting to the promise of <em>Chapman, </em>accepted the devise, undertook to pay the 250 dollars, and had actually paid all but 33 dollars for which he had given his note. And <em>Ross </em>proceeded to build mills at the mill seat on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>land devised to him, which had cost him, and were worth, 1500 dollars. And <em>Summers </em>erected a dam below, not more than 11 feet 6 inches high, which caused a reflux of the waters, which overflowed and drowned <em>Ross\u2019s </em>mill wheels and rendered his mills of no value, whereby <em>Ross </em>lost his machinery, labour and cost in the erection, and all profits therefrom. 5. The <em>fifth </em>count was like the <em>fourth; </em>only it alleged, that <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>agreement was to indemnify <em>Ross </em>against injury from the exercise by <em>Summers </em>of his <em>real or supposed right </em>to erect a dam 11 feet 6 inches high on the stream below, and that <em>Ross </em>had bound himself for (not that he had actually paid) the 250 dollars to the <em>Chapmans. </em>Yet the defendant, not regarding his several promises and agreements, though often requested, had hitherto, and still, failed and refused to indemnify <em>Ross </em>&amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-7\"><em>Chapman </em>demurred generally to each count of the declaration, and pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and <em>non assu'mpsit </em>within five years. <em>Ross </em>joined in the demurrer, and took issue on the pleas. The court overruled the demurrer, and there was a trial of the issues.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-8\">At the trial, <em>Chapman </em>moved three instructions to the jury, one of which the court gave with a modi fication, and refused to give the others; and <em>Chapman excepted; </em>but it is unnecessary to state the exception, since this court did not decide the points therein stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-9\">The jury found a verdict for <em>Ross, </em>for 734 dollars. <em>Chapman </em>moved the court to set it aside, and to direct a new trial, on two grounds, that the verdict was contrary to evidence, and if not, that the damages were excessive. The court thought the damages too high, and <em>Ross </em>released 234 dollars of them; upon which the court refused the new trial. <em>Chapman </em>filed a bill of exceptions, stating the facts proved at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b589-10\">It appeared by the bill of exceptions, that proof was made, that <em>John </em>and <em>Henley Chapman </em>sold <em>Matthew Alexander </em>a parcel of land lying on <em>Second Creek </em>in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number><em>Monroe, </em>and gave him a bond with condition to convey the title, which they afterwards conveyed: that the purchase money to be paid was 3000 <em>dollars; </em>of which 2500 dollars was paid, and <em>Matthew </em>and <em>James Alexander </em>gave their joint bonds for 500 dollars, and <em>James Alexander </em>paid 250 dollars, leaving 250 dollars to be paid by <em>Matthew, </em>who died in 1825, without having paid the same. <em>James Alexandet' </em>met with <em>Henley Chapman, </em>and told him, that <em>Matthew </em>had devised a part of the land to <em>Ross </em>(being that part on which <em>Matthew </em>had intended to erect mills) upon condition that <em>Ross </em>should pay the 250 dollars ; and that <em>Ross, </em>having understood, that <em>Summers </em>had the right to erect a dam 11 feet 6 inches high, on the stream below, which, he was apprehensive, would overflow the machinery should he erect mills on the land devised to him at the place contemplated, had refused to accept the devise, unless <em>Chapman </em>would agree to indemnify him against any injury which might result to his machinery when erected, by reason of <em>Summers\u2019s </em>dam on the stream below; upon which <em>Chapman </em>told him, that <em>Summers </em>had no .such right, and that there should be no difficulty on that account, for that he would indemnify <em>Ross </em>against any injury he might sustain by reason of the reflux of the waters caused by <em>Summers </em>erecting his dam <em>of </em>that height, if <em>Ross </em>would accept the devise, and pay the 250 dollars. And this promise of <em>Chapman </em>was repeated on another day. In consequence of which, <em>Ross </em>accepted the devise, paid the 250 dollars, and built his mills, the wheels of which were afterwards overflowed by the reflux of the waters caused by <em>Summers\u2019s </em>dam. But there was no proof, that <em>Summers </em>was authorized by law to erect his dam on the stream below <em>Ross\u2019s </em>mill seat, or that <em>Summers\u2019s </em>mill was legally established.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b590-4\">The court gave judgment for <em>Ross </em>for 500 <em>dollars; </em>and this court, upon the petition of <em>Chapman, </em>allowed him a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number><em>M1 Comas, </em>for the plaiiitifF in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aje9\">submitted the question upon the demurrers to the declaration, to the court; objecting, that no consideration was laid, to support the agreement which <em>Chapman </em>was alleged to have made; and that the agreement alleged, being merely verbal, it was void by the statute of frauds, whereby it was provided, that no action shall be brought to charge any person upon any agreement for the sale of any lands, tenements or hereditaments\u2014or upon any agreement which is not to be performed within one year from the making thereof\u2014unless the promise or agreement, or some memorandum or note thereof, shall be in writing &amp;c. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 101. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1. p. 372. The agreement in this case, ran with the land, and defended the enjoyment of it; and it was to be performed at any distant day, when <em>Summers </em>should build his mill dam. Besides, the declaration did not aver notice to <em>Chapman, </em>that <em>Summers </em>had erected his dam, and that the reflux of the waters caused by the same, obstructed <em>Moss's </em>works. But his main objection was, that there was no proof, that <em>Summers </em>had lawful right to erect his dam, and therefore, the circuit superior court erred in overruling the motion for a new trial. It was impossible to suppose that <em>Chapman </em>contracted, or meant to contract, to indemnify <em>Ross </em>against the tortious acts of <em>Summers.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b591-5\"><em>Preston, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"APF\">said the demurrers were rightly overruled. As to consideration, the declaration alleged, that <em>Chapman's </em>agreement to indemnify <em>Ross </em>against loss by reason of <em>Summers's </em>dam, induced him to accept <em>Alexander's </em>devise of the land to him, and to pay the 250 dollars, which, unless he accepted the devise, he was nowise bound to pay; and that, upon the faith of that indemnity, he proceeded to build his mills, and had lost all benefit from them. \u201c Damage to the promisee constitutes as good a consideration as benefit to the promisor.\u201d <em>Townley </em>v. <em>Sumral, 2 </em>Peters 170. 182. As to the statute of frauds, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>said, this was not an agreement which ran with the land, but was a personal contract between the parties; nor was it an agreement which was, by its terms, not to be performed within one year. It was to be performed whenever <em>Summers </em>should erect his dam, and thereby cause the mischief to <em>Moss\u2019s </em>mills, which <em>Summers </em>might have done within the year. <em>Fenton </em>v. <em>Emblers ex\u2019or of </em>May, 2 Burr. 1278. It was not necessary to aver notice to <em>Chapman </em>of the injury to <em>Ross\u2019s </em>mills caused by the erection of <em>Summers\u2019s </em>dam; <em>Austin </em>v. <em>Richardson, </em>3 Call 302. For the rest, the contract between <em>Ross </em>and <em>Chapman, </em>was, that if <em>Summers </em>should build his dam, and thereby cause a reflux of the waters which should obstruct <em>Ross\u2019s </em>works, whether <em>Summers </em>should have a legal right to erect such a dam or not, <em>Chapman </em>should indemnify <em>Ross. </em>Both parties assumed that <em>Summers </em>had or claimed a right to build his dam 11 feet 6 inches high, and upon the supposition that he had, <em>Chapman </em>agreed to indemnify <em>Ross </em>against the consequences.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b592-5\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AU_C\">The circuit superior court erred in refusing to grant a new trial. The verdict of the jury was not sustained or justified by the evidence. The promise of indemnity, on <em>Chapman\u2019s </em>part, was, upon a fair construction of the evidence, nothing more than an indemnity against the lawful acts of <em>Summers. Ross\u2019s </em>redress for <em>Summers\u2019s </em>unlawful acts was against <em>Summers </em>himself. <em>Chapman </em>neither undertook, nor did <em>Ross </em>receive his promise as an undertaking, to defend him against the tortious acts of <em>Summers. </em>Under this view of the contract, it was incumbent on <em>Ross to </em>shew, that the act of <em>Summei's </em>whereby he sustained injury, was not a tortious but a lawful act; that <em>Summers </em>had a lawful right to erect his dam 11 feet 6 inches high, and that so <em>Chapman </em>was liable on his <em>assumpsit </em>to indemnify him against the injury sustained by the exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>cise of such lawful right. But it is expressly stated, that no such evidence was exhibited to the jury; so that their verdict was not sustained by the evidence. This court, (not deeming it necessary, in this aspect of the case, to decide upon the questions raised by the motion to instruct) is of opinion, that a new trial should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\">Judgment reversed, and cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
