She died in 1827, and by her will, reciting the will of her second husband, and the power thereby given her, to dispose, at her death, of a moiety of his estate, she gave and disposed of the moiety thereof to her son, the appellant <em>Clement Pigg, </em>and gave him the whole of her own estate, and appointed him her executor. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>had many grandchildren, the descendants of two other sons.

Gray; that mrs. <em>Gray, </em>in part compliance with her promises, laid off 200 acres of land for him, built a house upon it, and put him in possession thereof, but did not make him a conveyance of the same; that she afterwards, brought an ejectment against him for the land, which was pending at her death, and was still pending. That shortly before <em>Corder </em>removed from <em>Kentucky, </em>he being in <em>Virginia, </em>and on \u25a0 a visit to his mother-in-law mrs. <em>Gray, </em>she gave him a female slave named <em>Charity, </em>who had since had two male children; that mrs. <em>Gray </em>intended to deliver him possession of the woman <em>Charity, </em>when he should return with his family to <em>Pittsylvania, </em>and to retain till then the possession for him; but that, in fact, she never delivered the possession of the slave to him; he had demanded the slave of mrs. <em>Gray, </em>but she re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>fused to deliver her, and retained the possession of her and her increase as long as she lived. And that mrs. <em>Gray </em>died many years after these transactions, and by her will gave her whole estate, and all which she had power to dispose of to her son <em>Clement Pigg, </em>and appointed him her executor. And the bill prayed specific execution <em>of </em>mrs. <em>Gray\u2019s </em>alleged promise or contract of October 181G, above stated; a decree for one third of her estate, and of all the property she had a right to dispose of, and for the slave <em>Charity </em>and her increase, and the profits thereof; and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-5\"><em>Clement Pigg </em>(the only defendant who had any interest in the subject), in his answer, controverted the facts alleged in the bill, touching the promise or contract of mrs. <em>Gray </em>of October 1816, and insisted, that, even if the facts were true, <em>Corder </em>was not now, under the circumstances, entitled to the relief he prayed; that his neglect to assert his claim during so many years while mrs. Gray was living, and the change of circumstances (his wife being now dead), were decisive objections to specific execution of such a contract. And he relied on the statute of limitations as a bar to the claim to the slave <em>Charity </em>and her increase.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b91-6\">The cause was transferred, in 1831, to the circuit superior court of <em>Pittsylvania. </em>The letter of mrs.

It was proved, that she was extremely illiterate. Another witness, named Lovell, deposed, that Corder, not long after the date of the above letter, shewed him <em>two </em>letters from mrs. <em>Gray; one of </em>which (now said to be lost) purported to explain her views more fully than the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>letter of the 19th October 1816. That other letter was never produced, nor did <em>Corder </em>give any account of it, except that he said it had been lost.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ax\">The depositions of several witnesses, examined on behalf of <em>Corder, </em>were filed, to prove declarations of mrs. <em>Gray, </em>sometimes in <em>Corder\u2019s </em>presence, sometimes when he was absent. These declarations of mrs. <em>Gray, </em>as stated by the several witnesses, were somewhat variant from each other: they, however, amounted to this, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>admitted, that she had written the letter of the 19th October 1816 to <em>Corder </em>and his <em>wife; </em>that she had induced <em>Corder </em>to sell off his property in <em>Kentucky, </em>and come back with his family to <em>Pittsylvania, </em>by promising that she would give him possession of her plantation and slaves, and put the whole under his management, and let him take to his own use whatever he could make over and above the support of his and her family; that it was her intention to give <em>Corder </em>and his wife one third of her estate, but so to give it that <em>Corder </em>should not have a right in it (for fear that if she gave him such right, he might sell it, and go off to the west again), and yet he should enjoy the use of it during his life ; that she intended to lay off 200 acres of land, and to aid <em>Corder </em>in building a house upon it, but she did not intend to vest the right in <em>Corder, \u201c </em>so that he could make way with it,\u201d but he should have his lifetime in it, and at the death of <em>Corder </em>and his wife, she intended to give it to their son <em>Francis Corder.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b93-6\">It was proved, that <em>Corder </em>and his wife left <em>Kentucky, </em>and returned to mrs. <em>Gray\u2019s </em>house, in January 1817, and lived for about a year with her; that she at first put all her property into <em>Corder\u2019s </em>hands, and gave him the entire management of it, and <em>Corder </em>made one crop; that, in the mean time, mrs. <em>Gray </em>had 200 acres of land laid off, and aided <em>Corder </em>in building a house upon it; that after the expiration of about a year, <em>Corder </em>and mrs. <em>Gray </em>disagreed; and then he and his fa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>mily removed from mrs. <em>Gray\u2019s </em>house to the house which had been built on the 200 acres of land that had been laid off for them, and <em>Cordel' </em>occupied that house and enjoyed the use of the 200 acres of land till his wife died; after which mrs. <em>Gray </em>brought an ejectment for the land, which was pending when she died, and still pending when <em>Corder </em>brought this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-4\">It was proved, that a conveyance of the 200 acres of land had been prepared to be executed by mrs. <em>Gray, </em>but she said \u201c she had <em>willed it\u201d </em>to <em>Corder </em>and his wife \u201c in the same way, and it was not necessary to sign the deed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-5\">This 200 acres of land was about one half of the land of mrs. <em>Gray\u2019s </em>second husband <em>Adin Gray, </em>of which by his will she was authorized to dispose of a moiety in fee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-6\">All the property which <em>Cordel' </em>had in <em>Kentucky, </em>consisted of two wagons and teams, about thirty head of cattle, and a stock of hogs. He retained one wagon and team, with which he removed his family to <em>Virginia ; </em>the other wagon and team, and his stock of cattle and hogs, he sold in <em>Kentucky, </em>but there was no proof that he sold them at less than their value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b94-7\">A witness named <em>Sally Owen, </em>examined for the defendant, deposes, that she was present at a conversation between the plaintiff <em>Corder </em>and mrs. <em>Gray, </em>when he was at her house on a visit previous to his removal from <em>Kentucky: </em>in which mrs. <em>Gray </em>told <em>Corder </em>to tell his wife (her daughter), that mr. <em>Gray </em>her deceased husband had given her his whole estate during her life, and one half of it to dispose of as she pleased at her <em>death; </em>and that if she (the daughter) would remove back to <em>Pittsylvania, </em>her (mrs. Gray\u2019s) house should be her <em>home; </em>that she would employ him (Corder) as her overseer, and all above the support of her family should be his as long as they could agree, and if they could not agree, she would build her (the daughter) a house on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>some part of her (mm. <em>Gray\u2019s) </em>land, so that she should have a home during her lite ; and that she intended to give her (the daughter) one third part of her estate for her and her heirs, but that <em>Corder </em>himself should not be one dollar the better thereby, as he had spent too much of her money already. That mrs. <em>Gray </em>also desired <em>Corder </em>to tell his wife, not to regard disposing of her property, but to come as light as possible, as she (mrs. <em>Gray) </em>had a plenty here, and would furnish her.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-5\">It appeared in proof, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>had lent <em>Corder </em>450 dollars to pay a debt he owed, for which he promised her security: that she afterwards demanded the money, and brought a suit for it, and that this claim was adjusted between them by arbitration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-6\">It appeared, that <em>Corder </em>had children by his <em>wife; </em>hut whether those children or any of them survived her, did not appear.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b95-7\">With regard to the woman slave Charity, it was proved, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>admitted, at the time of <em>Corder\u2019s </em>visit to her previous to his removal from <em>Kentucky, </em>that she had given him, or given his wife, the woman <em>Charity, </em>and told him he was at liberty to take her to the west with <em>him; </em>but she said, that as he had concluded to return and settle in <em>Pittsylvania, </em>it was unnecessary to incur the expense of carrying her to <em>Kentucky ; </em>and, therefore, he did not take her away. But possession of this slave was never, at any time, actually delivered to <em>Corder </em>or to his wife; on the contrary, mrs. <em>Gray </em>retained the possession, without interruption and without any claim set up by <em>Corder. </em>The woman <em>Charity </em>had two male children after the alleged gift to <em>Corder, </em>one of whom was sold by mrs. <em>Gray </em>in her lifetime <em>; </em>of <em>Charity, </em>and her other child, mrs. <em>Gray </em>held possession as long as she lived, and died in possession, and they came to the hands of the defendant as executor and legatee of his mother.

It is not a case requiring the interposition of the court <em>ex debito justitice, </em>but rests in then discretion, upon all the circumstances.\u201d And among the objections which he enumerates to the interference of the court, were, 1. the uncertainty of the agreement; and 2. the time suffered to elapse before the filing of the bill. Both apply with great force in this case. To which may be added the complete change of circumstances in the situation of the parties before the bill was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">The agreement relied on is contained in a letter from mrs. <em>Gray </em>to the appellee and his wife, dated the 19th October 1816. It was not written by mrs. <em>Gray, </em>who was an illiterate woman, and, upon its face, is manifestly the production of a most unskilful draftsman. The <em>witness.Hutchings </em>deposes, that he wrote it in pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>suance of the instructions of mrs. <em>Gray: </em>but it is very doubtful, whether a writing drawn up by one so unaccustomed to write, could be relied on as expressing her real intentions. It is proved by the witness <em>Lovell, </em>that not long after the date of this letter, the appellee shewed him <em>two </em>letters from mrs. Gray, one of which (said to be lost) purported to give the views of mrs. <em>Gray </em>more fully than the letter filed. Another witness, <em>Sally Owens, </em>proves, that she was present at a conversation between the appellee and mrs. <em>Gray, </em>when he was in <em>Virginia, </em>on a visit from <em>Kentucky, </em>the time when the agreement was made, which is referred to in the letter of the 19th October 1816. In this conversation, mrs. <em>Gray </em>told the appellee to inform her daughter, what she intended to do for her if they returned, but added, that the appellee should not himself be one dollar the better thereby, as he had spent too much of her money already. From this evidence, it appears the plaintiff was in possession of another letter, which he has not produced, and which, according to the evidence of <em>Lovell, </em>set out the agreement more fully than the letter he has produced; but what that agreement was we know not. And the evidence of <em>Owens, </em>confirmed by the whole current of the proofs, even by the letter of the 19th October 1816, shews, that the daughter was the object of <em>the mother\u2019s </em>bounty: it was for her she intended to provide ; and she did not contemplate any provision for the appellee distinct from her. It was contended in argument, that the letter contained either a promise to give the land to the husband, or to the husband and wife. I think the promise was intended for the wife alone, especially when the letter is taken in connection with the other proofs in. the case'. But the uncertainty which rests upon the character of the promise, is of itself a strong objection to the relief <em>prayed; </em>and this uncertainty, taken in connection with the circumstances, that the letter was not written by mrs. <em>Gray, </em>but by ano<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>ther person who may have misapprehended her views, and that another letter was written stating the terms of the contract more fully, and perhaps differently, which letter is not produced, furnishes to my mind an insurmountable obstacle to the exercise of the jurisdiction of a court of equity decreeing a specific execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Then, as to the time; the letter is dated in October 1816. The .appellee returned to <em>Virginia </em>in January <em>.1817. </em>He remained with mrs. <em>Gray </em>that year; they quarrelled and separated; controversies arose between them; a suit was instituted against him by mrs. <em>Gray, </em>for a large sum she had lent him, which was settled by arbitration. All this occurred many years before mrs. <em>Grafs </em>death; and this.suit was not commenced until November 1828. There was no reason for such long delay. \u201c It is laid down generally,\u201d says judge <em>Carr, </em>(in <em>Anthony </em>v. <em>Leftwich) \u201c </em>that he who comes for a specific execution, must not sleep on his case, but come recently. Time is pretty certain to operate a change in the circumstances of the parties, and the situation of the subject matter of the contract. It destroys evidence ; it cuts off the parties to the transaction; and then successors know not how to explain what they might have made perfectly clear.\u201d All this has occurred in the present instance. Mrs. <em>Gray </em>is dead: her daughter, the object of her solicitude, is dead; evidence which is shewn to have once existed is lost, or perhaps withheld; and the property has been disposed of to another. There could have been no considerations of good will or friendship, which restrained the appellee from asserting his rights at an earlier period, for they had differed and were at law. Such gross negligence, if there were no other objection, should prevent the interference of a court of equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">And in the last place, there has been an entire change in the circumstances of the parties. Mi\u2019s. <em>Corder </em>is dead. Mrs. <em>Grafs </em>promise was made to provide <em>her </em>with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>home. The evidence shews she did not contemplate * any permanent provision for the appellee, except so far as he might be benefited by the provision for his wife. To permit him now to assert the contract, would, under the changed condition of the parties, violate the intention of the party by whom the promise was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">As to the slave <em>Charity </em>and her increase: there are two objections to the relief granted, either of which is decisive. To constitute a valid parol gift of slave property, there must be a delivery. Here no delivery was made ; the slave never left the possession of the donor. It was nothing but a promise to give, and being without consideration never could be enforced. In the second place, if there had been a delivery, the slave was instantly returned and continued in possession of mrs. <em>Gray </em>until her death; and though the bill avers a demand, and her refusal to give her up, no suit was brought for more than ten years after the alleged gift. In the mean time, mrs. <em>Gray </em>sold one of the slaves, and she died in possession of the other two. If the appellee ever had a claim, it is barred by the statute of limitations, which is relied on in the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-9\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>concurred.</p>\n<author id=\"b99-10\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AaF\">Whether the evidence in this record establishes any claim against the appellant or not, it is apparent, that, upon legal principles, <em>this </em>decree can never be supported. The bill sets up <em>one </em>claim, the testimony goes to prove <em>another, </em>and the decree is for a third. The bill alleges a promise to give one <em>third </em>of the estate which mrs. <em>Gray </em>had a right to dispose of, to the plaintiff, <em>Corder ; </em>the letter produced as evidence of the contract, goes to prove, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>had promised not one third of her estate, but 200 acres of land definitively, and this was to be given not to <em>Corder </em>himself but to his wife ; and the decree is for a life estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>to <em>Corder </em>in the 200 acres of land. These discrepancies are fatal to the case, unless we discard at once those principles which require the proofs to correspond with the demand, and the relief afforded to he consistent with both. If, then, there were nothing more in the case, I should be of opinion to reverse the decree and dismiss the plaintiff\u2019s bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">But the objections to his case are yet more radical. Whether we consider the paper called the contract, or its reasonableness, or the consideration of it, or the performance on his part by Corder, or his delay in asserting his rights, or the evidence afforded by that delay of abandonment, we must come to the conclusion, that this is no case for specific execution.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">With respect to the letter itself, which is introduced by the bill of review, and which supersedes all the oral testimony as to the contract, I am of opinion, that it ought not to be taken to be, in itself, a contract binding mrs. <em>Gray. </em>I have always thought, that the loose <em>dicta-of </em>some of the judges in <em>Rowton </em>v. Rowton, I Hen. &amp;. Munf. 91. were calculated to give rise to claims on the part of children and sons-in-law, to conveyances, upon pretended contracts, sustained by evidence of loose family conversations or correspondence, and of abandonment of imaginary profits in consideration of the promise of a title to real estate. I have always thought there was much good sense in the remark of chancellor Kent, <em>\u201c </em>that it would be injurious to that freedom of intercourse, and, to the operation of those kind and generous affections which ought to be cherished in the circle of domestic connexions, to deduce a truth from loose and general expressions in a confidential correspondence, between one member of a family and another, and to give them the force of legal obligations.\u201d 5 Johns. 13. What parent could address a letter to his child in the free and unreserved language of affection, if he is to be trepanned into a contract by every expression of favourable inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tions towards his offspring ? What parent, in the use of such expressions, means any thing more, than to indicate that, in the exercise of his own free will\u2014in the fulfilment <em>ex mero motu </em>of his parental obligations to provide for his child\u2014it is his <em>purpose </em>to make a particular provision. What parent, by such language, conceives himself tied down by an obligatory contract, for which he has received not a stiver, merely upon the pretence that his son has given up some scheme of fancied profit to gratify a father\u2019s wishes? The natural interpretation of all such transactions is the reverse of this. If I were even to propose distinctly to my son-in-law, that if he would leave the place in which he resides and settle my daughter near me, I would give her a particular estate, it might, nevertheless, admit of doubt, whether without some definitive arrangement, the parties would have an obligatory claim upon me, or must look altogether to the exercise of my untrammeled discretion in the bestowal of this gratuity. The latter would be the fair inference, at least where instead of assorting their rights in my lifetime they lie by till my death, depending upon my voluntary act, and setting up no pretence to bind me until the grave has closed upon me and on their hopes. It is then too late to demand from my justice what in my lifetime they had looked to only from my affection and munificence. The ordinary principles which require promptness in the assertion of the right to specific performance, apply with peculiar force, where no consideration is given, and where from that circumstance there is always reason to doubt, whether there was any intention in the parent to bind himself irrevocably by contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">In the present case, indeed, there are strong expressions which have been relied on to prove there was a contract. Mrs. <em>Gray </em>says, that <em>Corder </em>and herself made \u201c a bargain.\u201d But, besides that this form of expression, in familiar use, does not always mean a technical con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tract, it would be going far indeed, to take this most inar^\u00a3cjgj letter, of a woman who could <em>not </em>write, written by a scribe who could not spell, and the terms of which are not defined, to be a contract binding her absolutely, without consideration save love and affection, to convey the whole of the land she had to dispose of, to her daughter, when she had three sons, or their descendants, to provide for. Add to this, that in the bill itself, and in the evidence of various witnesses, it is stated, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>was to convey one third only of what her second husband left her, and not the 200 acres (which was all the land in which she had a fee under his will); and we may well question, whether this paper contains the true understanding of the parties. But every doubt is removed, when we see that she promises \u201c to write another letter <em>in full </em>in a short time,\u201d and when we find that she did write another letter, which explained her views more fully, and which the plaintiff has not produced. Whether he has suppressed it, or has not taken care of it, because he looked upon neither of the letters as of any importance, it is not necessary to enquire. On the ground, therefore, that it does not satisfactorily appear- that this letter does contain the real contract of the parties, if any, and that it is of itself doubtful and uncertain, I should be clearly of opinion to deny the relief asked by the bill, or that given by the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">There are, however, other vital objections to the plaintiff\u2019s case. What was the consideration of this pretended contract ? There was none moving to her, except affection for her child; and it is therefore attempted to supply the want of it, by his pretended losses and sacrifices in the sale of his property in <em>Kentucky. </em>His property consisted of little more than two wagons and two teams; and there is no proof that these were sacrificed. What <em>adequate </em>consideration then was there for the conveyance of a tract of 200 acres of land and other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>property ? It is said he sacrificed his prospects. What those prospects were, does not appear. From his past successes, they could not have been very flattering. But be this as it may, a decree for specific performance, being a matter of discretion, a court of equity will never make it, where the consideration is inadequate, but will leave the party to his action for damages for the breach of the contract. And this is the more proper, where the contract was in its origin unreasonable, where the lapse of time and change of circumstances have rendered it more so, where the evidence of performance on his part by the plaintiff is at least unsatisfactory, and the presumption of his abandonment of title, if he ever imagined he had any, is well nigh conclusive. Was it reasonable, in the first instance, that mrs. <em>Gray </em>should have promised to give to her daughter and son-in-law, <em>the whole </em>of her disposable lands, when she had sons and grandchildren having equal claims upon her affections ? Was it reasonable, that she should be <em>compelled </em>to do so for the imaginary sacrifices made by her son-in-law in his property and his prospects? and this too, without any security provided by the contract, that as soon as he had got the title he would not sell the property and move out again to the west ? Was it reasonable to enforce the contract in favour of <em>Corder </em>when the main objects of mrs. Gray, the desire, namely, of her daughter\u2019s society, and of his services in her family, were frustrated by the quarrel between them in a few months, arising as it seems to me from his own misconduct? And would it now be reasonable, after the death of mrs. Gray, and of her daughter, and the <em>laches </em>of the plaintiff, to assert his claim until ten or or twelve years had elapsed, and the other contracting party was in her grave ? I think not, and have no hesitation in saying that as to the land, the decree should be reversed and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>I am also of the same opinion as to the slaves, for the reasons so well presented by my brother <em>Allen </em>in his views of the plaintiff\u2019s pretensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
