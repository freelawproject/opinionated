Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 25. with condition to save sheriff harmless, and to pay and satisfy any person claiming title to the property, all damages he may sustain by the seizure and sale; omitting to provide also, as required by the statute of 1828, Supp. to Rev.

The bond was dated in 1837, and was executed by <em>Catlett </em>and one <em>Howlett </em>since dead. The declaration counted on and made <em>profert of </em>the bond in the usual form, and set out the condition <em>in hcec verba: </em>\u201c The condition of the above obligation is such, that whereas <em>J. Catlett </em>assignee of <em>J. Howlett hath </em>sued out of the circuit superior court of <em>Gloucester, </em>two writs of <em>fi. fa. </em>against the goods &amp;c. of <em>J. Dutton </em>upon judgments obtained in the said court, which writs with the legal costs attending the same amount to 191 dollars, and whereas <em>T. Dabney, </em>sheriff &amp;c. hath levied the same on the following property, [specifying, among sundry other chattels, one grey mare j and a doubt arising whether the right of the said property is in the said <em>Dutton, </em>the sheriff hath required of the said <em>Catlett </em>bond to indemnify him pursuant to the statute in such case made and provided; now, if the above bound <em>Catlett </em>and <em>Howlett </em>shall indemnify the said <em>Dabney </em>against all damages which he may sustain in consequence of the seizure and sale of the property on which the said execution has been levied, and moreover shall pay and satisfy to any person or persons <em>claiming title to the said property, </em>all damages which such person or persons may sustain in consequence of such seizure or sale, then the said obligation to be void.\u201d And the declaration assigned the following breach of the condition, that the right of the property in the grey mare was in one <em>Booker, </em>and <em>the same was not liable to seizure or sale under the executions ; </em>and that <em>Booker, </em>in an action against <em>Dabney </em>the sheriff, recovered 62 dollars with interest &amp;c. for damages by <em>Booker </em>sustained by reason <em>of </em>the seizure and sale of a grey mare part of the property so levied on and sold, and 32 dollars costs of suit, as would appear by the record of that suit; and that <em>Dabney </em>had paid <em>Booker </em>the full amount of the judgment so by him recovered, which neither the said <em>Catlett </em>nor the said <em>Howlett, </em>nor the representatives of the said <em>Howlett </em>or either of them, have paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number><em>to the </em>said <em>Dabney, </em>though thereto often requested. By reason whereof action accrued to the said <em>Dabney </em>to demand and have of the said <em>Catlett </em>the said sum of 300 dollars (the penalty of the bond).

The bond was not a good statutory bond under the statute of 1819, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7, <em>25. </em>p. 533-4. as amended by the statute of 1828, Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 215. &lt;\u00a7&gt; 1. p. 272. which requires, that the condition of every indemnifying bond that should afterwards he taken by a sheriff in virtue of the former statute, shall contain a further provision \u201c that the obligors shall warrant and defend to the purchaser or purchasers of the property such estate or interest therein as shall be sold under the execution or other processand the condition of the bond in this case omitting the additional provision required by the last statute, the sheriff could not defend himself against the action of <em>Booker </em>the owner of the property, by pleading, under the 27th section of the statute of 1819, that he had taken and returned an indemnifying bond. But though the bond was not good as a <em>statutory </em>bond, it was a good <em>common lato </em>bond, and bound the obligors to indemnify the sheriff, and therefore he was entitled to his action. <em>Hewlett </em>v. <em>Chamberlayne, </em>1 Wash. 367. <em>Johnstons </em>v. <em>Meriwether, </em>3 Call 523. <em>Beale </em>v. <em>Downman, </em>1 Call 249. <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Jarret's adm'r, </em>2 Leigh 630.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-10\">The <em>attorney general, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxA\">The action against the sheriff for seizing and selling the property under <em>Catletfs </em>executions, was brought by <em>Booker, </em>the owner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>of the property so seized and sold. The indemnifying bond taken by the sheriff was a perfectly good statutory bond so far as <em>Booker </em>the owner was concerned, though it omitted the provision in favour of the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale required by the statute of 1828. Therefore, no action lay for <em>Booker </em>the owner against the sheriff <em>for </em>seizing and selling his property: an action lay for him, on the indemnifying bond, against <em>Catlett </em>and his surety, and it may yet be prosecuted, under the statute of 1819, 1 Rev. Code, ch. 134. \u00a7 26. 27. p. 534. In assigning the breach the declaration does not positively aver, that there was a seizure and sale of the property, but only that the property was not liable to seizure and sale under the executions.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-4\"><em>Stanard. </em>The breach rvas assigned in the very words of the condition; and that was sufficient. <em>Craighill al. </em>v. <em>Page, governor &amp;c. </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 446.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b406-5\">Per curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHl\">The judgment is erroneous, and is reversed with costs. And this court proceeding to render such judgment as the circuit superior court ought to have given, is of opinion, that the matters of law arising on the defendant\u2019s demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s declaration are for the plaintiff &amp;c. Therefore, it is further considered that the demurrer be overruled. And ordered, that the cause be remanded to the circuit superior court, for an enquiry of damages, unless the defendant shall plead to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
