Now, 1. the <em>second </em>count upon the parol agreement is certainly good. <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>2 Lev. 210. 1 Ventr. 318. 332. <em>S. C. </em>is an authority directly in point; a case which was decided upon great consideration by the court of <em>King\u2019s Bench, </em>and afterwards affirmed in the <em>Exchequer Chamber, </em>T. Raym. 303. and it has ever since been recognized in elementary treatises, Bull. N. P. 133, 4. 1 Com. Dig. <em>Case on Assumpsit </em>(E. a.) p. 309. and note (new edition) p. 310. and in many judicial opinions, <em>Martin v. Hind, </em>2 Cowp. 437. 443. <em>Shemerhorn </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>1 Johns. Rep. 139. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>10 Mass. Rep. 287. <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole </em>was the case of a promise made to a father to pay money to a daughter; and it was held, that the daughter and her husband might sue for the money in their own name : the court said <em>(Ventris\u2019s </em>report) <em>\u201c </em>it might have been otherwise if the money had been to have been paid to a stranger;\u201d but <em>(Levinz\u2019s </em>report) \u201cthere was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>such an apparent consideration of affection from the father to his children, for whom nature obliges him to provide, that the consideration and promise to the father may well extend to the children.\u201d And, in our case, the promise was made to a mother to pay money to her daughter. Indeed, in <em>Shemerhorn </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>the rule is laid down generally, that where one person makes a promise to another for the benefit of a third person, that third person may maintain an action on such promise. In <em>Marchington </em>v. <em>Vernon, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 101. <em>in notis, Butter, </em>J. states the rule in the same terms. And there are many other cases, in which a consideration moving from a <em>stranger, </em>no less than from a <em>parent, </em>has been regarded as sufficient to entitle the party to whom the money is to be paid, to sue in his own name: thus, in <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hind, </em>before cited, lord <em>Mansfield </em>regarded the rule as general; it was taken for granted in <em>Fruhling </em>v. <em>Shroeder, </em>2 Bing. 77. 29 Eng. C. L. R. 260. and it was so regarded by the supreme court of <em>N. York </em>in <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>12 Johns. Rep. 276. The same general rule is stated in the note on <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 149. where the cases are collected. So the rule is stated, 1 Chitt. Plead. 5. that \u201cwhen a contract, not under seal, is made with <em>A. </em>to pay <em>B. </em>a sum of money, <em>B. </em>may maintain an action in his own namefor which the authorities we have cited are referred to, and some others. But it is enough for us, that where a promise is made to a <em>parent </em>to pay money to a <em>child, </em>the <em>child </em>may maintain an action for the money. It is true, that in the cases we have mentioned, the form of the action was <em>assumpsit, </em>not <em>debt: </em>but wherever <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>can be maintained, <em>debt </em>will lie ; per <em>Ashhurst </em>and <em>Butter, </em>J. in <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Witter, </em>1 Doug. 6. and <em>Buller, </em>J. added, that \u201ctill <em>Slade\u2019s case,\u201d </em>(4 Co. 93. a.) \u201ca notion prevailed, that on a simple contract for a sum certain, the action must be <em>debt; </em>but it was held in that case, that the plaintiff has his election either to bring <em>assumpsit </em>or <em>debt.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>2. The <em>first </em>count, on the indenture, is good also ; or, if it would have been bad on demurrer, it must be taken to be good after verdict. It is true, that according to the english practice, founded however on reasons merely technical, upon a.n indenture strictly <em>inter </em>partes, none but a party can maintain an action; but upon a deed poll, any person to whom money is thereby promised to be paid, may sue for it; and even upon an indenture, one who in fact seals it, though he is not formally named as a party, may sue: Platt on Covenants, p. <em>7. </em>Therefore, if <em>Milne </em>and wife had averred in this count, that mrs. <em>Milne </em>had sealed the indenture declared on, the count would have been good, according to the strictest technical rules of english practice; and under our statute of <em>jeofails, </em>1 Rev. Code, ch. 128. \u00a7 103. p. 511. 512. it will, if necessary, be presumed after verdict, that it was proved or admitted at the trial, that mrs. <em>Milne </em>did seal the indenture <em>; for, </em>by the provision of that statute, no judgment, after verdict, shall be reversed, \u201cfor omitting the averment of any matter without proving which the jury ought not to have given such verdict\u201d\u2014\u201c or for any mistake or misconception of the action, or for any other defect whatsoever, in the declaration or pleading, whether of form or substance, which might have been taken advantage of by a demurrer, and which shall not have been so taken advantage of.\u201d In <em>Vaiden </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>3 Rand. 448. it was held, upon this statute, that the omission in a declaration in <em>replevin </em>to aver property or possession in the plaintiff, or that the defendant took the property from the plaintiff or from any body else, was cured by the verdict. Again, the technical rule of the english practice is only that <em>covenant </em>will not lie upon an indenture <em>inter partes </em>for any but a party to the indenture; and there may be reason for confining the action of <em>covenant </em>(which, in its theory, is founded on privity of contract) to the covenantees: but there is no reason why the action of <em>debt </em>should be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>denied to any person to whom an indenture provides that money shall be paid j for <em>debt </em>lies for all legal liabilities, and in many cases where there is no privity of contract. On general principles, <em>debt </em>may be maintained wherever money is to be paid, or a debt is actually due. Here, certainly, there is money to be paid, there is a debt actually due, by <em>Ross </em>to <em>Milne </em>and wife, and to no one else. If <em>Ross </em>had paid the money to them, and the representative of mrs. <em>Smith </em>had sued for it, <em>Ross </em>might have pleaded the payment to <em>Milne </em>and wife, as an exact performance of his covenant, and it would have been a bar. And if mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>representative had sued for and recovered the money, he would have been bound to pay it to <em>Milne </em>and wife: he would have been a naked trustee; a mere instrument through which a recovery was had for the actual beneficiaries. To allow <em>Milne </em>and wife to sue in their own name, prevents circuity of action, consults convenience and justice, and consists well with the principles of the action of debt. And unless <em>Milne </em>and wife can bring <em>debt, </em>no one can ; for if mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>representative is to sue, covenant, not debt, must be the action, since the money is not to be paid to mrs. <em>Smith </em>or her representative, but to mrs. <em>Milne.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b230-4\"><em>Patton </em>and <em>R. C. Stanard </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Azs\">The <em>first </em>count upon the indenture certainly cannot be maintained. That count alleges an indenture <em>inter partes, </em>in the strictest sense' of the phrase; <em>\u201c </em>an indenture made between <em>Janet Smith </em>of the one part and <em>James Ross of </em>the other, sealed with the seals of the said <em>Janet </em>and <em>James;\u201d </em>adescription that excludes the idea, which the ingenuity of counsel has suggested, that the deed might have been sealed by mrs. <em>Milne, </em>though she was not formally named as a party in it. Now, according to' all the authorities, and the very passage in <em>Platt\u2019s </em>treatise on Covenants, p. 7-8. cited for the defendants in error, none but a party to such a deed can main<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>tain an action upon it. And suppose any thing so improhable and repugnant could be presumed, as that mrs. <em>Milne </em>sealed the indenture, not being in any way a party to the deed otherwise than by sealing it; yet she could not maintain an action upon <em>Ross\u2019s </em>covenant to mrs. <em>Smith. </em>It is true, that if in an indenture between two parties, a third person covenants that one of the parties to the deed shall perform his contract with the other, and seals the deed, an action will lie <em>against </em>this third person upon <em>his </em>covenant; which was the case of <em>Salter </em>v. Kidgly, Carth. 76. cited in the note in Platt on Cov. p. 7. and there are many other cases to the same point. But it does not follow, that a third person, who, not being a party to an indenture <em>inter partes, </em>yet seals it, may maintain an action on the indenture, against a party to it, on his covenant to the other party, to pay money to the third person who is not a party. , It is well settled, that where there is a sealed contract between parties, containing a covenant for the benefit of another person not a party, the beneficiary cannot maintain an action upon the contract, but the right to sue is confined to the parties to the deed; <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Gordon &amp; al. </em>3 Mau. &amp; Selw. 308. 322. <em>Barford adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Stuckey, </em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 333. 6 Eng. C. L. R. 139. even though the covenants in the deed are made, in terms, directly to the beneficiary, and not to the other party to the instrument; <em>Berkeley </em>v. <em>Hardy, 5 </em>Barn. &amp;. Cress. <em>355. </em>11 Eng. C. L. R. 251. As to the distinction taken between the action of covenant and the action of debt\u2014 that though the beneficiary may not maintain <em>covenant, </em>he may maintain debt; no authority for any such distinction was referred to; and there is direct authority against it. <em>Barford adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Stuckey was debt </em>on an indenture brought by the administrator of a beneficiary not a party to the indenture, to recover money thereby contracted to be paid to his intestate; and the court held, that that action could not be maintained; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>Park, J. expressly said, <em>\u201c </em>that the deed there being <em>inter partes, </em>it made no difference whether the action was in <em>debt </em>or <em>covenant.\u201d</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5X\">Then, is the <em>second </em>count, upon the parol contract, g00d p That count alleges, that iioss, for a valuable consideration moving from mrs. <em>Smith, </em>undertook and agreed to pay mrs. <em>Milne </em>(a daughter of mrs. Smith) \u00a3500. sterling, within two months after mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>death; and upon this promise <em>Milne </em>and wife demand this money. To sustain their right to recover upon this count, it was insisted, that in every case of a promise made to a <em>parent, </em>upon a consideration moving from the parent, to pay money to a <em>child, </em>the child may maintain an action for the money in his own name: for which proposition <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole </em>was mainly relied on: and to fortify the authority of that case, it was shewn, that it has been cited with approbation, as well in several judicial opinions, as in approved elementary treatises. The case is a very peculiar one; and if it established the general proposition for which it is now cited, it would be difficult to reconcile it with many other adjudged cases; see them collected 1 Vin. Abr. <em>Actions of Assumpsit. </em>Z. p. 333-7. and 1 Com. Dig. note in new edition, p. 309-312. But granting that <em>Dutton 6p wife </em>v. <em>Poole </em>was rightly decided, it establishes no such general proposition, and is clearly distinguishable from our case. There, the action was <em>assumpsit; </em>a form of action in which it is necessary to shew a consideration moving from the promisee; and accordingly, such a consideration was substantially alleged in the declaration ; the allegations of which, collected from the several reports and notices of the case, 2 Lev. 210. 1 Ventr. 318. 332. T. Raym. 303. T. Jones 102. 8 Mod. 117. stated the plaintiff\u2019s case thus : The father of <em>Dutton\u2019s </em>wife, being entitled to timber trees growing in a park, and intending to cut down and sell the same to raise portions for his children, the defendant, his son and heir apparent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>having notice of this intention and purpose, in consideration that the father, at his instance and request, would forbear cutting the trees, and leave the same to descend with the land to him, promised the father, that he would pay the daughter \u00a31000. The father accordingly forbore to cut the trees; and the action was brought by the daughter and her husband, to recover the \u00a31000. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit; </em>there was a verdict for the plaintiffs, a motion in arrest of judgment, and judgment for the plaintiffs. According to <em>Levinz's </em>report, <em>Scroggs, </em>C. J. said, \u201c that there was such apparent consideration of affection from the father to his children for whom nature obliges him to provide, that the consideration and promise to the father may well extend to the children;\u201d meaning, that the daughter might well be regarded as party to the consideration and promise: <em>Jones </em>and <em>Wylde, </em>J. who had at first hesitated, concurred in the judgment, because i\u00a3 the son had the benefit by having the wood, and <em>the daughter lost her portion by this means.\" </em>It is upon the reasoning of chief justice Scroggs, not upon the case itself and the judgment of the court, that the counsel for <em>Milne </em>and wife rely, for authority to maintain their action. The case amounts to no more than this: that the defendant having, for his own advantage, prevented the father from applying his timber to the purpose of raising a portion for his daughter, and so deprived her of the bounty her father intended for her, by his promise, that if the father would forego his purpose he himself would pay her \u00a31000. and the daughter having lost, in consequence of the defendant\u2019s promise, the money which, but for the promise, her father would have given her; this loss, effected by the defendant, constituted a sufficient consideration moving from her, to entitle her to demand the fulfilment of the promise. This, then, is the true reason of the judgment in <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole; </em>and the only view of it in which it can be reconciled with ge<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>neral principles established by numerous adjudications. Convyn, in his treatise on Contracts, part I. ch. II. 10. p. <em>21. </em>considers the case as an instance in which a promise is valid, though the consideration on which it is made proceeds <em>in part </em>from another; and then lays down the general principle, that the consideration on which the promise is founded should proceed from the party in whose favour it is made; for which he refers to <em>Bourne </em>v. Mason, 1 Ventr. 6. <em>Crow </em>v. Rogers, 1 Stra. 592. and <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 147. As we understand the explanation of <em>Dutton if wife </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>given in Buller\u2019s Ni. Pri. 134. the consideration of the defendant\u2019s promise was the surrender to him, by the father, of the fund out of which the daughter\u2019s portion was to be raised, which portion was a kind of debt the father owed her. So, in <em>Buller\u2019s </em>view, the consideration proceeded from the daughter, and therefore she was entitled to sue upon the promise in her own name. In <em>Barford </em>v. <em>Stuckey </em>(before cited) <em>Park, </em>J. having remarked, that he found it \u201c difficult to understand the reasoning of <em>Dutton </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>or to see exactly how the parties in that case <em>stoodBurrough, </em>J. said <em>he </em>thought it was rightly decided: that \u201cit was the case of a father who washed to raise a portion for his daughter; the son promised the father to pay the daughter this portion, if the father would forbear to cut down a certain quantity of timber\u201d (out of which, it should be added, the father was about to raise the portion); \u201c and the question was, if this amounted to a sufficient consideration to entitle the daughter and her husband to sue: undoubtedly, it was sufficient.\u201d Thus explained and understood, the case of <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole </em>may well be approved. But so understood, that adjudication is no authority to maintain the case of <em>Milne </em>and wife against <em>Ross, </em>as it is pleaded in the <em>second </em>count of their declaration. It is not there alleged, that mrs. <em>Smith </em>being entitled to a share of <em>Colin Ross\u2019s </em>estate, and intending to give a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>portion of \u00a3 500. to her daughter mrs. <em>Milne </em>out of that fund, the defendant <em>Ross, </em>having notice of that intention, promised the mother, that if she would forbear to execute that purpose, and would assign the fund to him, he, in consideration of the assignment, would pay the daughter the \u00a3 500. The allegation is, that, in consideration that mrs. <em>Smith, </em>at <em>Ross\u2019s </em>request and upon his agreement to pay her daughter mrs. <em>Milne </em>\u00a3 500. within two calendar months after the mother\u2019s death, had assigned to <em>Ross </em>her share in <em>Colin Ross\u2019s </em>estate, he undertook and promised to pay mrs. <em>Milne </em>\u00a3 500. within two calendar months &amp;c. No present purpose of the 'i mother to give the portion to the daughter out of the S fund is alleged; no knowledge of such purpose, no design to prevent the execution of it, by procuring an assignment of the fund out of which it was to be accomplished, is imputed to <em>Ross: </em>the agreement is not alleged to have been made with, or the promise to, the mother, or to the daughter, or any body in particular; but the whole consideration is stated to have moved from the mother, it was an executory contract, on <em>Ross\u2019s </em>part, made with mrs. <em>Smith, </em>to pay the money to mrs. <em>Milne; </em>and on mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>part, it was an executory parol gift of the money to her daughter, which she might have revoked at pleasure. Not the daughter, therefore, but the representative of the mother only, is entitled to sue upon the agreement or promise. Suppose the daughter is the beneficiary, and the representative of the mother but a trustee for her, yet the legal title is in him, and he alone can maintain an action at law upon it: the daughter has, at the most, but an equitable right. From the other cases that were cited, the argument for the defendants in error can derive no support. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Hind, </em>2 Cowp. 437. was <em>assumpsit </em>brought by <em>Martin, </em>curate for <em>Hind, </em>who was rector of the parish of <em>St. Ann\u2019s Westminster, </em>to recover the salary or stipend due to him: and to prove <em>Hind\u2019s </em>undertaking to pay it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>the plaintiff offered in evidence a certificate addressed by the defendant to the bishop of <em>London, </em>wherein he certified to the bishop, that he, <em>Hind, </em>did <em>thereby </em>appoint <em>Martin </em>to perforin the office of curate in the church of <em>St. Ann, </em>and did promise to allow him a yearly sum of 50 guineas for his maintenance in the same &amp;c. And one objection taken for the defendant was, that it appeared by this certificate, that the promise to pay the curate\u2019s salary was made, not to the curate, but to the bishop, and therefore the curate could not maintain the action for the salary: and lord <em>Mansfield </em>said, that the certificate imported no promise to or contract with the bishop, but merely information of a matter of fact; the contract was with the <em>curate; </em>therefore, there was no shadow of objection to his maintaining the action. <em>Shemerhorn </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>1 John. Rep. 140. went off upon another ground; and, therefore, though this point arose, it was not necessary to examine it, and it manifestly was not examined, with any care. In <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>10 Mass. Rep. 287. the father of the plaintiff, when he was about fourteen years old, placed him in the defendant\u2019s service, upon an agreement that he should remain in that service till he should arrive to the age of twenty-one years: dining which time the defendant promised to find him food and clothing, and at the end of the term of service, to pay him 200 dollars; the plaintiff served out his time, and brought this action to recover the 200 dollars: it was objected, that the promise, as proved, was made to the father, not to the plaintiff. The court held that the plaintiff might maintain an action on the contract in his own name; and rightly, without doubt; for the whole service had been performed by the plaintiff, in other words, the whole consideration moved from him. Here again, the case itself is no authority to the purpose for which it was cited; and it is the general reasoning of the court in giving judgment, which is relied on. There, indeed, the court stated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>broad proposition, that <em>\u201c </em>when a promise is made to one for the benefit of another, he for whose benefit it is made may bring an action for the breach of itand the same proposition is stated by the supreme court of <em>N. York </em>in <em>Shemerhorn </em>v. Vanderheyden, and is imputed to Butter, .1. in the brief note of <em>Marchington </em>v. Vernon, 1 Bos. &amp; Pull. 101. So <em>Chitty </em>(Plead. <em>5-6.) </em>says, that \u201c when a contract not under seal is made with <em>A. </em>to pay <em>B. </em>a sum of money, <em>B. </em>may sustain an action in his own name.\u201d But the leading authority always referred to for the proposition, is the case of <em>Dutton &amp; wife v. Poole; </em>which does not warrant it, but by the plainest inference establishes the reverse of it. And though there is some contrariety in the older cases, they will be found, on examination, to result in the principle, that, upon a parol contract, none but the party to it or promisee, or the person from whom the consideration, moves, can maintain assumpsit, much less <em>debt, </em>in his, own name. A stranger both to the <em>promise </em>and the <em>consideration </em>can maintain no action. <em>Bourne </em>v. Mason, 1 Ventr. 6. <em>Crow v.

The first is upon an indenture between <em>Janet Smith </em>and the defendant, in which he promises to pay mrs. <em>Milne \u00a3 </em>500. sterling. To this indenture mrs. <em>Milne </em>is <em>no party, </em>and therefore, upon well established principles, she cannot sue upon it at law. Whether such a trust or interest is created for her benefit, as will enable her to sue in .equity, it is not necessary in this case to enquire. It is sufficient that she cannot sue at law. The right to sue under an indenture <em>inter partes </em>is confined to the parties to it. Platt on Cov. 7. 8. 1 Chit. 4. and the cases there cited. <em>Salter </em>v. <em>Kidgly, </em>Carth. 76. <em>Offly </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>1 Lev. 235. <em>Gilby </em>v. <em>Copley, </em>3 Lev. 138. In <em>Barford </em>v. <em>Stuckey, </em>2 Brod. &amp; Bing. 333. the defendant, by indenture between himself and <em>N. Pitts, </em>agreed to pay him an annuity for twenty-one years, and if he died within the term, then it was agreed and promised, that he should pay the annuity to his child or children: the administrator of his only child brought <em>debt </em>for the annuity. <em>Dallas, </em>G. J. said, \u201cIt is a general principle, that the right to sue under a contract is confined to the parties to the deed, The consideration did not move from the child, but from the father, and the obligation arises <em>out of the contract itself. </em>It is admitted that an action might have been brought by the administrator of <em>N. Pitts, </em>and if he had recovered, he would have been a trustee for the child; and if he had refused to sue, he might have been compelled by a court of equity to lend his name.\u201d He then declares, that the suit ought to have been brought by <em>N. Pitts\u2019s </em>administrator, and was improperly brought by the administrator of the daughter of <em>N. Pitts ; </em>and so the court decided. A distinction, however, has been taken between the action of <em>covenant </em>and the action of <em>debt, </em>and it is supposed that the latter may lie, though the former will not. For this distinction we have no authority, nor do I think it can be sustained. The right of the administrator to sue in <em>covenant </em>cannot be de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>nied; and if the beneficiary could also sue in debt, the <em>t ' J </em>defendant would either be twice charged, or, as <em>Dallas, </em>C. J. says, the court would be called upon to stay one of the actions. And thus, by the informal proceeding of a rule, the rights of the plaintiffs in the two causes would have to be determined. Such a course cannot be commended. It is better to adhere to the distinction of jurisdictions and of the forms of action, than to encounter the confusion which would ensue from departing from them. Therefore, I am of opinion, that the count upon the indenture is naught, and that no judgment upon it can be rendered in favour of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"AxO\">The <em>second </em>count sets forth the contract as a parol agreement between <em>Janet Smith </em>and the defendant <em>.Ross, </em>by which, in consideration of the transfer of her interest in <em>Colin Ross\u2019s </em>estate, the defendant promised to pay the plaintiff mrs. <em>Milne </em>\u00a3 500. sterling in two months after <em>Janet\u2019s </em>death. Waiving the question, whether there is not a misjoinder of action, or whether this count be in <em>debt </em>or <em>assumpsit, </em>I shall proceed to these positions: that mrs. <em>Milne </em>had no rights whatever under the contract as <em>laid; </em>that if she had, they could not be asserted at <em>law; </em>or if they could be so asserted, it could not be by action of <em>debt, </em>but only by special action on the case in <em>assumpsit.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">First, mrs. <em>Milne </em>had no rights under this alleged parol contract. To give her any right whatever, there must either have been an executed gift, or a valuable consideration. A gift without consideration confers a right, provided it is complete by delivery; and a grant, though incomplete, will confer a right if there be a valuable consideration. Thus, not only does a gift to a child, accompanied by <em>possession, </em>pass the title, but if one give chattels by <em>deed, </em>and deliver the <em>deed </em>to the use of the donee, though a volunteer, the goods and chattels are immediately in the donee. <em>Butler Sf Baker\u2019s case, </em>3 Co. 26. b. For the deed is an executed contract: it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>passes all title out of .the grantor, even without the delivery of possession. And if, in such case, the transfer is to one person for the benefit of another, the whole title passes at once by the deed from the grantor to the grantee. Of consequence, the grantor\u2019s rights are gone, and as the grantee gave no value, he holds as trustee for the third person, who thus becomes invested with the right by the declaration of trust in his favour, even though he has paid no consideration. On the other hand, though there be no deed, yet if there be a valuable consideration, the rights of the third party may be irrevocable. Thus if <em>A. </em>owes \u00a3100. and delivers that sum to <em>B. </em>to pay over to <em>C. </em>his creditor, <em>A. </em>cannot countermand it, and <em>C. </em>may sue for it as money had and received for his use, <em>Farmer </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>1 Bos. &amp; Pul. 296.; though this seems .to have been otherwise decided on the ground that the party may have subsequently paid the debt, <em>Turberville </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>Dyer 49. a. in note. And see also <em>Surtees </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>4 Esp. Rep. 203. It is, however, on this principle, that the case cited in argument of <em>Weston </em>v. <em>Barker, </em>12 Johns. Rep. 276. must rest. That was the case of a trust, in which the grantors had conveyed certain securities for discharging certain debts, and the balance to be held subject to then order: for that balance they gave the plaintiff an order, <em>he being a creditor of theirs, </em>and <em>the </em>defendant had notice of the order. The acceptance of the trust was held equivalent to an express promise by the trustee .to pay to the grantor\u2019s order, and the order being given for payment of a debt, and the funds being in the trustee\u2019s hands, it was held that <em>assumpsit </em>would lie for it. But where there is <em>no </em>consideration, and the contract is by <em>parol, </em>nothing passes to the third person by the promise to pay to him. That promise is at all times revocable before payment. Thus if a sum of <em>money </em>be delivered to <em>J. S. </em>to <em>the use and behoof </em>of a woman, to be delivered to her at her day of marriage, and before the mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>riage the bailor revokes it, it seems to be the better opinion, that the order was countermandable, notwithstanding the money had passed out of the hands of the grantor, and the gift therefore seemed executed as to him. <em>Lyte &amp; ux. </em>v. <em>Penny, </em>Dyer 49. a. The reasoning of <em>Shelley </em>in that case, shews the principles on which the case was decided: he said, <em>\u201c </em>that <em>gifts, </em>though <em>commenced, </em>are of no force if they be not co'tnpleled\u201d\u2014 \u201c For when a man makes such a sort of conditional gift of his mere will and good pleasure, and delivers the thing into <em>indifferent hands </em>to keep for the use of a stranger, still, before the condition is performed, the bailment is <em>revocable. </em>For if a man deliver to his servant on new year\u2019s day a golden cup, to give as a new year\u2019s gift to a stranger, clearly he may countermand this, notwithstanding the gift, for this was <em>not </em>a gift <em>perfectly executed. </em>And there is a difference, when a man makes a gift or bailment to give to a stranger <em>upon a consideration or former </em>duty\u201d\u2014\u201cAnd the law is the same when a thing is delivered in consideration, satisfaction, or recompense of another thing; there, he cannot countermand. And so here, if the case had been, that the bailor had been to be bound by covenant, in consideration of a marriage precedent, to pay such a sum, then could he never revoke it; for this alters the property; immediately; but it is otherwise of a <em>mere </em>gift <em>without any cause </em>precedent.\u201d There is indeed no proposition more clear, than that personal property can only pass by <em>deed, </em>or <em>delivery </em>of <em>possession; </em>and it is not less true, that <em>choses in action </em>are not assignable at all at <em>common law, </em>though the delivery of the documentary evidences of debt, for value received, may pass an <em>equitable </em>title to it. In this case, there is neither valuable consideration, nor delivery of any documentary evidence of the debt. It cannot therefore amount to a gift, or even to a promise to give. For there is no promise to mrs. <em>Milne, </em>either from the defendant <em>Ross </em>or from mrs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number><em>Smith. </em>It was but an order to her debtor to pay money due to her, to her daughter, which order she had a right to countermand, and of course there was no vested right in the plaintiffs which they can enforce against any one. If a gift of <em>personal chattels </em>without deed, or delivery of possession, is inoperative and void, the gift of a <em>chose in action, </em>without delivery and assignment of some documentary evidence of the debt, would seem to be even yet more clearly nugatory. For at common law even a bond could not be assigned, because it is but a <em>chose in action. </em>In equity, indeed, the assignment is held good, but even there, not without a valuable consideration; 1 Bac. Abr. Assignment. 249. <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>1 Mass. Rep. 117. And courts of law now permit suits in the name of the obligee for the benefit of an assignee for value. Upon these principles, it is not perceived how an <em>oral chose in action </em>can be assignable, so as to give the assignee, <em>even for value, </em>a right to sue in his own name; and the objection is <em>a fortiori, </em>where there is no consideration. There is nothing of which even a symbolical delivery can be made, and therefore there can be no valid, binding and executed gift. As in this case, <em>Ross </em>was the debtor of mrs. <em>Smith, </em>and if by the oral agreement with her, that he would pay the money to mrs. <em>Milne, </em>the latter acquired a right to sue for this <em>chose in action, </em>without consideration, without a promise or agreement with her, and without any act amounting to a transfer of the debt, then it would seem, that the principles of the law which inhibit the assignment of <em>choses in action </em>are unsubstantial and deceptive. For my own part, (with lord <em>Kenyon, </em>1 East 104.) I think it safest to resist the overthrow of the principle which forbids such assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\"><em>Fink </em>v. <em>Fink\u2019s ex\u2019or, </em>18 Johns. Rep. 145. is a case which involves some of these principles. <em>Alexander Fink, </em>in his lifetime, executed his promissory note to his son for 1000 dollars payable at sixty days; declar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>ing, when he did so, that he intended to give it to him absolutely; but there was no valuable consideration: an action by his son against his executor having been brought, it was decided, that it could not be maintained. <em>Spencer, </em>J. said \u201c A promise to <em>pay money </em>as a gift, is no more a ground of action than a promise to <em>deliver a chattel </em>as a gift.\u201d\u2014\u201cThere is no case where a personal action has been founded on an <em>executory </em>contract, where a consideration was necessary, in which the consideration of blood, or natural love and affection, has been held to be sufficient. In such case, the consideration must be a <em>valuable </em>one, for the benefit of the promiser, or to the trouble, loss, or prejudice of the promisee. <em>The note </em>here manifested indeed an <em>intention to give </em>the 1000 dollars. It was, however, <em>executory, </em>and the promiser had a <em>locus pcenitentim. </em>It was an <em>engagement </em>to give, and <em>not a gift.\" </em>In our case, there was not even a promise or engagement to give. There was only an oral promise by the <em>debtor to the creditor, </em>that he would pay the debt to the third person: and this promise the creditor had, at all times before payment, a right to release or countermand.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-3\">This case, however, has been attempted to be supported upon authority; and the case of <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole </em>(which may be considered as the foundation on which others rest) has been confidently relied on. It was an action on the case, and appears to have been in <em>assumpsit. </em>The declaration is rather more at large in sir <em>T. Raymond's </em>report than elsewhere, but even there no <em>assumpsit </em>from the <em>defendant </em>to the <em>plaintiff </em>is laid : which, however, does not seem to have been a litigated point. The plaintiff declared, that his wife\u2019s father being about to cut down timber to raise \u00a31000. for her, the defendant his son and heir promised the father, if he would forbear, he would pay the \u00a31000. He did forbear, and the son failing to pay, this suit was brought; and it was decided, that the right to sue was in her, and not in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>father or his executors. The propriety of this judgment I am not disposed to controvert. The <em>father </em>had kept his timber and suffered no loss: but he had designed to provide his daughter a portion, and the son\u2019s promise prevented. To refuse to fulfil his promise was a fraud upon the sister, and the loss to her was a sufficient consideration to sustain a special action on the case. But in the case at bar, there was no loss shewn or averred, which 'could constitute a consideration to support an action by the daughter. The case of <em>Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. <em>Poole, </em>therefore, is not an authority in point to that before us. <em>Felton </em>v. <em>Dickinson, </em>10 Mass. Rep. 287. was also cited. There, a father bound his son to a trade, and the master agreed in consideration of his services to pay him a certain sum at his full age. The son served out his time, and at maturity brought and maintained the action. His services were the <em>consideration; </em>and as it moved <em>from him, </em>and the promise to his father was <em>for him, </em>he being a minor, it was in effect a promise to himself. As to <em>Shemerhorn </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>1 Johns. Rep. 139. the decision, as to the point now before us, was extrajudicial; for the case went off on another point, and instead of being decided in favour of the plaintiff, was adjudged against him; so that this point seems to have been but little considered. The case of <em>Pigott </em>v. <em>Thompson, </em>3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 147. contains but an <em>obiter dictwm of </em>lord <em>Alvanley, </em>in which his brethren differed from him; though I am ready to admit the correctness of his proposition, wherever the promise to pay to the third person is on valuable consideration, or where the consideration moved from that person himself, as was the case in <em>Louther </em>v. <em>Kelly, 8 </em>Mod. 115. All the other cases which have been reviewed or referred to by the bar, in which the action by the third party has been sustained, will be found, I think, to be cases in which a valuable consideration moved <em>from </em>him, or the money was directed to he paid over in discharge of a debt due <em>to </em>him. Such was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>case of <em>Ward </em>v. Evans, 2 Ld. Raym. 928. <em>Israel </em>v. <em>Douglass, </em>1 H. Black. 239. <em>Weston </em>v. Barker, 12 Johns. Rep. 276. in which last, however, <em>Spencer </em>dissented in a strong opinion. The whole of these cases depend upon these legal principles: that <em>choses in action </em>are not assignable; and that no executory contract has any force unless sustained by a valuable consideration. The first is a rule of law adopted for the prevention of maintenance; and though it has, in modern times, been somewhat relaxed, it is still a ruling principle. It was early admitted, that an assignment for <em>value </em>was good in equity; and the assignee is now also permitted to sue at law in the name of the assignor, but he cannot sue in his own name. Nor can the assignee sue at law or in equity, unless he is an assignee for value, as has been already shewn. The second principle is universal. No executory contract has any force, unless it be for value ; and moreover, wherever a valuable consideration is essential to an agreement, the <em>legal </em>interest in the simple contract resides with the party from whom the consideration moves, notwithstanding it may enure for another\u2019s benefit, or even is to be performed to another person. From want of attention to the true principle of the cases, there is some apparent conflict among them, some having gone farther than others in encroaching upon the established rules against the assignment of <em>choses in action. </em>Thus, if I deliver a sum of money to <em>B. </em>to pay over to <em>C. </em>who is my creditor, the money may be sued for by <em>C. </em>as <em>money had </em>and received to his use. <em>Wheatley </em>v. <em>Low, </em>Cro. Jac. 668. <em>Contra, Crifford </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>11 Mod. 241. And if I have <em>money </em>belonging to <em>B. </em>and promise to pay it for him to <em>G. </em>he <em>C. </em>may sue for it in his own name, since by the agreement the money has changed owners, and 1 have become C.\u2019s agent as 1 was <em>B.\u2019s </em>before. <em>Surtees </em>v. <em>Hubbard, </em>4 Esp. Rep. 203. This is all clear enough: but not content with going thus far, it has been decided,\" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>that if I give goods of the value of \u00a310. to <em>B. </em>to pay to <em>C., C. </em>may sue, the parties having considered and treated the goods as money. 1 Roll. Abr. 32. pi. 13. And where <em>A. </em>was indebted to <em>B. </em>and <em>B. </em>to <em>C. </em>and <em>B, </em>gave an order to <em>A. </em>to pay <em>C. </em>and the order was accepted by <em>A.\u2014C. </em>was admitted to sue <em>A. </em>for the amount. This case has indeed been questioned, though I think without sufficient reason, since A.\u2019s acceptance formed a new contract, for which the transaction furnished a sufficient consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">Upon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, that mrs. <em>Milne </em>had no rights under this supposed contract. But if she had, I am still of opinion they could only be enforced in equity. For it is not perceived, that mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>representative has no concern or interest in the matter: he represents her with whom the contract was made by <em>Ross, </em>and from whom the consideration moved. Accordingly, in one case where the right of the beneficiary to sue was sustained, the right of the promisee to sue was also admitted<em>; Bell </em>v. <em>Chaplain, </em>Hardr. 321. But this leads to one of two <em>consequences; </em>either that the recovery here would not be a bar to the suit of the representative of mrs. <em>Smith, </em>or it would be a bar. If it would not be a bar, then the defendant would be twice charged: if it would be a bar, then the representative of the promisee would be concluded by a proceeding to which he is no party. If then mrs. <em>Milne </em>has rights, it is safest that they be asserted in equity, where all the parties can be convened; or that, at least, the suit should be brought in the name of mrs. <em>Smith\u2019s </em>administrator, that, by being a party upon the record, any controversy between him and mrs. <em>Milne, </em>as to her rights, may be collaterally decided by the usual proceedings in similar cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Lastly; admitting mrs. <em>Milne\u2019s </em>right to sue at law, I do not think she can maintain <em>debt. Dutton &amp; wife </em>v. Poole, and all the cases founded on it, were in <em>assumpsit. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>If entitled to sue, she must sue upon the special promise <em>only; </em>for <em>Ross </em>was never her debtor. This distinction, which prevails in many cases, is strictly applicable here. Thus, <em>debt </em>will not lie against the acceptor or endorser of a bill of exchange (except by statute) but the action lies upon the special undertaking. Nor will it lie on any collateral contract, as on a promise to pay the debt of another in consideration of forbearance. <em>Anon. </em>Hardr. 486. <em>Bishop </em>v. Young, 2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 78. 83. <em>Hard\u2019s case, </em>1 Salk. 23. Nor will it lie for a wager. <em>Bovey </em>v. <em>Castleman, </em>1 Ld. Raym. 69. In this case, it is clear, that if <em>Ross </em>was liable at all to mrs. <em>Milne, </em>it was upon the express contract, and not as <em>her </em>debtor, which he never was.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">It only remains to observe, that the want of title in mrs. <em>Milne </em>cannot be cured even by the omnipotent act of <em>jeofails. </em>That act never could, have been designed to enable a plaintiff to recover what by his own shewing belongs to another person. The judgment, then, in this case, should have been for the defendant, <em>non .obstante veredicto.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b247-8\">The other judges concurred.
