The commissioners named in this last act, met in 1803, and took measures for carrying the act of 1796 into execution. A committee of three managers was named, <em>John Caruthers </em>was appointed the treasurer, and <em>William Caruthers </em>the secretary : and it was made the duty of the secretary to distribute tickets for sale, to contract for printing, and to communicate with persons at a distance respecting the sale of tickets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-7\">The managers determined to make an experiment with one class of the lottery, by which they hoped to raise 5000 dollars. Tickets were accordingly distributed by the secretary, but the whole of them could not be sold. The lottery was drawn in August 1805.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b631-8\">The managers proceeded to make contracts for opening the roads, and applied the money raised by the lottery to defray the expense thereof. The community, interested in the improvement, aided it by private subscriptions. And in 1808, the general assembly likewise gave its aid to the work: by an act passed in that year, reciting that the sufferers by the fire had transferred their rights to the money raised by the lottery, to the managers thereof, for the purpose of opening the roads before mentioned, and that the managers had opened a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>road over the south mountain, hut had <em>not sufficient funds </em>to complete the road over the north mountain, 1000 dollars was appropriated, to he expended by commissioners named for the purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-10\">The roads were completed in 1808 or 1809.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-11\">The last meeting of the managers of the lottery was held in November 1808 <em>; at </em>which a committee was appointed to settle the accounts of <em>William Caruthers; </em>but whether any settlement was made, or attempted, nowise appeared.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-12\">In 1810 or 1811, <em>Abraham Smith </em>and <em>Juliet </em>his wife, and <em>Margaret </em>Lyle, sufferers by the fire, brought a suit, in the superior court of chancery of <em>Staunton, </em>against the commissioners for drawing the lottery named in the act of 1802, insisting that the money raised by the lottery should be applied to their relief, according to the intent of the acts by which the lottery was authorized, and praying an account of the funds which had been thereby raised. But neither the bill, nor any other part of the record in that suit, was exhibited in this suit, except only the answer of the commissioners ; wherein they resisted the claim of the plaintiffs to fix a personal liability on them for the misapplication of the money raised by the lottery, and stated, that not quite half the tickets of the first class of the lottery were sold, that the actual proceeds of it were only 2000 dollars, that this sum had been appropriated to the opening of the roads, and that the outstanding claims against the agents for selling the tickets had not then been fully settled up. This case of <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle </em>against the commissioners, was finally decided in favour of the commissioners, but not till after the death of <em>William Caruthers, </em>which occurred in 1817.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b632-13\">Ten years after, namely, in 1827, an act of assembly was passed for extending .the limits of the town of <em>Lexington; </em>whereby, among other things, the surplus money raised by lottery under the former acts, and then <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>remaining in the hands of the treasurer of the lottery, or of his representatives, was vested in the trustees of the town, and the treasurer or his representatives were required to settle the accounts with the trustees, and to pay over to them the balance in hand, deducting legal charges ; and in case of their failure to do so, the trustees were authorized to sue for the sum due <em>by action of debt.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-7\">In 1830, the trustees of <em>Lexington </em>exhibited their bill, in the superior court of chancery of <em>Staunton, </em>against the administrators of <em>William Caruthers, </em>alleging that he was the treasurer of the lottery, that large funds came into his hands, and that he died in 1.817, without having settled his accounts; that it appeared by the accounts and books of <em>Caruthers </em>and by a memorandum in his own handwriting, that he was a debtor to the lottery in a large balance; and that the reason why the accounts were not settled during his life, was, that <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle </em>had brought a suit in chancery to have the funds raised by the lottery applied to indemnify them against losses sustained by the fire. Therefore, the bill prayed, that the administrators of <em>Caruthers </em>should render an account of his transactions as treasurer of the lottery, and a decree for the balance which should be found due thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b633-8\">The administrators of <em>Caruthers </em>answered, that they had no knowledge whatever of the lottery transactions, but they exhibited all the documents relating to them they could find. They said, that their intestate was not the treasurer of the lottery, but the secretary; that <em>John Caruthers </em>was the treasurer; that their intestate could not be held liable for any balance in the treasury, if there was any balance; and that from all the information they could procure, they believed that nothing was due to the lottery from their intestate, or from any body else. They exhibited the answer of the commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>sioners of the lottery to the hill of <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle, </em>to shew that only 2000 dollars was raised hy the lottery, and shewed many receipts for moneys expended on the roads. They suggested, that the impression that a ba3-ance was due from their intestate, had grown out of an account on the books of <em>Isaac Caruthers Sp co. </em>of which their intestate <em>William </em>was a partner; which account they exhibited, and denied that it afforded any evidence of the indebtedness of their intestate to the lottery. And they objected, that they could not justly, and ought not to be called to account at this late day, when all the persons acquainted with the transactions were dead, and it was therefore impossible to render a just account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-9\">The account exhibited with the answer, between <em>The Lottery </em>and <em>Isaac Caruthers Sp co. </em>shewed a balance due the lottery, in October 1813, of \u00a3411. 15. 2. and it was stated, in the handwriting of <em>William Caruthers, </em>that this was \u201c a balance due the lottery to be paid by <em>William Caruthers </em>on a settlement with himbut it was manifest, that there was an individual account between <em>William Caruthers </em>and <em>The Lottery, </em>which was to be settled, and by which the true balance was to be ascertained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-10\">The cause having been transferred to the circuit superior court of <em>Rockbridge, </em>that court referred the accounts to a commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b634-11\">The commissioner reported, that the want of a general account, which <em>William Caruthers </em>ought to have kept with the lottery, and which without doubt he must have kept, but which his administrators could not produce, left the subject in much darkness, upon which that account alone could throw light: that he had, with great labour, examined the books of <em>Isaac Caruthers Sp co. </em>and the books kept by <em>William Caruthers, </em>and all the other documents laid before him. And he reported a balance due from <em>William Caruthers, </em>of 1128 dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>The defendants filed eighteen exceptions to the details of the account reported by the commissioner.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-4\">The court overruled the exceptions; and holding that, under all the circumstances, the lapse of time was not an obstacle to the relief; that though <em>William, Caruthers </em>was not the treasurer of the lottery, he acted as such, and received and disbursed all the moneys raised from the lottery; and that, acting as treasurer, it was his duty to have kept regular accounts shewing the true state of the lottery fund, which he had failed to do, and if there was any difficulty in ascertaining the just balance due from him, it was owing to his own fault; therefore, the court decreed, that the administrators of <em>William Caruthers </em>should pay the trustees of <em>Lexington, </em>out of the estate of their intestate, <em>the </em>sum of 1128 dollars, with interest from the 27th February 1827, the date of the act of assembly vesting the balance of the lottery fund in the trustees.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b635-5\">From this decree, the administrators of <em>Caruthers, </em>by petition to this court, prayed an appeal; which was allowed. '</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b635-9\">The cause was argued here, by <em>G. N. Johnson </em>and the <em>attorney gen,eral </em>for the appellants, and by <em>Cooke </em>for <em>the </em>appellees.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b635-10\">I. The counsel for the <em>appellants </em>insisted, that the act of assembly of 1827, was founded upon the supposition, that the accounts of the treasurer of the lottery had been settled, and that the balance due upon them had been ascertained and was acknowledged; therefore, the act vested the property in that balance in the trustees of <em>Lexington, </em>and gave them an <em>action of debt </em>to recover it: but it gave them no right to a bill in chancery to bring about a settlement of these old accounts after all the persons, who had any knowledge of the transactions, and who were able to explain <em>them, </em>were dead. The act too gave the action of debt against the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number><em>treasurer </em>of the lottery, or his representatives; but <em>John Caruthers </em>was the treasurer, and <em>William </em>only the secretary: the suit therefore should have been brought ^ against <em>John </em>; or if <em>William </em>acted as treasurer, <em>John </em>or rePresentatives should at least have been made a</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-6\">The counsel for the <em>appellees </em>answered, that it appeared, clearly, that <em>William </em>acted as the treasurer, nor was there any reason to believe that <em>John </em>ever interfered at all. The statute vested the whole balance due, in the trustees of <em>Lexington, </em>and required that the treasurer should settle his accounts with them, and then gave them an action of debt for the balance: but it was necessary to settle the account before the action of debt could be brought. The title to the balance was vested in the trustees; and the court of chancery was the proper tribunal to settle the accounts, and ascertain the balance. The form of the remedy was immaterial: the right was given to the trustees, and they resorted to the most convenient and proper remedy, a bill in chancery, to have the accounts adjusted.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b636-7\">II. The counsel for the <em>appellants </em>maintained, that this was a stale transaction and equity ought not to entertain the bill. If the statute intended, that the trustees might resort to equity to have an account settled, it surely never intended to authorize a bill for the settlement of such an account; a bill, which, on its general principles, equity could not entertain. The lottery was drawn in 1805; the money actually received from it, must have been disbursed as early as 1808 or 1809, when the roads across the south and the north mountains were completed; something, it seemed, remained due, not from the treasurer, but from agents for selling the lottery tickets; <em>William Caruthers </em>died in 1817, and this bill was filed thirteen years afterwards, when no person was living who had any part in the transactions, or could give any explanation of them. To authorize such an account were to authorize a palpable injustice.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>The counsel for the <em>appellees </em>answered, that it was plain the account had never been settled; and the reason was, that <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle </em>set up a claim to the money raised by the lottery. The commissioners, in their answer to that bill, said, that the accounts remained to be adjusted; that was in 1811. The suit of <em>Smith Lyle </em>was not decided till after the death of <em>Caruthers </em>in 1817. <em>Caruthers </em>then died without settling the accounts. The question is, whether, at the time the act of assembly vesting the balance in the trustees was passed, namely, in February 1827, these accounts were so stale, that a court of equity ought not to entertain bill for the settlement of them ? The legislature did not think so; for it required the debtor <em>to settle the accounts. </em>Nor is a lapse of ten or thirteen years enough to bar the settlement asked by the trustees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b637-4\">III. The remaining questions discussed at the bar, arose upon the exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report; but these turned upon matters of fact.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b637-5\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"ATgt\">It was objected, in the first place, that the act of assembly of 1827 did not authorize a proceeding in chancery; and that if, under a liberal construction of the act, such a proceeding could have been maintained, the act authorized a proceeding against the <em>treasurer </em>or his representatives, and as it appears, that <em>John </em>and not <em>William Caruthers </em>was the treasurer, the plaintiffs had no authority to proceed against the representatives of <em>William. </em>In the view this court takes of the case, it is unnecessary to decide these questions. Grant that the trustees of <em>Lexington </em>had a right to proceed by bill in equity, and that <em>William </em>Caruthers, though not regularly appointed treasurer of the lottery, acted as treasurer, have the trustees made out such a case as entitles them to relief in equity ?</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">It seems to me, that, after the great lapse of time which has occurred, the death of all the parties who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>could throw light on the transactions, and the impossibility, with the scanty materials before us, to settle the account correctly, the court below, upon the coming in of the commissioner\u2019s report, ought to have dismissed bill. The lottery was drawn in 1805. The roads, <em>to </em>the construction of which the money was applied, appear to have been completed in 1808 or 1809. From that period till 1817, when <em>Caruthers </em>died, the commissioners of the lottery seem to have concerned themselves no further with the matter, except to file an answer in 1811 to a bill of <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle. </em>In 1808, the last meeting of the commissioners of which we have any evidence, took place ; and then a committee was appointed to settle <em>Caruthers's </em>accounts with the lottery. And twenty-two years afterwards, and thirteen years after the death of <em>Caruthers, </em>this suit is brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In <em>Pickering </em>v. <em>Ld. Stamford, </em>2 Ves. Jr. 583. the master of the rolls said, \u201c that parties shall not, by neglecting to bring forward their demands, put others to a state of inconvenience subjecting them to insuperable difficulties. Against such a bill undoubtedly the court ought to set its face.\u201d\u2014\u201c If, from the plaintiff\u2019s lying by, it is impossible for the defendants to render the accounts he calls for, or it will subject \u2022 them to great inconvenience, the plaintiff must suffer, or the court will oppose, what I think the best ground, public convenience.\u201d The english cases refusing relief after a great lapse of time, were reviewed and approved by this court in the case of <em>Carr's adm'r </em>v. <em>Chapman's legatees, </em>5 Leigh 164. 178. where it is said, that \u201c the principles deduced from the english cases are fully supported, if not advanced a step, by the spirit of our own decisions and of our legislation also.\u201d The same principles are affirmed in <em>Hayes </em>v. <em>Goode, </em>7 Leigh 452. And in <em>Atkinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>9 Leigh 393. 396. the court held, <em>\u201c </em>that even if it were clearly proved, that the decedent <em>Beverley Robinson </em>had, in the last hours of his life, acknowledged that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>debt to Smart, which the complainant claimed, had not been fully discharged, yet the amount remaining due was uncertain, and coidd only be ascertained by a settlement of accounts in reference to transactions more than twenty-seven years old at the commencement of this suit, and now of more than thirty-seven years standing. Such an account ought not to be decreed; for every claimant who asks relief of a court of equity ought to exhibit his claim within a reasonable time, so that, in giving him a decree, the court may not do injustice to the defendant.\u201d No particular period is fixed by the cases as limiting the demand for an account. If, from the delay which has taken place, it is manifest that no correct account can be rendered, that any conclusion to which the court can arrive must be, at best, but conjectural, and. that the original transactions have become so obscured by time and the loss of evidence and the death of parties, as to render it difficult to do justice, the court will not relieve. It is the duty of the plaintiff in equity, as well as at law, to establish his title to the relief sought for, by satisfactory proof; it will not answer to shew a probable title to something. He must satisfy the court, that it can extend relief without the hazard of doing injustice to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">To apply these principles to the present case: <em>William Garuthers </em>was the secretary, not the treasurer, of the lottery. As secretary, it was his duty to keep the accounts with the agents to whom tickets were entrusted for sale. That account seems to have been kept by him, and furnishes the basis of the account reported by the commissioner. But this account does not prove, that he acted as treasurer in fact: it was kept by him as secretary, in discharge of his duties as secretary. The evidence shews that he was the active and efficient manager of the business, and, taken all together, raises a strong presumption, that most of the receipts and disbursements passed through his hands. Still, no account <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>kept by him as treasurer, or by any other person, is produced, though in all probability such an account was kept, by some person, somewhere. The evidence does not shew, that he received all the proceeds arising from ^Ie sa^e the tickets, or made all the disbursements, There was a treasurer, who may have transacted part of the business. Yet the first step in the account, is to charge him, as treasurer in fact, with the price of all the tickets disposed of. The evidence shews a great anxiety, on the part of the managers, and of the community, for the completion of the roads. A private subscription was raised in aid of the lottery fund: can we suppose, that this would have been done, if a large fund remained in the hands of <em>Caruthers ? </em>In 1808, the legislature contributed 1000 dollars, reciting in the act, that the funds raised by the lottery were insufficient. These circumstances, taken in connexion with the silence of all parties afterwards, render it extremely improbable, that such a fund could have been, lying in the hands of the secretary unappropriated.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\">It was contended, that the lottery fund was arrested in the hands of <em>Caruthers, </em>by the suit of <em>Smith </em>and <em>Lyle, </em>and that this explains why the accounts were not settled, and the balance was not exacted. The record of that suit is not exhibited in this. To sustain their proposition, the plaintiffs are themselves obliged to rely on the answer of the commissioners in that suit; and that answer, when looked to, repels the idea that there could have been any balance. The commissioners set out the difficulties they had to encounter, and their inability to dispose of half of the lottery tickets: they aver, that they realized not more than 2000 dollars, and that the money (together with the private subscriptions and the donation of 1000 dollars from the legislature) was appropriated to the road. And they, throughout, resist the claim of those plaintiffs, as an attempt to fix a personal liability on them for a misapplication of the fund, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>that is, of the whole fund. They say, indeed, that the outstanding claims on agents had not then heen fully settled up: were they ever fully settled up, and by whom ? by the secretary, or by the treasurer ? All this is left, by the evidence in this cause, absolutely uncertain.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\">The principal ground on which the plaintiffs rely, is the account between <em>The Lottery </em>and <em>Isaac Carulhers co. </em>exhibited with the defendants\u2019 answer. [Here, the judge entered - into an examination of that document, and shewed that it furnished no evidence of <em>William Caruthers\u2019s </em>indebtedness to the lottery; and then into an examination of the exceptions to the commissioner\u2019s report, and detected many errors in it.]</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">These considerations shew the great injustice likely to be inflicted, by an attempt to go into an account of such stale transactions, after the death of all the parties who could give satisfactory explanations. The act of 1827, authorizing the suit, does not obviate the objections to an account of such transactions. That act was passed under an impression, that an ascertained balance remained <em>in the </em>hands of the treasurer, <em>because there </em>was no person authorized to demand it. The balance was vested in the trustees of Lexington, and they were authorized to bring <em>an action of debt </em>for it; which plainly shews, that the legislature, if it intended a proceeding by bill in chancery at all, did not mean to sanction a bill for the settlement of stale accounts. Whatever may have been the motives of the legislature, there is nothing in its act to impair the rights of the parties. There is nothing in the actual case, to relieve the plaintiffs from the necessity of establishing their claim by satisfactory evidence. This they have failed to do : on the contrary, the case, as it now stands, leaves the impression, that the proceeds of the lottery have long since been appropriated ; and it is evident, that, at this period, with the materials that have been collected, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>account likely to do justice between the parties can be taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-9\">I am of opinion, that the decree should be reversed, and the bill dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"AXq7\">The other judges concurred. Decree reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
