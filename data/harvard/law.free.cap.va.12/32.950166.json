That the partnership of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>was now dissolved; <em>Davidson </em>was notoriously insolvent; <em>N. </em>and <em>J.

Dick, </em>then of <em>Richmond </em>now of <em>New Orleans, William Davidson </em>of <em>London, </em>and his testator <em>A. Moore </em>of <em>Petersburg. </em>That the defendant knew nothing of any such sale of goods alleged in the bill to have been made by <em>Smithson </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>and by him delivered to their partner <em>Davidson </em>at <em>London, </em>in the year 1817, nor did it appear by the books of <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>that any such goods were received by them in that year; but it appeared by their books, that goods put up by <em>Smithson </em>were shipped by <em>Davidson </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>in the year 1816, which goods amounted to \u00a31106. 15. 6. sterling, and were charged by <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>to themselves and to the credit of <em>Davidson </em>in account with him. That <em>Davidson </em>(as th\u00e9 defendant understood and believed) was doing business in <em>London </em>at the time, on his own separate account; business \u25a0 in which <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>had no concern. That the defendant had no knowledge whether the goods purchased of <em>Smithson, </em>were purchased by <em>Davidson </em>on his own individual account and credit, or on the account and credit of <em>Dicks, Moore i\u00a1' co. </em>but he had reason to believe, that the goods were purchased by <em>Davidson </em>on his individual account and credit alone, according to the understanding of <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>and that they denied that <em>Smithson </em>had any claim on them. That in 1816 when the goods were sold to <em>Davidson, </em>he was in good credit; but in 1817, when <em>Smithson </em>drew the bill on <em>Davidson </em>now exhibited, his circumstances might have become doubtful (he was now bankrupt); and that might have been the reason why <em>Smithson </em>was so careful to express on the face of the bill, that the money was due on account of <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>but if the credit was originally given to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number><em>Davidson </em>alone, the draft of the bill in that form, and <em>Davidson\u2019s </em>acceptance of it, was nothing but a contrivanee to charge <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>with <em>Davidson's </em>individual separate debt. And the defendant, as the executor of <em>Moore, </em>called for proof, that the goods were delivered by <em>Smithson </em>to the order, or in consequence of any order, of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>and not to <em>Davidson </em>on his separate individual account. The answer further stated, that the partnership of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>was dissolved in 1818, and <em>Moore </em>undertook to pay all the debts of that house. And then the answer (among other matters touching the defendant\u2019s administration of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate) stated, that <em>Moore </em>died indebted to <em>William Davidson </em>and <em>Albert Garnett, </em>trading under the firm of <em>Davidson Sj' Garnett </em>at <em>Liverpool, </em>in the sum of \u00a3 213. 7. O. sterling, and to the same persons trading under the firm of <em>W. Davidson Sp co. </em>at <em>London, </em>in the sum of \u00a3 520. 8. 5. sterling, and these creditors had by letter of attorney, authorized <em>Cunningham </em>to collect the debts for them; and that <em>Davidson Sp Garnett, </em>and <em>W. Davidson Sp co. </em>were indebted to <em>Edward Cunningham Sp co. </em>(of whom the defendant was a partner) to a much larger amount, and being now insolvent, the defendant claimed a right to apply the money he was authorized to collect for them of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate to the satisfaction of their debt to <em>E. Cunningham Sp co. </em>and to retain the same out of the assets of his testator <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate. The answer set forth also the dealings and transactions between <em>Cunningham </em>and <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>shewing that he was concerned as a partner with them, in two successive mercantile houses established at <em>New Orleans, </em>the last of which <em>{Dicks, Booker Sp co.) </em>was still continuing, but that on these accounts <em>Cunningham </em>was not at the time the process of attachment in this suit of <em>Smithson </em>was served on him, and had not been at any time since, debtor to <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>but on the contrary, they were and continued to be his debtors to a large amount.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ak0\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>The plaintiff put in a general replication to the answer of <em>Cunningham.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\">Pending the suit the defendant <em>Maria Moore </em>married <em>J- T. Robertson; </em>process was sued out against them, an&lt;^ they failing to appear, the bill was taken <em>pro confesso </em>as to them. The defendants <em>Nathaniel </em>and <em>James Dick </em>and <em>William Davidson </em>were proceeded against as absent defendants: an order of publication, in the usual form, was made to convent them before the court; and a certificate of the printer of the <em>Virginia Times </em>(a newspaper of the city of <em>Richmond) </em>that the order had been published in that paper for two months successively, was filed; but the certificate was not verified by affidavit, nor was there any other proof of the publication.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-5\">The only evidence adduced by the plaintiff <em>Smithson, </em>to prove his claim against <em>Dicks, Moore fy co. </em>was the bill drawn by him on <em>Davidson </em>of the 18th August 1817, for \u00a31073. 12. O. sterling, with <em>Davidson's </em>acceptance thereof, and the statements thereon indorsed, above set out at large.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-6\">The bill having been taken <em>pro confesso </em>as to the defendants <em>Robertson Sf wife, </em>and the plaintiff appearing (as the record stated,) \u201c to have proceeded in the mode prescribed by law against the defendants <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>who were out of the country,\u201d the cause came on for hearing in June 1826, on the bill, the answer of the defendant <em>Cunningham, </em>and the exhibits; and the court ordered accounts of <em>Cunningham's </em>administration of the estate of his testator <em>Moore, </em>and of the real estate of <em>Moore </em>in the hands of his devisee, the defendant mrs. <em>Robertson. </em>The commissioner reported the accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b58-7\">Some controversy arose upon <em>Cunningham's </em>administration account, not only between the plaintiff and <em>Cunningham, </em>but between <em>Robertson </em>and hi's wife, the devisee of the real estate of <em>Moore, </em>and <em>Cunningham, </em>the executor. Of the disputed items, it is only necessary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>to mention one : <em>Cunningham </em>claimed to charge <em>Moore's </em>estate, with 3261 dollars with interest from 1821, on account of the two sterling debts due from Moore, of \u00a3213. 7. O. to <em>Davidson Sp </em>Garnett, and \u00a3520. 8. 5. to <em>W. Davidson Sp co. </em>mentioned in his answer: and <em>Robertson and wife </em>objected to the charge, on the ground, that <em>Davidson </em>was a partner of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>and should be required to settle his accounts with that house, and to pay <em>Moore </em>any balance he might owe, before he should be allowed to assert those two claims against <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-4\">Exceptions being taken to the commissioner\u2019s report, the same was recommitted. And then a long delay in the proceedings ensued, which there was nothing in the record to account <em>for; </em>it was probably owing to some inattention on the part of the plaintiff, or rather of his agents. At length, in April 1833, the commissioner returned a reformed report of <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>administration account, and an account of the real estate of <em>Moore </em>in the hands of his devisee; by the former of which it appeared, that personal assets of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate amply sufficient to satisfy the plaintiff\u2019s demand, had come to the hands of the executor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b59-5\">It also appeared by the report, that a compromise had been entered into between <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, Cunningham </em>the executor of <em>Moore, </em>and <em>Robertson </em>and his wife the devisee, of all differences which had arisen between those parties; whereby <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>on their part, covenanted to pay all debts due from the late partnership of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>and to clear and save harmless the estate and representatives of <em>Moore </em>from all responsibility for the same; <em>Cunningham </em>on his part, covenanted to pay and transfer all moneys and other assets of the estate of <em>Moore </em>in his hands, to <em>Robertson </em>and his wife, who having been named an executrix in <em>Moore\u2019s </em>will, had recently qualified as such: and <em>Robertson and wife, </em>on their part, covenanted to indemnify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number><em>Cunningham </em>from all claims against him as executor of <em>Moore.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Adz\">Meantime, the cause had been transferred to the cireuit superior court of <em>Henrico. </em>And there, at June term on motion of the other defendants (as it seemed,) time was allowed them till the next term to take the deposition of the defendant <em>Cunningham </em>to be read in evidence in the cause, unless the plaintiff should consent, that <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>answer should be considered as a deposition, subject to all exceptions which might be taken to the reading thereof in evidence, if the same were a deposition regularly taken upon notice. The plaintiff consented, that the answer of <em>Cunningham </em>should be considered as his deposition, subject to just exceptions to its competency. And, thereupon, at the same term, June 1833, the cause came on for final hearing; and the court decreed, that Cunningham, who appeared by the report of the commissioner to have ample assets of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate in his hands to satisfy the plaintiff <em>Smithson\u2019s </em>claim, should pay him the balance of principal and interest appearing due upon <em>Smithson\u2019s </em>bill on <em>Davidson </em>of the 18th August 1819, for \u00a31073. 12. O. sterling, and the costs of this suit: reserving liberty to <em>Smithson, </em>if this decree should prove unavailing, to apply to the court for a decree against the defendants <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick </em>and <em>Davidson: </em>and reserving liberty to <em>Cunningham </em>(upon the articles of compromise between him, <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick </em>and <em>Roheidson and </em>wife) to resort to the court for relief against them as well as <em>Davidson, </em>if the <em>Dicks </em>and <em>Robertson and wife </em>should not save him harmless from this decree in favour of <em>Smithson </em>against him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b60-7\"><em>Cunningham, </em>and <em>N. </em>and <em>J.

That diffidence is enhanced, in the present instance, from the impression, that the result to which I have arrived, may do injustice to a fair creditor, provided the facts necessary, in my opinion, to make out his case, had been established ; facts which possibly he might have established by proof, but has failed to do so. He has elected, however, to submit his cause upon the evidence in the record; and it becomes our duty to pronounce what seems to us to be the law upon the case as it now appears.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">The first enquiry presented is, in what capacity did <em>Davidson </em>transact business in <em>England ? </em>in other words, did these partners carry on business at <em>Richmond, </em>in the name and firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp;p co., </em>and in <em>England </em>under the firm of <em>William Davidson ? </em>Upon this question, there is no proof in the record. The only information we have is furnished by the answer of <em>Cunningham. </em>On this point, <em>Smithson </em>himself must rely upon the answer, and upon it alone. He does not expressly aver in his bill, that the firm transacted business in <em>England </em>in the name of <em>William Davidson. </em>He states, that in 1817, he sold goods to the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore Sf co., </em>of which <em>N. Dick \u00a3f J. Dick, </em>then residing at <em>Richmond, A. Moore, </em>then of <em>Petersburg, </em>and <em>W. Davidson </em>of <em>London, </em>were partners; that the goods were received by <em>Davidson </em>and shipped to the partners in <em>Virginia; </em>that for the payment of the price of them, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>he drew a bill on <em>Davidson </em>on account of <em>Dicks, Moore co- </em>which was accepted by <em>Davidson, </em>but was not paid at maturity, the house having failed, and the bill was \u00b0rreturned: that although the failure took place in <em>Eng-^an^&gt; </em>there was no dissolution of the partnership at that time; the partners continued to do business in <em>Virginia, </em>and for aught we knew, were able to comply with their engagements. Now, this amounts to no direct allegation, that the partnership did business in <em>England </em>under the name of <em>W. Davidson. </em>On the contrary, such a construction would <em>do violence to the </em>allegations, taking them all together. He delivered the goods to <em>Davidson, </em>not to the house of <em>Dicks, Moore if co. </em>trading under that name. He drew on <em>Davidson individually; </em>and as conclusive evidence that he did not consider that as the style of the firm he draws on him to pay on account of <em>Dicks, Moore ip co. </em>which would have been idle, if the firm transacted business under the name of <em>W. Davidson; </em>for if such had been the fact, the bill on <em>Davidson </em>would have been a bill on the firm. And although it is said by way of recital, that the house having failed the bill was returned, it is not alleged that the house was known by the name of <em>W. Davidson. </em>If the statement could be construed into an averment, that there was a house of the partnership established at <em>London, </em>it is still uncertain in what name it transacted business. The answer states, that there was a mercantile house at <em>Richmond, </em>trading under the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore ip co., </em>the members of which resided in different places; one of them, <em>W. Davidson, </em>at <em>London. </em>But it no where is .admitted that the firm had a house transacting business at <em>London, </em>in that or any other name. The firm transacted its business at <em>Richmond </em>; it will not be pretended,\u2019 that a branch of the house is established wherever a single partner happens to reside.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">If a partner in trade draw, endorse, or accept a bill <em>in the name of the firm, </em>it will be binding on the firm jointly in the hands of a <em>bona fide </em>holder. This power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>of one partner to bind the firm, is implied by law from the principle, that members of trading partnerships are constituted agents, the one for the other, for entering \u00b0 , . , , , . \u2019 mto contracts connected with the business and concerns of the partnership, so that by the contracts of the agent all his principals are bound. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Clifton &amp; others, </em>6 Bing. 776. 795. 19 Eng. C. L. R. 233. 239. But to give to the act of one partner such an effect, it must be done in the name, and seemingly on behalf of the firm. In this case, the answer of <em>Cunningham </em>not only does not admit, that this partnership transacted business in <em>England </em>under the <em>firm </em>of <em>TV. Davidson, </em>or that the partnership had a house in <em>London, </em>but it avers, that the defendant always understood and now believes, that <em>Davidson </em>was doing business in <em>London </em>on his own separate account, with which the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore f co. </em>had no concern. This allegation is not responsive to any charge in the bill; it is affirmative, and if essential to the defence, should have been sustained by proof. But where, as in this case, no evidence is adduced to prove the existence of a house or firm in <em>London, </em>and the plaintiff is compelled to rely on the admissions of the answer to establish the fact, he makes it evidence ; the whole answer must be taken together, and it expressly negatives the pretension that the house in <em>Richmond </em>transacted business in <em>London </em>under the name of <em>TV. Davidson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">Where a partnership is conducted in the name of an individual partner, and a bill is drawn, endorsed or accepted by such partner, in an action against the firm, the plaintiff must be prepared to shew that the partner <em>A. </em>drew the bill not as <em>A. </em>but as <em>A. &amp; B. </em>Collyer on Partners. 226. In <em>The So. Carolina Bank </em>v. <em>Case, </em>8 Barn. &amp; Cress. 427. 15 Eng. C. L. R. 256. it appeared, that the business of the house of <em>Crowder, Clough co. </em>was carried on in <em>England </em>under that name, but in the <em>U. States </em>all the business of the partnership was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>transacted in the name <em>of J. B. Clough alone; </em>and he carried on no separate business: the court of king\u2019s bench held, that <em>J. B. Clough </em>was to be considered as the name of the <em>firm </em>for the purposes of business in <em>America, </em>and consequently, that the partners were liable as endorsers of the bills. The fact that the partnership transacted business under that name, was necessary to be established, before the partners could be rendered liable on the bills. This is clear from another case in which nearly the same parties were concerned, the case of <em>Denton v. Rodie, </em>3 Camp. 493. The house of <em>Clough, Wilkes Clough </em>was established at <em>Liverpool; J. B. Clough, </em>one of the partners, was resident at <em>New York ; </em>and he drew bills in his own name on the house at <em>Liverpool, </em>which were regularly accepted and paid until they stopped payment ,\u2022 when they stopped, one of the bills had been accepted, the others had not been presented. Lord <em>Ellenborough </em>distinguished the case from that of <em>Emly </em>v. <em>Lye, </em>15 East 7. the circumstances proving a <em>loan </em>rather than a <em>discount; </em>and concluded, that though he could not say the partners were jointly liable on the <em>unaccepted bills, </em>they were jointly liable for the amount, as for money lent, or money had and received. <em>Collyer, </em>commenting on the case, (p. 269.) says that the case seems to have been of the same nature and conducted by nearly the same parties as those in <em>The So. Carolina Bank </em>v. <em>Case; </em>and that, on the authority of that case, the plaintiffs might have recovered against the defendants as'drawers of the bills, supposing the name of <em>J. B. Clough </em>to have been in fact the <em>name of the firm </em>for the purposes of the business in <em>America. </em>The same proposition is maintained by judge <em>Story </em>in <em>U. States Bank </em>v. <em>Binney, </em>5 Mason 176. 189. The partnership was carried on in the name of <em>John Winship ; </em>he endorsed notes in his own <em>name; </em>and in an action against the firm on these notes, it was held, that the plaintiffs must shew, either directly or by implication, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>Hi at the notes were offered by <em>Winship </em>as notes binding the firm, and not merely himself personally; or that the discount was made for the benefit, or in the course of business of the firm. In the case before us, the plaintiff has not shewn that the partnership of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp </em>co. did business under the name of <em>W. Davidson </em>in <em>Condon </em>; and therefore the defendants cannot, according to these authorities, be held liable on the bill drawn by <em>*Smithson </em>on <em>Davidson, </em>and accepted by him, by force of the bill itself, unless it appears upon the face of the bill, to have been accepted in the name of the firm.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Bills of exchange, from their great utility in carrying on the mercantile transactions of the world, have been highly favoured: and, generally, all the parties are liable to the <em>bona fide </em>holder, who has given value for it before it became due. Such being the binding effect of the contract, no person can be considered as a party unless his name, or the name of the firm of which ho is a partner, appear on some part of it. Chitty on Bills 30. What is there on the face of this bill to charge the partnership of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. ? </em>It is drawn on <em>W. Davidson, </em>and accepted by him. I have endeavoured to shew, that this was not the name of the <em>firm </em>in <em>England: </em>and if that has been established, or rather, if it has not been shewn, on the contrary, that the acceptance made by <em>Davidson </em>was made in the character of the firm, and not as an individual, the authorities are clear, that an action cannot be supported against the firm on the <em>bill. </em>Wherever a person draws, accepts, or endorses for himself and partners, it is laid down that he should express, that he does so for himself and partners, or subscribe their names, or the name of the firm; and that otherwise, it will not bind the partners. Chitty on Bills 66. And this has been the settled and uniform doctrine from the earliest cases down to the present day. So strict is the rule, that if a person advances money to the firm, and takes the separate bill of the partner, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>cannot sue the firm on that security, although he may possibly succeed in an action against the firm for money advanced. On the bill the contract is several, and the individual partner alone can be sued upon it. Collyer <em>262. Siffkin </em>v. <em>Walker, 2 </em>Camp. 308. In <em>Emly </em>v. <em>Lye, 15 </em>East 7. <em>George Lye </em>and <em>E. L. Lye </em>were partners, and in the habit of drawing bills, some in the name of the firm, some by one partner, others by the <em>other; they were </em>discounted by <em>Burrough </em>at various times, without distinction between the bills, he conceiving that they were all drawn on partnership account; and the proceeds were applied to the partnership accounts: lord <em>Ellmborough </em>held, that the first counts in the declaration (on the bills themselves) were properly abandoned; for, unquestionably, on a bill drawn by one only, it cannot be allowed to supply by intendment the names of others, in order to charge them; that if the plaintiffs, therefore, rested their claim upon the <em>bills, </em>they should confine it to the drawer: and the court, treating the negotiation as a discount, not a loan, held that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover on the money counts. And in the argument here, it has been contended, that that was the only point decided. But the quotation given shews that the court held, that the partners could not be rendered liable on the <em>bills; </em>and that is the question of which we are now treating.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">It was contended, that this bill shews on its face, that it was drawn on account of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>that it calls on <em>Davidson </em>a partner to pay on account of that firm, and he has accepted generally; and that, as a general acceptance must be construed to be an acceptance according to the terms of the bill, therefore this acceptance, being made by a partner having authority to bind the firm, must be treated as an acceptance by the firm. The general proposition may be true; but it seems to me, the consequence deduced does not necessarily follow. To suppose so, we must first concede, that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>terms, \u201c on account of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co.\u201d </em>make it the 7 bill of that firm. If <em>Davidson </em>were not a partner, would such an acceptance bind the firm ? That will not be pretended. Is it not equally clear, that a creditor of the firm may take a separate security from one of the partners for the joint liability ? This is established by the case of <em>Emily </em>v. Lye, and numerous others. How then is the holder to know, from the face of such an instrument, whether it was accepted by a stranger on account of the firm, or by the partner, on his individual account ? He sees the bill directed to an individual, who has accepted ; he knows that he is bound, and takes it upon the faith of his individual responsibility; can he then, by extrinsic testimony, be driven to resort to the social effects ? This would be to change the contract which the bill and acceptance import, by evidence <em>aliunde, </em>and so far to impair the general credit of the security. The cases relied on to support the argument, are cases in which the bill was drawn on or accepted by the firm. Thus in <em>Mason </em>v. <em>T. Rumsey sen. &amp; T. Rumsey jun. </em>1 Camp. 384. (a leading case) the bill was drawn on messrs. <em>Rumsey Sf co. </em>and being shewn to <em>T. Rumsey junior, </em>he wrote across it, <em>\u201c </em>accepted, <em>T. Rumsey junior.\u201d </em>The action was against both, but was defended by <em>T. Rumsey junior </em>alone, who contended, that he was not liable as a joint acceptor: that if a bill be drawn upon a firm, it must be accepted in the name of the firm or for the firm. The court held otherwise: that such an acceptance does not indeed prove a partnership ; hut if the defendants were partners, they are both bound by it: that for this purpose, the word <em>accepted, </em>if written on the bill, would have been enough; for if a bill is drawn on a <em>firm, </em>and accepted by <em>one of the partners, </em>he must be understood to exercise his power to bind his copartners, and to accept the bill according to the terms in which it is drawn. In that case, the liability resulted from the fact, that the bill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>was drawn on the firm. So drawn, it shewed upon its ^ace&gt; an intenti\u00b0n to charge the firm; the terms imported a liability of the firm, and an intention to look to the finn for <em>satisfaction; </em>and being accepted by a partner having authority to bind them, it was an admission of the right to charge the firm, and an agreement to pay according to the terms of the demand. But in the case before us, the words used do not import such an intention, or establish such a charge. In the supposed case of an acceptance by a stranger, it would not create a charge; and if the acceptance be by a partner, it does not follow that he may not have been furnished with funds; and that fact being known to the drawer, he may have intended to taire a separate security for the joint debt. The words \u201c on account of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co.\u201d </em>might have been inserted merely to designate, for the benefit of the acceptor, the account on which he pays. <em>Wells </em>v. <em>Masterman, </em>2 Esp. Rep. 731. is like the case of <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Rumseys: </em>the bill was drawn on the firm, and accepted by one partner. See also <em>Dolman </em>v. Orchard, 2 Car. &amp; Payne 104. 12 Eng. C. L. R. 47. The case of <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Ashby, </em>2 Barn. &amp; Adolph. 23. 22 Eng. C. L. R. 17. proceeds upon the same principle. There, persons as partners carried on business under the style of <em>Ashby Sp co.; </em>one withdrew; and the business was afterwards carried on under the name of <em>Ashby &amp; Rowland; Shaw </em>afterwards entered the firm, as a dormant partner, but no change was made in its name; a bill was drawn on the firm of <em>Ashby &amp; co. </em>which firm had ceased to exist; and it was accepted by <em>Ashby &amp; Rowland: </em>the court held that notwithstanding the variance between the direction and the acceptance, the three partners constituting the firm of <em>Ashby &amp; Rowland </em>were bound. And this would seem to be perfectly clear; for no matter to whom the bill was addressed, or whether addressed at all, one partner having a right to bind the firm, when he acts in the name of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the firm, having accepted in the name of the firm, all were liable.</p>\n<p id=\"ARx\">It is argued, that this is a suit by the drawer against , _ , iii' the acceptor, and that as between them, the drawer might recover; though, if the plaintiff were endorsee,. it might be otherwise. The drawer might recover by force of the contract, if made with the firm; but not, I conceive, upon the <em>bill. </em>If it is a separate security taken from one partner, he alone could be sued on it. Upon the bill, the plaintiff whether drawee, payee or endorsee, can only charge the persons appearing on the face of it to be parties. Though as between the drawer and acceptor, the former may have a legal remedy against the firm by going to the original consideration, and shewing that the contract was made with the firm, he will then recover for money lent, or had and received, or for the goods sold.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">That the expression in this bill \u201c on account of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp </em>co.\u201d cannot be so construed as to convert the bill into a partnership security, when accepted by one partner, is, I think, shewn by the case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>2 Stra. 955. which occurred at an early period, and has never, that I can discover, been questioned or overruled. It was the case of an <em>agent; </em>and it decides, that he should accept or endorse in the name of his principal, or state in writing he accepts as agent. The plaintiff was endorsee of a bill drawn on defendant, in these words: \u201cAt thirty days sight, pay to <em>J. S. </em>or order \u00a3 200. value received of him, and place the same to account of the <em>York Buildings company, </em>as <em>per </em>advice from <em>C. </em>Mildmay.\u201d Addressed \u201c To mr. <em>H. Bishop </em>cashier of the <em>York Buildings Co. </em>at their house in <em>Winchester street </em>London.\u201d \u201cAccepted <em>per H. </em>Bishop.\u201d At the trial <em>Bishop, </em>against whom the action was brought on his acceptance, proved that the letter of advice was addressed to the company; and the bill having been brought to their house, he was ordered to accept it. A <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>verdict was found for the plaintiff under the direction of the judge; and on a motion for a new trial, the court held the direction right, stating that the hill on its face imported to he drawn on the defendant; it was accePte^ generally and not as agent; and this being an action by the endorsee it would be of dangerous consequence to admit evidence of extrinsic circumstances, arising from the letter of advice: that a bill of exchange was a contract by the custom of merchants, and the whole of that contract must appear in writing; that here, there was nothing in writing to bind the company, <em>nor could any action be maintained against them on the bill.\" Leadbitter </em>v. Farrow, 5 Maul. &amp; Selw. 349. is to the same effect. These cases, as to the point under consideration, are stronger than the cases before us. In <em>Thomas </em>v. Bishop, the bill was drawn upon the defendant as cashier &amp;c. he was directed to place it to the account of the company, and it was directed to him at the house of the company. The evidence shewed, that it was drawn in pursuance of a letter of advice to the company, and accepted by their order. The intention to draw on the company was more fully indicated than in the bill before us, and there was every reason to presume, from the face of the bill, that the party intended to accept according to the terms in which it was drawn, and that upon proof of his agency his acceptance would have been the act of the company. The <em>company </em>was held, however, <em>not to be liable on the bill ; </em>which could not have been, if the words <em>\u201c on account of the company,\" </em>would constitute it the bill of the company, when accepted by an agent having authority to bind them.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">It seems to me, therefore, upon a review of the authorities, that the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>were not bound by this acceptance of <em>Davidson ; </em>that it is to be treated as his individual acceptance ; and in the absence of proof, that this house transacted business in the name <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>of <em>W. Davidson </em>in <em>London, </em>his acceptance in that name does not bind the house, and that no action could be maintained on the <em>bill </em>against the <em>firm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-4\">It remains to enquire, whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover for the goods for which the bill is said to have been drawn and accepted. On this point, he has adduced no proof. The bill is drawn on the 18th August 1817, at two months, for \u00a31073. 12. sterling. The plaintiff says, that, in that year, he sold the goods, and drew the bill. In support of this allegation he has adduced no evidence: he is compelled to resort to the answer. The parties agreed, that the answer might be taken as a deposition subject to all just exceptions; and it is now contended by the appellee\u2019s counsel, that the witness was incompetent, and that his answer cannot be read as a deposition. If he is correct, his case is destitute of all support. For this is a proceeding against the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>which has since been dissolved, and the answer of the executor of one of the partners, would not be evidence against the other defendants. The proceeding is against absentees, but the court, as against them, cannot take the bill as <em>confessed </em>without proof. The statute authorizes the court, as against absentees, to hear the cause upon such proof as the plaintiff may adduce ; but some proof is necessary. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 123. $ 2. p. 475. Without the answer, there is nothing to shew that any goods were ever received by the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>But passing that objection, and looking to the answer, we must take it altogether, and what does it disclose touching this question ? It denies that any goods were received in 1817, but admits, that in 1816, goods to the amount of \u00a31106. 15. 6. sterling, put up by <em>Joshua Smithson </em>were shipped by <em>Davidson </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>These goods, it is contended, were the same for which the bill was drawn, and that the allegation that they were sold in 1817 must have been the mistake of coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>sel. That may be so. Yet the amount is different, and the bill said to have been drawn and accepted in payment, is dated in August 1817. The goods admitted to have been shipped by <em>Davidson, </em>were shipped in 1816, a^out ei\u00a7ht months before the date of the bill (at the shortest calculation). What was the state of the transactions between these parties during this interval, supposing the goods to have been the same ? Were they purchased for and charged to the firm ? If so, why. is not an account exhibited and proof adduced ? The answer further avers that <em>Cunningham </em>understood and believed, that <em>Davidson </em>transacted business on his individual account. Was this such a transaction? And when <em>Davidson </em>was in failing circumstances, was this bill drawn to charge the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>with his individual debt ? The plaintiff had it in his power to throw light on these transactions, but he has left us in the dark. There is another fact detailed in the answer which has an important bearing, as part of the <em>res gesta. </em>The goods shipped in 1816 were charged <em>by Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>to themselves, and to the credit of <em>Davidson </em>in account with him. Would this have been done, if the firm had been advised of a joint purchase, for which a bill was outstanding against them ? It is said, that this is the usual mode of entries in the books of partners. I imagine that is a mistake. Such a mode of entry would subject the firm to great inconvenience. Upon a dissolution or settlement of the partnership accounts, the partner to whose credit such an entry appeared, would get credit for the amount, and the firm might thereafter be compelled to pay the creditor. If the partner had been charged with funds, he would be entitled to a credit for the goods. But where the firm was pledged for the payment of the debt, the regular mode would seem to be, to charge the firm with the merchandise, and give it credit for the debts when paid. If, therefore, the firm, in this case, had been ad<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>vised, that it was held responsible for the price of the goods, it cannot be supposed they would have given <em>Davidson </em>credit for the amount; thereby in effect paying the price of them. A fraudulent representation by <em>Davidson </em>could not, it is true, affect the claims of the fair creditor of the firm. But here we are driven by the failure of the plaintiff to furnish the proof Avhich ho might have adduced if the facts Avere as he alleges, to gather our information of these transactions from the acts of the firm, as disclosed by the answer: and these acts, so far from sheAving a joint purchase, tend to establish a separate contract with <em>Davidson, </em>to Avhorn the firm has entered credit, and that at a period, when the transactions Avere recent, and there could have been no motive then existing to misrepresent or make false entries. The credit entered on the bill is relied on as a subsequent admission of the liability of the firm. It does not appear by Avhorn the bill was furnished which was credited: if by <em>Davidson, </em>it Avould strengthen the presumption, that this Avas an individual transaction; and if by the firm, nothing would have been easier than to have adduced proof of the fact. Upon the whole, it seems to me the plaintiff has failed entirely in making out this branch of Ihe case. And the admissions of the answer taking it altogether tend to establish, that this was an individual transaction between <em>Davidson </em>and the plaintiff for which the firm Avas never responsible. I think the bill should have been dismissed.</p>\n<author id=\"b73-4\">Brooke, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AJf\">After the able opinion of judge <em>Allen, </em>in which I entirely concur, I shall not say as much as otherwise I should have said in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">I suppose, that a bill drawn by <em>A. </em>on <em>B. </em>on account of <em>C. </em>and accepted by <em>B. </em>makes <em>B. </em>only, not <em>C. </em>the debtor of <em>A. </em>One mercantile firm may accept a bill on account of another firm, without making the latter debtor to the drawer of the bill, though it may become debtor to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>accepting firm when it pays the bill. Then let us see how the parties stood upon the bill before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">We find, on examination of the record, that the bill drawn by <em>Smithson, </em>on <em>W. Davidson, Davidson\u2019s </em>acceptance of it, and the statements endorsed on it is the only evidence, except the answer of the defendant <em>Cunningham. </em>The plaintiff is indebted to the answer alone for the fact, so essential to his case, that <em>Davidson </em>was a partner in the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co., </em>a fact, without which there is nothing in the record to sustain his claim. But the answer does not stop there : it is responsive to other allegations of the bill, and it is not to be garbled. It states, that <em>Davidson </em>was a partner of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>and resided at <em>London, </em>but that the defendant understood and believed, that <em>Davidson </em>carried on a separate business of his own at <em>London, </em>in which <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co., </em>whose business was transacted at <em>Richmond, </em>had no concern. There is no evidence to contradict this statement, and no evidence that there was any branch of the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>established at <em>London. </em>It is said, that the answer, in this respect, is afinmative, and the facts affirmatively alleged ought to be proved by other evidence. It is generally true, that affirmative matter alleged in an answer, must be proved: but here, the answer is responsive to the claim set up in the bill, to which the defendant was required to answer, and it must be taken to be true, unless it is contradicted by proof; and if the fact stated had not been true, it might easily have been disproved. Upon this state of the evidence in the record, let <em>Smithson\u2019s </em>pretensions be examined.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-10\">It is admitted that the acceptance of a bill by a partner of a firm, will bind the firm, if the bill be drawn on the firm, or he accepts it in the name of the firm: all the cases shew that. But this bill was not drawn on the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>but on <em>Davidson, </em>in his individual character; and he accepted it by writing his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>own name across it, and not as a partner of Dicks, <em>Moore &amp; co. </em>It was his individual acceptance. The credit of a bill of exchange must appear on its face, and is not to be sustained, much less altered, by extrinsic evidence. An endorsee of this bill would have had no claim against <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co., </em>nor can the drawer have any claim upon that house, by force of the bill itself. The evidence furnished by the endorsement of the credit on the bill, does not help the case: on the contrary, its excites suspicion, and certainly leaves something to be explained, which is very material. It is a credit of \u00a3500. sterling, for a bill on <em>Jones, Loyd Sp co. </em>received as late as February 1819, but it is not stated by whom that bill was drawn, or by whom it was remitted to <em>Smithson, </em>leaving it doubtful whether it was not drawn or remitted by <em>Davidson, </em>in part discharge of his acceptance of the bill in question, of August 1817. There is not a shadow of evidence, that it was drawn or remitted by <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>or by any body authorized by them. If <em>Smithson, </em>at the time, had considered <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>bound by the bill, or by <em>Davidsons </em>acceptance of it, it had been enough in endorsing the credit, to have stated that the bill of <em>Jones, Loyd &amp; co. </em>was received \u201c on account of the within bill,\u201d without taking the pains to add, that the credit was given \u201con account of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co.\"</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">Upon the whole, I think it very clear, that <em>S'rmthson\u2019s </em>claim against <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>cannot be sustained upon the bill itself. None of the cases cited at the bar apply exactly to this, but that of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>which, in principle, seems directly in point. In that case, the bill was in these words: \u201cAt thirty days sight, pay to <em>J. S. </em>or order \u00a3 200. value received, and place the same to account of <em>The York Buildings company, </em>as <em>per </em>advice from <em>C. Mildmay.\" </em>It was addressed, \u201c To rnr. <em>H. Bishop, </em>cashier of <em>The York Buildings convpany, </em>at &amp;c.\u201d And the acceptance was, \u201c Accepted <em>per </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number><em>H. </em>Bishop,\u201d without addition of his character of cashier. acti\u00b0ia was brought by <em>Thomas, </em>an endorsee, against <em>Bishop </em>in his individual character. He proved that the letter of advice, accompanying the bill, was addressed to <em>^ie Buildings company, </em>and that the bill being brought to then house, he was ordered to accept it, which he did in the same manner in which he had accepted other bills. And his defence was, that <em>The York Buildings company, </em>and not himself individually, was bound by the acceptance. The court held, that <em>Bishop </em>was, and that the company was not, bound by his acceptance in his individual name. Now, surely, the words in the body of that bill, \u201cplace the same to the account of <em>The York Buildings </em>company,\u201d were as strong to make that company parties to the bill, as the words in the bill before us, \u201con account of <em>Dicks, Moore Sf co.\u201d </em>are to make them parties to this bill, and indeed much stronger. And there, too, the bill was addressed to <em>Bishop as cashier of the company ; </em>the letter of advice was addressed to the company; and <em>Bishop </em>accepted by its orders: here, the bill was addressed to <em>Davidson </em>individually, and was accordingly accepted by him in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">On the claim against <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>viewed independently of the bill, I shall say a very few words. The only proof is furnished by the answer of the defendant <em>Cunningham: </em>that it appeared, by the books of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>that goods <em>put up by Snvithson </em>were shipped by <em>Davidson </em>to them (not in 1817 when the bill was drawn, but) in 1816, which goods amounted to \u00a31106. 15. 6. sterling (the bill was for \u00a31073. 12. 0.) and that the goods received in 1816, were charged by <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>to themselves, and to the credit of <em>Davidson, </em>in their account with him. Now, not to mention the discrepancy in sum and date, and taking the goods received by <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>to be the same goods for the price of which <em>Smithson's </em>bill on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number><em>Davidson </em>was drawn, the circumstances strengthen the conclusion deducible from <em>Smithson\u2019s </em>bill drawn on <em>Davidson </em>and accepted by him individually, that the goods for the price of which the bill was drawn, were sold to <em>Davidson </em>individually, and by him sent to <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>to be charged to the house, and credited to <em>Davidson ; </em>which was accordingly done.</p>\n<author id=\"b77-6\">Tucker, <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"A1k\">Though this case has obviously been very badly prepared, and some obscurity rests on certain facts which might have been easily ascertained, yet I think there is enough in the record to sustain the plaintiff\u2019s demand against the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>of <em>Richmond.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">It is admitted, on all hands, that <em>W. Davidson </em>of <em>London </em>was a partner of that house and that he resided at <em>London. Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>appear to have been importing merchants; and the natural course of business was to establish a house in the great mart with which their trade was carried on. <em>Davidson </em>was at <em>London </em>to do the business there. If he was there doing business for and on account of the firm, he constituted a branch of the house there; and accounts were <em>of </em>course opened between the house in <em>London </em>and the house in <em>Virginia, </em>as is usual in such cases. The books of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>as <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>answer states, shew that, in the year 1816, goods to the amount of \u00a3 1106. 15. 6. <em>put up by Joshua Smithson </em>were shipped by <em>Davidson </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>This is a pregnant fact. It shews beyond question, that the partner at <em>London </em>procured and shipped for the house at <em>Richmond, </em>the goods required for their business here; and thus we see that the firm had a house in each of these cities. It is said, indeed, that <em>Davidson </em>carried on business on his separate account. But this is not proved; for <em>Cunningham </em>only says he <em>understood </em>and believes that he did. Still less is there any denial of his carrying on business <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>at <em>London </em>for the firm. The entry abovementioned proves, that he did procure <em>from Smithson, </em>and ship to them, a quantity of goods. The presumption is, unless the contrary be proved, that this was done by him as partner. Of what advantage was it to the firm, to send a partner to <em>London </em>for the purpose of purchasmg then-supplies, if they were to be purchased by him on his individual account, and the firm to be charged with an advance for his particular benefit ? It could be none, and we must, therefore, in the absence of proof to the contrary, presume, that the transactions between <em>Davidson </em>and the house at <em>Richmond, </em>were not individual but partnership transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">That the goods for which the bill of <em>Smithson </em>was drawn, were the same goods which are credited on the books of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>I think may fairly be presumed. It is said, indeed, that the bill alleges the goods to have been furnished in 1817 when the bill was drawn. But this was an inadvertence doubtless of the counsel. The statements of a bill are not, like those of an answer, binding upon the party. Peake\u2019s Ev. 263. And still less should they be so considered, where the party resides in a foreign land, and the bill is filed by counsel here. The statement of the bill then weighs but little against the established facts here. That <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>received a parcel of goods amounting to \u00a31106. 15. 6. appears by their books: that they received them from <em>Davidson </em>also appears: that they were put up by <em>Smithson </em>is also proved by the books themselves, from which <em>Cunningham </em>derived the information that they were so <em>put up by him. </em>Here then are goods to the amount of \u00a31106. 15. 6. put up by <em>Smithson </em>in 1816, and shipped by <em>Davidson </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>in the same year, and the bill is drawn for \u00a31073. 12. 0. in 1817. Can there be a reasonable doubt, that those were the same goods, when neither <em>Smithson </em>nor the defendants pretend, that there was more than one parcel of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>goods sent by him from <em>Halifax </em>through <em>Davidson </em>of <em>London </em>to <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>of <em>Richmond ? </em>It is believed not. It is, therefore, taken as sufficiently proved, that this bill was drawn for the very goods credited on the books of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>to the firm in <em>London; </em>the difference between the original cost (\u00a31073. 12. 0.) and the sum credited (\u00a31106. 15. 6.) arising only from the incidental charges of receiving and forwarding.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">It is argued, that because the firm at <em>Richmond </em>charged themselves and credited <em>Davidson </em>with the amount of the goods, they must be supposed to have been furnished on his individual account. But this inference is not a necessary one, since if the business of the firm was carried on at <em>London </em>in the name of <em>Davidson </em>alone, the accounts with him as constituting that firm, would have been opened with him in that name alone. This is the usual course of partnership business. The circumstance, therefore, proves nothing; and the rather, as the parties in the possession of the books and papers, have not brought forward the evidences, which must have been ample, if the advance <em>was </em>an individual transaction, of that fact. It is further to be remarked, that the <em>res gesta </em>furnishes the strongest presumption of the contrary. <em>Smithson of Halifax </em>puts up goods for <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co., </em>with whom he has no direct correspondence, and they are sent to them through <em>Davidson </em>of <em>London. </em>He draws his bill upon <em>Davidson </em>on account of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>of <em>Richmond, </em>to whom he looked, as the parties to whom he had advanced his goods. How came he to know them in the transaction, if the goods had not been sent originally with the understanding that they were for them ? <em>Davidson </em>also, when they are received, forwards them to the firm in <em>Richmond, </em>without breaking them up, I presume, as <em>Cunningham </em>says that goods <em>put up by Smithson </em>were shipped by <em>Davidson </em>&amp;c. Moreover, he accepts the bill drawn on him <em>for their account. </em>And thus, through the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>whole transaction, the parties appear to have considered , . . it a partnership concern.</p>\n<p id=\"ARV\">If, then, we look to the acts of <em>Smithson </em>on the one hand, and of <em>Davidson </em>on the other, the bill was a partners^P contract, perfectly fair and in the ordinary course of business. The imputations of fraud on either of them are gratuitous; particularly as to <em>Smithson, </em>who has evidently sold goods to <em>Davidson, </em>for the firm of which he was a member, and drew upon him accordingly in that character. And as the question here is not between an endorsee and the acceptor, but between the original parties to the contract, one of whom had a perfect right to bind his partners, we must hold them to be so bound, if such ivas the intention of the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Such seems to be the conclusion to Avhich Ave must arrive, if Ave consider the case upon principles of reason and good sense, Avithout resorting to the adjudications upon bills of exchange. And as might be expected, these but confirm our deductions. The principles which govern the law of bills of exchange in relation to this subject, are indeed familiar. The poAver of one partner to bind the firm by his drawing or acceptance, and the necessity, in order to bind a party, that his name should appear upon the bill, are well understood. It seems at one time, too, to have been supposed, that Avhen a person endorses or accepts for himself and his partner, he should <em>always </em>express, that he does so for himself and partner, or subscribe both the names, or the names of the firm, and that otherwise it will not bind the firm. Chitty on Bills 51. citing <em>Pinkney </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>1 Salk. 126. and other cases. But it has been determined in <em>England, </em>more than thirty years ago, that where a bill is drawn upon a firm, and accepted by one partner in his oavii name only, it will bind the firm. <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Rumseys, </em>1 Camp. 384. And this seems but reasonable, since as he has the power, and is called upon to exercise it, the act of writing his acceptance on the bill, may fairly be regarded as done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>in execution of that power. Nor can the payee or any future holder of the bill, be embarrassed by the form of the acceptance ; for the party being called upon to pay in his social character, must be understood to promise payment in the character in which it is demanded, and not in his individual character.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">If this principle be correct, we have only to see whether the case before us falls within it. If, as I have supposed, <em>Davidson </em>carried on the business of the social house at <em>London </em>in his own name, then the case is clear; for the draft is upon him in that name, and he accepts in the same name; and the body of the bill distinctly shews, that the draft was \u201c on account of the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co.\u201d </em>But if it be not sufficiently proved, that the firm in <em>London </em>was under <em>Davidson\u2019s </em>name alone, still I think the same result would follow. For the bill calls on one of the partners of the firm, to pay the contents \u201c on account of the firm,\u201d and he accepts ; that is, he agrees to do that which he is called upon to do, to pay the contents of the bill on account of the firm of which he was a partner. He is called upon to pay, not individually, but for account of the <em>firm; </em>and he accepts accordingly, not individually, but as a member of the firm. If he had said, <em>\u201c </em>accepted on account of the firm, <em>W. Davidson,\u201d </em>there could have been no <em>doubt </em>And yet that is precisely the character and effect of the actual acceptance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">The case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>2 Stra. 955. is very different from this. 1. That was the case of an agent, the cashier of a company, and this the case of a partner: an agent must always contract in the name of his principal ; a partner can bind his copartners by any act which has reference to the partnership, though not done in the name of the firm. 2. In this case, the bill is drawn by <em>Smithson, </em>calling on <em>Davidson </em>to pay on <em>account </em>of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>In the case of <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Bishop, </em>the bill was directed to <em>Bishop, </em>cashier of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number><em>The York Buildings company, </em>who was directed to <em>place the same to account </em>of the company; he was not called on to <em>accept </em>on their account. 3. <em>Bishop </em>accepted in his own name only, without assuming his official character, and therefore was personally hound: here <em>Davidson </em>accepts, generally, a hill drawn on him <em>on account of the firm, </em>and that acceptance required no express declaration that it was made for himself and partners. \u2022 And lastly, in that case, the action was by an endorsee ; and the court expressly said, \u201c It might have been otherwise, had the action been by <em>J. S. </em>(the payee) who was privy to the transaction, and it had appeared he tendered the bill as a bill on the company. Here, the action is by the drawer, the original party to the bill. In the case before us, it is very possible that an endorsee, not privy to the bill, might have had his action either against the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>or against <em>Davidson, </em>individually; against the firm, because it was a social transaction; or against him individually, because the acceptance was in his own name, and an endorsee might therefore fairly take it to bind him separately. The case of <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>1 Barn. &amp; Cress. 407. 8 Eng. C. L. R. 112. furnishes an instance of this. There <em>TV. Smith </em>gave a note thus: \u201c I promise to pay the bearer on demand \u00a31. value received. For <em>W. Smith, W. P. Smith </em>and <em>TV. R. Taylor; W. Smith.\u201d </em>An action against <em>W. Smith, </em>individually, was brought and sustained ; but the court clearly intimated, that a suit might also have been sustained against the partners for whom he signed; saying, \u201c there are many cases, where a party entering into a contract in his own name, may be sued, or those for whom he contracts maybe sued, &amp;c.\u201d Admitting, therefore, that an endorsee might have looked to <em>Davidson </em>individually, it will by no means follow, that the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>was not responsible upon his acceptance on their account.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>Upon the whole, therefore, I am of opinion, that the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>were hound by the acceptance of <em>Davidson </em>their partner; but my brethren are of a different opinion on that point; and it is unnecessary I should consider any other matter in the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">The decree of this court reversed that of the circuit superior court, with costs, and dismissed the bill as to <em>Cunningham, </em>the executor of <em>Moore, </em>and as to <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>leaving the plaintiff at liberty to proceed against <em>Davidson </em>alone; for which purpose, the case was remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">After the decree was pronounced, the appellee\u2019s counsel, by way of motion for a rehearing, submitted, that the decree ought to be set aside, or at least ought to be modified, on the following grounds:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">1. That, it appeared, from the answer of <em>Cunningham, </em>that <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate was indebted to <em>W. Davidson, </em>or to the firms of which he was a partner, in two sums of \u00a3 213. 7. 0. and \u00a3 520. 8. 5. sterling, with long arrears of interest; and it appeared by the commissioner\u2019s report, that <em>Robertson and wife </em>had objected to the charge of those two sums to <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate, in <em>Cunningham\u2019s </em>accounts of administration, on the ground that <em>Davidson </em>was largely a debtor, and <em>Moore </em>a creditor, of the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>Therefore, the partnership accounts of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>ought to be settled, in order to ascertain whether any and what balance was due from <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>or from the estate of <em>Moore </em>to <em>Davidson ; </em>and if any such balance should be found due to him, the same should be applied to the satisfaction of <em>Smithson\u2019s </em>claim; since it was agreed on all hands, and admitted, both in the opinions of this court and in its decree, that <em>Davidson </em>was liable for the full amount of that claim. For the purpose of having these accounts settled, the executor of <em>Moore, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>and the surviving partners of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>were necessary parties. But the decree of this court dis-missed those parties entirely from the cause, and so preeluded the settlement of any such accounts. The counse^ therefore submitted, that the decree ought to be so altered, as to retain those parties before the cotut.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">2. That as the circuit superior court had held the proof adduced by <em>Smithson </em>of his claim against the house of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. </em>sufficient to establish the claim, and as the only ground on which this cotut reversed the decree, was that the proof was not sufficient for the purpose; this court, instead of proceeding to a final decree which would be a bar to the claim, ought to remand the cause, with directions that it should be opened, in order to receive such proofs as <em>Simthson </em>should be able to adduce to establish the liability of <em>Dicks, Moore &amp; co. If </em>the proof now in the cause was insufficient to ascertain the liability of the partnership so as to warrant a decree against the partners, enough appeared to shew, that this was <em>probably </em>a partnership debt; and <em>Smithson </em>ought to have an opportunity of producing additional evidence, if he can. They cited <em>Cropper </em>v. <em>Burtons, 5 </em>Leigh 426. and <em>Beverley </em>v. <em>Ellis &amp; Allan, </em>1 Rand. 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">3. The cause was not properly matured for hearing in the circuit superior court. <em>For the </em>absent defendants <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick, </em>for aught that appeared, were not regularly convented before the court. There was no proof of the publication of the order calling them before the court: there was only the printer\u2019s certificate of the publication, not verified by his oath. The decree ought to be reversed for that cause, and the case sent back for regular proceedings. As no decree <em>against </em>those parties could have bound them, so no decree could properly be pronounced <em>for </em>them.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">4. Supposing <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick </em>to have been duly con-vented before the court of chancery, they were both par-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>tics in this court. But the counsel offered proof, that <em>N. Dick </em>was dead before the hearing of the cause here. The decree should, therefore, be set aside, in order that . . the appeal might be revived against the representatives of <em>N. Dick, </em>and the cause then heard, with all proper parties before the court.</p>\n<author id=\"b85-8\">Allen, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AQl\">This case was very elaborately argued, and fully considered. Subsequent reflection has tended to confirm me in the correctness of the conclusion at which the majority of the court arrived. Since the decision was pronounced the appellee has asked for a rehearing, or if that could not be granted, for certain modifications of the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The first ground assigned is that as the bill was dismissed as to <em>Cunningham </em>and <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick </em>and the cause remanded for further proceedings against <em>Davidson, </em>and as it appears that <em>Davidson </em>or the firm of which he is a member, is a creditor of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate, an account cannot be settled with the firm of <em>Dicks, Moore Sp co. </em>if the bill is dismissed as to <em>Moore\u2019s </em>representative and <em>N. </em>and <em>J. Dick. </em>The bill was filed to charge the firm in its social character alone. The plaintiff did not seek to charge <em>Davidson </em>individually, or <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate, or the firm, as a debtor or debtors of <em>Davidson. </em>This court has decided, that the firm was not responsible, but gave the plaintiff leave to proceed against <em>Davidson. </em>If he chooses to amend his bill, and pursue <em>Davidson </em>alone, and in the progress of the cause establishes his claim against him, and shews that others are his debtors, nothing in the decree rendered will prevent his making them defendants, and charging them on this ground. But the possibility of such a result cannot deprive the defendants of the benefit of the decree of the court upon the case as the parties have chosen to submit it.</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>The second ground requires a reconsideration of the whole merits. They have already been discussed and decided. The whole issue was the liability of the firm. The plaintiff was, by the whole tenor of the answer, to ^ Pro\u00b0f every allegation tending to establish that liability. To remand the cause for further evidence, after a controversy so long protracted, upon the mere suggestion of counsel that such evidence may be in existence, and that too upon the sole point in controversy in the cause, would be to declare that chancery causes, already oppressive for delays, were henceforth to be interminable. The cases cited seem to me to have no application, and to have been decided upon the peculiar circumstances attending them. In <em>Cropper </em>v. <em>Burton, </em>the plaintiff had assigned a <em>debt; </em>his debtor proving insolvent; he satisfied his assignee, and filed a bill to set aside a fraudulent conveyance of the debtor. There Avas a general denial by infants, and strictly speaking the plaintiff Avas bound to prove his payment by him to his assignee. The debt, hoAvever, was not disputed; it had been secured by a mortgage, upon which a decree of foreclosure had been rendered, and the claim in part satisfied. The real subject in controversy was whether the conveyances were fraudulent ? The coimty court held they Avere; and upon an appeal, the chancellor reversed the decree and dismissed the bill because there was no proof of the payment by the assignor to the assignee. This court concurring Avith the chancellor, that the decree of the county court was erroneous in the absence of such proof, held it was too rigorous to dismiss the bill under such circumstances. The objection to the decree though fatal, was still one likely to have been overlooked. The money Avas due ; the plaintiff or his assignee Avas entitled to maintain the suit; and so far as the defendants were concerned it must have been immaterial Avhich recovered. Yet even in that case, judge <em>Carr </em>doubted the propriety of sending the cause back; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>remarking that it would not seem to be the business of the courts to exercise this kind of guardianship over persons <em>sui juris </em>and able to take care of themselves. In <em>Beverley y. Bilis Sf </em>Allan, the appellees had tioned the court for another hearing, alleging they could produce evidence that the contract between <em>Carter Beverley </em>and the appellant had been rescinded, and offering an excuse for not adducing the evidence sooner. The court satisfied that the appellees were entitled to recover upon the case as then made, refused the rehearing. This court held, that as the question itself upon which the case turned, was <em>res </em>integra, it would be hard on the appellees, having a decree in their favour, to deprive them of their other defence; and therefore reversed the decree because the chancellor had refused to rehear the cause. This case is totally different from either of those. Here there was no petition for rehearing. The question was one depending on the proofs. The plaintiff alleged a partnership liability; it was denied ; and he was bound to sustain his allegations. He has chosen to rest his case upon the proofs in the record, and he must abide by them.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">Another objection which the appellee now takes to his own decree, is that he obtained it improperly without due proof of publication against the absent defendants ; that the certificate of the printer was not under oath. There was no exception to the certificate in the court below; and the record sets out, that it appeared to the court the plaintiff had proceeded in the manner prescribed by law. It seems to me this would have been a sufficient answer to an objection to the decree on that ground, if made by the appellant; much more when the appellee alleges it as an error in his own proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The last objection is, that <em>N. Dick </em>is dead. His death has not been suggested; if it is, the suit can abate as to him. In a proceeding to estab it would seem to be doing a vain thing to set aside the decree, blish a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>against a firm, the surviving partners are the proper part]'-es t0 contest the claim. To what purpose should the case he continued, to bring in the representatives of one of the partners, after it has been decided, that the firm *s not responsible, and so decided in a case where the surviving partner is a party. The plaintiff alleges in the bill, that <em>Moore\u2019s </em>estate was alone solvent; he seeks for and takes a decree against his representative <em>alone; </em>and the court having held that he was not responsible, because there was no partnership liability,ecause it has since been ascertained that another partner was dead. If alive, the decree discharged him; and if his representatives do not claim to be made parties with a view to a proportion of the costs, the appellee cannot complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">The motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
