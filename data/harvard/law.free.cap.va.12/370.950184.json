The question referred to the court was, whether the demandant or the tenant was entitled ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-9\">The circuit superior court held that the law was for the tenant, and gave judgment for him accordingly; to which this court allowed the demandant a <em>supersedeas.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b391-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number><em>Robinson, </em>for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AQ1\">The testator certainly did not mean what the words of the executory limitation literally import, that if <em>Edward </em>should die without leaving lawful issue of a son of Edward, that is, without a grandchild or remoter descendant sprung from a son of his own, in such event the estate should devolve to the testator\u2019s son <em>Henry. </em>Upon that construction, if <em>Edward </em>had died leaving a son, and that son had no issue living at <em>Edward's </em>death, the son of <em>Edward </em>would have taken nothing. And the construction supposes, that the contingency upon which the testator meant to limit the estate to his son Henry, was the failure of great grandchildren of his own, male or female, sprung from a son of his son <em>Edward; </em>an intention so unusual, and indeed so unnatural and absurd, that the court will not impute it to the testator, if by any reasonable construction it can be avoided. The construction is easy and obvious: the superfluous preposition \u201cof\u201d should be struck out of the limitation, and the will should be understood as if it read, <em>\u201c </em>if <em>Edward </em>should die without lawful issue, a sonmeaning, <em>without a son. </em>And then, the effect will be, that <em>Edward </em>took an estate in fee, with an executory devise over to <em>Henry </em>in the event of <em>Edward </em>dying without a son ; and as that event must of necessity be ascertained at <em>Edward\u2019s </em>death or within nine months after, the executory devise was good in its creation, and <em>Henry </em>is now entitled to the estate. In <em>Melson </em>v. <em>Cooper, </em>4 Leigh 408. the testator devised land to his son <em>W. </em>and his heirs, and if he should <em>die without a son, and not sell the land, </em>then to his son <em>G.; </em>and <em>Carr </em>and <em>Cabell, </em>J. thought, that a general absolute unlimited power <em>to sell the land </em>was plainly given to <em>W. </em>and that, therefore, he took an absolute fee ; <em>Tucker, </em>P. doubted. In that case, but for the power to sell the land, the executory devise to <em>G. </em>limited upon the event of <em>W. </em>dying <em>without a son, </em>would have been held good. In <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Frost, </em>3 Barn. &amp; Ald. 546. 5 Eng. C. L. R. 373. the testator, having a son and daugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ter, and the latter having many children, devised lands to his son <em>W. F. </em>and his heirs, and if <em>W. F. </em>should have no children, child or issue, the said estate was, on the decease of <em>W. F. </em>to become the property of <em>the </em>heir at law, subject to such legacies as <em>W. F. </em>might leave by will to the younger branches of his family: and it was held, that it was to be ascertained at the period of the son <em>W. F.\u2019s </em>death, whether the estate devised to him should then vest in him in fee absolutely or pass over to some other person, and that <em>W. F. </em>took under the will an estate in fee, with a good executory devise to the person who, on the happening of the event contemplated by the will (namely, the dying of <em>W. F. </em>without issue living at his death) should be heir at law of the testator. In <em>Murray </em>v. <em>Addenbrook, </em>4 Russ. 407. 3 Cond. Eng. Oh. Rep. 729. the testator having bequeathed an annuity to <em>J. W. </em>for life, gave the annuity, upon the death of the annuitant, to the eldest surviving son of the annuitant\u2019s father sir <em>J. M. </em>and failing issue male of sir <em>J. M. </em>to his daughters living at the demise of such issue male, in equal proportions; at the death of <em>J. M. </em>the annuitant, his father sir <em>J. M. </em>had no son living, but he had two daughters: and it was held, that the executory bequest to the daughters of sir <em>J. M. </em>was well limited, and that in the event that occurred, they were entitled. He cited also <em>Birthright </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>3 Munf. 536. and <em>Burfoot </em>v. <em>Burfoots, </em>2 Leigh 119.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-4\"><em>Leigh, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avp\">If the words of the limitation are to be understood to import, that if the testator\u2019s son <em>Edward </em>should die without issue sprung from a son of <em>Edward, </em>the estate should devolve to the testator\u2019s son <em>Henry, </em>then this would be a devise to <em>Ed/ward </em>in fee, with an executory devise over to <em>Henry </em>limited upon a general failure of issue of any son of <em>Edward; </em>and the executory devise to <em>Henry </em>would be clearly void, as being limited on too remote a contingency. The jury so understood the words of the limi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tation; for the special verdict finds that <em>Edioard </em>died \u201c without leaving or having had lawful <em>issue of a son or of issue male or </em>female.\u201d But I agree, that that could hardly have been the meaning of the testator in framing this limitation. What, then, is the true import of the words \u201c if my son <em>Edward </em>should die without lawful issue of a son\u201d ? I understand the meaning to be, <em>without lawful issue of the son sex; </em>equivalent to <em>without issue male. </em>Among the various functions of the preposition \u201cof\u201d in composition, dr. <em>Johnson </em>says, it is sometimes used as \u201c noting something that has some particular quality,\u201d and sometimes, as \u201cnoting species or kindbut it must be confessed, that the examples he quotes do not exactly, though they do very nearly, indicate the same function of the preposition which I attribute to it in this will. I cannot remember any instance of this form of expression, in the precise sense I ascribe to it here, in any hook<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> or written instrument; but it is not uncommon in the vernacular speech of <em>Virginia, </em>especially of the people of eastern <em>Virginia ; </em>and was more frequent formerly, within my memory, than it is now. It must be familiar to the judges of this court. Taking it, that by \u201cissue of a son,\u201d the testator meant <em>issue of the son sex </em>(which I have no doubt is the .true explanation of the words) we have a plain ease : he devised the estate to his son <em>Edward </em>in fee simple, and if he should die without <em>issue of the son sex, </em>without <em>issue male, </em>then over to <em>'Henry. </em>And then, it cannot he doubted, that <em>Edward </em>took an estate tail by the will, with a contingent remainder to <em>Henry. </em>But, suppose the testator had said, as mr. <em>Robinson </em>insists his words ought to be understood,\u2014\u201cif my son <em>Edward </em>should die <em>without lawful issue, a son, </em>the estate shall go to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>my son Henry\u201d\u2014would the words \u201cwithout lawful issue) a son,\u201d import the same meaning as the words \u201c without a son\u201d ? I rather think the qualification of the word \u201cissue\u201d <em>by </em>the word \u201cson,\u201d would only serve to explain that by the word \u201c issue\u201d first used, he meant <em>male issue; </em>and then <em>Edward </em>took an estate tail. But grant all that mr. <em>Robinson asks; </em>take the will as if it read thus\u2014\u201cI give my son <em>Edward </em>the plantation &amp;c. to him and his heirs forever, and if he should die <em>without a son, </em>I give the same to my son Henry\u201d\u2014still, I insist, <em>Edward </em>would take an estate tail. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>1 Roll.

If <em>Edward </em>took an estate tail by the will, with a contingent remainder to Henry, the statute for abolishing entails converted <em>Edward \u2019s </em>estate tail into a pure and absolute fee, and cut off <em>Henry\u2019s </em>contingent remainder; and <em>Edward \u2019s </em>conveyance to <em>Cohoon </em>passed the absolute fee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-4\">Cabell and Brooke, <em>J. </em>without stating the reasons of their opinion, said the judgment was to be affirmed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"><em> </em>An instance has occurred to the reporter\u2019s memory since the argument.

After stating the case, he said\u2014It is contended by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, that <em>Edward Wright\u2019s </em>conveyance to <em>Cohoon </em>gave him only an estate for <em>Edward\u2019s </em>life, and that on the death of <em>Edward, </em>the title devolved to his brother <em>Henry ; </em>and in this I think he is sustained by the best established legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The only difficulty that can exist in the case, arises from the word \u201cof\u201d in the connexion which it has in the clause\u2014\u201cif my son <em>Edward </em>dies without lawful issue <em>of </em>a son.\u201d But this word I take to have been in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>terpolated, either hy a slip of the pen or by reason of the testator\u2019s want of skill in expressing himself. If we retain the word, the literal interpretation is, if he die <em>without a grandchild, </em>or rather, <em>without a child of a son. </em>But, besides the improbability of the testator\u2019s looking to the grandchildren of his son, that is, his own great grandchildren, it is not easy to imagine why he should have used this clumsy phraseology, instead of at once saying <em>if he die toithout grandchildren. </em>Moreover, if, as the words thus construed imply, he was looking to his own great grandchildren, it is not easy to discover a motive why the great grandchild, which might be of <em>either </em>sex conformably with the will, should be the child of a son rather than a daughter. It is contended, indeed, that the words are equivalent <em>to\u2014if he die without male issue; </em>but this cannot be ; for it is not by the will prescribed that the lawful issue of a son should be male issue. The words would be as well satisfied by female as by male children of the grandson of the testator. Again, even if we retain these words, <em>Edward\u2019s </em>estate could not be an estate tail. For he cannot take, <em>per form,am doni, </em>an estate either in tail male or tail general : not tail male, because the lawful issue of his son are not required to be <em>male; </em>nor tail general, because only a <em>son </em>of his could take; a daughter could not. If, then, we rigorously retain this particle <em>\u201c </em>of,\u201d the clause would still give no estate tail to <em>Edward. </em>The most it could do, would be to give an estate tail general to his son, if he had one, and if he had none, then to give the estate over to <em>Henry.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">I think, however, we are warranted in striking out this word \u201c of;\u201d <em>Doe </em>v. Micklen, 6 East 486. <em>Smart </em>v. Clarke, 3 Russ. 365. 3 Cond. Eng. Ch. Rep. 437. And then the limitation is to <em>Edward </em>and his heirs, and <em>if he die without a son, </em>then over to <em>Henry. </em>Taking it thus, there is a clear executory devise limited upon a fee simple. The first words, standing alone, would give a fee, but they are clogged and limited by the subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>words, <em>if he die without a son then over to Henry in fee. </em>It is a clear <em>limitation of a fee upon </em>a fee, by way of executory devise, in the event of the first taker dying without a' son. As where a testator devised to his mother for life, remainder to his brother in fee, but if his brother\u2019s wife then <em>encdnt </em>had a son, then to him in fee: a son was born: and this held a good executory devise to the son; Dyer 127. a. <em>in margin. </em>So, where lands were devised to <em>T. </em>and his heirs forever, but if he died without issue, living <em>W. </em>then to <em>W. </em>and his heirs; here, the words <em>without issue, living W. </em>were considered as constituting a good contingency, and the limitation over was held good. <em>Pells </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>Cro. Jac. 590. So, where lands were devised to <em>E. H. </em>forever, that is, if he have a son or sons who shall attain 21, but if he die without son or sons to inherit, then the testator\u2019s son <em>W. H. </em>to inherit: held, that <em>E. H. </em>took an estate in fee, subject' to an executory devise over in the event of his dying without a son who should attain 21. <em>Heath v. Heath, </em>1 Bro. C. C. 147. So, devise to &amp; <em>8. </em>and her heirs, but if she should die leaving <em>no child or children </em>or lawful issue of her body living at the time of her death, then to <em>T. B. </em>and his heirs: held, that <em>8. 8. </em>had a fee subject to an executory devise over to <em>T. B. </em>upon the contingency of her dying without child &amp;c. <em>Doe v. Wetton, </em>2 Bos. &amp; Pull. 324. <em>Right v. Day, </em>16 East 67. So, a devise to <em>A. </em>and his heirs forever, but if he died leaving no son, then to such son of his executor as he the executor should nominate, and if no such son, then to <em>B. </em>was held a good executory devise to <em>B. Fairfax v. Heron, </em>Prec. in Chan. 67. Butl. Feaxne 431. 6 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 466. 4 Bac. Abr. Legacies and Devises. I. p. 296. From these cases, it seems clear, that if the words of this will are equivalent <em>to\u2014if he die without a son, </em>the devise over to <em>Henry </em>was a good executory devise.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">The cases cited for the defendant in error, seem to me entirely inapplicable. Thus, in <em>Robinson v. Miller, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the devise was to the wife for life, and after to the testator\u2019s son, <em>without words of inheritance, </em>and if his son died without issue, having no son, then over: adjudged an estate tail; and properly, for there being no words of inheritance in the devise to the son, his children could never get the estate, unless it was construed to be an estate tail, though it was clear the testator postponed the devise over with a direct reference to benefiting his son\u2019s issue. So of <em>Wild's case: </em>it was held, that a devise to <em>A. </em>and his children, he having then no children, created an estate tail, because if <em>A. </em>had but a life estate, the children could never take any thing, whereas it was clearly the intention of the testator that they should be benefited by the devise. See 6 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 299. The principle stated in 2 Vern. 545. is but a reiteration of that in <em>Wild's case, </em>and <em>Merrymans </em>v. <em>Merryman, </em>5 Munf. 440. is of the same character. The celebrated case of <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>1 Burr. 38. was a devise for life and no longer to <em>L. II. ; </em>then to such son as be should have lawfully to be begotten (without words of inheritance), and for default of such issue, then over. <em>L. H. </em>took an estate tail, since the testator\u2019s manifest intent was to benefit the whole line of his issue, for the estate was not to go over until they failed, and if <em>L. H. </em>took but a life estate, his descendants could not receive the benefit intended for them. In these cases it is observable, that the first taker having no inheritance unless an estate tail was created, the son, children, or other descendants, could never come into any enjoyment of the estate. The estate tail, therefore, was implied to effectuate the intent of the testator in favour of the son, children or issue. But, in the case at bar, <em>Edward, Wright </em>took a fee by the first words, and his son of course would take the estate unless he aliened it. In this it is distinguished from the cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
