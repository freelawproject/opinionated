Deducting this sum of 695 dollars 77 cents from 1120 dollars, the amount advanced to <em>Elizabeth Dogan, </em>it appeared she had received an excess above her share of 424 dollars 33 cents, which the commissioners reported to be due from her, \u201cto bear interest\u201d (they added) \u201cuntil the money from the real estate should become due.\u201d And according to this division, the executor (as he alleged) paid all the legatees to whom money was due on account of the <em>personal </em>estate, their full shares.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-5\">The testator\u2019s <em>land </em>was a parcel of 442 acres in the county of <em>Culpeper; </em>of which 147 acres was laid off and assigned to the widow for her dower, leaving 295 acres. The executor advertised the testator\u2019s land for sale, as early as January 1821, on a credit of one, two and three years; but (as he alleged) was then unable to effect a sale.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b24-6\">In 1822, two of the testator\u2019s sons, <em>William </em>and <em>Robert, </em>sold and conveyed to <em>J.

And in 1823, <em>Gibson </em>sold and conveyed to <em>Moore, </em>the testator\u2019s executor, the interests he had purchased of <em>William </em>and <em>Robert Hilton </em>in the 295 acres of land, but not their reversionary interests in the 147 acres of dower land: the price <em>Moore </em>paid him was 840 dollars; and he professed <em>to </em>make the purchase, in order that he might have the power of selling the whole parcel of land, all together, as being more advantageous to the legatees than a sale thereof in parcels. He paid the purchase money out of the funds of his testator\u2019s estate; but he after-wards accounted to the legatees for the funds he had so applied, as part of his testator\u2019s personal estate, and so became entitled to, or claimed, his purchase of these interests on his own account.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b25-7\">The 295 acres of land (it seemed) was partly rented out by <em>Moore, </em>and partly cultivated by himself, till 1825.

It was cried out to <em>J.

In November 1828, <em>Henry 'Hilton </em>and <em>Henry Dogan </em>and <em>Elizabeth </em>his wife exhibited a bill in the superior court of chancery of <em>Fredericksburg, </em>against <em>Moore </em>the executor of the testator <em>John Hilton, James Garnett </em>and <em>Anne </em>his wife, <em>George </em>and <em>Susan Hilton, </em>and <em>Gibson </em>who had purchased the interests of <em>William </em>and <em>Robert Hilton, </em>colegatees of that testator\u2014setting forth the will of <em>John Hilton, </em>and the direction therein contained, that his <em>land, </em>should be sold <em>on such credit </em>as his executors should think best for the interests of his children, and the proceeds divided among them\u2014and charging, that <em>Moore </em>had delayed and neglected, for more than five years after his qualification as executor, to make sale of the land, though he might easily have effected a sale upon advantageous terms, and had in fact rejected offers of prices which he ought to have accepted ; prices much exceeding that at which he himself afterwards purchased, and now claimed to hold the land; that <em>Moore, </em>disregarding the plain terms of his testator\u2019s will, which directed that the land should be sold on credit, and violating the trust and confidence reposed in him, at length advertised the land to be sold for ready money, at a time when real estate could not be sold for eash without great sacrifice, and purchased it himself for 6 dollars <em>75 </em>cents per acre, much less than the land would have sold for, even at that unpropitious juncture, if offered for sale upon such credit as is usual, and as in the exercise of a sound discretion ought to have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>allowed; that though the land was cried out to <em>Marshall </em>as the highest bidder, he was only the agent of <em>Moore, </em>who had ever since continued to hold and enjoy it as proprietor, and now refused to settle with the plaintiffs upon any other principle but that of an unqualified transfer of their interests to him upon his payment to them of their respective shares of the proceeds of that illegal and fraudulent sale ; that the plaintiffs were advised that the sale was invalid, and that they had a right to have a resale made according to the directions of their father\u2019s will, and to hold <em>Moore </em>personally responsible for the injury they had sustained by depreciation in the value of the land during the time it remained unsold, owing to his unwarrantable delay and gross neglect, and for the profits of the property in the same interval. And the bill prayed, that the land should be resold and a proper distribution made of the proceeds, and that <em>Moore </em>should be held accountable for all loss and injury sustained by the parties concerned by reason of his official neglect or misconduct, and general relief.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b27-4\"><em>Moore, </em>in his answer, gave a history of his transactions in regard to the land of his testator, not materially variant, in substance, from the facts above stated, except in this, that he alleged, that instead of his having sold and purchased the whole parcel of 442 acres subject to the incumbrance of the widow\u2019s right of dower in 147 acres thereof, he had in fact sold only the 295 acres exclusive of the widow\u2019s dower land, and had purchased the 295 acres at 6 dollars 75 cents per acre, and that the plaintiffs nevertheless had insisted that he should account for and pay to them their shares of the proceeds of the whole 442 acres incumbered with the dower right, at the same price per acre. He claimed the interests of the legatees <em>William </em>and <em>Robert Hilton, </em>in the 295 acres, under his purchase from <em>Gibson, </em>rvho had purchased from them. He said, he had also purchased of <em>James Garnett </em>and <em>Anne </em>his wife, <em>all </em>her interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the. land; and that he had settled with <em>Garnett </em>as guardian of the legatee <em>Susan Hilton, </em>and paid him all her share of the personal and of the proceeds of the real estate, except a small balance of the latter. And as to <em>Dogan </em>and wife, after adverting to his testator\u2019s will, directing that \u00a3186. should be deducted from mrs. <em>Dogan\u2019s </em>share of his estate, he set forth the account stated in the testator\u2019s books of advancements made to her, shewing an additional advancement of \u00a3150. made to her subsequent to the codicil, and the testator\u2019s direction subjoined to the account, that the whole \u00a3 836. should be deducted from her part of his estate; and then he insisted, that as, after giving <em>Dogan </em>and wife full credit for her share of the testator\u2019s <em>personal </em>estate, she had received by way of advancement an excess of 424 dollars, this sum ought to be deducted from her share of the proceeds of the <em>real </em>estate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-4\">The defendant <em>Gibson </em>answered, and shewed the conveyance of <em>Willicmn </em>and <em>Robert Hilton </em>to him of <em>all </em>their interests in the real estate of theh father, as well their present interests in the 295 acres of land as their reversionary interests in the 147 acres assigned to their mother for her dower, and his own sale and conveyance to <em>Moore </em>of the interests he had bought of those two legatees in the 295 acres; and that he was still entitled to their reversionary interests in the dower land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-5\">None of the other defendants appeared; and as to them the bill was regularly taken pro <em>confesso.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b28-6\">Many depositions were taken and filed by the plaintiffs and the defendant <em>Moore, </em>touching two questions of fact. The purpose of the evidence on the part of the plaintiffs, was to prove, 1. that <em>Moore </em>had sold and purchased the whole parcel of 442 acres subject to the incumbrance of the dower right of the widow in 147 acres, at 6 dollars and 75 cents per acre; and 2. that <em>Moore </em>intended, contrived and practised, an actual fraud in the sale of the land, with a view to pinchase it him<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>self at a price below its real value, and below what, if be had acted in good faith, he might have obtained. And the purpose of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>evidence was to prove, that he had sold and purchased only the 295 acres at that price, exclusive of the 147 acres which had been assigned to the widow for her dower; and to vindicate himself from the charge of actual and wilful fraud imputed to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-5\">No proof was exhibited, of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>purchase from <em>Garnett </em>and wife of her interest in the real estate of her father, or of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>settlement with the guardian of <em>Susan Hilton, </em>and payment to him of that legatee\u2019s share of her father\u2019s estate, real as well as personal, as <em>Moore </em>alleged in his answer he had done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-6\">Pending the suit <em>Susan Hilton </em>married <em>Ambrose Jeffries </em>and by consent, <em>Jeffries </em>and wife were made parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b29-7\">The cause having been transferred to the circuit superior court of <em>Culpeper, </em>that court, on a hearing, at November term 1836, made an interlocutory decree, declaring, that <em>Moore\u2019s </em>sale of the land devised by his testator\u2019s will to be sold, was of the whole parcel of 442 acres subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower in the part thereof which had been assigned to her; and that the sale was irregular and illegal, both because it was made upon terms not authorized by his testator\u2019s will, and because <em>Moore </em>himself (the trustee) had become the purchaser at his own sale. And the court having put the plaintiffs to their election, <em>either </em>to have the sale set aside, and the land resold upon a proper credit as directed by the will, and to have an account of the profits of the land since the assignment of the widow\u2019s dower, <em>or </em>to compel <em>Moore </em>to take the whole 442 acres of land so purchased by him subject to the incumbrance of the widow\u2019s dower, and account for the purchase money at the rate of 6 dollars 75 cents per acre for the whole 442 acres, and such further sum, if any, as the same would have sold for on the first day of the September county <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>court of <em>Culpeper </em>1825, if it had been then sold upon credit of one, two and three years, the purchaser giving his bonds for the annual instalments of the purchase money, with personal surety for the first instalment, and the title to be made when the first instalment should be paid, and the other instalments secured by a deed of trust mortgaging the land. And the plaintiffs electing the latter alternative ; and it appearing, that no part of the purchase money of the land had been paid to them; and it being alleged, but not proved, by the defendant Moore, that he had purchased of <em>Garnett </em>and wife their interest in the land, and of <em>Garnett </em>as guardian of the legatee <em>Susan Hilton </em>her interest in the greater part of the same, and it not appearing whether any thing had been paid to the legatee <em>George Hilton </em>(who was an absent party) or whether his interest had been purchased by <em>Moore: </em>therefore, the court decreed, that <em>Moore </em>should pay to the plaintiff <em>Henry </em>Hilton, and to the plaintiffs <em>Henry Dogan </em>and wife, each respectively, the sum of 4.51 dollars 48 cents with interest on 426 dollars 21 cents part thereof from the 21st September 1828 till paid; such being their shares of the purchase money for which <em>Moore </em>had bought the whole land, according to the principles declared by the court; and the court being of opinion, that the intention of the testator <em>John Hilton, </em>manifested by the <em>codicil </em>to his will, was, that the money arising from the sale of his <em>land, </em>should be equally divided among his seven children without regard to previous advancements. And the court referred it to a commissioner to enquire and report, what purchases if any, and what payments if any, had been made by <em>Moore </em>of or on account of the interests or shares of <em>Garnett </em>and wife, of <em>Jeffries </em>and wife, and of <em>George Hilton, </em>in the land aforesaid, or in the purchase money (at the rate of 6 dollars 75 cents per acre) of the whole parcel of 442 acres subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower. And the court ordered an issue to be made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>lip and tried at its own bar, to ascertain, whether more, and if so how much more, than 6 dollars <em>75 </em>cents per acre, would have been obtained on the 21st September 1825, for the whole tract of 442 acres subject to the incumbrance of the widow\u2019s right of dower therein, if the same had been then offered for sale, on the terms of credit and for security of the purchase money before indicated in the decree, as the terms on which the land ought properly to have been sold: And that <em>Moore </em>should render an account of the rents and profits of the land from the date of the assignment of the widow\u2019s dower to the 21st September 1826 (when, if the sale had been made upon the proper terms of credit, the first instalment of the purchase money would have been due); and directed the commissioner to state and report the shares of the testator\u2019s seven devisees of the rents and profits, and how much of the same remained due \u25a0and unpaid to them. And in order to enable the court to give the defendant <em>Gibson </em>a decree against the defendant <em>Moore </em>for his part of the purchase money of the land, on account of the reversionary interests of <em>William </em>and <em>Robert Hilton </em>in the part that had been assigned to the widow for her dower, which <em>Gibson </em>had purchased <em>of </em>those two legatees and was 3ret entitled to, the court directed the commissioner to enquire and report what rate per cent, upon the purchase money, would, on the 21st September 1825, have given <em>Gibson </em>the value of his said reserved reversionary interests, and how much of the purchase money should have been paid to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b31-3\">In June 1837, before any thing had been done under the interlocutory decree, <em>Moore </em>presented a \u201cpetition for a rehearing\u201d (so called in the record) wherein he complained, 1st, that even upon the evidence before the court at the time the decree was pronounced, the decree was erroneous <em>in </em>fact, in declaring, that <em>Moore </em>had sold and purchased the whole parcel of 442 acres of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>subject to the incumbrance of the widow\u2019s dower, at 6 dollars <em>75 </em>cents per acre j whereas, he insisted, the just inference from the pleadings and the evidence should have been, that he sold and purchased, at that price, the 295 acres exclusive of the 147 acres that had been assigned to the widow for dower: And for the purpose of shewing that this was the just inference, the pleadings and the evidence before the court at the time of the decree, were stated. And then, the attention of the court was asked to new evidence touching the question, which had been taken and filed since the decree; and reasons were stated for the failure to adduce it earlier; but it was not alleged, that this new evidence had been discovered since the decree, nor had <em>Moore </em>obtained any special order of the court authorizing him to take and file it. 2ndly, He complained, that the interlocutory decree was erroneous in point of law, namely, in declaring, that it was the intention of the testator, <em>John Hilton\u2019\u2019s </em>will, manifested by the codicil, that the proceeds of the sale of his land should be equally divided among his seven children without regard to previous advancements; for that, taking the will and codicil together, the meaning and intent were apparent, that all advancements made to <em>William Hilion </em>and <em>Elizabeth Dogan </em>should be brought into hotchpot in the division of the <em>whole </em>estate, <em>real and </em>personal, among the seven children. And further to shew that this was the true construction, there was exhibited with the petition (what though pleaded in the answer, had not been exhibited before, because it was in possession of the testator\u2019s widow,) a copy of the account stated on the testator\u2019s books of the advancements to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>to the amount of \u00a3 336. and the testator\u2019s direction subjoined to the account, that that sum should be deducted \u201c from her part <em>of his </em>estate,\u201d when a division should take place among all his children, with evidence (filed since the interlocutory decree) to prove that the original account of the advance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>ments to mrs. <em>Dogan, </em>and the direction subjoined thereto, were on the testator\u2019s books, and all in his own handwriting. There was also exhibited a copy of the report of the division of the testator\u2019s <em>personal </em>estate (a proceeding to which <em>Dogan </em>and wife were parties) whereby it appeared, that this sum of \u00a3 336. had been brought into the division, each of the seven children allowed their full share thereof as well as of the other personal estate, and the executor held accountable to them respectively for the same, and <em>Dogan </em>and wife, after being credited with their full portion, found debtors for a balance of 424 dollars 33 cents, <em>\u201c </em>to bear interest until the money from the real estate should become due.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-4\">Evidence was exhibited with the petition, that <em>Moore </em>had given his bond to the guardian of <em>Susan Hilton </em>for the balance (it was a small one) due her as legatee of her father ; that, pending this suit, he had accounted to and paid <em>Henry Hilton </em>his full share of the <em>personal </em>estate, and that he had settled with and paid <em>George Hilton, </em>his full share of the personal estate, and purchased all his interest in the land, except his reversionary interest in the dower land.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-5\">It appeared that between the date of the interlocutory decree and the time of presenting the \u201c petition for a rehearing,\u201d the testator\u2019s widow died, so that the reversion of the 147 acres of dower land had now fallen in.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b33-6\">The court refused the rehearing.

The questions of fact, whether <em>Moore\u2019s </em>sale and purchase were of the whole 442 acres of land subject to the incumbrance of the widow\u2019s dower in 147 acres, or only of the 295 acres exclusive of the dower land ? and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>whether any wilful or actual fraud was iustly imputable. to <em>Moore </em>? were debated at the bar, and the evidence touching both points minutely examined. This court concurred with the circuit superior court, that <em>Moore </em>sold and purchased the whole parcel of 442 acres subject to the widow\u2019s right of dower. And as to the imputation on <em>Moore </em>of wilful or actual fraud, neither the' court below nor this court took any notice of the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b34-5\">II. As to the refusal of a rehearing, <em>Leigh </em>said, that, so far as the petition prayed the court to reconsider any question of fact determined by the interlocutory decree upon the evidence which was before the court at the time the decree was pronounced, or any question of law determined by the decree (and the question upon the construction and eifect of the testator <em>John Milton's </em>will and codicil as to the advancements, was a point of law), this was, properly, a <em>petition for a rehearing, </em>and was regular in practice, <em>Banks </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>2 Hen. &amp; Munf. 20. <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>18 Yes. 319.325. <em>Radley </em>v. <em>Shaver, </em>1 Johns. Ch. Rep. 200. <em>Consequa </em>v. <em>Panning, </em>3 Id. 587. <em>Fanning </em>v. <em>Dunham, </em>4 Id. 35. though, he said, a petition for a rehearing was not necessary, in such cases, nor usual in practice; for if a party could shew the court, or the court itself discovered, that it had committed an error in an interlocutory <em>decree, either </em>as to a matter of fact or of law, the court might and surely ought to correct the error, at any time before the final decree. In the english practice, the petition for a rehearing was resorted to, when the decree though in its character final had not been enrolled: such petition was not necessary, where the decree was merely interlocutory. In our practice, there was no enrolment; all decrees were entered of record, <em>eo instante </em>they were pronounced. So far as the petition sought to bring new evidence into the cause, which had not been adduced when the interlocutory decree was pronounced, though it bore upon the questions put in issue by the pleadings, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>the petition was, in effect, a bill in the nature of a bill of review, Mitf. Plead. 81-3. and so this court would consider it, though put in the form of a petition for a rehearing, <em>Roberts\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Cocke </em>ex\u2019or, 1 Rand, 121. Regularly, according to the practice of the english chancery, a review of <em>any </em>decree, upon new evidence, could not be allowed, unless the new evidence had been discovered since the decree was pronounced. But (repeating the argument of the appellant\u2019s counsel on a similar point, in <em>Dunbar\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Woodcock\u2019s ex\u2019o\u00eds, </em>10 Leigh 647, 8.) he said, that \u201cin our practice, there was no decree merely interlocutory, which might not be corrected upon new evidence adduced before final hearing, whether the new evidence was discovered before or after the interlocutory decree was pronounced. Formerly, by statutory regulation, after the commission for taking depositions was closed, and the cause set for hearing, new'evidence might be introduced, in any stage of it, under a special order of the court, but not without such a special order. 1 Rev. Code, ch. 66. \u00a7 103. p. 216. And in the practice of the superior courts of chancery, handed down from the high court of chancery in chancellor <em>Wythe\u2019s </em>time, the special order for taking new evidence was always made upon motion, if the evidence was material, unless it appeared to have been kept back for purposes of delay or chicane. The leave to take new evidence was almost a matter of course, when it was asked: and it was more frequent <em>after </em>than <em>before </em>an interlocutory decree. And it was only necessary to reflect upon the loose and unadvised manner in which depositions in chancery were taken, generally by the parties themselves in the country, to understand why the strictness of the english chancery practice had never prevailed, and how the liberal indulgence of our practice became indispensable to the ends of truth and justice. With knowledge of the existence of this practice, and aware that the opening of the cause for new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>evidence had become matter of comse upon motion for the purpose, the legislature, by the statute of March 1826, dispensed with the necessity of the motion and the special leave of court, by providing, that <em>from the filing of the bill until the final hearing in any case, either party may, without any order of court, obtain general commissions and take depositions to be read therein; </em>Supp. to Rev. Code, ch. 103. \u00a7 9. p. 132.\u201d The special court of appeals in <em>Dunbar\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Woodcock\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>did not determine the question of practice upon the construction and effect of the provision in the statute of March 1826. It remained now to be settled. The circumstance of the new evidence being introduced, in the present case, upon a petition for rehearing, could not render it less proper that the court should consider the new evidence, and correct the interlocutory decree in the particulars wherein that evidence shewed it to be erroneous.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b36-4\"><em>Patton </em>said, that the new evidence introduced with the \u201c petition for a rehearing,\u201d ought not to have been admitted and considered by the court. And he repeated, and enforced, the argument of the appellee\u2019s counsel upon the point, in <em>Dunbar\u2019s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Woodcock\u2019s ex\u2019ors : \u201c </em>It was the practice of our courts of chancery, formerly, before the statute of March 1826, when the general commission to take depositions had been closed, to open the commission by special order, on motion, at any time before the hearing; but after the hearing, and an interlocutory decree deciding the questions of fact, the court never gave leave to take new depositions on a point decided, unless upon affidavit that the new evidence had been discovered since the decree. This was, perhaps, sometimes done informally, upon motion, and sometimes regularly upon supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review of the interlocutory <em>decree; </em>but in whichever way it was done, the principle on which the new evidence was received was the same, namely, that it had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>been newly discovered. And it was necessary that this principle should be observed; for otherwise, the litigation of questions of fact, however solemnly decided by the court on a full hearing, would have been perpetually renewed, and there would have been no end of it; and the admission of new evidence under such circumstances, would have been a temptation to carelessness and neglect, if not to subornation of evidence. The statute of March 1826 was designed to dispense with the motion for leave to take depositions and the special order for that purpose, in cases in which the former practice required them, but only in such cases ; not to render the interlocutory decision of questions of fact nugatory, or to dispense with the supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review of interlocutory decrees, or to abrogate the principle on which such bills of review could be allowed. Though the words of the statute were general, that <em>from, the filing of the bill until the final hearing in any case, </em>depositions may be taken to be read therein, without any order of court; yet the <em>final hearing </em>there meant was such final hearing as had formerly concluded the questions of fact; and formerly the questions of fact might have been settled by an interlocutory decree as well as a final one.\u201d In <em>Dunbar1 s ex\u2019or </em>v. <em>Woodcock\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>the special court of appeals held, that the interlocutory order there in question, Avas not a <em>final decree </em>within the meaning of the statute of March 1826, being only an opinion of the court, given in the progress of an account, upon exceptions to a report or instructions to the commissioner. In this case, there can be no doubt, that there Avas a full and <em>final hearing </em>of all questions of fact and of laAV, and these questions settled by the interlocutory decree ; and this, he submitted, Avas such a <em>final hearing </em>as the statute of March 1826 had in contemplation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b37-4\">III. <em>Leigh </em>said, the court below erred in the construction it put on the av\u00edII and codicil of <em>John Hilton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>namely, that it was the testator\u2019s intention, manifested hy the codicil, that the money arising from his <em>land </em>should be equally divided among his seven children, without regard to previous advancements. The testator\u2019s general intent and purpose was very clear, to give equal portions to each and all his children: the provision for the education of his younger children, was hardly an exception, since he had already educated the elder. This general intent could only he accomplished, hy requiring those to whom he had made advancements, to bring them into hotchpot in the division of his estate; of his whole estate without discrimination; of the personal estate he left, and of the proceeds of his land, which he directed to he sold out and out, and thus converted into personalty. There was nothing in the words of the codicil, viewed with reference to the will (which was its context) that indicated a particular intent that the proceeds of the <em>land </em>should he equally divided among the seven children without regard to the advancements ; and to shew this, he entered into a critical examination of the will and codicil. But, he said, if the words of the codicil, taken alone, might seem to indicate such a particular intent, the court would not sacrifice the plain general, to the very doubtful particular, intent: it would adopt the construction that would best effectuate the general intent. The function of the codicil was simply this: the testator, having hy his <em>will </em>indicated the objects of his bounty hy <em>description, </em>\u201chis children living at his decease,\u201d thought proper, hy the codicil, made shortly before his death, to bequeath it to them hy <em>name; </em>an alteration very material in its effect. Clearly then, the \u00a3186. mentioned in the will as having been advanced to mrs. Dogan, was to he brought into hotchpot in the division of <em>the whole estate. </em>The only doubt was as to the \u00a3150. advanced to her after the codicil was made. Now, that the testator made that additional advancement of \u00a3150. to her, and intended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>that that as well as the former advancement of \u00a3186. should be brought into hotchpot in the division of <em>his whole estate, </em>appeared by the account stated on his books of his advancements to that daughter, and his direction subjoined thereto, that the whole \u00a3 336. should be deducted from her part <em>of his estate </em>when a division should be made among all his children. The testator had thus given his own construction of his will and codicil, which surely the court must respect; and he himself had made an estimate of the amount of advancements to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>which she was to bring into hotchpot. Again, the advancement of the \u00a3150. to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>was a satisfaction of the legacy to her <em>pro tanto. </em>The testator certainly did not make a simple gift of that \u00a3150. to mrs. <em>Dogan: </em>it was given to her with the intent, and upon condition, that it should be brought into hotchpot in the division of his estate, and if it should not be so brought into hotchpot, she would be debtor to the estate to that amount; and even in this view, it ought to be discounted from her share of the proceeds of the land. But, moreover, the whole amount of advancements to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>(\u00a3336.) had been in fact brought into hotchpot, as part of the personal estate, in the division thereof; a proceeding to which <em>Dogan </em>and wife were parties: the executor was made accountable for six sevenths of that \u00a3 336. to the other six legatees, and accounted to <em>Dogan </em>and wife for the other one seventh, who were found indebted in a balance of 424 dollars over and above their share, which was left to be deducted, with interest, from her share of the proceeds of the land. And if it should not be so deducted, <em>Dogan </em>and wife would get exactly 424 dollars more than their share, and the executor would have to pay, if he had not already paid, that sum out of his own pocket to the other legatees.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b39-4\"><em>Patton </em>contended, that the codicil expounded the provisions of the will, and if it did not expound, it con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>trolled them. The codicil provided, in precise and plain \u201c that the money arising from the sale of the testator\u2019s land should he equally divided among\u201d his seven children therein named; that is, that it should, in all events, be so divided among them.' This was probably his intention when he made his will, and he meant to explain that intention by the codicil; or, if it was not so, then he had changed his purpose, and made his codicil to declare his final intention. As to the account found in the testator\u2019s books of his advancements to mrs. Dogan, and the direction subjoined that the <em>&amp; </em>336. which had been advanced to her should be deducted from her part of his estate in the general division thereof among all his children, and the evidence adduced to prove that the account and the direction were in the testator\u2019s handwriting, the court could not, with propriety, take any notice of these facts; because, in the first place, the account and the direction thereto subjoined were, in their nature, a testamentary paper, and yet had never been duly proved as such, and without due probat was nugatory; and because, in the second place, all this was new matter brought into the cause after the interlocutory decree was pronounced, without pretence that it had been subsequently discovered. It was, indeed, pleaded in <em>Moore\u2019s </em>answer; and, if he intended to rely upon it, ought to have been exhibited with the answer. It was matter which, though <em>Moore </em>might have exhibited it before the hearing and the interlocutory decree, was only brought before the court with the <em>\u201c </em>petition for a rehearingwhich, in this respect, was a bill in the nature of a bill of review of the decree, upon matter well known to the party, and within his power to adduce proof of, before the hearing: therefore, he could not avail himself of it to impeach the decree. He said, the same remarks were applicable to the report of the division ; that must have been well known to the party before the hearing, yet it was suppressed till the interlocu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>tory decree was pronounced, and only brought before the court with the \u201cpetition for a rehearing.\u201d But, adverting to the report, he said, that though it thereby appeared, that the \u00a3 336. advanced to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>was taken into account by the commissioners as part of the testator <em>John Hilton\u2019s </em>personal estate, and equal shares thereof allowed to each of the legatees, it nowise appeared that Moore, the executor, had paid the same to any of them. They might be interested in this question, <em>Moore </em>was not.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b41-4\"><em>Leigh </em>replied, that as to the doubt now suggested, whether <em>Moore </em>had paid the legatees their shares of the personal estate including their share of the \u00a3336. advanced to mrs. Dogan, the report of the division shewed that he was held accountable to them for the same; <em>Moore </em>alleged in his answer, that he had paid their full shares to all the legatees, except <em>Henry, </em>George, and <em>Susan Hilton ; </em>the interlocutory decree took it for granted, that he had paid all the legatees their shares except those three, as to whose interests it directed the proper accounts; the others had not appealed from the decree : <em>Dogan </em>and wife had no right to complain of the decree, on behalf of their codefendants; and <em>Dogan </em>and wife were the only parties interested to contest the question with the executor, whether the advancement of the \u00a3 336. to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>ought to he brought into hotchpot in the division of the proceeds of the <em>land, </em>for they were the only parties who were chargeable with a balance on account of advancements. There was evidence filed with the petition for a rehearing, that <em>Moore </em>had accounted for and paid to the legatees <em>Henry, George </em>and <em>Susan, </em>their full shares; and this evidence might certainly be laid before the commissioner, when he proceeded to state the accounts directed by the decree. He said, that the account of advancements to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>found on the testator\u2019s books with the direction subjoined to it, all in the testator\u2019s handwriting, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was indeed a testamentary paper, and might have been proved as such. Yet it was proper evidence without a regular probat; or if a regular probat was necessary, it might even now be propounded for probat, and the court ought to have given leave and time to the party to make the probat; <em>Druce </em>v. <em>Denison, </em>6 Yes. 385. 397. For the rest, supposing that the commission to take depositions touching questions of fact put in issue by the pleadings, could not be opened without special leave of the court after an interlocutory decree settling the questions of fact, and ought not to be opened unless it appeared -that the new evidence had been discovered subsequently to the decree ; yet it had never been doubted, in our practice, that exhibits, which ought to have been but had not been tiled with the pleadings, and which had not been called for by the other party or by the court, might be filed after an interlocutory decree; especially when, as in this case, though they might vary the final result, they could nowise impede the execution of the decree.</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b42-4\">IV. <em>Leigh </em>admitted, that <em>Moore's </em>sale and purchase of the land could not be supported, not only for the reasons stated in the decree, but because, as the advertisement of the sale gave no notice that any part of the purchase money would be required in cash, the requisition, at the time of sale, of 1386 dollars in cash, was calculated to prevent competition. But, he contended, the court erred in the mode and measure of relief. Either the sale should have been set aside, and a resale ordered upon such terms of credit as the court thought most advantageous, and <em>Moore </em>held accountable for the profits since his purchase: or he should have been held to the actual bargain he had made, and the plaintiffs allowed the full benefit of it; charging him with the price of the 295 acres of land exclusive of the widow\u2019s dower, or of the whole 442 acres subject to the incumbrance of the dower, (according as the one or the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>was found to have been the real subject sold and bought,) at 6 dollars <em>75 </em>cents per acre, with interest on the purchase money. And the court might properly enough have given the plaintiffs choice of those alternatives. But, compelling <em>Moore </em>to take the land, it ought not to have gone further, and compelled him to pay not only the price at which he had bought it, but as much more as he ought to have given for it if the sale had been made upon the proper terms. A court of equity might set aside contracts for fraud, or for mistake as to facts; it might avoid a trustee\u2019s sale and purchase at his own sale, at the instance of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>either for any unfairness or irregularity in the transaction, or because it was incompatible with the duty of his trust; but it could not, on the ground of fraud, unfairness, irregularity or breach of trust, make a new bargain for the purchaser, and decree specific execution of such bargain thus made for and forced upon him. And this was exactly what the court had done in this case: it held <em>Moore </em>accountable for the whole purchase money of the land, according to the terms of his actual purchase upon the most onerous construction thereof; and then required him to pay as much more purchase money as a jury should say the subject would have sold for, at the time he made the sale and purchase, if it had been then offered for sale on the terms of credit prescribed by the court. Equity never gave speculative damages, for breach of a contract of sale, or upon a rescission of such a contract for any cause, or for fraud or deceit in a bargain ; especially, where the subject of the contract remained in <em>statu quo, </em>to be restored to the parties complaining, or disposed of by the court for their benefit. There were some precedents of issues <em>quantum damnificatus </em>directed by the court of chancery; but they were very rare, and the authority of those precedents had been questioned, even in cases where the court could no otherwise give the party injured the benefit of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>his bargain, or of his property. He cited, and examined, <em>Threlkeld\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh\u2019s ex\u2019x, </em>2 Leigh 451. <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Hogsheads, </em>3 Id. 667. <em>Denton </em>v. <em>Stuart, </em>1 Cox 158. 17 Ves. 276. <em>in notes.

C. 418.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b44-4\"><em>Patton </em>maintained, that the decree was right as to the manner and the extent of the relief it gave. The testator directed that his land should be sold, on a credit, and the proceeds divided among his children: the duty of the trustee was to make the sale, on reasonable credit, as soon as he conveniently could; he neglected to sell it for some five or six years, and then committed a plain and gross breach of trust in making the sale. To give the <em>cestuis que trust </em>what the land would bring twelve years after (according to the trustee\u2019s own shewing) it ought to have been sold, their subjecting them to the risque of a depreciation of the property, and exempting him from it, making them bear the loss that might arise from his delay, neglect and misconduct, instead of holding him liable for it, would have been most unmerited favour to him, and to them most inadequate relief. The trustee had bought the shares of two of his <em>cestuis que trust </em>in 295 acres of the 442 acres of land, to enable bim to sell the whole subject, because, as he himself declared, the sale of it in separate parcels, would be disadvantages to the parties <em>interested; </em>indeed, he claimed to have acquired since the sale, the right of two other parties; and thus he had <em>become </em>entitled <em>to four sevenths </em>of the 295 acres. He would have a right to demand that <em>four sevenths of </em>the land itself should be laid off and allotted to him in <em>severalty; </em>or, if the court ordered the whole land to be sold on the proper terms of credit, no other purchaser could come into fair competition with him to whom so large a share of the proceeds of sale would be due. Therefore, it was impossible to restore to the plaintiffs the same benefit to which they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>would have been entitled if their trustee had timely and fairly performed his trust, by directing a resale of the subject upon the proper and usual terms of credit and giving the plaintiffs their shares of the proceeds, or in any other way than that which the court had adopted in the decree. And there was abundant authority to shew the propriety of the decree. He cited, in the course of his argument, <em>Hedges </em>v. <em>Everard, </em>1 Eq. Ca. Abr. p. 18. pl. <em>7. Ivie </em>v. <em>Ivie, </em>1 Atk. 429. <em>Bostock </em>v. <em>Blakeney, 2 </em>Bro. C. C. 653. <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mackreth, </em>Id. 400. <em>Tebbs </em>v. <em>Carpenter, </em>1 Madd.

In one view, indeed, <em>Moore </em>himself would be benefited by the mode of relief adopted by the decree <em>; </em>he was to be charged with the purchase money for which the jury should find that 442 acres of land would have sold, in 1825 subject to the then existing incumbrance of the widow\u2019s dower, if it had then been offered for sale upon the proper terms of credit; but the widow being now dead, he held the land relieved from that incumbrance; and if now sold over again, it would be sold clear of the incumbrance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b45-9\">Tucker. <em>P.</em></author>\n<p id=\"APR\">Much discussion having taken place at the bar on the subject of petitions for rehearing, I shall take occasion to state succintly my views of the practice, and then apply them to the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">According to the english practice, a petition for rehearing is an application to the chancellor, before a decree has been signed and enrolled to rehear a cause, not upon new matter or new evidence, but upon the matter in issue and the evidence in the cause at the former hearing. If there be new matter or new evidence in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>the power of the party, which would have been the foundation of a bill of review if the decree had been enrolled, it must be made the subject of a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, and its object cannot be attained by a petition to rehear. Mitf. Plead. 82. <em>Wiser </em>v. <em>Blackly &amp;c. </em>2 Johns. Ch. Rep. 488. To this supplemental bill, the defendant answers as in other cases, traversing, if he so pleases, the alleged discovery of new matter or new evidence since the former healing. It were well, I think, that this regular proceeding had been adhered to by our courts, yet I have no doubt they have fallen into the practice of entertaining petitions as substitutes for the supplemental bill; an instance of which is found in <em>Roberts\u2019s adm\u2019r </em>v. <em>Cocke ex\u2019or, </em>cited at the bar. \u2022 It is plain, however, that every such petition must partake of the character of the supplemental bill, and be treated according to its analogy. Therefore as a supplemental bill filed for the purpose of bringing forward new matter or new evidence, must shew that it has been newly discovered, and could not, by due diligence, have been brought forward before, <em>Dale </em>v. <em>Roosevelt, </em>6 Johns. Ch. Rep. 255. so also must a petition for rehearing, which is its substitute. As the supplemental bill calls upon the defendant to answer, and as he may accordingly traverse the. alleged recent discovery, so in the case of a petition <em>setting forth the discovery of new matter or new evidence, </em>the adversary party may traverse the allegation; and to that end the necessary steps should be taken for calling upon him to answer. Unless this course be adopted, we must discard the proceeding by petition, and adhere to the supplemental bill; but so long as the substance is retained, I should incline to think a proceeding by petition, or even by motion or rule, might be without objection, and even preferable for its simplicity and expedition.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-12\">In this case, there was no foundation for a supplemental bill, and none of course for a petition .bringing in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>new evidence. There is no allegation, that the evidence upon either point was newly discovered, or that the defendant could not hy due diligence have had advantage of it before. I think, therefore, that the court ought not to have allowed the petition, or reheard the cause, unless our statute of March 1826 has otherwise provided. That statute provides, that \u201c from the filing of the bill to the <em>final hearing of the </em>cause, either party may, without order of court, obtain commissions to take depositions to be read therein.\u201d What then is the meaning of the statute as to the <em>final hearing 1 </em>Are we to understand it in its strictest acceptation, or in a more limited sense ? If the former, then although a decree shall have been pronounced upon the merits, after a full hearing of the cause, yet if accounts or any other supplementary proceedings are directed, which (as frequently happens) may occupy years, the decree, and all that has been founded upon it, may he set aside upon the production of a deposition subsequently taken, and a new hearing upon the merits and on the new testimony must be the consequence. Such a construction would be pregnant with mischief. I think, therefore, that we should give to the statute a more limited construction, and confine it to what was obviously the design of the legislature. It was merely intended to remove the inconvenience of special applications for commissions after a cause is set for hearing; and it clearly was not intended to give to any party liberty to take testimony without a commission in any case, which even the allowance of a commission before could not make regular. If before this statute, it would have been error in a court after a full hearing upon the merits, to have awarded a commission to take evidence which was before known to the party and in his power, I should hold it to be clear, that the legislature did not design to legitimate such evidence without a commission. Therefore I am of opinion, that it is not competent to a party, after a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>hearing of the cause and a decree settling the merits of <em>. </em>the controversy, to take new testimony to matter that was fairly in issue and decided upon; but if the party has new matter to put in issue, or newly discovered evidence to the matter formerly in issue, he must resort to his supplemental bill of review, or to a petition for a rehearing in the nature of it, which must be governed by the principles which prevailed in relation to them before the statute in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Excluding the depositions taken after the hearing, we must- consider the appellant as having purchased, according to his advertisement, the whole 442 acres of land subject to the widow\u2019s dower. This sale, it is admitted, cannot stand without the assent of the legatees; who, upon equitable principles, have a right either to have a resale or to insist upon that which has been made. They have elected the latter, but they demand that <em>Moore </em>shall be held to pay as much more than the contract price, as a sale upon proper terms of credit would have brought, instead of a sale for cash or one half cash. This seems but reasonable. Both parties acquiesce in the fairness of the price, considering it was a sale for a large portion in cash, and all that the case requires is a fair estimate of the probable difference between a cash and credit sale. The nature and circumstances of the case, which arise out of the appellant\u2019s own conduct, render this necessary. No other expedient can attain justice, or place the appellees in the situation they would have held, had the trust been faithfully executed. The falling in of the life estate of the widow, and the possible variance of prices, would render a sale at this time a very unfair means of adjusting the rights of the parties. The principle of the decree, then, appears to me to be right, though it would have been better to have referred it to a discreet commissioner, rather than to a jury, to ascertain the probable difference according to the general current of similar transactions, between a sale <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>on the terms on which <em>Moore </em>bought, and a sale on such credit as would have been proper under his testator\u2019s will. This might safely be entrusted to a judicious man of business, familiarized to similar enquiries; but I would be unwilling to submit an estimate to the vague conjeetures of a jury, of the price that might have been obtained for the land in 1825. In this respect, it would seem advisable to correct the decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">We come, lastly, to the advances to <em>Dogan </em>and wife. T am of opinion, that the court erred in declaring that the testator intended by his codicil, that the proceeds of sale of his <em>land </em>should be divided without reference to advancements. I find nothing from which this inference can be drawn, particularly in relation to subsequent advances. Now, the advance to mrs. <em>Dogan </em>mentioned <em>in the will, </em>is expressly directed to be taken out of her share of the <em>estate. </em>The additional advancement of \u00a3150. which it is claimed to deduct from her share of the realty, and which was subsequent to the date of the codicil, is alone in question. Now, an advancement to a child, made subsequent to a will, is to be taken as a satisfaction <em>pro toto o\u00ed pro tanto, </em>according to its amount. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>5 Rand. 577. <em>Hoskins </em>v. <em>Hoskins, </em>Prec. in Ch. 263. <em>Trimmer </em>v. Bayne, 7 Ves. 508. 515. <em>Pye ex parte, </em>18 Yes. 140. 151. <em>Monck </em>v. <em>Monck, </em>1 Ball &amp; Beat. 296. 304. This advancement, then, should have been charged to <em>Dogan </em>and wife in the division of the proceeds of sale of the land. But it is said, <em>'no </em>proof of the advancement was in the cause at the time of the decree. I think, however, that the defendant having set forth the advances in his answer, it was not necessary that the proof should have been taken, before a reference of the accounts to a commissioner, which, in the regular course of proceeding, ought to have taken place. But the court made no such reference ; and, moreover, cut off at once, by the decree, all evidence as to the advancements claimed in the answer, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>by declaring that they were not to be deducted. <em>Laches, </em>therefore, in exhibiting this evidence, should not be imputed to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">On the whole, I think the decree is erroneous, as it respects the advances to <em>Dogan </em>and wife, but that it isj in other respects, correct upon principle, though it would be advisable to modify it by referring the estimate of the difference between a cash and a credit sale to a commissioner instead of a jury.</p>\n<author id=\"b50-5\">Stanard, <em>J.</em></author>\n<p id=\"AB1\">delivered the following as the opinion and decree of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">That after an interlocutory decree on a hearing deciding matters in issue between the litigant parties has \u2022been rendered, neither of the parties has the absolute right to introduce new evidence in respect to the matter so decided, but the right to introduce and use such evidence as ground for changing or setting aside such decree, depends on the sound judicial discretion of theg comt to which it is offered, and its judgment on the sufficiency of the excuse that may be urged for the failure to have had that testimony before the court when the cause was heard and the decree rendered; and such excuse may be offered to the court, either upon motion or notice to rehear the cause on the new evidence, or by petition for rehearing. That the decree of the court below in this case, is right, so far as it decides that the sale at which the executor was purchaser, was of the Avhole land subject to the widow\u2019s doiver, and not the two thirds thereof not covered by the doAver; and such being the opinion of the majority of the court, Avhether the additional evidence which <em>Moore </em>sought, by his petition for a rehearing, to introduce in the case, be heard or excluded, therefore it is unnecessary to decide on the sufficiency of the excuse offered by him for failing to have that evidence in the case before the interlocutory decree Aims rendered: The decree rightly made <em>Moore </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>chargeable on his purchase with the whole of the land at the rate of 6 dollars 75 cents per acre. That <em>Moore </em>did not conform to his duty in requiring so large a portion of the purchase as was required, to be paid in cash; that while as purchaser he may (as any other purchaser would) at the election of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>be bound for the amount of the purchase money, he is further chargeable to the <em>cestuis que trust </em>for the injury arising from such an improvident sale ; and that the measure of that injury is the difference in the price which the land would have commanded, tested by the dealings of prudent and judicious men, if sold on the usual credit of one, two and three years, in equal instalments, and tho price it commanded at the sale that was made, assuming that the price at which it was purchased was a fair and full price, having reference to the terms of that sale. That, while the court below was right so far as it held <em>Moore </em>accountable to the <em>cestuis que trust </em>for the said difference, that difference could be more conveniently and compendiously ascertained by an enquiry and report of a commissioner than by a trial before a jury; and that that course should be taken on the return of the case to the circuit superior court. That the court below erred in decreeing a division of the proceeds of the sale of the <em>land </em>and thus separating that from the rest of the estate, without an account shewing the state of the administration of the estate, and of the advancements or payments to, and accountabilities of, legatees; that <em>Moore </em>was not in default in not producing previous to the decree, the document shewing, or purporting to shew, the division of the personal estate, and the responsibilities of the legatees to the estate or the executor, that being a document proper to be used before the commissioner who might take the accounts ; that, in taking such accounts, it was competent to <em>Moore, </em>to introduce the evidence to shew the charge by the testator of 500 dollars the value of property delivered to <em>Henry Dogan, </em>the hus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>baud of the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>as an advancement for which she was to be accountable on the division of the estate, and if satisfactory evidence to that effect be introduced, it would be proper to bring that to the charge of the said daughter <em>Elizabeth; </em>and that on the account so to be taken, the decree should be in favour of the legatees respectively, for the balances that may be ascertained to be due, of the aggregate of their respective shares of the real and personal estate. Therefore, the decree, so far as it conflicted with the principles here declared, was reversed, with costs &amp;c. and in other respects approved and af\u00f1rmed, and the cause remanded to the circuit superior court for further proceedings &amp;c.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
