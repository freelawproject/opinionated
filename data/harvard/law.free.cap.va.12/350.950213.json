And 2. Whether, in the division of the subject among the testator\u2019s children and his grandchildren, the grandchildren respectively should take <em>per </em>stirpes, or all the children and grandchildren equally <em>per capita </em>?</summary>\n<summary id=\"b373-4\">The court ordered accounts to be taken, by a commissioner, of the executor\u2019s administration, and of the rents and profits of the testator\u2019s mansion house and plantation, and of the profits of his slaves and other personal estate in Virginia, accrued since the deed of the 19th November 1819 between the testator\u2019s widow and <em>James Hamlett </em>his executor and others: that the commissioner should enquire and report, whether the agreement contained in that deed was beneficial to the infant legatees concerned: that he should enquire and report, what was the present age of <em>Lucy </em>the wife of the testator\u2019s son <em>George Hamlett </em>; and how many children the testator\u2019s son <em>James .Hamlett, </em>and his daughters <em>Mary Jejfress, Patsey Wilson, Nancy Jejfress </em>and <em>Narcissa Jejfress, </em>respectively, had at the testator\u2019s death, and how many they each had now: and that he should present a scheme for the division in three views: 1. Dividing the fund among the residuary legatees <em>per stirpes ; </em>2. dividing it among them <em>per capita, </em>regarding as legatees only such of the children as were born at the time of the testator\u2019s death ; and 3. dividing it among all the children and grandchildren of the testator who were parties to the suit; that is, the testator\u2019s five children and his grandchildren by his other two sons and two daughters, as well those who had been born since the testator\u2019s death as those who were then <em>in esse.</em></summary>\n\n<summary id=\"A8tJ\">Thus it appeared, 1. that if the fund was to be divided among the testator\u2019s legatees, children and grandchildren, <em>per stirpes, </em>it would he divided into <em>nine </em>parts, and each of his five children would take <em>.one ninth, </em>and each of the four sets of grandchildren would take one ninth, to be subdivided among them respectively. 2.

And 3. that if it was to be divided among the testator\u2019s \u00b0 five children and his twenty-six grandchildren born before and since his death, <em>per capita, </em>then it would be divided into <em>thirty-one </em>parts, and each of the children and grandchildren would take one such part.</summary>\n\n<summary id=\"b375-7\">The commissioner also reported, that the agreement contained in the deed of the 19th November 1819, between the testator\u2019s widow and <em>James Hamlett </em>the executor and others, was beneficial to the infant parties concerned.</summary>\n<summary id=\"b375-8\">Upon a hearing of the cause on the report of the commissioner shewing all the matters above stated, the court declared, that all the grandchildren, whether born <em>before </em>or <em>after </em>the testator\u2019s death, who should, at the time for the division of the fund (namely, at the death of the widow), come within any one of the classes described in the will, would be entitled to a share of the fund: that such of the grandchildren as were <em>in esse </em>at the death of the testator took vested and transmissible interests ; such interests being liable, however, to be diminished by the birth of other grandchildren; and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>the afterborn children, so soon as they came <em>in esse, </em>took likewise vested and transmissible interests. That, notwithstanding the cases of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, 2 </em>P. Wms. 383. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>3 Bro. C. C. 367. and <em>Crow </em>v. Crow, 1 Leigh <em>74. </em>upon the intention <em>of </em>this testator, inferred from his intention to make a provision for his whole family, and the inconsiderable part of his estate which his own children would get in a division <em>per capita, </em>the division ought, in this case, to be <em>per stirpes </em>; a view strengthened by the fact that the testator\u2019s \u00f1ve children who were themselves to take as legatees, had children at the time of his death, and indeed large families. And that a division of the fund might be presently made, seeing that, in the ordinary course of nature, no other grandchildren entitled to a share of the fund, could hereafter come <em>in esse. </em>Therefore, the court, after ordering the commissioner\u2019s former report to be reformed in some particulars, directed him to ascertain the exact amount of the fund, and to report a division of the same, <em>per stirpes ; </em>that is, giving one part to each of the testator\u2019s children legatees in the will, and one part to each set of grandchildren legatees, to be subdivided among them, respectively.</summary>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b377-4\">1.

In <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>the testator bequeathed the surplus of his estate <em>equally to </em>^js son <em>james </em>an\u00bf to his son <em>Peter\u2019s </em>children, to his daughter <em>Traverse, </em>and to his daughter <em>Webb\u2019s </em>children, and to his daughter <em>Mann. </em>At the time of making the will, his son <em>Peter </em>was dead, leaving several children ; his daughter <em>Webb </em>was living, but her husband was in low circumstances, having been twice a bankrupt. It is hardly possible that two cases should have actually occurred, more perfectly alike in all material circumstances, than that case and this. It was argued there, as it may be argued here, that it was not likely the testator intended his own children to take no greater share than each of his grandchildren, and that the construction should be according to the statute of distributions. To which it was answered, that such part of the surplus as is given to the grandchildren must be the same, and have the same construction, as if the testator had particularized each grandchild by name, as <em>John, Thomas </em>&amp;c. when there could be no question but that the grandchildren must have taken <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes ; </em>and as to the statute of distributions, as the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Webb </em>was living, her children could take nothing by representation within that statute. Lord chancellor <em>King </em>at first seemed inclinable that the grandchildren should take <em>per stirpes </em>only; but at length he decreed, that the children and grandchildren (being <em>fourteen </em>in number) should each take <em>per capita, </em>as if all the grandchildren had been named by their respective names; and he said, that the grandchildren could not taire according to the statute of distributions, or in allusion thereto, forasmuch as the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Webb </em>was living, and her children could not represent her: and to determine that the grandchildren should take <em>per stirpes </em>would be going too much out of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>wilt, and contrary to the words, when the meaning of the testator might be according to his words, and that meaning a reasonable and sensible one. The decisions of the english courts, from 1716 to 1822, have followed the principle of <em>Blacker v. Webb, </em>with remarkable uniformity and consistency. <em>Northey </em>v. <em>Strange, </em>(decided in 1716) 1 P. Wms. 340. <em>Richardson v. Spraag, </em>(1718) Id. 433. <em>Warner </em>v. <em>Hone, </em>(1718) Prec. in Chan. 4, 91. <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hole, </em>(1728) Ca. Temp. Talb. 251. <em>Lugar </em>v. <em>Harman, </em>(1786) 1 Cox 250. <em>Eccard </em>v. <em>Brooke, </em>(1790) 2 Cox 213. <em>Butler </em>v. <em>Stratton, </em>(1791) 3 Bro. C.

The case last cited is very remarkable : there, the testatrix bequeathed the residue of her property to such of the children of <em>Thomas, Mary, William, Elizabeth </em>and <em>James Hen,ley, </em>as should be born in lawful wedlock and living at her death, <em>or </em>the issue of such of them, as should be <em>married, </em>in equal shares and proportions. At the death of the testatrix, there were two children of <em>Thomas living; </em>he had had a son who had died leaving <em>five </em>children, and a daughter who had died leaving <em>two: </em>these were all living at the death of the testatrix. <em>Mary Henley </em>had <em>one </em>child, <em>William </em>two, and <em>Elizabeth </em>one, all of whom were living at the death of the testatrix, but they had no children. <em>James Henley </em>died before the testatrix, unmarried. It was held, that the word <em>or </em>(in the bequest to the children of the five persons named, <em>or </em>their issue) should be construed to mean <em>and, </em>and the children and. grandchildren were let in to take equal shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-12\">In Virginia, a like case, <em>Tucker Spc. </em>v. <em>Tucker's edors, </em>was before the old general court in 1740, and is reported in <em>Barradall's </em>MS. reports, p. 94. The testator bequeathed: \u201c I give all my ready money and outstanding debts, to be equally divided between <em>Robert Tucker, John Tucker, John Cooke, Robert Cooke, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number><em>Jacob Walker\u2019s </em>children; and in case mr. <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children die before they come of age, that <em>their parts </em>go to the survivor of their children.\u201d <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children were four in number: their mother, who was dead, was related to the testator in equal degree with the <em>Tuckers </em>and <em>Cookes ; </em>they were the testator\u2019s nephews, and she was his niece. It was insisted, on behalf of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children, that the word <em>equally </em>could not be satisfied unless each legatee had an equal share, and there was no difference between naming, and not naming, the children in the will. The general court, after two arguments, decreed that <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children took, collectively, a fifth part among them. But this decree was reversed upon appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Barradall, </em>in a note, says that the reversal, as he was informed, was chiefly by reason of the word <em>parts [their parts, </em>in the plural] in the limitation over to the survivor of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children. But the decision in <em>Blackler </em>,v. <em>Webb, </em>though it was not cited in the general court, had been made some years before, and in the authority of that case, no doubt, the true reason of the reversal is to be found. And, lately, the principle of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb </em>has been followed, and established by this <em>court, in Crow </em>v. <em>Crow, </em>1 Leigh 74.</p>\n\n\n<attorneys id=\"b381-5\"><em>Macfarland </em>and <em>Leigh </em>for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"A1r\">The principle of construction adopted in the case of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb </em>and the other cases cited for the appellants, is not a positive rule of law, a canon of property to be arbitrarily applied, whether it conform with testator\u2019s intention or not, like some of the rules of construction that have been applied in cases of executory devise, and implied estates tail, where a legal construction and effect have been given to a testator\u2019s language, though confessedly different from his actual intention. This case, like most others that arise on wills, presents a question of testamentary intention: and this court has instructed us, that the intention of the testator is the cardinal rule, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>the polar star to guide us in the construction of wills; that the intention is to be carried into effect, provided the dispositions <em>intended </em>do not conflict with the law; and that the intention is to be collected from the circumstances 0f the testator, his estate and family, the situation of the legatees, their relation to and connexion with him, as well as from the words of the will. See the opinions of <em>Pendleton, </em>P. in <em>Shelton\u2019s ex\u2019ors </em>v. <em>Shelton, </em>1 Wash. 556. and in <em>Kennon </em>v. <em>M\u2019Roberts &amp; ux. </em>Id. 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">In the first clause of this testator\u2019s will, he authorizes his wife to lend any part of the property before given her (in effect, his whole estate in Virginia) to such of his <em>children </em>as she should think proper, but if she should lend any part <em>to any of them, </em>the part so loaned should at her decease be returned, in order to make <em>fair and equal division as he should thereafter direct. </em>It was his <em>children, </em>then, for whom he meant to provide; it was among his <em>children </em>that he meant afterwards to direct <em>a fair and equal division.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">Then, consider the situation of his family and the relation of the several legatees to him. Of his own five children to whom he bequeathed shares of his residuary estate, his son <em>James </em>had <em>four </em>children living at his death ; his daughter <em>Mary, seven ; </em>his daughter <em>Patsey, nine ; </em>his daughter <em>Nancy, five ; </em>and his daughter <em>Narcissa, seven: </em>these five children had, then, <em>thirty-two </em>children; and they all might, and some probably would (as two of them in fact did) have more issue. Of his children to whose children he bequeathed shares of the same residuary estate, his son <em>Bedford </em>was dead leaving <em>three </em>children; his son <em>George </em>had <em>four; </em>his daughter <em>Elizabeth, seven: </em>and his daughter <em>Obedience, three; </em>in all <em>eighteen </em>children living at the testator\u2019s death; and <em>George, Elizabeth </em>and <em>Obedience, </em>might and probably would have (as two of them in fact had) more issue born during his widow\u2019s life, who would be let in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>for shares of the same fund. The intention which the court is asked to impute to the testator, is, that he meant to give to each of his own <em>five </em>children, to aid them in the maintenance of their <em>thirty-two </em>children already in existence, and all the children they should afterwards have, exactly the same portion of his estate, as he gave to each of his <em>eighteen </em>grandchildren, then horn, and to each which should he afterwards born, of his other four children. To impute such an intention to the testator, were to violate all probability, and all sense of parental justice by which the testator may fairly be presumed to have been actuated in disposing of his property among his offspring. The estate to be divided was only some 14,600 dollars; and dividing it <em>per </em>capita, there will be <em>thirty-one </em>parts or shares; of which each of the testator\u2019s five children legatees (for themselves and their <em>thirty-two </em>children, and still increasing families) will take one share, and each of his <em>twenty-six </em>grandchildren legatees will take one share. A division <em>per capita, </em>professing to rest on the principle of equality, will perpetrate the grossest and most cruel inequality. If the law imperiously commands this, the law, though common sense revolt at it, must be obeyed. But, happily, there is no such arbitrary rule of law, applicable alike to all testamentary dispositions of the kind; applicable as well where it works plainly contrary to, as where it may conform with, the testator\u2019s apparent intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">The cases cited for the appellants, it must be confessed, seem very strong. But in <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>it does not appear, how many children the testator\u2019s son <em>James </em>and his daughters mrs. <em>Traverse </em>and mrs. <em>Mann, </em>respectively, had, or whether they had any, or how many his daughter mrs. <em>Webb </em>had, or his son <em>Peter </em>left. For aught that appears in the reported state of the case, <em>Peter </em>might have left some three or four, mrs. <em>Webb </em>might have had two, and <em>James, </em>mrs. <em>Traverse </em>and mrs. <em>Mann </em>none. Suppose it had appeared, that <em>James, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>mrs. <em>Traverse </em>and mrs. Mann, had, living at the testator\u2019s death, numerous families, some <em>twenty </em>children in all, and that <em>Peter </em>had left, and mrs. <em>Webb </em>had, some <em>twelve </em>between <em>them; </em>the case would then have been fhis <em>i </em>an(l the like question would have arisen, which arises here, whether it was possible to imagine, that the testator, without any assignable motive, intended to give to his own three children, to enable them to rear and support their numerous families, exactly the same portion which he gave to each of his grandchildren by his son <em>Peter </em>and daughter mrs. <em>Webb </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In <em>Horridge </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>the bequest was to and among \u201c such <em>of </em>the children of <em>Thomas, Mary, William, Elizabeth </em>and <em>James Henley </em>as should be born in wedlock and living at the decease of the testatrix, <em>or </em>the issue of such of them as should be married.\u201d If the bequest had been to the issue of such of them as should be <em>dead, </em>the court would have had no doubt, that the issue of such as were dead should take <em>per stirpes, </em>instead of the deceased parents. But the court thought that it was too much to interpret \u201c the issue of such as were married,\u201d to mean \u201cthe issue <em>of </em>such as were deadthat, according <em>to </em>the strict grammatical <em>meaning of </em>the words, the issue were to take instead of their parents, in some <em>event not expressed ; </em>which would render the bequest uncertain. Yet the testatrix intended that the <em>issue </em>were to take; and to let them in, it was necessary to construe the word <em>or </em>to mean <em>and. </em>If the word <em>or </em>was taken in its literal sense, such of the children as were <em>married </em>and living at the testatrix\u2019s death, would have been cut out entirely. It was necessary, either to understand the word <em>or </em>to mean <em>and, </em>or the word <em>married </em>to mean <em>dead: </em>and the court preferred the former alternative, and then it was clear the issue came in <em>per capita. </em>The court said, \u201c by understanding the word <em>or </em>grammatically, you cannot make sense of the passage without inserting something else; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>but by using that latitude of construction which the court has been in the habit of resorting to, and converting it into <em>and, </em>the whole is made consistent, and all the members of the family are let in.\u201d Besides, it seems, the testatrix there was not providing for her own family, and was under no moral duty to have regard to the situation of the legatees in dispensing her bounty among them: she was not providing for <em>Thomas, Mary, William, Elizabeth </em>and <em>James Henley, </em>or for any of them, but for the children and other offspring of them all.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b385-6\">In <em>Tucker &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Tucker\u2019s ex\u2019ors, </em>the bequest was of a fund <em>\u201c </em>to be equally divided between <em>Robert Tucker, John Tucker, John Cooke, Robert Cooke\u201d </em>[nephews of the testator] \u201c and <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children\u201d [children of his niece]; <em>\u201c </em>and in case <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children should die before they came of age, then <em>their parts </em>to go to the survivor.\u201d The general court decreed, that <em>Walker\u2019s </em>four children should take one fifth part <em>\u25a0per stirpem. \u201c </em>But note this,\u201d says <em>Barradall, </em>\u201cthe decree was reversed upon an appeal, and chiefly, as I have been informed, by reason of the word <em>parts </em>in the limitation over to the survivor of <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children.\u201d Mr. <em>Robinson </em>thinks, that the reason for the reversal is to be found in the authority of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb. </em>It may have been so: but <em>Barradall </em>was likely to be well informed: he himself argued the cause in the general court; and mr. <em>Jefferson </em>says, he was one \u201c of the most eminent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>counsel at that bar.\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> And the reason on which <em>Barradall </em>was informed the reversal was chiefly grounded, seems a natural and sufficient one: the language of the limitation over shewed that <em>Walker\u2019s </em>children were not t0 ta^e collectively <em>one part, </em>but <em>\u201cparts\u201d </em>(in the plural), and if more than one, then certainly four parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><em>Crow </em>v. <em>Crow </em>is certainly not a decisive authority for the appellants. The testator there bequeathed: <em>\u201c </em>The balance of my slaves shall be <em>equally divided </em>among <em>nvy children, </em>to wit, the heirs of <em>William Crow, </em>namely, <em>William, Robert, Patsey, Nancy, Henry, Ennis </em>and <em>John </em>(heirs of <em>William Crow </em>deceased), <em>Thomas, Moses, </em>and <em>John Crow, </em>and the children of my deceased daughter <em>Massey Jones, </em>and the children of my deceased daughter <em>Sarah Crane </em>; but the children of my daughter <em>Jones </em>are to take only such part as their mother would take if she was alive, that is to say, a child\u2019s part, and in like manner the children of my daughter <em>Crane </em>are to take only such part as their mother would take if she was alive, that is to say, a child\u2019s part.\u201d The question was, whether the seven children of the testator\u2019s deceased son <em>William, </em>should take collectively one part among them, or take <em>per capita </em>seven out of twelve parts? The county court and the chancellor held, that they should take <em>per stirpes; </em>this <em>court </em>that they should take <em>per capita; Green, </em>J. dissenting. The case of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>and other english cases of the same class, were indeed cited, and the general principle they proceeded upon, stated and approved. Yet this court did not rest its decree, merely or mainly, upon the authority of those cases, but rather on the particular provisions of the will before them: namely, that the testator mentioned the seven children of his son <em>William </em>by name, as his own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>children; and then (which was the most influential consideration) he expressly provided, that the children of his daughter mrs. <em>Jones, </em>and those of his daughter mrs. <em>Crane, </em>respectively, should take <em>per stirpes, </em>but did not provide, that the children of his son <em>William </em>should 1 ike wise take <em>per stirpes ; </em>whence the court inferred the intention, that <em>William\u2019s </em>children should take <em>per capita. </em>And it was on this peculiar circumstance in that case, that the decision Avas mainly founded. There is nothing like it in our case.</p>\n\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Evidence was adduced, by the appellants (it seems), of the value of the lands which had been advanced by the testator, in his lifetime, to his sons <em>James </em>and <em>George, </em>and of the value of the lands devised to his son <em>James, </em>to his two grandsons <em>D. </em>and <em>iS. Major, </em>and to his two grandsons <em>Thomas </em>and <em>James Hamlett. </em>If the object for Avhich this evidence Avas adduced, was. to shew a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>reason why the testator should make a greater provision for the several sets of grandchildren legatees, than for the children legatees, it is nothing to the purpose. For though land was advanced and land devised to the son <em>james </em>no land was advanced or devised to the daughters <em>Mary, Patsey, Nancy </em>and <em>Narcissa, </em>who are certainly to take an equal share with <em>James, </em>of the residuary estate, whatever that share may be; land had been advanced to <em>George, </em>yet <em>George\u2019s </em>children born and to be born before the widow\u2019s death, were to have a share or shares of the <em>residuum; </em>and lands were devised to two sons of the testator\u2019s son <em>Bedford, </em>and to two sons of his daughter <em>Obedience, </em>and yet they are made legatees of the <em>residuum, </em>along with the other child of <em>Bedford </em>and the other children <em>of Obedience.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Evidence, too, was adduced by the appellants to shew that the testator\u2019s five children legatees, were all in easy circumstances, whereas, of the children whose children were made legatees, <em>Bedford </em>had died insolvent; <em>George </em>was living, and was needy and improvident; the husband of his daughter <em>Averett </em>was also needy and improvident; and the husband of his daughter <em>Obedience, </em>though industrious and provident, was supposed to be embarrassed: and the purpose of this evidence was, apparently, to assign a motive which might have induced the testator to make a more liberal provision for the four needy branches of his family, than for the five who were well to do in the world; to give to his children legatees a pittance (a pittance, having regard to their numerous and probably increasing families) and to give the same bounty to each of the children of his other four children, which, as to them, was comparatively a large provision. The circumstance may indeed explain the reason why the testator bequeathed portions of his estate to five of his children, and other portions to his grandchildren instead of their parents; but it shews no motive for making a more liberal provision for the latter than for the former. He gave portions of his estate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>bis five children, because they would probably improve his bounty to the advantage of their families: he gave other portions to the children of his other children, because, if he gave them to their parents, they might probably be wasted by those that were both needy and improvident, and applied to the payment of the debts of those who were embarrassed; so that neither they nor their families would enjoy his bounty. If all his children, or their husbands, had been equally provident and equally unembarrassed, he would have given his estate in equal portions to his nine children; if all had been equally improvident and wasteful, or equally embarrassed xvith debt, ho would have given his estate to the children of them all. A consideration of the situation of the several branches of the testator\u2019s family, affords a strong argument that the decree of the circuit superior court conforms with the testator\u2019s real intention, and is right.</p>\n\n\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-5\"> The appeal from the general court was to the king in council.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b370-5\">Richmond.</p><p id=\"b370-3\">1841. <em>May.</em></p><p id=\"b370-8\">1.

That the testator\u2019s son <em>James Hamlett </em>had <em>four </em>children living at the testator\u2019s death: that his daughter <em>Mary, </em>wife <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>of <em>Thomas Jeffress, </em>had severe\u2019children, all horn before -the testator\u2019s death: that his daughter <em>Patsey, </em>wife of <em>James Wilson, </em>had <em>twelve </em>children, <em>nine </em>of whom were born before his death: that his daughter <em>Nancy, </em>wife <em>Richard Jeffress, </em>had <em>six </em>children, <em>five </em>born <em>before his death, </em>and <em>one since </em>born: and that the testator\u2019s daughter <em>Narcissa, </em>wife of <em>Coleman Jeffress, </em>had severe children, all born before the testator\u2019s death. So that the testator\u2019s children who were residuary legatees, each and all had children, and all together <em>thirty-two </em>children, and two of his daughters were of that age that they, as well as the son <em>James, </em>might and would probably have more issue. 2. That the testator\u2019s son <em>George </em>had by his wife <em>Irucy, seven </em>children, <em>four of </em>whom were born <em>before </em>the testator\u2019s death, and <em>three since </em>born, and that <em>Lucy, </em>the wife, was now fifty-six years old and her youngest-child was born in 1823, and therefore, probably, past child-bearing: that his daughter <em>Elizabeth, </em>wife of <em>William Averett, </em>had <em>seven </em>children all born before the testator\u2019s death: that his son <em>Bedford, </em>who died before the testator, left three children living at the testator\u2019s death: and that his daughter <em>Obedience </em>had been twice married, first to <em>William Major, </em>and then to <em>James Faulkner, </em>and that she had <em>eight </em>children -of both marriages, <em>three </em>born <em>before </em>and <em>five after </em>the testator\u2019s death. So that, of the testator\u2019s grandchildren who were made residuary legatees, there were in all <em>eighteen </em>living at his death, and <em>five </em>since born; and two at least of his children, to whose children he bequeathed shares, might be expected to have more issue.</p><p id=\"b375-6\">The fund in hand at the time of this report was .14,305 dollars 87 cents: of which, upon the first principle, each of the testator\u2019s five children would get 1589 dollars 31 cents, and each of the four sets'of grandchildren the same sum to be subdivided among them respectively. Upon the second principle, the share quoted to each <em>of the </em>testator\u2019s five children and each of his <em>eighteen </em>grandchildren born before his death, was 621 dollars 90 cents. And upon the third principle, the share quoted to each of the testator\u2019s five children and <em>twenty-six </em>grandchildren born before and since his death, was 421 dollars 41 cents.</p><p id=\"b376-7\">The commissioner reported that the whole fund was now 14,619 dollars 9 cents; which was divided into nine shares of 1624 dollars 34 cents each: and one share was assigned to the testator\u2019s son <em>James Hamlett; </em>one to <em>Richard Jeffress </em>and <em>Nancy </em>his wife; one to <em>Coleman Jeffress </em>and <em>Narcissa </em>his wife; one to <em>Mary Jeffress, </em>whose husband died pending the suit; and one to <em>James Wilson </em>administrator of his wife <em>Patsey </em>who was now dead: one to the children of <em>Elizabeth Averett, </em>subdivided into <em>eight </em>parts; one to the children of <em>Obedience Faulkner, </em>subdivided into <em>eight </em>parts; one to the children of <em>Bedford Hamlett, </em>subdivided into <em>three </em>parts; and one to the children of <em>George Hamlett, </em>subdivided into <em>seven </em>parts.</p><p id=\"b377-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>After the interlocutory decree was made, several depositions were taken by the plaintiffs, which were returned with the commissioner\u2019s last report. The evidence they contained was quite vague; but it might be inferred from the depositions, collated with each other\u2014\u25a0</p><p id=\"b377-7\">The grandchildren applied by petition to this court for an appeal from the decree; Avhich Avas alloAved.</p><p id=\"b380-4\">The principle is correctly stated in 2 Powell on Devises, p. 331. That where a devise or bequest is made to a person described as standing in a certain relation to the testator, and to the children of another person standing in the same relation, as to my brother <em>A. </em>and the children of my brother <em>B. </em>the legatees take <em>per capita </em>and not per <em>stirpes: A. </em>only takes a share equal to one of the children of <em>B. </em>though it may be conjectured that the testator had a distribution according to the statute of distributions in his mind. The court will find, on examination of the adjudged cases, that the principle has been applied to cases presenting every variety of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>circumstances; that it has been equally applied, whether the persons whose children were made legatees, were dead or alive, or some dead and some living j and that it has never, in any instance, been controlled by a regard to the number of children which the testator\u2019s children, brothers &amp;c. made legatees by description of classes, had at the time, and the number of the other legatees made so by name. And the reason on which the principle is founded, is, that all the persons to whom the bequest extends, are considered as entitled to take in like manner as if they were named; and all are considered as taking directly in their own right, and none by way of representation.</p><p id=\"b381-4\">This principle of construction has been so long established, and so uniformly applied, in so many cases, and those so variously circumstanced, that it has become a canon of property and ought not now to be disturbed or departed from. It was wisely established at <em>first; </em>but even if it was not, <em>\u201c </em>it is better the law should be certain than that every judge should speculate upon it so said lord <em>Eldon </em>in <em>Sheddon </em>v. <em>Goodrich, </em>8 Ves. 497. in reference to a much more questionable doctrine than this: and many other judges have affirmed the same maxim of judicial wisdom.</p><p id=\"b385-5\">All the english cases that have been cited, are open to similar commentaries. And in respect to them all, it will be found, on examination, that the courts have by no means designed to lay down any fixed inflexible rule of construction, but have adopted that construction, which, upon the circumstances, appeared most just.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b387-5\">It is to be remarked, that in all the cases which have been referred to, the bequest was to take effect immediately on the testator\u2019s death, Avhen all the legatees named, or described by classes, would be ascertained, and the aliquot parts they were each to take, would of course be also ascertained. But in this case, the division of the fund was postponed till the death or marriage of the testator\u2019s widow: his five children named legatees Avere known, and they Avere to have their aliquot parts, Avithout regard to their numerous families, or any future increase thereof; but liis four children\u2019s children Avho were to take as legatees, could not be known till the AvidoAv\u2019s death. Upon the principle of a division <em>per capita, </em>the aliquot parts of the testator\u2019s own children Avould be liable to continual diminution, and the aggregate shares of each of three sets of the grandchildren legatees, would be continually increasing. The testator could not have intended to give his five children such small portions of his estate, and even those small portions subject to eventual and probably great diminution.</p><p id=\"b389-4\">The president announced the unanimous opinion of tbe court, that the decree should be affirmed, but the reasons of the opinion were not stated.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p><p id=\"b389-5\">Decree affirmed.</p><p id=\"b385-8\"> The counsel went into a critical examination of the whole class of cases: but it is not necessary to report their comments on them all.</p><p id=\"b386-5\"><em> </em>See preface to Jefferson\u2019s reports. That small volume contains Barradall\u2019s reports of cases which depended on our own colonial laws, but not of the cases which depended on questions of law or equity common to both the mother country and the colony. Therefore, mr. Jefferson has not included the case of <em>Tucker &amp;c. </em>v. <em>Tucker's ex'ors.</em></p><p id=\"b389-6\"><em> </em>Tlie decree was pronounced at a very late day of the term. The president told tlie reporter, that a written opinion had. been prepared, wliich was mislaid. It has never been found. Considering the interesting question involved, its doubtfulness, and the weight ami apparent application of the authority of <em>Bladder </em>v. <em>Webb </em>and tlie other cases of that class, it is much to be regretted, that the reasons of the decision of the court are lost to the profession. The reporter learned, in conversation with the judges, that, upon the particular circumstances, they thought this testator intended a division of the subject among the legatees <em>per stirpes, </em>and that there was nothing in the authorities which required the court to disregard the intention in this case more than in any other cases of testamentary disposition. He inferred, that the court saw reasons to distinguish this case from those of <em>Blackler </em>v. <em>Webb, Crow </em>v. <em>Crow, </em>&amp;c. not to deny, or shake, tlie authority of those adjudications.</p></opinion></casebody>\n</body></html>"}}
