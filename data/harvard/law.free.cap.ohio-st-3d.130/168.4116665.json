We conclude that the discharged employee, appellee, Randall J. Dohme, has not established that he meets the requirements that are necessary to maintain his claim for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">I. Facts and Procedure</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 2} Dohme began working for appellant, Eurand America, Inc., in 2001. He held two positions at Eurand America until the termination of his employment in March 2003. His first position was as engineering supervisor. In this position, Dohme was responsible for supervising the performance of engineering technicians and team leaders. Thereafter, Dohme was named the facilities administrator, and his job responsibilities included maintaining the plant fire-protection system. Dohme asserts that although his title or job description never changed, his duties with Eurand America during the last three months of his employment consisted of merely tracking the tools and parts used by the maintenance department.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 3} Eurand America fired Dohme in 2003. Dohme contends that Eurand America fired him because he had expressed concerns about the safety of the Eurand workplace to outside parties. One incident occurred in 2002 when Dohme discussed with his neighbor, a captain with the local fire department, the design of a pump, which Dohme believed had started a fire at the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 4} Dohme asserts that in 2003 he also communicated his workplace-safety concerns to an insurance adjuster who conducted an on-site evaluation of Eurand America\u2019s facility to assess the building and its operations. Dohme contends that this particular communication to an outside party underlies his claim of wrongful termination in violation of public policy; i.e., he was terminated because of his \u201cperceived role in an on-site insurance adjuster\u2019s discovery of certain violations relative to [Eurand America\u2019s] fire alarm system, which * * * jeopardized workplace safety and placed employees in [an] unreasonable and dangerous setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 5} For its part, Eurand America states that it terminated Dohme for insubordination. Eurand America states that prior to the insurance adjuster\u2019s visit, it sent an interoffice e-mail to all its employees. This interoffice e-mail explained that the facility would be inspected by the adjuster and that only certain employees of Eurand America, who were identified by Eurand America in that e-mail, were to have contact with the adjuster. Dohme was not identified in the interoffice e-mail as one of the employees who would be speaking with the adjuster.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Dohme spoke with the adjuster nevertheless. Dohme told the adjuster that he could not locate an internal monthly report detailing overdue fire-alarm inspections. Dohme stated to the adjuster that \u201che might want to find out what happened with that [fire] inspection [that was removed from the computer system].\u201d Dohme believed that someone at Eurand America purposefully made the fire inspection report disappear and someone was \u201ctrying to make it look like\u201d Dohme was not doing his job, even though he had been told to concentrate on the location and labeling of spare parts. Dohme stated that his interaction with the adjuster took place despite, as characterized by Dohme, Eurand America\u2019s active attempts to \u201cprevent employee communication with said adjuster pursuant to an interoffice email sent by management personnel to all employees, including [Dohme], days prior to the adjuster\u2019s arrival, which expressly prohibited communication with said adjuster.\u201d It was Dohme\u2019s plain disregard of this express directive from Eurand America that resulted in the allegation of insubordination.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 7} The trial court granted summary judgment to Eurand America on Dohme\u2019s claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. The trial court based its decision on Dohme\u2019s failure to articulate a specific clear public policy that was jeopardized by his termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 8} The appellate court reversed. <em>Dohme v. Eurand Am., Inc., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 593, 2007-Ohio-865, 868 N.E.2d 701, \u00b6 39. The court concluded that because there was a clear public policy generally favoring fire safety in the workplace, retaliation against employees who raise concerns over fire safety violates public policy. The court found irrelevant Dohme\u2019s motive for reporting the safety concerns. The appellate court also concluded that the public policy favoring workplace fire safety was jeopardized by Dohme\u2019s discharge, id. at \u00b6 24, contrary to the trial court\u2019s ruling that the issue was moot because Dohme failed to articulate a specific public policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 9} Eurand America appealed, and we first accepted jurisdiction in 2007. 114 Ohio St.3d 1424, 2007-Ohio-2904, 868 N.E.2d 679. The propositions of law we accepted addressed the clarity and the jeopardy elements of the tort of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Id.; 119 Ohio St.3d 1471, 2008-Ohio-4911, 894 N.E.2d 331. However, prior to issuing an opinion in that appeal, we discovered that there was no final, appealable order by the trial court, which is a prerequisite for appellate court jurisdiction over an appeal. Consequently, we vacated the judgment of the court of appeals and remanded the cause to the trial court for further proceedings. 121 Ohio St.3d 277, 2009-Ohio-506, 903 N.E.2d 1174.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 10} On remand, a final, appealable order was issued by the trial court, and the ease was again appealed to the Second District Court of Appeals. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>appellate court adopted its prior decision in favor of Dohme in its entirety. 189 Ohio App.3d 343, 2010-Ohio-3905, 938 N.E.2d 417, \u00b6 8. Eurand America appealed, and we again accepted jurisdiction over the same propositions of law. 127 Ohio St.3d 1502, 2011-Ohio-19, 939 N.E.2d 1266.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">II. Analysis: Wrongful Discharge in Violation of Public Policy</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 11} In Ohio, the common-law doctrine of employment at will governs employment relationships. The act of terminating an at-will employee\u2019s relationship with an employer usually does not give rise to an action for damages. <em>Collins v. Rizkana </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 65, 67, 652 N.E.2d 653; <em>Mers v. Dispatch Printing Co. </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 100, 19 OBR 261, 483 N.E.2d 150, paragraph one of the syllabus. However, if an employee is discharged or disciplined in contravention of a clear public policy articulated in the Ohio or United States Constitution, federal or state statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or common law, a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy may exist as an exception to the general rule. <em>Painter v. Graley </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 377, 639 N.E.2d 51, paragraph three of the syllabus; <em>Greeley v. Miami Valley Maintenance Contrs., Inc. </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 228, 551 N.E.2d 981, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 12} The elements of a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-9\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c \u20181. That clear public policy existed and was manifested in a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulation, or in the common law (the <em>clarity </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c <em>\u20182. </em>That dismissing employees under circumstances like those involved in the plaintiffs dismissal would jeopardize the public policy (the <em>jeopardy </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c \u20183. The plaintiffs dismissal was motivated by conduct related to the public policy (the <em>causation </em>element).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-12\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c \u20184. The employer lacked overriding legitimate business justification for the dismissal (the <em>overriding jiostification </em>element).\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Painter, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, fn. 8, quoting Perritt, The Future of Wrongful Dismissal Claims: Where Does Employer Self-Interest Lie? (1989), 58 U.Cin.L.Rev. 397, 398-399. See also <em>Leininger v. Pioneer Natl. Latex, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 311, 2007-Ohio-4921, 875 N.E.2d 36, \u00b6 8-12.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-13\">{\u00b6 17} The clarity and jeopardy elements of the <em>Painter </em>test are issues of law for the court\u2019s determination; the causation and overriding-justification elements are questions for determination by the fact-finder. <em>Collins, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 70, 652 N.E.2d 653.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>{\u00b6 18} In an action claiming wrongful termination, the terminated employee must assert and prove a clear public policy deriving from the state or federal constitutions, a statute or administrative regulation, or the common law. <em>Leininger, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 311, 2007-Ohio-4921, 875 N.E.2d 36, \u00b6 16. See also id. at \u00b6 9, quoting <em>Painter, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 384, 639 N.E.2d 51, fn. 8, quoting Perritt, 58 U.Cin.L.Rev. at 398-399; <em>Sutton v. Tomco Machining, Inc., </em>129 Ohio St.3d 153, 2011-Ohio-2723, 950 N.E.2d 938, \u00b6 11 (identifying R.C. 4123.90 as the source of Ohio\u2019s public policy against retaliatory employment actions after an injury on the job). \u201cClear public policies\u201d have been recognized in a variety of circumstances. Cf. 2 Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law and Practice (5th Ed. 2006) 7-32 to 7-32.8, Section 7.05[A] (listing public policies asserted by plaintiffs in other jurisdictions to support a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, including assisting investigations, permitting Occupational Safety and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) complaints, ensuring public safety, and eliminating unsafe working conditions). Other states have similarly required that the clear public policy supporting the wrongful-discharge claim must be plainly manifested within a state or federal constitution, statute or administrative regulations, or in the common law and that the plaintiff must identify the specific expression of public policy. See, e.g., <em>Turner v. Mem. Med. Ctr. </em>(2009), 233 Ill.2d 494, 502-503, 331 Ill.Dec. 548, 911 N.E.2d 369; <em>Gardner v. Loomis Armored Inc. </em>(1996), 128 Wash.2d 931, 941, 913 P.2d 377; <em>Birthisel v. Tri-Cities Health Servs. Corp. </em>(1992), 188 W.Va. 371, 377, 424 S.E.2d 606.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 19} In this case, we conclude, as did the trial court, that Dohme failed to meet his requisite burden to articulate, by citation of its source, a specific public policy that Eurand America violated when it discharged him. Dohme\u2019s complaint simply alleged that Eurand America\u2019s actions \u201cjeopardized workplace safety.\u201d Eurand America asserted in its motion for summary judgment that Dohme has not identified a public policy applicable to the incident. Dohme, the nonmoving party, then had the reciprocal burden of articulating, by citation of its source, a specific clear public policy. See <em>Mitseff v. Wheeler </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 112, 526 N.E.2d 798, syllabus (\u201cA party seeking summary judgment must specifically delineate the basis upon which summary judgment is sought in order to allow the opposing party a meaningful opportunity to respond\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 20} In Dohme\u2019s materials opposing summary judgment, he recited syllabus language from <em>Pytlinski v. Brocar Prods., Inc. </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 77, 760 N.E.2d 385: \u201cOhio public policy favoring workplace safety is an independent basis upon which a cause of action for wrongful discharge in violation of public policy may be prosecuted.\u201d Although Dohme contended that under <em>Pytlinski, </em>no further articulation, by citation of its source, of a clear public policy was required, he additionally cited the plurality opinion of <em>Kulch v. Structural Fibers, Inc. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 134, 152, 677 N.E.2d 308, which cites several statutes outlining an employer\u2019s general duty to provide a safe workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b621} As the nonmovant, Dohme must show that the issue to be tried is genuine and may not rely merely upon the pleadings or upon unsupported allegations. <em>Shaw v. J. Pollock &amp; Co. </em>(1992), 82 Ohio App.3d 656, 659, 612 N.E.2d 1295. The mere citation of the syllabus in <em>Pytlinski </em>is insufficient to meet the burden of articulating a clear public policy of workplace safety. Further, Dohme only generally mentioned or identified any legal basis for a statewide policy for workplace health and safety. Dohme did not cite any specific statement of law in support of his claim of public policy that was drawn from the federal or state constitution, federal or state statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or common law. In contrast, the <em>Pytlinski </em>and <em>Kulch </em>plaintiffs both alleged that their respective employers had violated federal OSHA regulations. <em>Pytlinski, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 78, 760 N.E.2d 385 (the terminated employee alleged that he had delivered a memorandum to his employer detailing the violations of OSHA regulations that were occurring at the workplace); <em>Kulch, </em>78 Ohio St.3d at 135, 677 N.E.2d 308 (the terminated employee alleged that after his verbal complaints of the health violations within the workplace were rebuffed by the employer, he had filed a written report with OSHA, which resulted in an on-site inspection and OSHA finding several violations of its standards). Thus, Dohme failed to establish the existence of a clear public policy applicable to him in this matter. Cf. <em>Lesko v. Riverside Methodist Hosp., </em>10th Dist. No. 04AP-1130, 2005-Ohio-3142, \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 22} Similarly unavailing is Dohme\u2019s reliance on the appellate court\u2019s sua sponte articulation of a public policy favoring workplace fire safety, which was supported by citation of various state and federal statutes and regulations. <em>Dohme v. Eurand Am., Inc., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 593, 2007-Ohio-865, 868 N.E.2d 701, \u00b6 24. As the plaintiff, Dohme has the obligation to specify the sources of law that support the public policy he relies upon in his claim. Because Dohme did not back up his assertion of a public policy of workplace safety in his summary-judgment documents with specific sources of law, he has not articulated the clarity element with specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 23} Unless the plaintiff asserts a public policy and identifies federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, regulations, or common law that support the policy, a court may not presume to sua sponte identify the source of that policy. There may be valid reasons for a plaintiffs failure to identify and assert a specific public policy or a specific source for that public policy. An appellate court may not fill in the blanks on its own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 24} Based on the foregoing, we conclude that to satisfy the clarity element of a claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy, a terminated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>employee must articulate a clear public policy by citation of specific provisions in the federal or state constitution, federal or state statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or common law. A general reference to workplace safety is insufficient to meet the clarity requirement. Dohme has not asserted or proven for the purposes of satisfying the clarity element the existence of a clear Ohio public policy supported by specific citations so as to overcome a motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">{\u00b6 25} Dohme has failed to establish that his discharge was in contravention of a clear public policy articulated in the Ohio or United States Constitution, federal or state statutes, administrative rules and regulations, or common law, and his action must fail because establishment of the clarify element is essential to the survival of his remaining claims. Because Dohme\u2019s claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy fails for lack of proof of a specific clear public policy, Eurand America is entitled to summary judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 26} Although Eurand America has asserted two additional propositions of law in this appeal, we do not reach those issues, because our determination on the proposition of law involving the clarity element has fully resolved this matter. Because the court does not need to reach the issue of whether Eurand America\u2019s termination of Dohme jeopardized a public policy, we decline to do so. See <em>Meyer v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>122 Ohio St.3d 104, 2009-Ohio-2463, 909 N.E.2d 106, \u00b6 53; <em>PDK Laboratories, Inc. v. United States Drug Enforcement Administration </em>(C.A.D.C.2004), 362 F.3d 786, 799 (Roberts, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\u201cif it is not necessary to decide more, it is necessary not to decide more\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 27} It is well settled that this court does not issue advisory opinions. <em>State ex rel. White v. Kilbane Koch, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 395, 2002-Ohio-4848, 775 N.E.2d 508, \u00b6 18, citing <em>State ex rel. Baldzicki v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Elections </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 238, 242, 736 N.E.2d 893 and <em>Egan v. Natl. Distillers &amp; Chem. Corp. </em>(1986), 25 Ohio St.3d 176, 25 OBR 243, 495 N.E.2d 904, syllabus. Accordingly, we dismiss, sua sponte, the propositions of law concerning the jeopardy element of the claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy as having been improvidently accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">{\u00b6 28} In sum, Dohme has not articulated a clear public policy applicable to his claim of wrongful discharge in violation of public policy. Because Dohme failed to establish the clarity element of his claim, the appellate court erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Eurand America. Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A0G\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>Duwel Law, David M.
