Galloway Jr., for writs of mandamus and procedendo to compel appellees, Lucas County Court of Common Pleas and Judge Denise Ann Dartt, to issue judgments in his criminal cases that comply with Crim.R. 32(C) and constitute final, appealable orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-14\">{\u00b6 2} The sentencing entries in Galloway\u2019s criminal cases fully complied with Crim.R. 32(C) by including the jury verdicts upon which the convictions are based, the sentence, and the signature of the judge and by being entered on the journal by the clerk of court. See <em>State ex rel. Peterson v. Durkin, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 213, 2011-Ohio-2639, 951 N.E.2d 381, \u00b6 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-15\">{\u00b6 3} Moreover, insofar as Galloway claims that one of his sentencing entries did not properly reflect the jury\u2019s verdict, he raises mere error, and he had an adequate remedy by appeal to raise the issue. See generally <em>Manns v. Gan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number><em>sheimer, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 251, 2008-Ohio-851, 883 N.E.2d 431, \u00b6 6 (\u201csentencing errors are not jurisdictional and are not remediable * * * by extraordinary writ\u201d); <em>State ex rel. Jelinek v. Schneider, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 332, 2010-Ohio-5986, 939 N.E.2d 847, \u00b6 13 (neither mandamus nor procedendo will issue if the relator has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AgW\">Carlos G.

Borell, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">{\u00b6 4} Finally, any error regarding the imposition of court costs can be challenged by appeal. <em>State ex rel. Whittenberger v. Clarke </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 207, 208, 729 N.E.2d 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">{\u00b6 5} Therefore, the court of appeals properly denied Galloway\u2019s request for extraordinary relief in mandamus and procedendo, and we affirm that judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b493-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
