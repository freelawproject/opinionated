VI. <em>In re Attorney Registration Suspension of Brown, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1475, 2009-Ohio-5786, 915 N.E.2d 1256. Brown is still under this suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">{\u00b6 3} Between June 29, 2009, and January 14, 2010, three separate grievances were filed against Brown with relator, Cleveland Metropolitan Bar Association. On July 14, 2009, and February 16, 2010, Brown submitted cursory responses to these grievances to relator. Brown was deposed by relator on March 10, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-14\">{\u00b6 4} On June 14, 2010, relator filed a three-count complaint with the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline charging Brown with professional misconduct. The charged misconduct arose from his alleged (1) neglect of client matters, (2) failure to communicate with clients and respond to their requests for information, (3) failure to properly maintain and deliver client funds and property, (4) failure to provide competent representation, and (5) conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-15\">{\u00b6 5} The board sent notice of relator\u2019s complaint to Brown and requested his written answer within 20 days of June 17, 2010. The board, however, was unable to serve Brown at his place of employment or his residence. The board thereafter perfected service on September 7, 2010, through the clerk of the Supreme Court pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(11)(B) (clerk is agent for attorney who conceals his or her whereabouts).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>{\u00b6 6} Brown did not file an answer to the complaint. On February 14, 2011, relator filed a motion for default judgment pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). In support of its motion for default, relator submitted affidavits of the grievants, affidavits of two of relator\u2019s staff attorneys, letters from Brown to relator acknowledging that he was aware of the grievances filed against him, and a transcript of Brown\u2019s deposition. Relator also submitted evidence showing that between late November and early December 2010, Brown communicated with relator through a series of telephone calls and e-mails, showing that Brown had actual knowledge of the complaint filed against him and that he had missed the date for filing his answer with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">{\u00b6 7} A master commissioner appointed by the board granted relator\u2019s motion for default judgment, making findings of fact and conclusions of law that Brown had engaged in misconduct and recommending that he be permanently disbarred from the practice of law. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law. The board, however, disagreed with the recommendation that Brown should be permanently disbarred and instead recommended that he be indefinitely suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">{\u00b6 8} We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law and its recommendation of an indefinite suspension. We further order that Brown\u2019s indefinite suspension be served consecutively to his attorney-registration suspension, meaning that he cannot petition for reinstatement until two years from the date he resolves his attorney-registration suspension.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b434-7\">\n<em>Count One (The Stewart Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">{\u00b6 9} In February 2009, Marilyn J. Stewart hired Brown to file a motion to modify child support on her behalf. Stewart wanted to increase the amount of child support she was receiving so that her children would be able to remain in a childcare program at their school. Stewart paid Brown a $700 fee for the first five hours of work. Brown, however, assured Stewart that he would not require five hours of legal work to resolve the matter and that he would return any unused funds to her. Brown also promised Stewart that he would provide a weekly accounting of the services rendered, amount billed, and remaining balance, but he never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">{\u00b6 10} Brown told Stewart that he had filed her petition with the court when in fact he had not. Stewart, relying on Brown\u2019s representations, committed to making payments to the school\u2019s childcare program. As a result of Brown\u2019s failure to take any action regarding Stewart\u2019s child-support matter, she was eventually unable to make the necessary payments to the school, and her children could not be enrolled in the childcare program for the following school year.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Stewart made numerous attempts to contact Brown, but he never returned her calls. On May 6, 2009, Stewart sent Brown a letter by certified mail expressing her dissatisfaction with his conduct and requesting an update on her ease and the weekly ledgers that he had promised her. Stewart received no response to her letter. Stewart sent a second certified letter to Brown on June 10, 2009, terminating the attorney-client relationship and requesting a full refund of the $700 fee that she had paid him.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">{\u00b6 12} On July 14, 2009, relator received a letter from Brown in response to Stewart\u2019s disciplinary grievance. In his letter, he conceded that he had let \u201cMs. Stewart\u2019s concerns slip[ ] thru [sic] the cracks * * * [and he agreed to] refund her retainer in full.\u201d Brown stated that he had \u201cno excuse for neglecting Ms. Stewart\u2019s matter\u201d and offered to \u201cperform the work requested free of charge and cover all expenses necessary.\u201d On March 10, 2010 \u2014 nearly eight months later\u2014 Brown gave a deposition during which he admitted that he still had not returned Stewart\u2019s $700. He again stated that he would return the money, but there is no evidence in the record that he has done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">{\u00b6 13} The board found, and we agree, that Brown violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.3 (requiring a lawyer to act with reasonable diligence in representing a client), 1.4(a)(3) (requiring a lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter), 1.4(a)(4) (requiring a lawyer to promptly comply with a client\u2019s reasonable requests for information), 1.15(d) (requiring a lawyer to promptly deliver funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive), and 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">\n<em>Count Two (The Green Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-8\">{\u00b6 14} In February 2009, Mamie-LeeShaun Green paid Brown $400 in cash to represent her in a bankruptcy matter. Brown did not communicate with Green for several months after he accepted the $400, despite Green\u2019s attempts to contact him. It was only after Green contacted Brown\u2019s family that she was able to reach him.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">{\u00b6 15} In June 2009, Brown met with Green in her home to discuss her bankruptcy. At that time, Green paid Brown $100 for services he had provided to her in an unrelated case. During the meeting, Brown claimed to have filed a bankruptcy petition on Green\u2019s behalf. He also told Green that two of her creditors were disputing the amounts of the debts, and he requested information from Green regarding these creditors, which Green provided. In addition, Brown told Green that he had spoken to the bankruptcy judge about her case and that the judge required that Green take a credit-counseling class. Brown said that he would put information about the class in Green\u2019s mailbox the next day. Green never received the credit-counseling information, and she never saw Brown again.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Green made numerous attempts to contact Brown, but was unable to get a response for several months. In early November 2009, Green sent him an email requesting information about her bankruptcy case and asking him to return her fee if he was not willing to continue as her attorney. On November 12, 2009, Brown replied with an e-mail stating that he would provide Green with a copy of her bankruptcy petition the following Tuesday.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">{\u00b6 17} Green subsequently went to bankruptcy court and learned that Brown had never filed a bankruptcy petition. She sent him another e-mail on December 15, 2009, demanding that he refund her $400. Brown has not returned Green\u2019s file or her $400 fee.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">{\u00b6 18} During Brown\u2019s deposition, he admitted that he has never been admitted to practice in bankruptcy court, has no bankruptcy-law experience, does not have electronic-filing privileges for bankruptcy court, and was not aware that the filing fee for a bankruptcy petition is $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">{\u00b6 19} The board found that Brown\u2019s conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.1 (requiring a lawyer to provide competent representation to a client), 1.3, 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 1.15(d), and 8.4(c). We agree and adopt these findings of misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">\n<em>Count Three (The Walling Matter)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-9\">{\u00b6 20} In January 2008, Jeffrey Walling, who owned a debt-collection company, hired Brown to collect a judgment on behalf of Walling\u2019s client, ABC Bail Bonds, Inc. ABC Bail Bonds had previously obtained a judgment in the Lyndhurst Municipal Court against a James Vojtech for over $101,000, and Vojtech\u2019s wages were being garnished to pay the award, but Walling wanted Brown to pursue other debt-collection methods. Brown had no written fee agreement with Walling. Brown and Walling did have an oral fee agreement that allowed Brown to collect the garnishment checks, deduct a portion for his fee, and turn over the balance to Walling.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-10\">{\u00b6 21} Brown collected approximately $3,700 in garnishment checks, but never paid any money to Walling. Brown claimed that the garnishment proceeds covered his legal fees and that nothing was left over, but he failed to provide a billing statement or any other explanation of work performed for Walling on behalf of ABC Bail Bonds that the garnishment proceeds went toward. In addition, during his deposition, Brown conceded that he had never maintained a client trust account and that he had deposited the funds collected on behalf of ABC Bail Bonds into his personal bank account.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 22} With respect to the above misconduct, the board found that Brown had violated Prof.Cond.R. 1.4(a)(3), 1.4(a)(4), 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to hold property of clients or third persons separate from the lawyer\u2019s own property in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>client trust account), 1.15(d), and 8.4(c). We agree that Brown engaged in the above misconduct and therefore adopt the board\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 23} In recommending a sanction, the master commissioner considered the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10 of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). The master commissioner found, as aggravating factors, that Brown had engaged in a pattern of misconduct involving multiple offenses. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(c) and (d). He also noted that Stewart and Green were vulnerable clients that Brown had taken advantage of and harmed. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(h). Finally, the master commissioner found that Brown had failed to make restitution to any of the aggrieved clients. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(l)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 24} In mitigation, the master commissioner noted that Brown was suspended in 2009 for failing to register, but nevertheless found that his \u201cabsence of a prior disciplinary record\u201d qualified as a mitigating factor. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). The master commissioner ultimately concluded, however, that Brown\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record did not mitigate his misconduct in these matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> No other mitigating factors were found.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 25} Relator recommended that Brown be permanently disbarred. The master commissioner also recommended disbarment. The board, however, disagreed. The board concluded that an indefinite suspension was a more appropriate sanction based on the entire record, including the fact that Brown had been in the practice of law for only a few years. The board further recommended that Brown be required to pay restitution to the three clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 26} Having reviewed the record, we agree that an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-10\">{\u00b6 27} Accordingly, Shawn Javon Brown is indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in the state of Ohio. We further order that his indefinite suspension run consecutively to his attorney-registration suspension. We also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>order that Brown pay restitution to the three clients harmed by his misconduct within 60 days. Costs are taxed to Brown.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AOs\">Heather M. Zirke, Andrew Geronimo, and David O. Simon, for relator.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b438-4\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b438-5\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b437-11\">. The master commissioner erred in finding that Brown had no prior disciplinary record. See, e.g., <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Larkin, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 368, 2011-Ohio-762, 944 N.E.2d 669, It 9; <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Mitchell, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 266, 2010-Ohio-135, 921 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 8; and <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Paulson, </em>112 Ohio St.3d 334, 2006-Ohio-6678, 859 N.E.2d 932, \u00b6 12 (all recognizing attorney-registration violations as prior disciplinary offenses pursuant to BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(a)). But because the master commission gave no weight to this factor in mitigation, the error is harmless.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
