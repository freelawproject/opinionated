Timothy Dearfield of Loveland, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0039684, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1988. On April 12, 2010, relator, the Cincinnati Bar Association, filed a complaint charging Dearfield with violating the Rules of Professional Conduct with regard to his representation of Jeffery M. Hallet. On May 11, 2010, Dearfield filed an answer denying the alleged violations. The case was heard before a panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline of the Supreme Court of Ohio. Finding that Dearfield violated several Rules of Professional Conduct, the board recommends a one-year suspension with six months stayed. We hold that a one-year stayed suspension is the proper sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-11\">I. Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b649-12\">{\u00b6 2} Jeffery Hallet hired Dearfield to file bankruptcy on his behalf. Dear-field\u2019s standard charges were $3,274 for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy, which included a $700 retainer and $274 in court costs, and $1,099 for a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, which included an $800 retainer and $299 in court costs. Hallet signed an agreement with Dearfield that stated: \u201cAll retainer payments are good for one year from the date made and will be credited to the attorney fees and court costs then applicable for the filing. Any monies paid on retainer are <em>non-refundable </em>except in unusual circumstances and only at the discretion of an attorney employed by the Law Firm.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b649-13\">{\u00b6 3} On June 30, 2009, Hallet wrote Dearfield a $700 check for \u201cbankruptcy filing.\u201d Approximately two weeks later, Hallet wrote an additional $399 check to Dearfield for \u201ccourt costs.\u201d Both checks were deposited in Dearfield\u2019s usual business account.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Hallet and Dearfield had numerous conversations about whether Hallet should file Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy. Eventually, Hallet decided not to file bankruptcy, because he had negotiated a payment plan with his creditors. Thus, Hallet sent a letter dated August 15, 2009, discharging Dearfield as his bankruptcy attorney and requesting an itemized bill, a refund of the $399 in courts costs, and his documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">{\u00b6 5} Dearfield believed that his firm had invested at least $1,099 worth of work in preparing Hallet\u2019s bankruptcy case and that he could use Hallet\u2019s $399 to offset that expense. Thus, Dearfield considered Hallet\u2019s $399 as earned fees and initially refused Hallet a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">{\u00b6 6} Hallet filed a grievance against Dearfield with the relator, the Cincinnati Bar Association. In late 2009 or early 2010, relator notified Dearfield of Hallet\u2019s grievance. Dearfield sent a letter to relator explaining that although he believed that his firm had earned the $299 that would have been paid in costs, he would refund that amount to Hallet \u201cas a full and complete satisfaction of any claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">{\u00b6 7} Several weeks later, Dearfield refunded $299 to Hallet and in return Hallet signed a document that stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b650-8\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cYou acknowledge that you have received $299.00 in cash from this office on this 26th day of February 2010 in full and complete satisfaction of any claims you may have against same and or any of its attorney[s], paralegals etc. Said claims include any and all claims such as legal malpractice, ethical violations, or other complaints to overseeing bodies including the Ohio Supreme Court, the Ohio State Bar Association, the Cincinnati Bar Association or any other applicable entities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b650-9\">{\u00b6 9} The board concluded that relator proved by clear and convincing evidence that Dearfield had violated (1) Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c) (a lawyer must deposit advance legal fees and expenses into a client trust account, to be withdrawn by the lawyer only as fees are earned or expenses incurred), (2) Prof.Cond.R. 1.5(d)(3) (a lawyer shall not charge \u201ca fee denominated as \u2018earned upon receipt,\u2019 \u2018nonrefundable,\u2019 or in any similar terms, unless the client is simultaneously advised in writing that if the lawyer does not complete the representation for any reason, the client may be entitled to a refund of all or part of the fee based upon the value of the representation pursuant to division (a) of this rule\u201d), and (3) Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (a lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice). We agree that Dearfield violated these rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">II. Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b650-11\">{\u00b6 10} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in BCGD Proc. Reg. 10(B). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21; <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Freedman, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 497, 2011-Ohio-1959, 946 N.E.2d 753, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-4\">{\u00b6 11} The board found that Dearfield\u2019s lack of a disciplinary record was a mitigating factor. However, the board found four aggravating factors: (1) Dearfield acted with a dishonest or selfish motive, (2) Dearfield did not cooperate with the disciplinary process, (3) Dearfield engaged in deceptive practices during the disciplinary process, and (4) Dearfield refused to acknowledge the wrongful nature of his conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-5\">{\u00b6 12} The board also cited <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Berger </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 454, 597 N.E.2d 81, in support of suspending Dearfield\u2019s law license for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">{\u00b6 13} Dearfield admits the alleged violations but argues that his conduct does not merit an actual suspension. For the following reasons, we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">A. Mitigating and Aggravating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"AhlG\">1. Failure to Cooperate/Deceptive Practices</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">{\u00b6 14} We find that Dearfield\u2019s action in securing a release of the disciplinary action is an aggravating factor in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">{\u00b6 15} Relator charged Dearfield with violating Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) \u201cfor failing to cooperate with the disciplinary process by requiring Mr. Hallet to sign a release before refunding the court costs,\u201d citing <em>Akron Bar Assn. v. Holder, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 307, 2004-Ohio-2835, 810 N.E.2d 426, \u00b6 31. However, the board found that there was no clear and convincing evidence that Dearfield had failed to cooperate in this regard. Nevertheless, the board still appears to have found Dearfield\u2019s conduct to be an aggravating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">{\u00b6 16} In <em>Holder, </em>at \u00b6 31, the court stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b651-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cAnd because respondent had attempted to derail the investigation of his misconduct by negotiating the withdrawal of Wright\u2019s grievance through settlement discussions, threatening legal action, and actually filing a grievance against the investigator, among other examples, the board found respondent in violation of Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G) (requiring an attorney to cooperate in the disciplinary proceedings).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b651-12\">{\u00b6 18} Apparently, the board found that Dearfield\u2019s conduct in the instant case was distinguishable from the attorney\u2019s conduct in <em>Holder </em>in determining that there was insufficient evidence to find that Dearfield violated Gov.Bar R. V(4)(G). We agree. However, we also agree that Dearfield\u2019s act of having Hallet sign a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>document that purported to release any disciplinary action pending against Dearfield is an aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(e) (lack of cooperation in the disciplinary process). While Dearfield\u2019s use of this release was not comparable to the pervasive actions taken by the attorney in <em>Holder </em>to thwart the disciplinary process, <em>Holder </em>put Dearfield on notice that his use of such a release could at least be an aggravating factor under BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">{\u00b6 19} The board also found that Dearfield had engaged in deceptive practices in dealing with the disciplinary process. However, the board did not specify what actions taken by Dearfield were deceptive, and we cannot locate any such evidence in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">{\u00b6 20} Accordingly, we find that the aggravating factor of failing to cooperate with the disciplinary process is present.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">2. Dishonest or Selfish Motive</p>\n<p id=\"b652-8\">{\u00b6 21} Contrary to the board\u2019s findings, we find that Dearfield did not act with a dishonest or selfish motive with regard to the violation of Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c) and 8.4(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-9\">{\u00b6 22} Dearfield\u2019s failure to deposit the $399 into a trust account was based on his mistaken belief that costs paid by a client to a lawyer do not need to be deposited into a trust account pursuant to <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Flanagan </em>(1997), 77 Ohio St.3d 381, 674 N.E.2d 681. While <em>Flanagan </em>did hold that former DR 9-102(A) did not require that costs paid by a client to a lawyer had to be deposited into a trust account, the rules have recently been amended to require such costs to be deposited into a trust account. Prof.Cond.R. 1.15(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-10\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, we find that Dearfield did not act in a dishonest or selfish manner by initially failing to refund Hallet\u2019s fees. Hallet believed that the $399 he paid to Dearfield was for a filing fee and, because no court fees had been incurred, that Dearfield should have refunded the money. Dearfield, on the other hand, believed that his firm had earned at least $1,099 in preparing Hallet\u2019s bankruptcy case before Hallet decided that he would not file bankruptcy. Consequently, Dearfield initially believed that he was entitled to use the $399 to offset the fees that Hallet had incurred. Dearfield was wrong, and ultimately he agreed to refund $299 to Hallet, but under these circumstances, we do not find that he acted with a dishonest motive by initially refusing to issue a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">{\u00b6 24} Accordingly, we find that Dearfield did not commit the aggravating factor of acting with a selfish or dishonest motive.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>3. Wrongful Nature of Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">{\u00b6 25} Contrary to the board\u2019s findings, we find that Dearfield acknowledged the wrongful nature of his conduct and has taken steps to prevent further misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">{\u00b6 26} Dearfield admitted that under the current rule, clients\u2019 fees must be deposited into an attorney\u2019s trust account. Dearfield also testified at the disciplinary hearing that he has changed his fee agreements by removing the statement that the fee is nonrefundable. Finally, Dearfield stated that he has learned not to condition the settlement of a fee dispute upon the dismissal of any ethics complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">B. <em>Berger </em>is Distinguishable</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">{\u00b6 27} We also find that <em>Berger </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Berger, </em>the court found that two attorneys charged an excessive fee, denied a client access to settlement proceeds, failed to accept any ethical responsibility for their conduct, and attempted to suppress the bar association\u2019s investigation. <em>Berger, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 454, 597 N.E.2d 81. The court suspended the attorneys\u2019 licenses for one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">{\u00b6 28} Dearfield\u2019s conduct to some degree could be compared to the conduct in <em>Berger </em>in that he attempted to secure the release of disciplinary charges filed against him. However, unlike the attorneys in <em>Berger, </em>Dearfield did not charge an excessive fee or refuse to return any fees, and perhaps most important, he has acknowledged the wrongful nature of his conduct and has taken steps to prevent future misconduct. Accordingly, we find that <em>Berger </em>is not persuasive in determining the appropriate sanction to impose on Dearfield.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b653-10\">{\u00b6 29} We hold that Dearfield violated three rules of professional conduct and that the aggravating factor of failing to cooperate with the disciplinary process by having his client sign a settlement that purported to release him from any disciplinary action is present. However, he has no prior disciplinary record, ultimately returned his client\u2019s fees, admitted his misconduct, and has altered his practice to avoid future misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-11\">{\u00b6 30} While we cannot locate any cases on point that suggest an appropriate sanction, the primary goal of the attorney disciplinary system is to protect the public. <em>In re Disbarment of Lieberman </em>(1955), 163 Ohio St. 35, 41, 56 O.O. 23, 125 N.E.2d 328; <em>Warren Cty. Bar Assn. v. Marshall, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 197, 2009-Ohio-501, 903 N.E.2d 280, \u00b6 19. Dearfield has admitted his wrongdoing and has taken the appropriate steps to avoid violating the same disciplinary rules again. Therefore, we do not believe that an actual suspension is in order. Instead, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>suspend Dearfield\u2019s license to practice law for one year with the entire suspension stayed on the condition that Dearfield not commit any further misconduct.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ans\">G.
