Boles, for a writ of habeas corpus. Boles\u2019s speedy-trial and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>double-jeopardy claims under R.C. 2945.73(D) are not cognizable in habeas corpus. See <em>Tisdale v. Eberlin, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 201, 2007-Ohio-3833, 870 N.E.2d 1191, \u00b6 7 (\u201ca claimed violation of a right to a speedy trial is not cognizable in habeas corpus\u201d); <em>Smith v. Voorhies, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 345, 2008-Ohio-4479, 894 N.E.2d 44, \u00b6 9 (\u201cres judicata is not an appropriate basis for extraordinary relief\u2019). \u201cAn appeal rather than a writ of habeas corpus is the proper remedy to challenge alleged violations of the right to a speedy trial.\u201d <em>In re Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus for Jackson </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 189, 190, 522 N.E.2d 540 (affirming judgment denying writ of habeas corpus based on claimed violation of right to speedy trial under R.C. 2945.71 through 2945.73 and the United States and Ohio Constitutions). Appeal is also the appropriate remedy to raise a claimed violation of double jeopardy. <em>Smith </em>at \u00b6 9.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMZ\">Shawn R. Boles, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AUt\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Elizabeth A. Matune, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">{\u00b6 2} Dismissal under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim was warranted because after all factual allegations of Boles\u2019s petition were presumed to be true and all reasonable inferences therefrom were made in his favor, it appeared beyond doubt that he was not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in habeas corpus. No further inquiry into the legality of his detention was necessary. And insofar as Boles claims that the court of appeals\u2019 judgment that he is appealing from does not constitute a final, appealable order, his claim lacks merit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-7\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b626-10\">.
