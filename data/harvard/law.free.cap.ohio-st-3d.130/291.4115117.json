The school board contends that the BTA erred by according deference to the BOR\u2019s decision rather than relying on its own independent weighing of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 2} We agree with the school board. We therefore vacate the BTA\u2019s decision and remand so that the BTA can determine whether there is sufficient evidence to permit it to perform an independent valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 3} The property at issue consists of 1.8210 acres improved with a 32,060-square-foot hotel. The auditor assigned a true value of $2,096,320 for tax year 2006. The owner, Bajarangi Corporation, filed a complaint against valuation on March 28, 2007, seeking a reduction of true value to $1,468,000. The school board filed a countercomplaint seeking to retain the auditor\u2019s valuation. Prior to the BOR hearing, Ratilal Patel, who identified himself as the owner and president of Bajarangi, submitted a letter dated March 9, 2007, setting forth general contentions in support of the complaint and attaching an \u201c[ajppraisal report as of 2007.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 4} On August 2, 2007, the BOR held a hearing on the complaint. The record of that hearing consists of terse handwritten notes, which indicate that the owner presented an appraisal that certified an opinion of $1,488,000 \u201cexclusive of FFE (i.e., the furniture, fixtures, and equipment).\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Patel appeared on behalf of the owner to present the appraisal and to offer testimony. According to the handwritten notes, Patel testified that \u201c[hjotel performance [was] going down every year\u201d and that the subject property had incurred \u201cexorbitant expenses.\u201d The hearing notes assert that the property is \u201c[c]urrently listed @ 1.5 million\u201d and indicate that Patel would be \u201chappy to sell @1.3 million.\u201d In June 2007, a prospective buyer offered $1.4 million, but the offer was contingent on $150,000 of improvements, and the deal fell through. The property was purchased in 2002 for $1.9 million, an allegedly fair price at that time. Occupancy was said to be approximately 35 percent.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 5} The notes reflect that the school board objected to the appraisal report as hearsay \u201cbecause the appraiser wasn\u2019t here to question.\u201d The notes then state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>that \u201cP <em>&amp; </em>L\u201d (presumably profit and loss) documentation is contained in the appraisal report and that the occupancy rate was 46 percent \u201c[w]hen purchased.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">{\u00b6 6} The BOR\u2019s September 7, 2007 decision is documented by the hearing notes. The BOR decided to assign a value of $1,499,080 to the property, \u201cper CLT review <em>&amp; </em>recommendation.\u201d At oral argument, counsel for the county explained that \u201cCLT\u201d refers to the appraisal firm used by the county in valuing real property. The notes do not reflect any ruling on the school board\u2019s objection to the appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">{\u00b6 7} On one page of the property-record card, handwritten numbers appear that are apparently intended to substitute for the printed numbers used in determining value under the income approach. Specifically, the \u201cECO ADJ\u201d figure of 84 percent under \u201cEST ECONOMIC INCOME\u201d was crossed out and changed to 75.8 percent, while the 100 percent \u201cECO ADJ\u201d figure under \u201cVACANCY AND CREDIT LOSS\u201d was changed to 20 percent. Finally, under \u201cOPERATING/DEPARTMENTAL EXPENSES,\u201d the \u201cECO ADJ\u201d figure is changed from 100 percent to 90 percent. There are no such handwritten notations on the separate page that reflects the ultimate determination of value according to the income approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 8} The school board appealed to the BTA, and the BOR certified a record that did not include the appraisal report referred to in the hearing notes. On December 19, 2008, the BTA held a hearing at which only the school board appeared. At that hearing, counsel for the school board argued that \u201cthere was insufficient evidence to support the reduction in value.\u201d The school board also filed a brief at the BTA, renewing its claim of insufficient evidence and expressing its concern that \u201ceven though the BOR excluded the appraisal from the record, the BOR\u2019s notes indicate that it still relied upon the report in reducing the value of the subject property.\u201d The brief additionally pointed out that the taxpayer had informed the BOR that the appraisal report valued the property \u201cas of\u2019 2007 rather than as of the tax-lien date, January 1, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 9} On September 1, 2009, the BTA issued its decision. The BTA canvassed the sparse evidence in the record. The board noted the handwritten notations on the property-record card and stated that the \u201cmodifications reduce the annualized potential gross rent and \u2018ECO\u2019 adjustments, apparently consistent with the testimony presented at the BOR hearing.\u201d <em>Vandalia-Butler City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Sept. 1, 2009), BTA No. 2007-M-1022, at 3, 5. The BTA then noted that the school board \u201cpresented no evidence contradicting the loss of income suffered by the property or the adjustments made by the BOR.\u201d Id. at 5. After reviewing case law, the BTA articulated the issue as whether there was sufficient evidence to support the BOR\u2019s reduction in value. Id. at 7. ;</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>{\u00b6 10} As for the evidence itself, the BTA stated, \u201c[W]e would find little evidentiary support for the BOR\u2019s value herein.\u201d Id. at 6. The board then characterized the record as containing \u201climited evidence to support the valuation adopted by the BOR\u201d and described that evidence as being of a type previously rejected by the board. Id. at 7. In spite of these deficiencies in the evidence, the BTA ultimately adopted the BOR\u2019s valuation. The stated grounds for doing so were twofold. First, the \u201cBOR saw fit to reduce the subject\u2019s valuation, while not to the value opined by the property owner, but to a value lower than that which the auditor had determined.\u201d Id. Second, \u201cthe auditor must have conceded to the reduced valuation for the subject, since there is no indication in the record that the auditor attempted to defend and/or maintain the auditor\u2019s original valuation.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 11} The school board has appealed, and we now vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 12} The BTA is responsible for determining factual issues, but we \u201c \u2018will not hesitate to reverse a BTA decision that is based on an incorrect legal conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Gahanna-Jefferson Local School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Zaino </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 231, 232, 754 N.E.2d 789. In the present case, the school board asserts that the BTA erred by presuming the validity of the BOR\u2019s value determination rather than independently weighing the evidence to arrive at its decision. In response, the county contends that because evidence presented to the BOR tended to negate the validity of the auditor\u2019s determination, the BTA could not revert to that valuation without contravening the holding of <em>Dayton-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22 <em>(\u201cDayton\u201d). </em>The dispute in this case therefore presents us with a claim of legal error by the school board as appellant and a claim by the county that legal principles dictated the decision that the BTA reached.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">\n<em>I. The BTA erred by deferring to the BOR\u2019s determination rather than relying on its independent evaluation of the evidence.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 13} We agree with the school board that the BTA failed to discharge its duty to base its decision on an independent weighing of the evidence. It is well settled that when the BTA reviews a board-of-revision decision based upon the record developed before that tribunal, the BTA has the duty to \u201c \u2018independently weigh and evaluate all evidence properly before it\u2019 \u201d in arriving at its own decision. <em>Hilliard City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 565, 2011-Ohio-2258, 949 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 17, quoting <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1996), 76 Ohio St.3d 13, 15, 665 N.E.2d 1098 (BTA must reach its \u201cown independent judgment based on its weighing of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>evidence contained in [the BOR\u2019s] transcript\u201d). Equally well established is the proposition that \u201cdecisions of boards of revision should not be accorded a presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 493, 2007-Ohio-4641, 873 N.E.2d 298, \u00b623, citing <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>at 15 and <em>Springfield Local Bd. of Edn. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 493, 494, 628 N.E.2d 1365. Read in conjunction, these two principles foreclose the approach taken by the BTA in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 14} Quite simply, the BTA\u2019s crucial error in this case lay in its exclusive reliance on the BOR\u2019s evaluation of the evidence rather than its own. The property owner, Bajarangi Corporation, sought a reduction in value and presented oral testimony by Patel and an appraisal report at the BOR hearing. The BTA\u2019s evaluation of this evidence was decidedly negative: the board stated, \u201c[W]e would find little evidentiary support for the BOR\u2019s value herein,\u201d BTA No. 2007-M-1022 at 6, characterized the record as containing \u201climited evidence to support the valuation adopted by the BOR,\u201d and pronounced the evidence to be of a type that the board had previously rejected. Id. at 7. In deciding to retain the value found by the BOR, the BTA placed sole reliance on the bare fact that \u201cthe BOR saw fit to reduce the subject\u2019s valuation, while not to the value opined by the property owner, but to a value lower than that which the auditor had determined,\u201d along with the lack of any \u201cindication in the record that the auditor attempted to defend and/or maintain the auditor\u2019s original valuation.\u201d Id. at 7.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In other words, even though the BTA itself was unpersuaded by the evidence, it adopted the BOR\u2019s reduction of value on the grounds that the BOR <em>was </em>persuaded. That constitutes the very deference that the case law prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 15} Moreover, although Bajarangi Corporation presented not only Patel\u2019s testimony but also an appraisal report, the report was objected to, and the BOR did not include it in the certified record to the BTA. Nonetheless, the BOR may have used it in arriving at its determination of the value of the <em>property </em>\u2014 an <em>option not open to the BTA, </em>which did not have the appraisal report before it. In addition to the fact that the BTA did not have before it a piece of evidence that may have been crucial to the BOR\u2019s value determination, the BTA also erred by adopting the BOR\u2019s valuation without addressing the hearsay objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>{\u00b6 16} Finally, it is not insignificant that the BOR noted its reliance on \u201cCLT review &amp; recommendation.\u201d The county has explained that. CLT is the \u201cappraisal firm that assists the county auditor in setting property values.\u201d To the extent that the appraisal firm presented new evidence to the BOR, the BTA did not have the evidence itself before it, only a reference to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 17} In opposing the school board\u2019s argument, the county auditor and the BOR contend that the BTA \u201cdid perform its obligation to weigh and evaluate the evidence before the BOR, and did not merely presume that the BOR\u2019s decision was valid simply because the auditor failed to object to the decrease in value.\u201d While it is certainly true that the BTA discussed the evidence, we agree with the school board that the BTA ultimately did not reach a conclusion concerning the value of the property based on its own review of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 18} Indeed, we find the county\u2019s interpretation of the BTA decision incompatible not only with the words actually set forth in that decision, but also with the absence of any specific explanation of how the value of $1,499,080 is supported by the evidence. The BOR itself did not offer such an explanation, and the BTA\u2019s own failure to supply one demonstrates the high degree to which it simply deferred to the BOR.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 19} In sum, the BTA erred by deferring to the BOR\u2019s decision to order the value reduction, rather than relying on its own independent evaluation of the evidence as required by case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">\n<em>II. Case law requires the BTA to determine whether the record contains sufficient evidence to allow an independent valuation.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 20} The county argues that the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully in determining that \u201csufficient\u201d evidence supported the BOR\u2019s valuation, with the result that the BTA was bound by the determination of the BOR. This argument rests upon the BTA\u2019s own misreading of the case law. Specifically, the BTA cited our decision in <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, for the principle that the presence of \u201csufficient\u201d evidence at the BOR required the BTA to defer to the BOR\u2019s valuation. BTA No. 2007-M-1022 at 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">{\u00b6 21} The BTA was mistaken, and the county\u2019s argument has no merit. It is true that the <em>absence </em>of sufficient evidence requires the BTA to reverse a reduction or increase ordered by a board of revision. See <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 564, 566-567, 740 N.E.2d 276. But it does not follow that the <em>presence </em>of a particular quantum of evidence requires the BTA to adopt the BOR\u2019s valuation. The BTA\u2019s duty, as previously discussed, is to reach its \u201cown independent judgment based on its weighing of the evidence contained in the [board of revision] transcript.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Columbus Bd. of Edn., </em>76 Ohio St.3d at 15, 665 N.E.2d 1098. Put differently, the evidence for adopting the BOR\u2019s valuation could be \u201csufficient\u201d for purposes of the BTA\u2019s review <em>if and only if </em>the BTA independently concluded that the evidence supports the very value found by the BOR. Here the language of the BTA\u2019s decision makes clear that the BTA reached no such independent conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 22} We must return this case to the BTA so that the BTA can apply the analysis we articulated in <em>Colonial Village, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196. In <em>Colonial Village, </em>we explained the larger framework of the BTA\u2019s duty when a valuation case has been appealed from a board of revision.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 23} Contrary to the BTA\u2019s decision and the county\u2019s argument, our earlier decision in <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn., </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, must be construed and applied within that framework. In <em>Bedford, </em>the majority stated that the BTA erred \u201cin reinstating the auditor\u2019s determination of value when the taxpayer had presented sufficient evidence to the BOR to justify the reduction the BOR ordered.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 15. The county defends the BTA\u2019s reading of <em>Bedford </em>and emphasizes the <em>Bedford </em>court\u2019s heavy reliance on <em>Dayton, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22. At oral argument, the county\u2019s counsel asserted that the evidence presented to the BOR foreclosed reverting to the auditor\u2019s original valuation because it tended to negate that valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 24} Our decision in <em>Colonial Village, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, shows that the BTA and the county are mistaken. Even if some evidence tends to negate the auditor\u2019s original valuation, it is proper to revert to that valuation when the BTA finds that the owner has not proved a lower value <em>and there is otherwise \u201cno evidence from which the BTA can independently determine value.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>Simmons v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 689 N.E.2d 22. In <em>Simmons, </em>this court held that when a board of revision retained the auditor\u2019s valuation and the BTA rejected the owner\u2019s evidence of a lower value, the BTA could properly \u201capprove the board of revision\u2019s valuation, without the board of revision\u2019s presenting any evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In <em>Dayton, </em>we expressly distinguished <em>Simmons </em>and found that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>record before us did contain sufficient evidence to permit the BTA to perform an independent valuation. <em>Dayton </em>at \u00b6 15-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\">{\u00b6 25} The <em>Bedford </em>court came to the same conclusion. Indeed, the disagreement between the majority and the dissent in <em>Bedford </em>centered on whether there was sufficient evidence to permit an independent valuation that would justify a reduction. <em>Bedford, </em>\u00b6 15 (majority concludes that \u201cthe taxpayer had presented sufficient evidence to the BOR to justify the reduction the BOR ordered\u201d) and \u00b6 18 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting) (\u201cunlike in <em>Dayton, </em>there was no evidence before the Board of Tax Appeals that permitted an independent determination of value,\u201d and that deficiency in the evidence \u201cjustifie[d] the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 reversion to the auditor\u2019s determination of value\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 26} In the present case, it follows that once the BTA had determined that the record contained evidence tending to negate the county\u2019s original valuation, the BTA\u2019s duty was to \u201cdetermine whether the record as developed by the parties contain[s] sufficient evidence to permit an independent valuation of the property.\u201d <em>Colonial Village, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, \u00b625. When there is sufficient evidence to permit the BTA to perform an independent valuation \u2014 as in <em>Dayton </em>and <em>Bedford </em>\u2014 the BTA must do so. Id. But when there is not sufficient evidence to permit an independent valuation, the BTA may properly revert to the county\u2019s original determination of value, as in <em>Simmons.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 27} The BTA erred by failing to determine whether sufficient evidence existed to permit an independent valuation of the property. To be sure, the BTA\u2019s discussion of the evidence indicates the board\u2019s dissatisfaction with the state of the record. Indeed, the complete absence of the proffered appraisal report and any analysis performed by CLT does leave gaps in the evidence before the BTA. But the existence of those gaps does not relieve the BTA from the obligation to independently weigh the evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys id=\"AGV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Rich &amp; Gillis Law Group, L.L.C., Mark H.

A board of revision must \u201ctake full minutes of all evidence given before the board, and it may cause the same to be taken in shorthand and extended in typewritten form.\u201d R.C. 5715.08. When a board of revision elects to preserve the hearing in the form of minutes without preparing a transcription or maintaining an audio record of the proceedings, that decision potentially affects the ability of the BTA to evaluate the evidence presented to the board of revision, since the BTA will have a mere summary rather than the actual testimony in its full extent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b581-7\">. The BTA fails to explain why it believes that the auditor\u2019s action or inaction in relation to the adoption of a new value is important. The record does not disclose whether the auditor or his delegate voted in favor of reducing the value of the property at issue, but that vote is not necessarily material. The school board (not the auditor) instigated the appeal to the BTA, and the BTA\u2019s duty was to determine the value of the property based on the evidence. A vote by the auditor to depart from his initial valuation would not by itself establish that the initial valuation was wrong or that the reduced value was correct.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b583-8\">. Our discussion also leads us to reject the county\u2019s contention that the school board had the burden to prove the validity of the auditor\u2019s valuation at the BTA. While it is true that the party that appeals to the BTA in a valuation case typically does bear the burden of showing a different value, see <em>Colonial Village, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196, \u00b6 23, the school board\u2019s appeal in this case rested upon a claim of legal error. In prosecuting such a claim, the appellant\u2019s burden is to show the presence of reversible error, and proof of a new value may not be necessary when the appeal seeks a return to the auditor\u2019s valuation.

The BTA noted that the BOR has the duty to preserve the evidence presented to it pursuant to R.C. 5715.08 and that the BOR should have certified the appraisal report as part of the record pursuant to R.C. 5717.01. <em>Vandalia-Butler City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision </em>(Sept. 1, 2009), BTA No. 2007-M-1022, at 3-4, fn. 2. We agree. In particular, R.C. 5717.01 expressly requires that the BOR certify \u201call evidence offered in connection\u201d with the valuation complaint. The criterion for inclusion is that the evidence was <em>offered, </em>not admitted, and that is significant given the de novo review at the BTA. Failure to certify the entire evidentiary record may prejudice the interest of the proponents of omitted items, and therefore, boards of revision should take care to comply with the statutory duty to certify the <em>entire </em>record. On remand, the BTA will confront the question whether to order that the appraisal report be certified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>by the BOR pursuant to R.C. 5717.01, along with the issue whether the appraisal ought to be considered at all in light of the hearsay objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
