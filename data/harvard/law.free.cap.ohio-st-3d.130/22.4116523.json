As the court of appeals correctly held, Hazel\u2019s petition was defective because although he filed an affidavit of indigency and sought waiver of prepayment of the court\u2019s filing fees, he failed to include in his affidavit of indigency a statement setting forth the balance in his inmate account for each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier, in violation of R.C. 2969.25(C). \u201cThe requirements of R.C. 2969.25 are mandatory, and failure to comply with them subjects an inmate\u2019s action to dismissal.\u201d <em>State ex rel. White v. Bechtel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 11, 2003-Ohio-2262, 788 N.E.2d 634, \u00b6 5. Hazel\u2019s subsequent filing of the statement did not cure the defect. See R.C. 2969.25(C); see also <em>Fuqua v. Williams, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 211, 2003-Ohio-5533, 797 N.E.2d 982, \u00b6 9. And although Hazel attempts to excuse his noncompliance with R.C. 2969.25(C) by citing a purported prison policy, which he attached to his reply brief, we cannot consider any evidence that is not part of the record on appeal. See <em>State ex rel. Albourque v. Terry, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 505, 2011-Ohio-1913, 947 N.E.2d 169, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 2} Moreover, because Hazel either raised or could have raised his claims in a previous habeas corpus case, see <em>Hazel v. Knab, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 1460, 2010-Ohio-2753, 928 N.E.2d 736, res judicata barred him from filing a successive habeas corpus petition in the court of appeals. See <em>Goins v. Pineda, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 358, 2011-Ohio-529, 944 N.E.2d 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 3} Finally, because Hazel\u2019s petition did not state a facially valid habeas corpus claim, the appellate court\u2019s dismissal without prior notice was proper and in accordance with the basic, summary procedure of R.C. Chapter 2725. <em>Wells v. Hudson, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 308, 2007-Ohio-1955, 865 N.E.2d 46, \u00b6 9; <em>Chari v. Vore </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 323, 327, 744 N.E.2d 763.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 4} Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed Hazel\u2019s habeas corpus petition, and we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b309-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"ANh\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Corey Hazel, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A64\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, and Hilda Rosenberg, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
