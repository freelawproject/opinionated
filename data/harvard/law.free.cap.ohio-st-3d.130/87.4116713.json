Bell, for writs of mandamus to compel appellee, David W. Brooks, the managing director of property and casualty insurance for County Risk Sharing Authority, Inc. (\u201cCORSA\u201d), a joint self-insurance pool whose members include the majority of Ohio\u2019s counties, to provide certain CORSA records pursuant to R.C. 149.43 and 149.431. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals insofar as it denied the writ for the records on grounds that CORSA is not the functional equivalent of a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.43. But we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals to the extent that the court faded to consider Bell\u2019s claims in which CORSA\u2019s status as a private, nonprofit corporation was not dispositive and remand that portion of the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings on those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">I. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">A <em>CORSA</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 2} In the mid-1980s, the General Assembly authorized counties to use risk-sharing pools like CORSA. See R.C. 2744.081. The County Commissioners Association of Ohio, rather than a governmental entity, created CORSA as a private, nonprofit corporation organized under R.C. 1702.01 et seq. In 1987, CORSA began operating as a joint self-insurance pool.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 3} As of April 2009, CORSA\u2019s members included 62 Ohio counties and 19 county facilities. CORSA operates like an insurance company by providing coverage and risk-management services to its members, except that it pools its clients\u2019 resources rather than charging premiums. CORSA receives the vast majority of its income from member contributions.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 4} Neither the state nor any other government entity controls CORSA\u2019s day-to-day business operations. Instead, CORSA is operated by an independent board of directors elected by its members. The board is composed of nine members, commissioners from nine different counties, http://www.corsa.org/ BoardofDirectors/tabid/60/Default.aspx. The Internal Revenue Service recognizes that CORSA is a government instrumentality, and thus it is exempt from federal taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>\n<em>B. Records Requests</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">{\u00b6 5} By letter dated September 2, 2009, Bell requested that CORSA provide him with copies of certain records pursuant to R.C. 149.43 and 149.431, including the following financial records:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAll financial records relating to contract(s) between CORSA and Madison County, Ohio, including but not limited to: all invoices sent to Madison County; all records showing allocation of Madison County payments into CORSA financial accounts and sub-accounts; CORSA\u2019s chart of accounts; all records showing disbursements from CORSA financial accounts as payments to third-parties in performance of the eontract(s) with Madison County.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 7} In his response on behalf of CORSA, Brooks provided some of the requested records, but for the requested financial records other than the Madison County invoices, CORSA refused to provide copies, asserting that they were not public records. Brooks further informed Bell that CORSA was a private corporation and not a public office subject to R.C. 149.43.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 8} By letter dated September 15, 2009, Bell requested that Brooks provide copies of \u201c[a]ll minutes of every meeting of the CORSA board of trustees, for the period from January 1, 1999 up to and including the most recently convened meeting\u201d pursuant to R.C. 149.43 and 149.431. CORSA denied Bell\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 9} By letter dated September 28, 2009, Bell requested that Brooks provide copies of \u201c[a]ll compensation records for CORSA executive and administrative staff during the period from January 1, 1999 up to and including the records indicating the present compensation amounts\u201d pursuant to R.C. 149.43 and 149.431. CORSA rejected the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">\n<em>C. Mandamus Cases</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">{\u00b6 10} Bell filed complaints in the court of appeals for writs of mandamus to compel Brooks to provide copies of the requested CORSA records in accordance with R.C. 149.43 and 149.431. Brooks submitted answers in the three mandamus cases, and he moved to consolidate the cases for purposes of evidence, briefing, and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">{\u00b6 11} Following a conference before a court of appeals magistrate, on January 20, 2010, the magistrate granted Brooks\u2019s motion and consolidated the mandamus cases and ordered the parties to file evidence and briefs on only the issue whether CORSA is a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act. The parties then filed evidence and briefs relating to that specific issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">{\u00b6 12} The magistrate issued a decision recommending that the court of appeals deny the writs of mandamus because Bell had failed to establish by clear and convincing evidence that CORSA is the functional equivalent of a public office so as to be subject to the Public Records Act. Bell filed objections to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>magistrate\u2019s decision. In his objections, Bell argued that the magistrate had erroneously narrowed the issue to whether he had established that CORSA was the functional equivalent of a public office, even though his mandamus claims were broader. Bell further claimed that he had established that CORSA was the functional equivalent of a public office. Brooks submitted a response to the objections in which he asserted that Bell\u2019s objections should be stricken because the document was signed by Bell on behalf of the attorney in violation of Civ.R. 11 and that Bell had waived his broader mandamus claims because he had agreed that his claims could be resolved on the narrow issue of whether CORSA was the functional equivalent of a public office.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">{\u00b6 13} In September 2010, the court of appeals entered a judgment overruling Bell\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, adopting the decision, and denying the requested writs of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b6 14} This cause is now before the court for our consideration of Bell\u2019s appeal as of right from the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">II. Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">\n<em>A. Mandamus: Functional Equivalent of a Public Office</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 15} For Bell\u2019s public-records mandamus claims, \u201c[mjandamus is the appropriate remedy to compel compliance with R.C. 149.43, Ohio\u2019s Public Records Act.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Physicians Commt. for Responsible Medicine v. Ohio State Univ. Bd. of Trustees, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 288, 2006-Ohio-903, 843 N.E.2d 174, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 16} The court of appeals held that Bell\u2019s claims lacked merit because CORSA is a private entity. For purposes of the Public Records Act, an office is subject to the act if it is a \u201cstate agency, public institution, political subdivision, or other organized body, office, agency, institution, or entity established by the laws of this state for the exercise of any function of government.\u201d R.C. 149.011(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 17} In arguing that the court of appeals erred in determining that CORSA was not a public office subject to R.C. 149.43, Bell relies in part on our test in <em>State ex rel. Fostoria Daily Rev. Co. v. Fostoria Hosp. Assn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 10, 12, 531 N.E.2d 313 (a hospital is a public office subject to R.C. 149.43 if it is a public hospital, renders a public service to residents, and is supported by public taxation). But in 2006, we modified the test for determining a private entity\u2019s status as a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A). <em>State ex rel. Am. Civ. Liberties Union of Ohio, Inc. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Commrs., </em>128 Ohio St.3d 256, 2011-Ohio-625, 943 N.E.2d 553, \u00b6 47 (before 2006, \u201cwe used different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>tests to determine whether a private entity was a public office subject to the Public Records Act\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>State ex rel. Oriana House, Inc. v. Montgomery, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 456, 2006-Ohio-4854, 854 N.E.2d 193, at the syllabus, we set forth the applicable test for determining when a private entity is a public office subject to the Public Records Act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c1. Private entities are not subject to the Public Records Act absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence that the private entity is the functional equivalent of a public office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c2. In determining whether a private entity is a public institution under R.C. 149.011(A) and thus a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act, R.C. 149.43, a court shall apply the functional-equivalency test. Under this test, the court must analyze all pertinent factors, including (1) whether the entity performs a governmental function, (2) the level of government funding, (3) the extent of government involvement or regulation, and (4) whether the entity was created by the government or to avoid the requirements of the Public Records Act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">{\u00b6 21} We will now apply the functional-equivalency test to CORSA.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">1. Governmental Function</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">{\u00b6 22} Unlike operating community-based correctional facilities, which is the function performed by the private entity at issue in <em>Oriana House, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 456, 2006-Ohio-4854, 854 N.E.2d 193, at \u00b6 28, providing insurance to counties, which is the function being performed by CORSA, has not been established to be a historically governmental function. As the court of appeals concluded, \u201c[i]nsurance has traditionally been provided by private entities * * *.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Bell v. Brooks, </em>Franklin App. Nos. 09AP-861, 09AP-944, and 09AP-1055, 2010-Ohio-4266, 2010 WL 3527580, at \u00b6 8. Therefore, CORSA is not performing a historically governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">2. Level of Governmental Funding</p>\n<p id=\"b377-12\">{\u00b6 23} From the audit report of CORSA submitted by Bell into evidence, over 88 percent of its income for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2008, consisted of member contributions. And member contributions accounted for an even higher percentage of CORSA\u2019s income for the fiscal year ending April 30, 2009, because CORSA had a negative value for its net investment income. This level of government funding is significant. See <em>Oriana House </em>at \u00b6 32 (entity\u2019s receipt of 88 percent of its total revenues from public sources found to be a significant level of government funding); <em>State ex rel. Repository v. Nova Behavioral Health, Inc., </em>112 Ohio St.3d 338, 2006-Ohio-6713, 859 N.E.2d 936, \u00b6 32-33 (entity\u2019s receipt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>of nearly 92 percent of mental-health-services revenue from public sources deemed to be a significant level of government funding).</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">3. Extent of Government Involvement or Regulation</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 24} There is no evidence that any government entity controls the day-to-day operations of CORSA. The evidence establishes that CORSA is a private corporation operated by an independent board of directors composed of nine individual county commissioners and is not controlled by any county board of commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">4. Creation of Entity</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 25} Like the entities in <em>Oriana House </em>and <em>Repository, </em>CORSA was created as a private, nonprofit corporation, was not established by a government entity, and was not formed as an alter ego of a governmental agency to avoid the requirements of the Public Records Act. <em>Oriana House, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 456, 2006-Ohio-4854, 854 N.E.2d 193, at \u00b6 34; <em>Repository </em>at \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">5. Weighing of Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 26} The court of appeals did not err in concluding that Bell had failed to establish by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that CORSA is the functional equivalent of a public office subject to the Public Records Act. Three factors of the functional-equivalency test support Brooks\u2019s position that CORSA is not the functional equivalent of a public office, and one factor supports Bell\u2019s position that it is.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">{\u00b6 27} For the sole factor favoring Bell\u2019s claim \u2014 the level of government funding \u2014 we have emphasized that the \u201cfact that a private entity receives government funds does not convert the entity into a public office for purposes of the Public Records Act.\u201d <em>Oriana House </em>at \u00b6 29; <em>Repository </em>at \u00b6 38. \u201cThe Public Records Act was not designed to allow public scrutiny of \u2018all entities that receive funds that at one time were controlled by the government.\u2019 \u201d <em>Repository </em>at \u00b6 38, quoting <em>Oriana House </em>at \u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">{\u00b6 28} Nor does the mere fact that R.C. 2744.081(C) specifies that joint self-insurance pools perform a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d by \u201cenabling the members of the joint self-insurance pool to obtain insurance or to provide for a formalized, jointly administered self-insurance fund for its members\u201d require a contrary result. See <em>Oriana House </em>(holding that nonprofit corporation performing the historically governmental function of operating a correctional facility was not the functional equivalent of a public office so as to be subject to R.C. 149.43); <em>Repository </em>(holding that a nonprofit corporation performing the uniquely governmental function of providing mental-health care for the uninsured and compensating for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>the inadequacy of benefits in commercial health-insurance plans was not the functional equivalent of a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.43).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">{\u00b6 29} Bell\u2019s requests for writs of mandamus were for three different categories of CORSA records: (1) financial records relating to contracts between CORSA and Madison County, (2) minutes of CORSA\u2019s board meetings, and (3) compensation records for CORSA\u2019s executives and administrative staff. Bell concedes that the court of appeals\u2019 resolution of the issue whether CORSA is the functional equivalent of a public office resolved his claim for CORSA\u2019s board-meeting minutes. Therefore, we affirm the denial of the writ of mandamus for those records.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\n<em>B. CORSA\u2019s Financial and Compensation Records</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 30} For the remaining requested records, however, the court of appeals erred in holding that its determination that CORSA is not the functional equivalent of a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.43 also disposed of Bell\u2019s mandamus claims for CORSA\u2019s financial and compensation records.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 31} The Revised Code requires the disclosure of certain financial and compensation records of nonprofit corporations and associations with government-service contracts under specified circumstances, even if they are not public offices for purposes of R.C. 149.43:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 32} \u201c(A) Any governmental entity or agency and <em>any nonprofit corporation or association, </em>except a corporation organized pursuant to Chapter 1719. of the Revised Code prior to January 1, 1980 or organized pursuant to Chapter 3941. of the Revised Code, <em>that enters into a contract or other agreement with </em>the federal government, <em>a unit of state government, or a political subdivision or taxing unit of this state for the provision of services shall keep accurate and complete financial records of any moneys expended in relation to the performance of the services pursuant to such contract or agreement according to generally accepted accounting principles. Such contract or agreement and such financial records shall be deemed to be public records as defined in division (A)(1) of section H943 of the Revised Code and are subject to the requirements of division (B) of that section, </em>except that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 33} \u201c(1) Any information directly or indirectly identifying a present or former individual patient or client or his diagnosis, prognosis, or medical treatment, treatment for a mental or emotional disorder, treatment for mental retardation or a developmental disability, treatment for drug abuse or alcoholism, or counseling for personal or social problems is not a public record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c(2) If disclosure of the contract or agreement or financial records is requested at a time when confidential professional services are being provided to a patient or client whose confidentiality might be violated if disclosure were made <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>at that time, disclosure may be deferred if reasonable times are established when the contract or agreement or financial records will be disclosed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(3) Any nonprofit corporation or association that receives both public and private funds in fulfillment of any such contract or other agreement is not required to keep as public records the financial records of any private funds expended in relation to the performance of services pursuant to the contract or agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(B) <em>Any nonprofit corporation or association that receives more than fifty per cent of its gross receipts </em>excluding moneys received pursuant to Title XVIII of the \u201cSocial Security Act,\u201d 49 Stat. 620 (1935), 42 U.S.C. 301, as amended, <em>in a calendar year in fulfillment of a contract or other agreement for sewices with a governmental entity shall maintain information setting forth the compensation of any individual serving the nonprofit corporation or association in an executive or administrative capacity. Such information shall be deemed to be public records as defined in division (A)(1) of section 149.48 of the Revised Code and is subject to the requirements of division (B) of that section.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to otherwise limit the provisions of section 149.43 of the Revised Code.\u201d (Emphasis added.) R.C. 149.431.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 38} The court of appeals magistrate improperly restricted the submission of evidence and briefs to the functional-equivalency issue and neglected to consider Bell\u2019s claims for the release of CORSA\u2019s financial and compensation records under R.C. 149.43 and 149.431. Bell timely raised this ground in his objections to the magistrate\u2019s decision, but the court of appeals summarily denied Bell\u2019s objections without any discussion of R.C. 149.431.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 39} In this regard, Brooks contends on appeal \u2014 and claimed in his response to Bell\u2019s objections \u2014 that Bell had waived his R.C. 149.431 claims by purportedly agreeing to the magistrate\u2019s restriction of the dispositive issue to the functional-equivalency question. But there is no indication that the court of appeals denied Bell\u2019s objections on the grounds cited by Brooks. Nor is there evidence in the record to support Brooks\u2019s assertion that Bell waived these claims. See <em>State v. Pasqualone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 186, 2009-Ohio-315, 903 N.E.2d 270, \u00b6 13 (\u201cWaiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right\u201d). There is no evidence that Bell agreed that the functional-equivalency issue resolved all his claims. And the purported technical violation of Civ.R. 11 raised by Brooks in the proceedings below (Bell\u2019s signing the objections on behalf of his attorney) was not done to defeat the purpose of the rule, but instead was done under exigent circumstances. Nor does Brooks raise this alleged violation of the rule on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 40} Therefore, the court of appeals erred in denying Bell\u2019s mandamus claims for release of CORSA\u2019s financial and compensation records.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AdZ\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>Phillip Wayne Cramer, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"Ai9\">Isaac, Brant, Ledman &amp; Teetor, L.L.P., Mark Landes, and Mark H. Troutman, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">{\u00b6 41} Because the court of appeals did not err in holding that Bell did not establish that CORSA is the functional equivalent of a public office for purposes of R.C. 149.43 and that holding is dispositive of Bell\u2019s claim for CORSA\u2019s board-meeting minutes, we affirm the portion of the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus relating to those records. But because the court of appeals erred in denying the writs of mandamus regarding Bell\u2019s records requests for CORSA\u2019s financial and compensation records, we reverse the portion of the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writs relating to those records and remand the cause to the court of appeals for further proceedings, including the submission of evidence and briefs on those remaining claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b381-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\">.
