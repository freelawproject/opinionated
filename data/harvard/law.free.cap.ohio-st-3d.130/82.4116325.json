Richardson claims that the entry did not properly impose postrelease control and did not comply with Crim.R. 32(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-8\">{\u00b6 2} Richardson\u2019s sentencing entry \u201c \u2018sufficiently included language that post-release control was part of his sentence so as to afford him sufficient notice to raise any claimed errors on appeal rather than by extraordinary writ.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Tucker v. Forchione, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 298, 2010-Ohio-6291, 943 N.E.2d 1006, \u00b6 1, quoting <em>State ex rel. Pruitt v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 402, 2010-Ohio-1808, 928 N.E.2d 722, \u00b6 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">{\u00b6 3} And \u201cthe remedy for a failure to comply with Crim.R. 32(C) is a revised sentencing entry rather than a new hearing.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Alicea v. Krichbaum, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 194, 2010-Ohio-3234, 931 N.E.2d 1079, \u00b6 2; see also <em>State ex rel. Scheck v.

Richardson also challenges the court of appeals\u2019 ruling granting him a -writ of procedendo to compel Judge Suster to rule on his motion for a de novo hearing, but he lacks standing to contest that portion of the court\u2019s holding because he is not aggrieved by it.
