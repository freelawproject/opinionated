Respondent was served with a copy of the complaint and forwarded it to his attorney, who requested and received an extension of time to respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>{\u00b6 4} Respondent did not file an answer, and relator moved for default pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F). A master commissioner appointed by the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline reviewed the evidence, made findings of misconduct and conclusions of law, and recommended that respondent be permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio, all of which the board adopted. We adopt the board\u2019s report and permanently disbar respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">{\u00b6 5} The evidence demonstrates that on October 1, 2009, respondent pleaded guilty to one felony count of conspiracy in violation of Section 1951, Title 18, U.S.Code. The plea agreement states that respondent participated in a conspiracy with his law partners and others to unlawfully obtain contracts for certain businesses, substantially controlled by one of his partners, to perform commercial appraisals for the Cuyahoga County auditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">{\u00b6 6} From March 1998 through January 2008, as a result of the conspiracy, the businesses obtained more than $21 million in commercial appraisal contracts with the county. During that time, respondent and his partners paid approximately $1.4 million in kickbacks to two employees of the auditor\u2019s office. Respondent\u2019s firm, in turn, performed all of the bookkeeping, invoicing, and banking for the businesses and collected almost $9 million in fees \u2014 more than the value of the services they provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">{\u00b6 7} One of respondent\u2019s partners died in 2006, and the law firm dissolved. Respondent and a relative of one of his former partners formed another business to continue the conspiracy. That business collected revenue of almost $3.7 million, which exceeded the value of the services it provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-9\">{\u00b6 8} Based upon this conduct, the board found that respondent had violated DR 1 \u2014 102(A)(3) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in illegal conduct involving moral turpitude), DR 1-102(A)(4) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(c) (both prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation), DR 1-102(A)(5) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice), and DR 1-102(A)(6) and Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We adopt the board\u2019s findings of fact and misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">{\u00b6 9} When imposing sanctions for attorney misconduct, we consider relevant factors, including the ethical duties that the lawyer violated and the sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>imposed in similar cases. <em>Stark Cty. Bar Assn. v. Buttacavoli, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 424, 2002-Ohio-4743, 775 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 16. In making a final determination, we also weigh evidence of the aggravating and mitigating factors listed in Section 10(B) of the Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d). <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Broeren, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 473, 2007-Ohio-5251, 875 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">{\u00b6 10} The board found that respondent\u2019s lack of a prior disciplinary record and the imposition of criminal sanctions, including incarceration and an order of restitution, were mitigating factors. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (f). Aggravating factors found by the board include respondent\u2019s dishonest or selfish motive and his \u201cwidespread pattern of criminal misconduct and corruption that resulted in great harm to the residents of Cuyahoga County and all county government.\u201d See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(b), (c), and (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">{\u00b6 11} Relator seeks and the board recommends respondent\u2019s permanent disbarment from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">{\u00b6 12} In <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Ritson, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 89, 2010-Ohio-4504, 936 N.E.2d 931, \u00b6 4, 36, we permanently disbarred an attorney who had participated for nearly five years in a criminal conspiracy to induce real estate professionals to join two professional organizations by falsely claiming that members would receive errors-and-omissions insurance as a benefit of their membership. We noted that Ritson\u2019s actions \u201ccaused harm to approximately 3,000 victims and resulted in a restitution order totaling $3.7 million.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 34. Here, respondent\u2019s conduct has lasted approximately ten years, victimized every taxpayer in Cuyahoga County, and resulted in a five-year prison sentence and a restitution order of $3,215,845.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">{\u00b6 13} Having reviewed the record, weighed the aggravating and mitigating factors, and considered the sanction imposed for comparable conduct, we adopt the board\u2019s recommended sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">{\u00b6 14} Accordingly, Bruce Alan Zaccagnini is permanently disbarred from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">{\u00b6 15} Costs are taxed to respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b365-12\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AOC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>Jonathan E.

Relator charged respondent with misconduct under applicable rules for acts occurring before and after February 1, 2007, the effective date of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which supersede the Disciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility.
