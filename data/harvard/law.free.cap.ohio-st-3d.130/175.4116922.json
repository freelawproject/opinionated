Because that decision expands the exception to political-subdivision immunity for the negligent failure to maintain a roadway beyond that intended by the General Assembly and potentially imposes on political subdivisions a duty to defend in cases arising out of accidents where skid resistance becomes an issue, and because an issue of this importance deserves a decision on the merits to clarify the law for Ohio appellate courts, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss this appeal as having been improvidently accepted.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 4} On March 4, 2006, Michelle Sanderbeck rode in the back seat of a vehicle driven at a high rate of speed by 16-year-old Steven W., as it approached an S curve on East Smith Road in Medina County. The driver lost control of the vehicle, crossed the eastbound lane of traffic, left the road, and drove into a drainage ditch, flipping the vehicle onto its top and coming to rest on a stone retaining wall. Michelle died in that crash.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 5} Raymond Sanderbeck (individually and as administrator of Michelle\u2019s estate) filed a wrongful-death action against Medina County, asserting that it had negligently, recklessly, and willfully and wantonly failed to keep East Smith Road in repair, proximately causing his daughter\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 6} The county asserted its political-subdivision immunity, but Sanderbeck contended that an exception to the county\u2019s immunity applied pursuant to R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), which provides that \u201cpolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair.\u201d In support of his position, Sanderbeck relied on the expert opinion of Richard L. Stanford II, who opined that at the time of the crash, \u201cEast Smith Road was in disrepair and a contributing factor in the accident that claimed Michelle Sanderbeck\u2019s life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 7} Stanford explained that roadway curves have a characteristic known as \u201ccritical speed,\u201d which is \u201cthe speed at which the tires of a turning vehicle attempting to negotiate the curve will begin to sideslip, often resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle.\u201d Stanford further testified that roads also have a \u201cskid number\u201d based on their coefficient of friction that relates to their skid resistance, and he asserted that a high-volume roadway like East Smith Road is considered out of repair if it has a skid number of 38 or less. He therefore believed that the \u201cworn out\u201d condition of East Smith Road contributed to the accident because, at the time of the crash, the critical speed of the curve was 45 m.p.h. or less and the road had a skid number of only 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 8} The trial court denied the county\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and the Ninth District upheld that decision, holding that the testimony of Sander-beck\u2019s expert established a genuine issue of material fact regarding the claim that the county had failed to keep the road in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>{\u00b6 9} On appeal, the county maintains that Sanderbeck presented no evidence that it had failed to keep the road in repair, because his expert had no knowledge of the skid resistance of the road at the time of its design or construction. Sanderbeck responds that Stanford\u2019s testimony regarding the insufficient skid resistance of the road at the time of the accident demonstrates that the county failed to maintain it in a safe condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 10} This case concerns an issue of public and great general interest: whether a political subdivision may be deprived of a benefit of its sovereign immunity based only on the opinion of an expert that the skid resistance of the road fell below a certain theoretical threshold level at the time of an accident, without knowing the skid resistance of the road at the time of its construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 11} R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) generally affords political subdivisions immunity from tort actions, providing that \u201ca political subdivision is not liable in damages in a civil action for injury, death, or loss to person or property allegedly caused by any act or omission of the political subdivision or an employee of the political subdivision in connection with a governmental or proprietary function.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(e) specifically defines the maintenance and repair of roads to be a governmental function.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 12} Nonetheless, R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) establishes an exception to this immunity: \u201c[PJolitical subdivisions are liable for injury, death, or loss to person or property caused by their <em>negligent failure to keep public roads in repair </em>and other negligent failure to remove obstructions from public roads * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 13} In my view, the testimony of an expert regarding the adequacy of a roadway\u2019s skid resistance at the time of an accident does not without more establish that the road is out of repair for purposes of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Our duty in construing statutes is to determine and give effect to the intent of the General Assembly in enacting them. <em>Fisher v. Hasenjager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 53, 2007-Ohio-5589, 876 N.E.2d 546, \u00b6 20. And as we explained in <em>Symmes Twp. Bd. of Trustees v. Smyth </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 549, 553, 721 N.E.2d 1057, \u201c[wjhen the language of a statute is plain and unambiguous and conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no need for this court to apply the rules of statutory interpretation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 14} R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) is unambiguous, and we need only apply it here. The plain meaning of the word \u201crepair\u201d is \u201cto put back in good condition after damage [or] decay.\u201d Webster\u2019s New World College Dictionary (4th Ed.2000) 1214. Thus, in order for a claimant to establish that a political subdivision has failed to keep a public road in repair, there must be evidence presented regarding the condition of the roadway prior to its alleged damage or deterioration in order to show that the duty to maintain a public road has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>{\u00b6 15} It is recognized that a political subdivision is immune from suit for the design and construction of a roadway, see <em>Haynes v. Franklin, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 18 (construing analogous predecessor statute), but not for failure to maintain a roadway in good repair. R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 16} Here, Sanderbeck presented expert testimony regarding the skid resistance of the road at the time of the accident, but he presented no evidence establishing its skid resistance at the time of design and construction. In my view, testing regarding the skid resistance of the road at the time of the accident fails to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding his claim that Medina County is liable for negligent failure to keep public roads in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 17} The General Assembly, as the final arbiter of public policy in Ohio, has intended \u201cto limit political-subdivision liability for roadway injuries and deaths,\u201d <em>Howard v. Miami Twp. Fire Div., </em>119 Ohio St.3d 1, 2008-Ohio-2792, 891 N.E.2d 311, \u00b6 29, with a purpose to preserve \u201c \u2018the fiscal integrity of political subdivisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hubbell v. Xenia, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 77, 2007-Ohio-4839, 873 N.E.2d 878, \u00b623, quoting <em>Wilson v. Stark Cty. Dept. of Human Servs. </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 450, 453, 639 N.E.2d 105; see also <em>Rankin v. Cuyahoga Cty. Dept. of Children &amp; Family Servs., </em>118 Ohio St.3d 392, 2008-Ohio-2567, 889 N.E.2d 521, \u00b6 34. The court of appeals\u2019 decision in this case frustrates that policy and imposes on political subdivisions the duty to defend in numerous cases raising claims similar to those presented here, exposing them to potential liability for all accidents occurring on roads within their territorial limits. I would prefer to decide the issues here, review the evidence to determine whether the county breached its duty to keep the roadway in repair, and further consider the immunity granted to political subdivisions and the application of R.C. Chapter 2744 to the facts of this case, given the other attendant factors that could have contributed to this accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 18} Because the majority dismisses this appeal as having been improvidently accepted without reaching its merits, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b464-8\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b464-9\">Lanzinger, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AAJ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 19} I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss this appeal as having been improvidently accepted. We have been given the opportunity to set forth parameters with respect to the sufficiency of evidence needed to create a material issue of fact on whether a road is kept \u201cin repair,\u201d thus subjecting a political subdivision to the possibility of liability under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). This is an important question for all political subdivisions throughout the state and should be answered.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Because I believe that the evidence offered by appellee, Raymond J. Sanderbeck, in opposition to the motion for summary judgment filed by Medina County and the Medina County Board of Commissioners (\u201cthe county appellants\u201d) is insufficient to raise an issue over the assertion that the county appellants negligently failed to keep the road in question in repair, appellee is unable to establish an exception to R.C. 2744.02(A)(l)\u2019s general grant of sovereign immunity. I would hold that the county appellants are entitled to summary judgment on the grounds of immunity and accordingly would reverse the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">I. Case Background</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b621} This case arises from a tragic, single-car collision that occurred on March 4, 2006, in Medina County, resulting in the death of Michelle L. Sander-beck. The driver, who was exceeding the posted advisory speed limit of 25 miles per hour on East Smith Road, had failed to negotiate an S curve and overturned the car into an embankment.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 22} Sanderbeck filed this wrongful-death action individually and as administrator of his daughter\u2019s estate against the county appellants, asserting that they had negligently, recklessly, and willfully and wantonly failed to perform the necessary care, supervision, and control in the maintenance and repair of East Smith Road, proximately causing his daughter\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 23} The county appellants filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that they were entitled to statutory immunity under R.C. 2744.02(A)(1). The trial court denied summary judgment after finding that questions of fact remained on whether the road had been in repair and whether the county appellants had been required to install a guardrail at the site of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 24} The Ninth District Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment in part and reversed it in part. The court of appeals held first that Sanderbeck\u2019s expert\u2019s affidavit and deposition testimony that East Smith Road was in disrepair at the time of the accident constituted evidence sufficient to prevent summary judgment in the county appellants\u2019 favor. 2010-Ohio-3659, 2010 WL 3075598, at \u00b6 12. The appellate court also held, however, that Sanderbeck failed to show a duty on the part of the county and board to erect a guardrail, because the drainage ditch running parallel to East Smith Road and under a driveway was not a \u201cculvert\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 5591.36. Id. at \u00b6 17. Thus, the trial court\u2019s order denying summary judgment was affirmed on the repair issue but was reversed on the guardrail issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 25} We accepted the first proposition of law presented by the county appellants on their discretionary appeal: \u201cUnder R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), the skid resistance of a road does not raise a repair issue when no evidence exists <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>regarding the skid resistance of the road at the time of design or construction. (R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) interpreted and applied.)\u201d 127 Ohio St.3d 1502, 2011-Ohio-19, 939 N.E.2d 1266. We are asked to interpret the meaning of the statute that sets forth the duty of the county appellants to repair roads and the evidence needed to create a material issue of fact on the liability of political subdivisions under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). As part of this analysis, we must determine whether a political subdivision may be deprived of the benefit of its sovereign immunity based only on the opinion of an expert who, without knowing the skid resistance at the time of the road\u2019s construction, asserted that the skid resistance of the road was below a certain theoretical threshold level at the time of an accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">\n<em>A. Political^Subdivision Tort Immunity under R.C. Chapter 2711</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 26} The Political-Subdivision Tort Liability Act, R.C. Chapter 2744, was enacted in response to the judicial abolishment of common-law sovereign immunity for political subdivisions in <em>Haverlack v. Portage Homes, Inc. </em>(1982), 2 Ohio St.3d 26, 2 OBR 572, 442 N.E.2d 749. The statutory scheme requires a three-tiered analysis. R.C. 2744.02(A)(1) provides that a political subdivision is generally not liable for damages for injury, death, or loss to persons or property incurred in connection with the performance of a governmental or proprietary function of the political subdivision. R.C. 2744.02(B) lists several exceptions to the general grant of sovereign immunity. Even if an exception applies under R.C. 2744.02(B), however, immunity may be restored if a political subdivision can assert one of the defenses to liability found in R.C. 2744.03.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 27} \u201cPolitical subdivision\u201d means \u201ca municipal corporation, township, county, school district, or other body corporate and politic responsible for governmental activities in a geographic area smaller than that of the state.\u201d R.C. 2744.01(F). County appellants fall squarely within this definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision,\u201d while the term \u201cgovernmental function\u201d specifically includes \u201cthe maintenance and repair\u201d of roads. R.C. 2744.01(C)(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">{\u00b628} But there are several exceptions to the general grant of sovereign immunity, as listed by R.C. 2744.02(B). Sanderbeck relies on R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), which provides: \u201c[PJolitical subdivisions are liable for * * * death * * * caused by their negligent failure to keep public roads in repair * * In responding to the county appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, Sanderbeck asserted that a material question of fact existed on whether the county appellants had kept East Smith Road \u201cin repair\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">\n<em>B. Scope of R.C. 27H.02(B).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 29} For their part, the county appellants argue that \u201cin repair\u201d as used in R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) refers to \u201cmaintaining a road\u2019s condition after construction or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>reconstruction.\u201d They assert that the Ninth District Court of Appeals failed to properly interpret the statute when it held that the testimony of Sanderbeck\u2019s expert was sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact because the expert\u2019s testimony at best indicated a design flaw, rather than a failure to keep the road in repair. Sanderbeck responds that the lower courts correctly determined that the expert\u2019s testimony, along with other evidence depicting the roadway, created a genuine issue on whether the county appellants had kept the road in repair.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 30} To prevail in their motion for summary judgment, the county appellants must show that there is no genuine issue of <em>material </em>fact in this case. <em>Dresher v. Burt </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 280, 294, 662 N.E.2d 264. Sanderbeck cannot avoid summary judgment merely by showing that some facts are in dispute. In this case, R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) provides the possibility of an exception to a political subdivision\u2019s immunity from tort liability when the political subdivision has failed to keep public roads in repair. The material issue in this case, then, is whether the county appellants failed in their duty to keep the road in repair. To answer this question, one must first determine the definition of the phrase \u201cin repair,\u201d which is undefined in R.C. Chapter 2744.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 31} I agree with the county appellants that the phrase \u201cin repair\u201d refers to a public subdivision\u2019s duty to maintain a road\u2019s condition after construction or reconstruction. In a case decided before R.C. Chapter 2744 was enacted, we stated that a statute setting forth a duty of county commissioners to keep roads \u201cin proper repair\u201d created \u201ca duty on the commissioners only in matters concerning either the deterioration or disassembly of county roads and bridges.\u201d <em>Heckert v. Patrick </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 402, 406, 15 OBR 516, 473 N.E.2d 1204. Given the broad grant of sovereign immunity in R.C. 2744.02(A)(1), however, we cannot read R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) as allowing a claimant to establish that an exception to immunity exists by merely asserting that a road does not have a certain skid-resistance number. To establish a genuine issue of material fact on whether the road lacked appropriate maintenance, i.e., was out of repair, evidence must be adduced to prove that the skid resistance of the roadway had deteriorated from an earlier condition. Only in this manner can a claimant demonstrate that the lack of adequate skid resistance is attributable to the failure to maintain a public roadway.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>C. Insufficient evidence of \u201cfailure to keep public roads in repair\u201d</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 32} Sanderbeck failed to submit evidence sufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact on this crucial point.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 33} Sanderbeck relied on the expert opinion of Richard L. Stanford II, who gave an opinion that at the time of the crash, \u201cEast Smith Road was in disrepair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>and a contributing factor in the accident that claimed Michelle Sanderbeck\u2019s life.\u201d Stanford stated that roadway curves have a characteristic known as \u201ccritical speed,\u201d which is \u201cthe speed at which the tires of a turning vehicle attempting to negotiate the curve will begin to sideslip, often resulting in a loss of control of the vehicle.\u201d Stanford further testified that roads also have a \u201cskid number\u201d based on their coefficient of friction that relates to their skid resistance, and he asserted that a high-volume roadway like East Smith Road is considered out of repair if it has a skid number of 38 or less. He therefore believed that the \u201cworn out\u201d condition of East Smith Road contributed to the accident because, at the time of the crash, the critical speed of the curve was 45 miles per hour or less and the road had a skid number of only 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 34} In summary, the evidence Sanderbeck provided was that (1) the \u201cskid number\u201d of the roadway is a calculation that determines the deterioration of the pavement friction characteristics of the road or, in other words, how susceptible a roadway is to having cars slip off the roadway; (2) a skid number of 25 was calculated for the portion of East Smith Road where the accident occurred; (3) anything less than a skid number of 38 on a high-volume road would qualify as \u201cdisrepaired pavement\u201d; (4) the \u201ccritical speed\u201d for a curve in a roadway is the speed at which the tires of a turning vehicle will begin to slip, potentially causing a loss of control of the vehicle; (5) Stanford\u2019s opinion was that the critical speed of East Smith Road at the time of the accident was at or below the posted speed limit of 45 miles per hour; (6) East Smith Road was \u201cin disrepair\u201d;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (7) the condition of East Smith Road was a contributing factor in the accident that resulted in Michelle Sanderbeck\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 35} While appellee argues that Stanford\u2019s testimony creates a genuine issue of material fact, there was no evidence offered that established that the roadway on the date of the accident had deteriorated from an earlier standard due to the county appellants\u2019 lack of maintenance.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 36} The difference between a road containing a design defect and a road that has fallen into disrepair is of critical importance in this case. R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) specifically provides that a political subdivision may be liable in tort for negligent failure to keep public roads in repair. But we have held that allegations involving design flaws \u201cinvolve discretionary functions as provided in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5)\u201d and that \u201cthe defenses found in R.C. 2744.03(A)(3) and (5) preclude the imposition of liability on a political subdivision for any acts or omissions related to these discretionary functions.\u201d <em>Franks v. Lopez </em>(1994), 69 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Ohio St.3d 345, 349-350, 632 N.E.2d 502. We have stated further that a \u201cplaintiff must establish that the <em>cause of </em>the condition was other than a decision regarding design and construction\u201d to overcome the hurdle of a political subdivision\u2019s immunity. (Emphasis sic.) <em>Haynes v. Franklin, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 344, 348, 2002-Ohio-2334, 767 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 18. Although both cases construed a previous version of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3) that contained the repealed concept of \u201cnuisance,\u201d the principle remains under the current version of the statute: a political subdivision is immune from liability for design or construction defects because decisions on those matters involve discretion on the part of employees of a political subdivision.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 37} Sanderbeck also relies upon photographs attached to the county appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment that depict the road the day after the accident occurred, asserting that they indicate spalling, i.e., physical deterioration of the pavement, and create a genuine issue of material fact on whether the road was in repair for purposes of R.C. 2744.02(B)(3). Yet as with the skid number and critical speed, the trial court was incorrect in stating that a material issue of fact on repair was created by these photographs, for no photographs were admitted showing the condition of the road beforehand for a basis of comparison.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Furthermore, Sanderbeck\u2019s assertion that his expert relied upon the photographs in forming his opinion that the road was in disrepair is contradicted by Stanford\u2019s deposition statement that while the pictures depicted deterioration in the road, that was not the \u201ckey point,\u201d and \u201cThe key point is we have a measurement of the friction characteristics which tell us that it was worn out or out of repair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 38} Viewed as a whole and in a light most favorable to appellee, the testimony of Stanford relates only to a potential flaw in the road\u2019s design or construction rather than the failure to adequately maintain the road. Stanford stated his opinion that at the time of the accident, the road\u2019s skid number fell below accepted standards and that the critical speed of the road was below the posted speed limit. Each of these measurements, however, concerns the design or construction of the road. Because the county appellants are immune from liability for faulty design or construction, this evidence is not sufficient to defeat the county appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 39} Under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), the skid resistance and critical speed of a road do not raise a repair issue when no evidence exists suggesting that the road <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>had deteriorated from an earlier standard due to a lack of maintenance.

Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 40} Because I conclude that appellee, Raymond J. Sanderbeck, failed to offer sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact on the issue of the political-subdivision immunity of Medina County and the Medina County commissioners under R.C. 2744.02(B)(3), I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to dismiss this case as having been improvidently accepted. I would instead reverse the decision of the court of appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b470-7\">Lundberg Stratton, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-8\">. Stanford\u2019s statement that the road was in disrepair is not based on supporting facts. \u201cIt is improper for an expert\u2019s affidavit to set forth conelusory statements and legal conclusions without sufficient supporting facts.\u201d <em>Douglass v. Salem Community Hosp., </em>153 Ohio App.3d 350, 2003-Ohio-4006, 794 N.E.2d 107, at \u00b6 28.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b469-9\">. Appellants assert that the photographs do not show that the road had deteriorated, while appellee argues that the photographs provide evidence of deterioration. Because these photographs cannot constitute evidence of a failure to keep the road in repair without photographs showing the road while it was alleged to be in repair, I would not address the issue of whether the photographs depicted deterioration.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
