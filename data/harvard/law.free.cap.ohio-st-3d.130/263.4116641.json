For the reasons that follow, we conclude that Dr. Skoskiewicz is not an officer or employee of the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">I. Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">{\u00b6 2} Dr. Marek Skoskiewicz practices general surgery at Henry County Hospital in Napoleon, Ohio. Henry County Hospital is a private organization and is not affiliated with the College of Medicine or any other state-sponsored institution. Dr. Skoskiewicz has been a volunteer clinical faculty member of the College of Medicine since 1995. The University of Toledo is a state university. R.C. 3345.011.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">{\u00b6 3} In January 2005, while a third-year medical student from the College of Medicine was observing, Dr. Skoskiewicz performed two vasectomy surgeries on appellee, Larry Engel Jr., on separate days. Both of these procedures occurred at Henry County Hospital. Allegedly due to negligence during the first and second surgeries, a third surgery, to remove Engel\u2019s necrotic right testicle, was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In May 2006, Engel filed a medical-malpractice suit against Dr. Skoskiewicz in the Henry County Court of Common Pleas. Dr. Skoskiewicz asserted that he was entitled to personal immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86 because, at the time of the surgeries, he was acting in his capacity as a volunteer clinical instructor of the College of Medicine and was therefore an officer or employee of the state. Accordingly, Engel filed an action against the College of Medicine in the Court of Claims, which possesses exclusive jurisdiction over personal-immunity claims. R.C. 2743.02(F). In his complaint, Engel reasserted his malpractice allegations and sought a determination whether Dr. Skoskiewicz was entitled to personal immunity as a state employee. The court of common pleas stayed Engel\u2019s malpractice suit pending resolution of the personal-immunity issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">{\u00b6 5} The Court of Claims concluded that Dr. Skoskiewicz had \u201cperformed the operations as a state employee\u201d and that, therefore, he was entitled to personal immunity. <em>Engel v. Univ. of Toledo College of Medicine, </em>Ct. of Cl. No. 2008-03572, 2008-Ohio-7058, \u00b623. The Tenth District Court of Appeals affirmed, based on its conclusion that Dr. Skoskiewicz \u201csatisfies the definition of \u2018officer or employee\u2019 in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a).\u201d <em>Engel v. Univ. of Toledo College of Medicine, </em>184 Ohio App.3d 669, 2009-Ohio-3957, 922 N.E.2d 244, \u00b6 16. This court accepted Engel\u2019s discretionary appeal. 124 Ohio St.3d 1479, 2010-Ohio-354, 921 N.E.2d 249.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b550-7\">{\u00b6 6} R.C. 9.86 states, \u201cExcept for civil actions that arise out of the operation of a motor vehicle and civil actions in which the state is the plaintiff, no officer or employee shall be liable in any civil action that arises under the law of this state for damage or injury caused in the performance of his duties, unless the officer\u2019s or employee\u2019s actions were manifestly outside the scope of his employment or official responsibilities, or unless the officer or employee acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a wanton or reckless manner.\u201d In <em>Theobald v. Univ. of Cincinnati, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 541, 2006-Ohio-6208, 857 N.E.2d 573, \u00b6 14, this court stated that determining whether a person is entitled to R.C. 9.86 immunity requires a two-part analysis, the first part of which is to determine whether the person claiming immunity is a state officer or employee. If the person claiming immunity is a state officer or employee, the second part of the analysis is to determine whether that person was acting within the scope of employment when the cause of action arose. Id. Because we conclude that Dr. Skoskiewicz was not a state officer or employee when the cause of action arose, we need not address the second part.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-8\">\n<em>A. Is Dr. Skoskiewicz a state employee?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b550-9\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) through (d) defines who is a state officer or employee for purposes of R.C. 9.86. R.C. 9.85(A); <em>Theobald </em>at \u00b6 14. Only subsection (a) is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>relevant here; it provides that a state officer or employee is \u201c[a] person who, at the time a cause of action against the person arises, is serving in an elected or appointed office or position with the state or is employed by the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">{\u00b6 8} This court has rarely had the opportunity to examine subsection (a) of R.C. 109.36. In <em>State ex rel Sanquily v. Lucas Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1991), 60 Ohio St.3d 78, 573 N.E.2d 606, we did little more than acknowledge the obvious: that a doctor employed as a resident physician working for the Medical College of Ohio, a state institution, was a state employee. We did not use a specific test or look at a list of criteria to determine whether the doctor in that case was a state officer or employee, as it was obvious that he was a state employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">{\u00b6 9} Although <em>Theobald </em>involved a similar medical-malpractice suit filed against several doctors, the case is of little help here. The issue whether the doctors were state employees was not before the court because it had not been appealed. Id. at \u00b6 14. The ultimate issue in <em>Theobald </em>was whether the doctors were acting within the scope of employment when the alleged negligence occurred, which is not relevant here. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">{\u00b6 10} The College of Medicine suggests that certain factors be considered when determining whether a person is a state employee. Although we do not adopt a formal test, we find the proposed factors to be helpful. We emphasize that other factors may be considered and stress that in most circumstances a person\u2019s status as a state employee is factually indisputable.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-9\">1. Contractual relationship between state and alleged employee</p>\n<p id=\"Ag0\">{\u00b6 11} The College of Medicine argues that Dr. Skoskiewicz was not a state employee because he did not have a contractual relationship with the College of Medicine. The only possible evidence that such a contractual relationship did exist are two letters from the College of Medicine, one from 1995 and one from 2005, confirming Dr. Skoskiewicz\u2019s status as a volunteer clinical instructor. But the letters do not show that Dr. Skoskiewicz was hired, appointed, or credentialed by the College of Medicine. Indeed, the parties stipulated that Dr. Skoskiewicz practiced general surgery at Henry County Hospital, which is not affiliated with or a part of any state university and is not an instrumentality of the state of Ohio. We conclude that there was no contract of employment, written or oral, between the College of Medicine and Dr. Skoskiewicz.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">2. State control over actions of purported employee</p>\n<p id=\"AYJ\">{\u00b6 12} The College of Medicine argues that Dr. Skoskiewicz was not a state employee because the College of Medicine did not exercise control over Dr. Skoskiewicz\u2019s medical practice. This argument is based on \u201cthe logical principle that where the state lacks the ability to control a physician\u2019s actions it makes no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>sense to extend immunity to him.\u201d See <em>Walton v. State Dept. of Health, </em>162 Ohio App.3d 65, 2005-Ohio-3375, 832 N.E.2d 790, \u00b6 19 (citing state\u2019s lack of control over plaintiff as basis for holding that plaintiff was not state employee). At all times relevant to this case, Dr. Skoskiewiez was treating a private patient at a private hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">{\u00b6 13} For its holding that Dr. Skoskiewiez was serving in an appointed position with the state, the court of appeals relied on the 2005 letter from the College of Medicine to Dr. Skoskiewiez confirming his \u201cappointment\u201d to the volunteer faculty. That letter states, \u201cAs a condition of appointment, you will be subject to the [Medical College of Ohio] Faculty Rules and Regulations, and Medical College of Ohio policies and procedures, including those governing research. Use of your Medical College of Ohio title or academic affiliation on professional publications, such as professional journal articles, requires the prior approval and is at the discretion of the department chair.\u201d But this language, without more, does not demonstrate that the College of Medicine exercised, or intended to exercise, such control over Dr. Skoskiewicz\u2019s practice of medicine as to justify a holding that the doctor was at any time a state employee. Whether the rules, regulations, policies, and procedures cited in the first sentence above would control the way Dr. Skoskiewiez practiced medicine is a matter of pure speculation. The import of the second sentence seems to be to ensure that the College of Medicine\u2019s name is not used to lend gravitas to published materials without its prior approval, which hardly shows the kind of control that would support a holding of employment. We conclude that the College of Medicine did not control Dr. Skoskiewiez.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">3. Payment by state for services of alleged employee</p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">{\u00b6 14} Finally, the College of Medicine argues that Dr. Skoskiewiez was not a state employee because he was not paid by the state for his services. The parties stipulated that \u201c[a]t no time relevant to this case was Dr. Skoskiewiez a member of the regular faculty of the [College of Medicine]. At all times relevant to this case, regular faculty members of the [College of Medicine] were paid academic salaries directly from [the college]. Dr. Skoskiewiez did not receive any such salary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">{\u00b6 15} That the College of Medicine did not directly pay Dr. Skoskiewiez does not necessarily mean that he is not a state employee. For example, in <em>Potavin v. Univ. Med. Ctr. </em>(Apr. 19, 2001), 10th Dist. No. 00AP-715, 2001 WL 392492, the court of appeals concluded that a state entity, the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, and a private entity, the Foundation for Obstetrics and Gynecology, \u201cfunctioned as one entity\u201d because the foundation \u201ccould not exist if not for its relationship\u201d with the medical center. Id. at *5. Based on that finding, the court concluded that a doctor who volunteered for the state entity but who was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>paid by the foundation was a state employee. Id. But here no such symbiotic relationship exists. The College of Medicine did not pay Dr. Skoskiewicz, and the Henry County Hospital, whieh is not connected with the college, did.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">{\u00b6 16} Based on the record before us, we conclude that there was no contract of employment between the College of Medicine and Dr. Skoskiewicz, that the College of Medicine did not exercise control over Dr. Skoskiewiez\u2019s medical practice, and that the College of Medicine did not pay Dr. Skoskiewicz. Based on these conclusions, we conclude that Dr. Skoskiewicz was not an employee of the College of Medicine.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-7\">\n<em>B. Does Dr. Skoskieioicz hold a state office or position?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b553-8\">{\u00b6 17} We must also determine whether Dr. Skoskiewicz was \u201cserving in an elected or appointed office or position with the state\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a). Based on the record and briefs, there is no suggestion that Dr. Skoskiewicz was holding an elected office or position, so we need not address that issue, which leaves us to consider only whether Dr. Skoskiewicz holds an \u201cappointed office or position with the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">{\u00b6 18} To be sure, the letters that Dr. Skoskiewicz received from the College of Medicine stated that the College of Medicine had approved his \u201cappointment\u201d to the volunteer faculty at the rank of clinical assistant professor. As support for the proposition that Dr. Skoskiewicz had been appointed to an R.C. 109.36 \u201coffice or position,\u201d however, these letters are a slender reed. We refuse to read so much into the letters\u2019 use of the word \u201cappointment\u201d because, to us, the more significant words in R.C. 109.36(A)(1)(a) are \u201coffice or position with the state.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ARK\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Skoskiewicz does not occupy a position or office with the state. In <em>State ex rel. Newman v. Skinner </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 325, 191 N.E. 127, this court was required to determine whether a person employed by the state as a librarian was also a state officer. We stated that \u201c[a] public officer, as distinguished from an employee, must possess some sovereign functions of government to be exercised by him for the benefit of the public either of an executive, legislative, or judicial character. * * * \u2018[T]he chief and most decisive characteristic of a public office is determined by the quality of the duties with which the appointee is invested, and by the fact that such duties are conferred upon the appointee by law.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 327, quoting <em>State ex rel. Landis v. Butler Cty. Bd. of Commrs. </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 157, 159, 115 N.E. 919. Clearly, Dr. Skoskiewicz possessed no \u201csovereign\u201d function of an executive, legislative, or judicial character. And his duties were not of a level consonant with those of a public office. The appointment did not entitle Dr. Skoskiewicz to office space, staff, or authority at the College of Medicine; did not enable him to lecture or teach a class at the College of Medicine; did not allow him to conduct university-sponsored research, although he was allowed to collaborate with College of Medicine researchers; did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>not allow him to practice at the university clinic; and did not entitle him to payment from the College of Medicine. In truth, based on the record before us, the appointment did not enable Dr. Skoskiewicz to do anything except, as stipulated, allow students to \u201crotate through Dr. Skoskiewicz\u2019s practice as a part of one-month clerkships.\u201d Furthermore, the appointment did not impose any duties upon Dr. Skoskiewicz. To the extent that complying with the College of Medicine\u2019s policy guidelines is a duty, the duty was not conferred by law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A9q\">Law Office of John B.

But that service, however commendable, does not transform the volunteers behind it into an arm of the state. Based on the record before us, we conclude that Dr. Skoskiewicz did not hold an appointed office or position with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">{\u00b6 21} We conclude that Dr. Skoskiewicz is not a state employee and that he does not hold an appointed office or position with the state. Accordingly, he is not entitled to personal immunity pursuant to R.C. 9.86. We reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
