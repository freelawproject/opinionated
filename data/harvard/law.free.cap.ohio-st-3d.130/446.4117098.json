Zody,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to initiate appropriation proceedings for the physical taking of their property resulting from flooding caused by a spillway constructed by respondents and the state\u2019s lake-level-management practices. We find that relators\u2019 claim is not barred by the applicable statute of limitations and that they have established a taking; therefore, we grant the writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">\n<em>Grand Lake St. Marys</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">{\u00b6 2} Grand Lake St. Marys (\u201cGLSM\u201d) is a man-made lake located in Mercer and Auglaize Counties in Ohio. GLSM was created between 1837 and 1841 as a water source for the Miami-Erie Canal by damming the headwaters of the Wabash and St. Marys Rivers and flooding the area in between. By the early 20th century, the use of the canal had decreased, and the lake\u2019s primary purpose changed. In 1949, the state designated GLSM as a state park and placed it under ODNR\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-7\">{\u00b6 3} GLSM is about 8.2 miles long, covers roughly 13,500 acres, and drains an area of about 112 square miles. Without the lake, about 59 percent of the GLSM watershed would drain to the west and eventually into the Mississippi River, and the remaining 41 percent would drain to the east into the St. Marys River and eventually into Lake Erie.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-8\">{\u00b6 4} The dam at GLSM is an earthen embankment about 5,540 feet long. In 1914, a 39.4-foot curved spillway was constructed on the western shoreline of the lake that feeds into Beaver Creek. The spillway had a crest elevation of 870 feet above mean sea level and four gated outlet conduits. Between 1985 and 1997, only two of the four gates worked. GLSM discharges water from the western spillway into Beaver Creek, which in turn discharges water into the Wabash River, which flows in a westerly direction from Ohio into Indiana. Although a gate also existed at the eastern end of the lake, that gate had limited discharge capabilities. ODNR thus used the western spillway for virtually all water flow out of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-9\">{\u00b6 5} A 1978 inspection showed that the western spillway at GLSM could not pass a probable' maximum flood<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> without overtopping for 48 hours, which would result in the eventual failure of the dam and catastrophic flooding. This potential for failure presented an unacceptable risk for people and property downstream from the western spillway. In 1988, ODNR raised the crest elevation of the spillway to 870.6 feet by placing four-inch wooden boards at the crest of the old spillway.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-10\">{\u00b6 6} In 1990, ODNR determined that the 39.4-foot spillway needed to be replaced with a 500-foot spillway to pass the probable-maximum-flood test. ODNR began construction of the new spillway in 1996 and completed it in 1997. The new spillway has a crest elevation of 871.5 feet above mean sea level with a 50-foot-long notch in its center at 870.6 feet above mean sea level.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>{\u00b6 7} The redesigned spillway permanently established the four-inch increase in the lake level that ODNR had first achieved in 1988 by placing \u201cstop logs\u201d across the spillway to increase recreational value to boaters at GLSM. ODNR had previously regulated the lake level at GLSM by lowering it through the old spillway\u2019s gated outlets by 12 inches almost every winter. However, after the new spillway \u2014 which has two 60-inch outlets near the bottom of the structure\u2014 was built, ODNR considered the lake to be self-regulating; it has not lowered the GLSM lake level since that time, although it has the capability to do so. When ODNR finished building the new spillway, it also modified the eastern outlet of GLSM with a structure that has no flood-management capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-5\">\n<em>Concerns about New Spillway</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">{\u00b6 8} From the outset of the spillway-replacement project, public officials and private citizens expressed concerns to ODNR and others regarding the possibility of greater flooding downstream along Beaver Creek.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">{\u00b6 9} Keith G. Earley, the Mercer County Engineer at that time, wrote a series of letters and met with ODNR and other officials to express his concern that the new spillway would cause increased flooding on the western side of GLSM that would adversely affect downstream farmers and businesses. Earley later concluded that \u201cODNR chose to serve recreational users of Grand Lake by maintaining a constant lake level and to avoid any flooding on the southern end of Grand Lake to the detriment of the owners of structures and farmers on the western side of Grand Lake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">{\u00b6 10} Similarly, the Mercer County Soil and Water Conservation District advised ODNR that it needed to either address or further study the effect of the new spillway on croplands and that it believed that ODNR \u201chas forgotten the farmer, as the * * * design of the spillway will put 4 feet in Beaver Creek itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-9\">{\u00b6 11} Finally, the Mercer County Board of Commissioners warned that \u201cany possible adverse [effects] that could occur along the Beaver Creek outlet should be thoroughly evaluated before proceeding further.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b735-10\">\n<em>State ex rel. Post v. Speck</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">{\u00b6 12} In May 2001, five landowners of property located downstream from the western spillway of GLSM along Beaver Creek or the Wabash River filed an action for a writ of mandamus against the director of ODNR in the Mercer County Court of Common Pleas. The landowners owned farmland whose location ranged from less than one mile from the redesigned western spillway to 11 miles away. The common pleas court granted the writ after concluding that ODNR\u2019s 1997 modification of the western spillway constituted a taking of the farmers\u2019 property because of \u201cfrequent, severe and persistent flooding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>{\u00b6 13} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the common pleas court after it determined that the court\u2019s factual findings were supported by sufficient, credible evidence. <em>State ex rel. Post v. Speck, </em>Mercer App. No. 10-2006-001, 2006-Ohio-6339, 2006 WL 3477024, \u00b6 76-77.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">\n<em>Case Leasing &amp; Rental, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AXp\">{\u00b6 14} In 2005, an Ohio corporation filed suit against ODNR in the Ohio Court of Claims, alleging that flood damage to its property caused by the replacement spillway resulted in an unconstitutional taking without just compensation. The corporation owned 21 acres of land adjacent to Beaver Creek, a few hundred yards downstream from the intersection of Beaver Creek and the western shoreline of GLSM. The Court of Claims held that ODNR was liable for the negligent construction and maintenance of the replacement spillway. The court concluded that \u201cODNR knew or should have known that the installation of the replacement spillway as designed would result in more frequent and more severe flooding to downstream landowners\u201d and that ODNR\u2019s \u201cdesign choice and subsequent lake level management were unreasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b736-6\">{\u00b6 15} On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed that part of the judgment finding ODNR liable in negligence, but reversed and remanded for further determination on the issue of damages. <em>Case Leasing &amp; Rental, Inc. v. Ohio Dept. of Natural Resources, </em>Franklin App. No. 09AP-498, 2009-Ohio-6573, 2009 WL 4809639.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-7\">\n<em>Mandamus</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b736-8\">{\u00b6 16} On July 17, 2009, relators, more than 80 landowners,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> filed this action for a writ of mandamus in this court to compel respondents, ODNR and its director, to initiate appropriation proceedings for the taking of their property. Respondents filed a motion to dismiss, and relators filed a memorandum in opposition. We granted an alternative writ and set a schedule for briefing and presentation of evidence. 123 Ohio St.3d 1404, 2009-Ohio-5031, 914 N.E.2d 203. We later appointed a master commissioner for the limited purpose of receiving evidence and making evidentiary rulings. 123 Ohio St.3d 1435, 2009-Ohio-5611, 915 N.E.2d 659. The parties submitted evidence, and we made various evidentiary rulings. See, e.g., 125 Ohio St.3d 1504, 2010-Ohio-3268, 929 N.E.2d 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-9\">{\u00b6 17} Relators presented substantial, credible lay evidence by way of affidavits, depositions, photographs, and videos to show that following ODNR\u2019s 1997 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>replacement of the western spillway and its concomitant decision to abandon lake-level management, their properties flooded more frequently, over a larger area, for longer periods of time and with greater resulting damage, including crop loss, the deposit of silt, sand, stone, and other debris, drainage-tile failure, soil compaction, and the destruction of trees, bushes, and shrubs. Some of the relators presented evidence that their properties had never flooded until the construction of the new spillway and abandonment of lake-level management.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">{\u00b6 18} Most of the relators have experienced flooding on a frequent basis since the new spillway was built and lake-level management was discontinued, with many experiencing flooding every year and in some years on multiple occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">{\u00b6 19} Relators also presented expert evidence in support of their claims. Their primary expert was Pressley L. Campbell, an engineer with education and experience in hydrology and hydraulics.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Based on his previous work as an expert for the relators in <em>Case Leasing, </em>as well as his analysis of rainfall records and storm-event data from 1913 to 2006 and lake-elevation readings from 1927 to 2006, Campbell opined that the redesigned spillway caused frequent and severe flooding in the Beaver Creek-Wabash River area.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">{\u00b6 20} Campbell concluded that it was highly unlikely that relators\u2019 property downstream from the GLSM spillway would have flooded if the old spillway had been in place and ODNR had continued the lake-level management it had practiced before the 1997 construction of the new spillway. Campbell determined that based upon his analysis of lake-elevation data, if the new spillway had been in place in 1927, 15 storm events between 1927 and 2006 would have resulted in flooding, i.e., an average of one every five years, whereas with the old 39.4-foot spillway and lake-level-management practices in place, only one storm event would have caused flooding.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">{\u00b6 21} Campbell further calculated that since 1997, 73.3 percent of the daily measurements reflected GLSM elevations above 870.6 feet mean sea level, the elevation at which water overflows the spillway and enters Beaver Creek. ' By contrast, before 1997, the lake elevation was above 870.6 feet for only 21.4 percent of the measurements. Campbell found that since 1997, 26.3 percent of the daily measurements exhibited lake elevations above 871.5 feet mean sea level, the elevation at which water overflows the entire 500-foot spillway, whereas before 1997, the lake elevation was above 871.5 feet for only 2.4 percent of the measurements.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>{\u00b6 22} Relators also relied on the testimony of Keith Earley, the former Mercer County Engineer who had warned ODNR that its planned redesign of the spillway would result in flooding to downstream farmers on the western side of the lake, and James Moir, an engineer who had criticized the analysis performed by respondents\u2019 expert. Finally, relators submitted evidence from <em>Post </em>and <em>Case Leasing, </em>which involved different properties in the same general area as those at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">{\u00b6 23} Respondents submitted evidence from ODNR\u2019s expert, the consulting firm Stantec. Stantec constructed hydrologic and hydraulic models of the pertinent property using computer programs developed by the United States Army Corps of Engineers. Stantec\u2019s hydrologic modeling confirmed greater peak spillway flow from the new spillway when compared to the old spillway for 24-hour 100-year storm events and 96-hour five-year, ten-year, and 100-year storm events.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">{\u00b6 24} For example, the peak spillway flow for a 96-hour five-year rain event for the new spillway was 390 cubic feet per second (\u201ccfs\u201d), which exceeds the 345 cfs peak spillway flow for a 96-hour 100-year rain event for the old spillway. And the 650 cfs peak spillway flow for a 96-hour ten-year rain event for the new spillway exceeds the 480 to 500 cfs capacity for Beaver Creek that ODNR had stipulated to in <em>Case Leasing, </em>which would cause Beaver Creek to overtop its banks.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">{\u00b6 25} In Stantec\u2019s initial report in March 2010, it concluded that for an event expected to occur once every 15 years (7 percent chance of occurring in any given year), the new spillway causes an increase in depth of flooding up to 1.6 feet directly below the spillway, and the increased depth decreases until about two miles downstream, when any increased flooding results from local drainage and runoff, not spillway flow. Stantec further found that for an event expected to occur once every 100 years (1 percent chance of occurring in any year), the new spillway causes an increase in depth of flooding up to three feet directly below the spillway, with the depth decreasing until about four miles downstream.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-8\">{\u00b6 26} In sum, Stantec determined that the new spillway increases the duration of out-of-bank flooding for some properties adjacent to Beaver Creek and the Wabash River during both the 15-year and 100-year rain events because of the new spillway, with some properties having increased duration of flooding of up to two days, but that a number of parcels identified in the case are not affected by either increased depth or duration of flooding due to the new spillway.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-9\">{\u00b6 27} In its March 2010 report, Stantec determined that \u201c[bjecause rainfall events that are likely to cause flooding happen over the entire watershed, when assessing the impacts of the spillway modification, it is not proper to do so without considering the contribution of runoff below the dam; runoff that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>present and contributed to flooding problems in Beaver Creek well before the spillway modification.\u201d For a 96-hour 15-year rain event, the \u201cspillway flow makes up well under 10% of the overall flow entering the system for both the new and old spillway configurations. This means that the majority of the flooding, especially as the distance downstream of the spillway increases, results from runoff that enters the stream below the spillway and not a direct result of spillway flow itself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">{\u00b6 28} In a May 26, 2010 memorandum, Stantec responded to relators\u2019 expert\u2019s questions and concerns by explaining and updating its analysis. The results of the revision showed slightly less effect on the relators\u2019 property from the new spillway. Stantec concluded that (1) ten of relators\u2019 parcels were affected by increased maximum depth and duration of flooding during a 15-year rain event, (2) 46 parcels were affected by increased duration of flooding during a 15-year rain event, and (3) 35 parcels were not affected by flows from the new spillway during a 15-year rain event.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">{\u00b6 29} Stantec also concluded that (1) 25 of relators\u2019 parcels were affected by increased maximum depth and duration of flooding during a 100-year rain event, (2) 41 parcels were affected by increased duration of flooding during a 100-year rain event, and (3) 25 parcels were not affected by flows from the new spillway during a 100-year rain event. Stantec determined that only 16 of relators\u2019 parcels had additional acreage affected by flooding resulting from the new spillway during a 15-year rain event and that only 24 parcels had increased acreage affected during a 100-year rain event.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">{\u00b6 30} Stantec\u2019s modeling, however, was flawed because it underestimated the infiltration, or antecedent moisture, of the soil, which affects runoff, and which is therefore important in determining the amount of flooding affecting relators\u2019 property.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-8\">{\u00b6 31} In addition, although Stantec attempted to show that increased rainfall was the main cause of the flooding of relators\u2019 property, its senior associate could point to only a slight increase in the average number of severe rainfall days after 1997, when the new spillway was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">{\u00b6 32} The parties subsequently submitted briefs, and the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation filed an amicus curiae brief in support of relators. Oral argument was held on September 20, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">Legal Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">\n<em>Applicable Statute of Limitations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b739-12\">{\u00b6 33} We must first resolve the question of which statute of limitations applies in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>{\u00b6 34} \u201cUnder R.C. 2305.09(E), an action for relief on the grounds of a physical or regulatory taking of real property must generally be brought within four years after the cause accrued.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nickoli v. Erie MetroParks, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 449, 2010-Ohio-606, 923 N.E.2d 588, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">{\u00b6 35} Thus, as we held in <em>Nickoli, </em>the four-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.09(E), which was expressly promulgated by the General Assembly to address takings claims, is generally applicable to such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">\n<em>R.C. 2305.09(E) Does Not Bar the Takings Claim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">{\u00b6 36} Respondents contend that because relators\u2019 claim is based primarily on the 1997 construction of the replacement spillway, their claim is time-barred by R.C. 2305.09(E). Respondents argue that relators or their predecessors-in-title either knew or should have known of any damage allegedly caused by the spillway by 2003 at the latest, when a catastrophic flood occurred that relators claim was caused by the spillway. Relators did not institute this action until 2009; thus, respondents argue, relators\u2019 claim is barred by the four-year limitations period of R.C. 2305.09(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">{\u00b6 37} Nevertheless, in assessing respondents\u2019 statute-of-limitations claim, we note that R.C. 2305.09 contains a comparable four-year limitations period for \u201ctrespassing upon real property.\u201d R.C. 2305.09(A). In construing the statute of limitations for actions for trespass upon real property, we have held that if a trespass is continuing rather than a single completed act, the limitations period is tolled. <em>Sexton v. Mason, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 275, 2008-Ohio-858, 883 N.E.2d 1013, \u00b6 30-33; <em>Valley Ry. Co. v. Franz </em>(1885), 43 Ohio St. 623, 4 N.E. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-9\">{\u00b6 38} In <em>Valley Ry., </em>the railway company built a dam and an artificial channel on its own land to divert the river from its natural channel. This construction was completed in 1874. The diverted water damaged the plaintiffs land, and the plaintiff filed suit for trespass in 1881. We held that the case was not barred by the four-year statute of limitations, because of the continuing nature of the company\u2019s trespass:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-10\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c[W]hen the owner of land rightly and lawfully does an act entirely on his own land, and by means of such act puts in action or directs a force against or upon, or that affects, another\u2019s land, without such other\u2019s consent or permission, such owner and actor is liable to such other for the damages thereby so caused the latter, and at once a cause of action accrues for such damages; and such force, if so continued, is continued by the act of such owner and actor, and it may be regarded as a continuing trespass or nuisance; and each additional damage thereby caused is caused by him, and is an additional cause of action; and, until such continued trespass or nuisance by adverse use ripens into and becomes a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>presumptive right and estate in the former, the latter may bring his action.\u201d Id. at 627.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">{\u00b6 40} Although the railway company\u2019s actions in diverting the river ended in 1874, the company\u2019s continued control over the diverted channel resulted in a continuing trespass that tolled the four-year statute of limitations:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThe company remained upon its own land, and cut the new channel, and took control of the stream, and directed its course when the same passed from its land and its control, and has ever since so controlled and directed the stream that has caused the damage complained of. The amended petition states a cause of action that is not barred by the statute of limitations provided for such cases.\u201d Id., 43 Ohio St. at 628, 4 N.E. 88.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 42} Similarly, in <em>State v. Swartz </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 131, 723 N.E.2d 1084, the defendant was charged with creating a nuisance by erecting a bridge and culvert on his property, which allegedly caused a backup of water and ponding on a neighbor\u2019s property with each heavy water flow. The structures constituting the nuisance were completed in 1992, and prosecution was not commenced until 1998. Nevertheless, we held that the two-year limitations period had not expired, because the alleged nuisance remained within the control of the defendant so as to constitute a continuing course of conduct:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cWhere one creates a nuisance as defined in R.C. 3767.13(C) and permits it to remain, so long as it remains, and is within the control of the actor, the nuisance constitutes a continuing course of conduct tolling the limitations period pursuant to R.C. 2901.13(D).\u201d Id. at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 44} Finally, in <em>Sexton, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 275, 2008-Ohio-858, 883 N.E.2d 1013, we applied <em>Valley Ry., </em>43 Ohio St. 623, 4 N.E. 88, and <em>Swartz </em>and held that the \u201cdefendant\u2019s ongoing conduct or retention of control is the key\u201d to distinguishing a continuing trespass, which tolls a statute of limitations, from a permanent trespass, which does not. Id. at \u00b6 45. \u201cWe hold that a continuing trespass in this context occurs when there is some continuing or ongoing allegedly tortious activity attributable to the defendant. A permanent trespass occurs when the defendant\u2019s allegedly tortious act has been fully accomplished.\u201d Id. The defendants in <em>Sexton </em>had finished their work on the subdivision development and had ceded control by 1995. Because the neighboring homeowners did not bring suit until 2003, well after the four-year statute of limitations had expired, their trespass claim was barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 45} <em>Sexton, Valley Ry., </em>and <em>Swartz </em>lead inexorably to the conclusion that when an act carried out on the actor\u2019s own land causes continuing damage to another\u2019s property and the actor\u2019s conduct or retention of control is of a continuing nature, the statute of limitations is tolled. There is no logical rationale for refusing to apply this rule to takings cases and R.C. 2305.09(E). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>Otherwise, a person whose property is damaged by flooding caused by another\u2019s actions might have a cause of action against a private person or entity but not against a governmental entity. Here, respondents constructed the new spillway in 1997 and continued to exercise control over both the spillway and the lake level by making decisions not to draw down the water either annually or before heavy rains. Therefore, based on this court\u2019s precedent, relators\u2019 mandamus claim is not barred by the four-year statute of limitations in R.C. 2305.09(E), because respondents\u2019 ongoing control has tolled the running of the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">{\u00b6 46} In fact, in their merit brief, respondents do not even attempt to distinguish or otherwise argue the inapplicability of these cases. Instead, respondents rely on <em>Nickoli, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 449, 2010-Ohio-606, 923 N.E.2d 588, and <em>Painesville Mini Storage, Inc. v. Painesville, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 504, 2010-Ohio-920, 924 N.E.2d 357, in support of their argument that the four-year limitations period in R.C. 2305.09(E) was not tolled. These cases, however, are manifestly distinguishable. In <em>Nickoli, </em>the act constituting the taking \u2014 the construction and opening of a recreational trail \u2014 occurred on the relators\u2019 property rather than on the respondents\u2019 property. Unlike the relators here, the relators in <em>Nickoli </em>thus had direct and immediate notice of any alleged taking as well as the cause of the taking. In <em>Painesville, </em>the contested action was the city\u2019s issuance of a building permit for construction that, relator argued, interfered with its use of its own property. Unlike the alleged taking by ODNR and its director here, the city in <em>Painesville </em>did not retain control. And as with the relators in <em>Nickoli, </em>the relator in <em>Painesville </em>had direct and immediate notice of any alleged taking of its easement and right of access, as well as the cause of the taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">{\u00b6 47} By contrast, this case arises from facts that are similar to those in <em>Swartz </em>and <em>Valley Ry., </em>where defendants had allegedly engaged in conduct on their own property that caused flooding or water damage to adjoining landowners\u2019 property, and the defendants had retained control over their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">{\u00b6 48} Moreover, as we observed in <em>Nickoli </em>at \u00b6 34, quoting <em>Hopland Band of Pomo Indians v. United States </em>(Fed.Cir.1988), 855 F.2d 1573, 1577, a cause of action against the government does not accrue until \u201c \u2018all the events which fix the government\u2019s alleged liability have occurred and the plaintiff was or should have been aware of their existence.\u2019 (Emphasis omitted.)\u201d See also <em>United States v. Dickinson </em>(1947), 331 U.S. 745, 749, 67 S.Ct. 1382, 91 L.Ed. 1789 (\u201cwhen the Government chooses not to condemn land but to bring about a taking by a continuing process of physical events, the owner is not required to resort either to piecemeal or to premature litigation to ascertain the just compensation for what is really \u2018taken\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-8\">{\u00b6 49} Respondents\u2019 expert, Stantec, stated that \u201c[standard engineering practice calls for at least 10 and preferably 15 years or more of record in order to produce meaningful hydrologic statistics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>{\u00b6 50} Consequently, even assuming that respondents are correct that all the events that fixed their liability to downstream landowners like relators were completed in 1997, when the new spillway was built, their mandamus action in 2009 was still filed within the four-year period of R.C. 2305.09(E). The ten to 15 years necessary to gather data to prove a taking had not yet passed. Relators needed time to determine whether the flooding that followed respondents\u2019 construction of the spillway in 1997 and their refusal to lower the lake level at GLSM was of sufficient frequency to constitute a taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">{\u00b6 51} Therefore, the R.C. 2305.09(E) statute of limitations does not bar relators\u2019 takings claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\n<em>Mandamus: General Considerations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe United States and Ohio Constitutions guarantee that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.\u201d <em>State ex rel.

Relators argue that they need prove the required elements of mandamus only by a preponderance of the evidence, whereas respondents argue that the applicable standard is proof by clear and convincing evidence. A preponderance of the evidence is defined as that measure of proof that convinces the judge or jury that the existence of the fact sought to be proved is more likely than its nonexistence. See <em>Pang v.

In <em>State ex rel. Pressley v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1967), 11 Ohio St.2d 141, 161, 40 O.O.2d 141, 228 N.E.2d 631, we observed that in mandamus cases, \u201c \u2018[t]he facts submitted and the proof produced must be plain, clear, and convincing\u2019 \u201d before a writ will be granted. Id., quoting 35 Ohio Jurisprudence 2d (1959) 285, Section 37. And a few years later, in <em>State ex rel. Henslee v. Newman </em>(1972), 30 Ohio St.2d 324, 325, 59 O.O.2d 386, 285 N.E.2d 54, we held that the burden of proof on the relator in a mandamus case is to \u201c \u2018demonstrate that there is plain, clear, and convincing evidence which would require the granting of the writ.\u2019 \u201d Id., quoting the court of appeals\u2019 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">{\u00b6 56} Parties seeking extraordinary relief bear a more substantial burden in establishing their entitlement to this relief. In mandamus cases, this heightened standard of proof is reflected by two of the required elements \u2014 a \u201cclear\u201d legal right to the requested extraordinary relief and a corresponding \u201cclear\u201d legal duty on the part of the respondents to provide it.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">{\u00b6 57} Therefore, we reaffirm our holdings in <em>Pressley </em>and <em>Henslee </em>by specifying that relators in mandamus cases must prove their entitlement to the writ by clear and convincing evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">{\u00b6 58} Finally, relators seem to suggest that <em>Post </em>and <em>Case Leasing </em>are res judicata on relators\u2019 takings claim. We rejected a similar contention in <em>Nickoli, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 449, 2010-Ohio-606, 923 N.E.2d 588. Relators are not in privity with the claimants in <em>Post </em>and <em>Case Leasing </em>merely because they own property in the same general area. Id. at \u00b6 23-26. As to the evidence from those cases that has been submitted in this case, we will consider it to the extent that it is relevant to the takings claims of relators.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">\n<em>Mandamus: Taking by Flooding</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">{\u00b6 59} Relators\u2019 claim is based on a taking by flooding resulting from the state\u2019s public-improvement construction of a replacement spillway and its subsequent lake-level-management policies. \u201cAny direct encroachment upon land, which subjects it to a public use that excludes or restricts the dominion and control of the owner over it, is a taking of his property, for which he is guaranteed a right of compensation by section 19 [Article I of the Ohio Constitution].\u201d <em>Norwood v.

Co. </em>(1941), 312 U.S. 592, 598, 61 S.Ct. 772, 85 L.Ed. 1064. Even when the flooding is only occasional, a taking may result. See <em>United States v. Cress </em>(1917), 243 U.S. 316, 328, 37 S.Ct. 380, 61 L.Ed. 746 (\u201cThere is no difference of kind, but only of degree, between a permanent condition of continual overflow by backwater and a permanent liability to intermittent but inevitably recurring overflows; and, on principle, the right to compensation must arise in the one case as in the other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">{\u00b6 62} Relators\u2019 mandamus action is one for inverse condemnation, which is \u201ca cause of action against the government to recover the value of property taken by the government without formal exercise of the power of eminent domain.\u201d <em>Moden v. United States </em>(Fed.Cir.2005), 404 F.3d 1335, 1342.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">{\u00b6 63} The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, in a case involving a claimed taking by the government due to increased storm-water runoff caused by the construction of a post office, set forth the following two-part test for inverse-condemnation claims: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>probable result of an authorized activity and not the incidental or consequential injury inflicted by the action.\u2019 <em>Columbia Basin Orchard v. United States </em>(Ct.Cl.1955), 132 F.Supp. 707, 709 * * *. * * * Second, the nature and magnitude of the government action must be considered. Even where the effects of the government action are predictable, to constitute a taking, an invasion must appropriate a benefit to the government at the expense of the property owner, or at least preempt the owner\u2019s right to enjoy his property for an extended period of time, rather than merely inflict an injury that reduces its value.\u201d (Citations omitted in part.) <em>Ridge Line, Inc. v.

The line distinguishing potential physical takings from possible torts is drawn by a two-part inquiry. First, a property loss compensable as a taking only results when the government intends to invade a protected property interest or the asserted invasion is the \u2018direct, natural, or</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>{\u00b6 65} In eminent-domain cases involving claims of government-induced flooding, the claimant establishes a taking by proving that (1) the flooding is either intended by the government or is the direct, natural, or probable result of government-authorized activity and (2) the flooding is either a permanent invasion or creates a permanent liability because of intermittent, but inevitably recurring, overflows. See generally <em>Cary v. United States </em>(Fed.Cir.2009), 552 F.3d 1373, 1377, 1380-1381; <em>Arkansas Game &amp; Fish Comm. v. United States </em>(Fed.Cir.2011), 637 F.3d 1366, 1374-1375; <em>Ridge Line, </em>346 F.3d at 1355, 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">{\u00b6 66} The first part of this test, which requires that the flooding is either intended by the government or is the direct, natural, or probable result of the government-authorized activity, is characterized as the causation prong. <em>Cary </em>at 1376-1377. There is some evidence here that respondents made an intentional choice to favor recreational users of the lake and south-side lakefront landowners over landowners and farmers on the western side of the lake. But there is no credible evidence that ODNR and its director intended to flood relators\u2019 land. In fact, it appears that the intent of respondents in constructing the new spillway was to prevent flooding \u2014 to prevent the dam at GLSM from failing and causing a catastrophic flooding event \u2014 and not to create or exacerbate it.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">{\u00b6 67} Therefore, relators must establish that the flooding that occurred on relators\u2019 property was the direct, natural, or probable result of respondents\u2019 actions. See also <em>Barnes v. United States </em>(Ct.Cl.1976), 538 F.2d 865, 871 (\u201cin cases such as these, plaintiffs need not allege or prove that defendant specifically intended to take property. There need be only a governmental act, the natural and probable consequences of which effect such an enduring invasion of plaintiffs\u2019 property as to satisfy all other elements of a compensable taking\u201d). In essence, relators must prove both that respondents\u2019 actions caused the flooding and that the flooding was a foreseeable result of their actions. <em>Nicholson v. United States </em>(2007), 77 Fed.Cl. 605, 617.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">{\u00b6 68} For the following reasons, relators have met their burden of proof with respect to the causation prong of the taking-by-flooding test.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>{\u00b6 69} First, relators presented substantial, credible, and uncontroverted firsthand testimonial and documentary evidence that following respondents\u2019 construction of the new spillway in 1997 and its subsequent abandonment of lake-level management, their properties flooded more frequently, over a larger area, for longer duration, and with greater damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">'{\u00b6 70} Second, relators\u2019 primary expert, engineer Pressley L. Campbell, testified that the redesigned spillway caused frequent and severe flooding in the Beaver Creek-Wabash River area. This flooding would have been \u201chighly unlikely, if not impossible\u201d without the new spillway and respondents\u2019 subsequent failure to manage the lake level. Notwithstanding respondents\u2019 claims to the contrary, Campbell\u2019s conclusions were not based simply on his <em>Case Leasing </em>work. Other engineers in Campbell\u2019s company visited the properties and took photographs of the area, which Campbell reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">{\u00b6 71} Third, the reliance of respondents and their expert on a 1981 United States Army Corps of Engineers report to discount Campbell\u2019s expert opinion is misplaced. According to engineer James Moir, the current conditions differ substantially from those in existence when that report was completed. There are now no trees along Beaver Creek, and thus the creek has a much greater capacity to convey water than it had previously.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">{\u00b6 72} Fourth, significantly, respondents\u2019 own expert, Stantec, concluded in its hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that for the 15-year rain event that respondents claim to be the applicable frequency for a takings analysis, ten of relators\u2019 parcels suffered increased maximum depth and duration of flooding, and 46 of their parcels experienced increased duration of flooding since the redesign of the spillway and the abandonment of lake-level management. That is, even Stantec concedes that flooding of at least some of relators\u2019 property was caused by the new spillway and the lack of lake-level management.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">{\u00b6 73} Fifth, Stantec also concluded that the peak flow from the new spillway in even ten-year rain events now exceeds the peak flow from historical 100-year rain events with the old spillway. For a 96-hour ten-year rain event with the new spillway, Stantec determined that the peak spillway flow was 650 cubic feet per second (\u201ccfs\u201d), which exceeds the 345 cfs peak spillway flow for a 96-hour 100-year rain event with the old spillway. According to the stipulations that ODNR agreed to in <em>Case Leasing, </em>Beaver Creek has a capacity of approximately 480 to 500 cfs, meaning that if the water discharged into the creek exceeds this capacity, Beaver Creek will overtop its banks. Therefore, based on respondents\u2019 own expert\u2019s analysis, since the 1997 construction of the new spillway and their cessation of lake-level management for GLSM, flooding in excess of prior 100-year rain events is occurring on at least a ten-year frequency, with the banks of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>the Beaver Creek overtopping enough to create the inevitably recurring flooding downstream that all the relators testified to experiencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">{\u00b6 74} Finally, the flooding caused by respondents\u2019 new spillway and lake-level-management practices was foreseeable. ODNR was warned repeatedly by landowners, the Mercer County Engineer, and public officials about the likelihood of greater flooding. As the county engineer concluded, ODNR made a conscious choice to disregard that foreseeable risk in favor of recreational users of the lake and landowners on the southern end of the lake.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">{\u00b6 75} ODNR and its director argue that relators have not met their burden of proof because they have not provided the requisite expert evidence on the issue of causation. Respondents maintain that relators\u2019 experts \u201cmade no effort to scientifically evaluate the impacts of the new spillway on individual Relator properties.\u201d Thus, relators have presented only lay evidence, which is insufficient to establish that the flooding was caused by governmental action.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">{\u00b6 76} Even assuming that respondents have correctly characterized the relators\u2019 expert evidence as deficient on causation, we reject respondents\u2019 argument that relators have failed to sustain their burden on that issue. It is true that \u201c[t]he determination of causation in flooding cases is particularly difficult,\u201d <em>Mildenberger v. United States </em>(2010), 91 Fed.Cl. 217, 260, and that in certain circumstances, lay testimony is insufficient, and expert testimony is required. See generally <em>Alost v. United States </em>(2006), 73 Fed.Cl. 480, 495, and 496, fn. 14; see also <em>Cox v. Tennessee Valley Auth. </em>(C.A.6, 1993), 989 F.2d 499, 1993 WL 72488, *4 (unpublished disposition). Nevertheless, expert evidence is not always required to prove causation. <em>Moore v. Associated Material &amp; Supply Co., Inc. </em>(1997), 263 Kan. 226, 242, 948 P.2d 652 (causation of flooding can be proved by lay testimony).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-7\">{\u00b6 77} In fact, even in cases holding that lay testimony is insufficient to establish causation in a takings case involving flooding, the holdings appear to be limited to the specific circumstances therein. For example, in <em>Alost, </em>the United States Court of Federal Claims emphasized that \u201cthe only evidence the plaintiffs presented with regard to the cause of the overflow flooding on their land was lay testimony,\u201d that half of the plaintiffs had owned their land for only one or two years before the government river-regulation project, and that the federal government provided <em>uncontroverted expert </em>testimony that the project did not cause the flooding of the plaintiffs\u2019 property. Id. at 495-496. This case is manifestly distinguishable from <em>Alost </em>because (1) relators introduced lay testimony and documentary evidence that was not merely conclusory, (2) some of the relators have been lifelong residents and farmers of the relevant property, (3) relators also submitted expert evidence, and (4) respondents\u2019 own evidence supports a finding that flooding of at least some of relators\u2019 property was caused <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>by respondents\u2019 actions. See also <em>Tarrant Reg. Water Dist. v. Gragg </em>(Tex.App. 2001), 43 S.W.3d 609, 618 (\u201cCredible lay testimony is relevant to causation\u201d in flooding cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">{\u00b6 78} As the court of appeals held in <em>Post, </em>2006-Ohio-6339, 2006 WL 3477024, at \u00b6 66, relators\u2019 own testimony, \u201calthough not expert testimony, supports the hypothetical analysis that flooding will increase because of the new spillway. [The landowners] were not required to prove that every increased flooding event they had experienced was solely caused by the change in the spillway design.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">{\u00b6 79} Therefore, relators have satisfied the first part of the two-part test for establishing a taking of their property by flooding caused by respondents. They proved by the requisite clear and convincing evidence that flooding that occurred on their property was the direct, natural, or probable result of respondents\u2019 actions. <em>Ridge Line, </em>346 F.3d at 1355.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">{\u00b6 80} For the second part of the test, referred to as the appropriation prong, the nature and magnitude of the government action are considered. Id. at 1356; <em>Cary, </em>552 F.3d at 1380. This part requires an analysis of whether respondents\u2019 interference with relators\u2019 property rights \u201cwas substantial and frequent enough to rise to the level of a taking.\u201d <em>Ridge Line </em>at 1357. \u201cGenerally speaking, property may be taken by the invasion of water where subjected to intermittent, but inevitably recurring, inundation due to authorized Government action.\u201d <em>Lenoir v.

A landowner is \u201cnot entitled to recover for a Fifth Amendment taking where the intermittent flooding of his land was not increased in elevation, frequency, and duration as a result of the government\u2019s project.\u201d <em>Bistline v.

As discussed previously, they testified concerning the frequency of the flooding, which many have experienced on a yearly basis, including in 2011. Moreover, Stantec\u2019s own expert report established that respondents\u2019 actions regarding the spillway and lake-level management are now causing 100-year flooding events every ten years. And according to the evidence submitted by some of the relators, flooding can now occur after even a minimal rain event.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">{\u00b6 83} Based on the foregoing, relators have established that respondents, by their actions, effected a taking of at least some of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">\n<em>Prescriptive Easement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b750-6\">{\u00b6 84} Respondents argue that even should this court find a taking, the taking is not compensable, because ODNR had acquired a prescriptive easement to flood relators\u2019 property. Respondents waived this affirmative defense by failing to raise it before the parties proceeded to submit evidence and argument in this ease. See generally <em>State ex rel. Plain Dealer Publishing Co. v. Cleveland </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 31, 33, 661 N.E.2d 187 (\u201cAn affirmative defense is waived under Civ.R. 12(H), unless it is presented by motion before pleading pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B), affirmatively in a responsive pleading under Civ.R. 8(C), or by amendment under Civ.R. 15\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 85} Based on the foregoing, this case is not barred by the four-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.09(E), and relators have established that respondents\u2019 construction of the spillway and concomitant refusal to lower the lake level at GLSM caused flooding with the requisite frequency to constitute a taking. As we recently noted, \u201c[t]his court has a history of protecting property rights, and our decision today continues that long-standing precedent.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Merrill v. Ohio Dept. of Natural </em>Resources, 130 Ohio St.3d 30, 2011-Ohio-4612, 955 N.E.2d 935, \u00b6 60. Respondents were free to determine that the old spillway needed to be replaced for the dam at GLSM to survive a probable maximum flood. And they were also authorized to determine that redesigning the spillway and abandoning lake-level management were the preferable ways to remedy the probable-maximum-flood problem and to appeal to both recreational users of the lake and homeowners on the southern shore of the lake. Once they made that decision, however, they were liable for the damage to downstream landowners caused by the intermittent, but inevitably recurring, flooding that resulted from the new western spillway.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b686} Therefore, we grant a writ of mandamus to compel respondents to commence appropriation proceedings to determine the amount of their taking of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>the property. <em>Shemo, </em>95 Ohio St.3d at 69, 765 N.E.2d 345 (writ of mandamus granted to compel respondents to commence appropriation proceedings to determine the amount of the city\u2019s temporary taking of relators\u2019 property). The determination of the extent of the taking will be made by the court presiding over the appropriation proceeding.
