R.C. 2967.191 provides: \u201cThe department of rehabilitation and correction shall reduce the stated prison term of a prisoner * * * by the total number of days that the prisoner was confined for any reason arising out of the offense for which the prisoner was convicted and sentenced * * The fact that the Highland County court ordered that Rankin\u2019s 13-year sentence be served concurrently with his prior sentences does not affect our determination that Rankin is not entitled to a reduction of his 13-year sentence. See generally <em>State v. Parsley, </em>Franklin App. No. 01AP-612, 2010-Ohio-1689, 2010 WL 1510197, \u00b6 48-50. Our holding in <em>State v. Fugate, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 261, 2008-Ohio-856, 883 N.E.2d 440, does not require a different result, because in that case, the defendant was held on each of the charges before his sentencing, and he was thus entitled to a reduction of each concurrent prison term. Id. at \u00b6 17-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">{\u00b6 3} Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b687-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Cupp, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
