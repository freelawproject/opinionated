The bureau brought suit against both the recipient of workers\u2019 compensation benefits and the third-party tortfeasor under R.C. 4123.931(G) to recover the full amount of its subrogation interest. The third-party tortfeasor raised a statute-of-limitations defense. The trial court held that a two-year limitations period applied and that it had expired. The court of appeals reversed and held that a six-year limitations period applied and that it had not yet run out.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">{\u00b6 2} R.C. 4123.931(G) provides that if a settlement or compromise between a workers\u2019 compensation \u201cclaimant\u201d (as defined in R.C. 4123.93(A)) and a \u201cthird party\u201d (as defined in R.C. 4123.93(C)) excludes any amount paid by a \u201cstatutory subrogee\u201d (as defined in R.C. 4123.93(B)), \u201cthe third party and the claimant shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the statutory subrogee the full amount of the subrogation interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">{\u00b6 3} The issue presented is whether a claim under R.C. 4123.931(G) brought by a statutory subrogee to recover its subrogation interest is subject to a two-year statute of limitations (the same limitations period applicable to the injured worker\u2019s personal-injury suit against the third party) or to a six-year statute of limitations for an action on \u201ca liability created by statute,\u201d R.C. 2305.07. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the claim in this case is an action upon a liability created by statute and that the statute of limitations is six years. We accordingly affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\">I. Facts and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b443-9\">{\u00b6 4} Because the trial court dismissed the complaint in this case for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, we construe the material allegations in the complaint as true for purposes of this appeal. Jeffrey McKinley was severely injured on July 13, 2003, while in the course of his employment at a work site in East Liverpool, Ohio. The bureau allowed McKinley\u2019s claim for workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-10\">{\u00b6 5} McKinley filed an action against his employer and a third party, defendant-appellant, Heritage-WTI, Inc., the owner of the premises where the accident occurred. McKinley\u2019s suit against his employer was later dismissed. After McKinley provided notice to the bureau and to the Ohio attorney general in 2004 that he was in settlement negotiations with Heritage, he and Heritage settled for an undisclosed amount.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>{\u00b6 6} On November 4, 2008, the bureau filed suit in Columbiana County-Common Pleas Court against McKinley and Heritage, asserting that they were jointly and severally liable under R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 for failing to honor the bureau\u2019s subrogation lien in the settlement that had been reached. The bureau asserted that on the date of the complaint\u2019s filing, it had paid more than $460,000 in medical bills and compensation on McKinley\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim and that additional future payments were expected to be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 7} Heritage shortly thereafter moved the trial court under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim, arguing that the bureau\u2019s subrogation claim was derivative of McKinley\u2019s right to recover against Heritage and that the two-year statute of limitations applicable to McKinley\u2019s personal-injury claim against Heritage also applied to the bureau\u2019s claim. Heritage additionally asserted that the bureau sought a \u201ctypical,\u201d or traditional, subrogation recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 8} In its response to the motion to dismiss, the bureau argued that R.C. 4123.931 creates an independent right of recovery for a statutory subrogee, in that the bureau\u2019s subrogation claim arose from that statute, and that the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.07 for an action on \u201ca liability created by statute\u201d is the one that applies to claims brought pursuant to R.C. 4123.931(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 9} The trial court granted Heritage\u2019s motion to dismiss. It reasoned that the bureau\u2019s claim was derivative of McKinley\u2019s claim against Heritage and that the same two-year statute of limitations that applied to McKinley\u2019s claim against Heritage also applied to the bureau\u2019s claim, thus rendering the bureau\u2019s claim untimely. The trial court also dismissed as untimely the bureau\u2019s claim against McKinley.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 10} Upon the bureau\u2019s appeal, the Seventh District Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order of dismissal and remanded for farther proceedings. <em>Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp. v. McKinley, </em>7th. Dist. No. 09CO3, 2010-Ohio-1006, 2010 WL 893801, \u00b6 63. The appellate court rejected Heritage\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>arguments that R.C. 4123.931 is a typical derivative subrogation statute, and instead held that R.C. 4123.931 \u201ccreates an independent right of recovery for the statutory subrogee\u201d so that R.C. 2305.07\u2019s six-year statute of limitations applies. Id. at \u00b6 55. Accordingly, the appellate court held that the bureau\u2019s complaint was timely because it was filed within six years of McKinley\u2019s injury. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">{\u00b6 11} We accepted Heritage\u2019s appeal under our discretionary jurisdiction for review of a single proposition of law presented: \u201cOhio Revised Code Section 4123.931 is a typical subrogation statute and does not provide the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation an independent right of recovery and therefore, claims brought under R.C. 4123.931 are subject to the same statute of limitations that governs the claimant\u2019s underlying cause of action.\u201d See 126 Ohio St.3d 1512, 2010-Ohio-3331, 930 N.E.2d 331.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 12} In order for a trial court to dismiss a complaint under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, it must appear beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of the claim that would entitle the plaintiff to the relief sought. <em>O\u2019Brien v. Univ. Community Tenants Union, Inc. </em>(1975), 42 Ohio St.2d 242, 245, 71 O.O.2d 223, 327 N.E.2d 753; <em>LeRoy v. Allen, Yurasek &amp; Merklin, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 323, 2007-Ohio-3608, 872 N.E.2d 254, \u00b6 14. The allegations of the complaint must be taken as true, and those allegations and any reasonable inferences drawn from them must be construed in the nonmoving party\u2019s favor. Id. Appellate review of a trial court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint pursuant to Civ.R. 12(B)(6) is de novo. <em>Perrysburg Twp. v. Rossford, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 79, 2004-Ohio-4362, 814 N.E.2d 44, \u00b6 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 13} A complaint may be dismissed under Civ.R. 12(B)(6) for failing to comply with the applicable statute of limitations when the complaint on its face conclusively indicates that the action is time-barred. <em>Doe v. Archdiocese of Cincinnati, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 491, 2006-Ohio-2625, 849 N.E.2d 268, \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">{\u00b6 14} As we observed in <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377, \u00b6 48, R.C. 4123.931 sets forth the statutory subrogee\u2019s right of subrogation and details how that right is implemented, while R.C. 4123.93 is a definitional section that explains the meaning of terms appearing in R.C. 4123.931. Neither of those statutes specifically supplies a limitations period applicable to a subrogation claim brought by a statutory subrogee pursuant to R.C. 4123.931. In <em>Groch, </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, we upheld the facial constitutionality of the workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statutes, but no statute-of-limitations issue was presented in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-10\">{\u00b6 15} The key issue of law in this case, as framed by Heritage\u2019s arguments based on case law interpreting subrogation statutes in contexts different from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>that we explore here, is whether R.C. 4123.931(G) creates an independent right of recovery for a statutory subrogee. If it does, then the recovery by the statutory subrogee is not a \u201ctypical\u201d derivative subrogation recovery, and the six-year statute of limitations for an action \u201cupon a liability created by statute\u201d of R.C. 2305.07 applies to a workers\u2019 compensation subrogation claim. See <em>McAuliffe v. W. States Import Co., Inc. </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 534, 538, 651 N.E.2d 957 (R.C. 2305.07\u2019s six-year limitations period applies when no statute of limitations is legislatively specified and an action would not exist \u201cbut for\u201d the statute creating it). If a six-year statute of limitations applies, the trial court erred in dismissing the bureau\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 16} Alternatively, if R.C. 4123.931(G) is a typical subrogation statute that allows a subrogation recovery that is derivative of a claimant\u2019s ability to recover from a third party, then the same two-year personal-injury statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.10 that applies to a claimant\u2019s personal-injury action also applies to a statutory subrogee\u2019s claim under R.C. 4123.931(G). See <em>Chemtrol Adhesives Inc. v. Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 40, 42, 537 N.E.2d 624 (in insurance subrogation, a subrogee cannot have greater rights than those possessed by its insured). If a two-year statute of limitations applies, the trial court did not err in dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">{\u00b6 17} An important point of dispute is R.C. 4123.931(A), which provides, \u201cThe payment of compensation or benefits pursuant to this chapter * * * creates a right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party. The net amount recovered is subject to a statutory subrogee\u2019s right of recovery.\u201d (\u201cNet amount recovered\u201d is defined in R.C. 4123.93(E).)</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 18} In defending the trial court\u2019s determination that R.C. 4123.931 involves a derivative recovery, Heritage primarily relies on two Ohio appellate court decisions in which courts reviewed subrogation statutes other than the one implicated here and determined that those statutes did not create a right of recovery in favor of the state. Heritage asserts that the analysis of those decisions is directly on point and requires that the same conclusion must be reached for R.C. 4123.931, the statute involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">{\u00b6 19} In <em>Ohio Dept. of Human Servs. v. Kozar </em>(1995), 99 Ohio App.3d 713, 717, 651 N.E.2d 1039, the Eighth Appellate District held that former R.C. 5101.58, a statute governing the Ohio Department of Human Services\u2019 subrogated recovery against a third party for Medicaid benefits paid, used the term \u201csubrogation\u201d in its conventional sense and did not give an independent right of recovery. The court accordingly held that the state\u2019s right of subrogation derived from the rights of the injured party and was not greater than those rights. Because the injured party had not recovered from the alleged tortfeasor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>and could not recover because the statute of limitations had expired, the court determined that the state could not recover either. Id. at 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Montgomery v. John Doe 26 </em>(2000), 141 Ohio App.3d 242, 250, 750 N.E.2d 1149, the Tenth Appellate District held that a former version of R.C. 2743.72(A), which provided for the state\u2019s subrogation recovery against third parties for reparation payments made from the Crime Victims Fund pursuant to R.C. 2743.56, used the term \u201csubrogation\u201d in its conventional sense and did not create a right of recovery for the state. The court held that the same statute of limitations applicable to the claimants\u2019 ability to seek recovery from the third parties also applied to the state\u2019s subrogation recovery. Id. at 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 21} However, a consideration of R.C. 4123.931 reveals that the subrogation right involved in this case is fundamentally different from the subrogation rights in the statutes at issue in the foregoing cases. In particular, R.C. 4123.931(A) specifically states that the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits in and of itself <em>\u201ccreates a right of recovery </em>in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Other sections of R.C. 4123.931 similarly delineate the special nature of the subrogation recovery involved here. That the statutes considered in <em>Kozar </em>and <em>Montgomery v. John Doe 26 </em>did not involve subrogation in the workers\u2019 compensation context renders those decisions distinguishable. The statutory provisions involved in the case before us are manifestly not typical subrogation statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 22} The third phrase of the text of R.C. 4123.931(A), \u201cthe statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party,\u201d makes explicit that the scope of the automatic and independent right of recovery in favor of the statutory subrogee fully encompasses all \u201crights of a claimant against that third party.\u201d It is an affirmative grant of a right and not a limitation. As a whole, then, R.C. 4123.931(A) creates a right of recovery atypical of traditional subrogation statutes. See Ohio Legislative Service Commission Final Bill Analysis of 2002 Sub.S.B. No. 227, 149 Ohio Laws, Part II, 3716 (the bill that enacted current R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931), explaining that the act \u201cstates more specifically than the previous statute that payment of compensation or benefits creates <em>a right of recovery, </em>as opposed to the prior law\u2019s \u2018right of subrogation,\u2019 of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, the trial court erred in relying too heavily on the third phrase of the statutory text and in failing to accord sufficient meaning to the preceding text whereby the fact of payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201ccreates a right of recovery in favor of\u2019 the statutory subrogee against a liable third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>{\u00b6 23} We conclude that R.C. 4123.931(A) must be interpreted to provide that the right of the statutory subrogee to recover its subrogation interest is an independent right, but that the right is subrogated in the sense that the statutory subrogee can recover from the claimant and/or the third party only if the third party is liable to the claimant in tort. In this regard, we agree with the court of appeals\u2019 interpretation of this provision. See 2010-0hio-1006, 2010 WL 893801, at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 24} The Second Appellate District, in <em>Corn v. Whitmere, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 204, 2009-Ohio-2737, 916 N.E.2d 838, \u00b6 30, accurately observed that subrogation in the workers\u2019 compensation context cannot be analogized to subrogation arising from contract or equitable principles and concluded that workers\u2019 compensation subrogation is not the same as typical subrogation, which often arises in the insurance context.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 25} Subrogation generally is \u201c[t]he substitution of one party for another whose debt the party pays, entitling the paying party to rights, remedies, or securities that would otherwise belong to the debtor.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 1563-1564. Insurance is the context in which subrogation most commonly arises. In that context, subrogation is \u201c[t]he principle under which an insurer that has paid a loss under an insurance policy is entitled to all the rights and remedies belonging to the insured against a third party with respect to any loss covered by the policy.\u201d Id. at 1564. In the insurance context, \u201c[a] subrogated insurer stands in the shoes <em>of </em>the insured-subrugor and has no greater rights than those of its insured-subrogor. * * * Further, where the insured\u2019s claim against a tortfeasor is based on negligence, the insurer\u2019s subrogated claim is also necessarily based on negligence, rather than on the insurance contract. * * * Consequently, where an insured\u2019s tort claim is subject to a statute of limitations, so too is the insurer\u2019s subrogation claim.\u201d <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Zimmerman, </em>5th Dist. No. 2004 CA 00007, 2004-Ohio-7115, 2004 WL 3038032, \u00b6 16; see <em>Corn, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 204, 2009-Ohio-2737, 916 N.E.2d 838, at \u00b6 35 (\u201cin the insurance context, subrogation is derivative in nature, and no new cause of action is created\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 26} However, workers\u2019 compensation subrogation under R.C. 4123.931 is different. In this singular context, a claimant\u2019s ability to receive workers\u2019 compensation benefits is not based on any concept of fault, and a claimant\u2019s recovery of those benefits is governed by the provisions of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. See, e.g., <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 119, 748 N.E.2d 1111 (workers\u2019 compensation laws are a unique social bargain in which employees give up their common-law remedy in exchange for greater assurance that they will receive reasonable compensation for a work-related injury, and employers in turn give up common-law defenses but are protected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>from unlimited liability); <em>Blankenship v. Cincinnati Milacron Chems., Inc. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St.2d 608, 614, 23 O.O.3d 504, 433 N.E.2d 572. While in typical insurance subrogation an insurer\u2019s subrogated claim is based on the negligence of the tortfeasor and is derivative of the insured\u2019s rights, a statutory subrogee\u2019s R.C. 4123.931 subrogation interest arises from the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">{\u00b6 27} The subrogation statutes are designed to permit the statutory subrogee, who paid the workers\u2019 compensation benefits to the claimant in the first instance, to be at least partially reimbursed out of any recovery that the claimant may obtain from the third party responsible for causing the injury. See <em>Com </em>at \u00b6 41. \u201cFar from a modification of a common-law cause of action, [the statutory subrogee\u2019s] right to reimbursement * * * is nonexistent but for the statute.\u201d Id. Because workers\u2019 compensation subrogation cannot be analogized to typical insurance subrogation, the court in <em>Com </em>recognized that R.C. 4123.931 \u201cprovides for an independent subrogation claim that is in fact a new cause of action.\u201d Id. at \u00b6 35. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b628} Other aspects of the statutory subrogation recovery considered here support the conclusion that R.C. 4123.931 is not a typical subrogation statute. The special term \u201cstatutory subrogee\u201d used throughout R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 reinforces that the claim for subrogation arises from the statutes providing for the recovery. The consistent usage of the word \u201cstatutory\u201d to modify \u201csubrogee\u201d indicates that the statutory subrogee is not a subrogee in the common usage of that word.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 29} Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th Ed.2009) 1564 defines a subrogee as \u201c[o]ne who is substituted for another in having a right, duty, or claim; esp., the person or entity that assumes the right to attempt to collect on another\u2019s claim against a third party by paying the other\u2019s claim-related debts or expenses.\u201d But a concurrent right of recovery against a claimant, as the bureau has here under R.C. 4123.931(G), which makes the claimant and the third party \u201cjointly and severally liable to pay the statutory subrogee\u201d for the full subrogation amount, is inconsistent with the usual process by which a typical subrogee seeks recovery against a third-party tortfeasor by pursuing a derivative claim. See also R.C. 4123.931(H), stating that \u201cthe right of subrogation * * * is automatic,\u201d which is also not a feature of a typical attempted subrogation recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 30} In light of the above considerations, a statutory subrogee that pursues recovery of its subrogation interest under R.C. 4123.931(G) clearly does much more than merely substitute for and \u201cstand in the shoes of\u2019 a claimant. These subrogation statutes set forth an overall scenario in which the claimant, the third party, and the statutory subrogee are three independent actors playing discrete <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>and delineated roles. The statutory subrogee pursues an independent recovery in its own right under R.C. 4123.931(G) as a separate and distinct actor.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 31} In <em>Santos v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>101 Ohio St.3d 74, 2004-Ohio-28, 801 N.E.2d 441, \u00b6 5, the bureau acknowledged that when this court in <em>Holeton, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 135, 748 N.E.2d 1111, held the former subrogation statute unconstitutional, the bureau \u201ccould no longer assert subrogation rights.\u201d Consistent with that concession, this court in <em>Santos </em>stated that after the decision in <em>Holeton, </em>\u201cany collection or retention <em>of </em>moneys collected under the statute by the [bureau] was wrongful.\u201d Id. at II17. This court therefore recognized that in the absence of a constitutional workers\u2019 compensation subrogation statute, a statutory subrogee has no basis to pursue any portion of a claimant\u2019s personal-injury award from a third party as reimbursement for workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid to the claimant. See also <em>Modzelewski v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>151 Ohio App.3d 666, 2003-Ohio-827, 785 N.E.2d 501, \u00b6 27 (self-insured statutory subrogee had no subrogation right under predecessor statute to the statute held unconstitutional in <em>Holeton, </em>in that the predecessor statute was also unconstitutional), judgment of unconstitutionality affirmed by <em>Modzelewski v. Yellow Freight Sys., Inc., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 192, 2004-Ohio-2365, 808 N.E.2d 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 32} Workers\u2019 compensation subrogation recovery would not exist \u201cbut for\u201d R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931. See <em>McAuliffe, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 538, 651 N.E.2d 957. Because R.C. 4123.931 creates an independent right of recovery that would not otherwise exist, we conclude that a statutory subrogee\u2019s claim under R.C. 4123.931(G) to recover its subrogation interest is governed by the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2307.05 for a liability created by statute. See <em>Com, </em>183 Ohio App.3d 204, 2009-Ohio-2737, 916 N.E.2d 838, at \u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 33} Heritage lists a number of reasons why the bureau should not be able to recover its subrogation interest in this case, including reasons based on the bureau\u2019s notice of the settlement and on public policy. The bureau counters with its view of why recovery should be available here and justifies the manner in which it has pursued that recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 34} As to Heritage\u2019s arguments based on the bureau\u2019s notice of the settlement, we observe that R.C. 4123.931(G) explicitly makes the third party and the claimant jointly and severally liable to pay the subrogation interest if a claimant does not give notice of the claimant\u2019s actual or potential right of recovery <em>\u201cor </em>if a settlement or compromise excludes any amount paid by the statutory subrogee.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Moreover, the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the complaint in the early stages of this case was based solely on its conclusion that a two-year statute of limitations applied and that it had expired. Therefore, the only issue presented to this court is which statute of limitations applies. Resolution of that issue is wholly a question of law. Any of the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>arguments based on the specific details of the attempted recovery here or on public policy (which is generally implemented by the legislature and not by the courts) are outside the scope of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">{\u00b6 35} The bureau asserts that no statute of limitations should be applicable to its attempts to collect on its excluded statutory subrogation interest, under <em>Ohio Dept. of Transp. v. Sullivan </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 137, 527 N.E.2d 798, in which this court held at the syllabus that \u201c[t]he state, absent express statutory provision to the contrary, is exempt from the operation of a generally worded statute of limitations.\u201d We decline to consider applying <em>Sullivan </em>for two independent reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">{\u00b6 36} First, the bureau did not raise this argument in the trial court. Rather, it specifically urged the trial court to find the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.07 applicable to its statutory subrogation claim. The bureau therefore did not ask the trial court to distinguish it from a nongovernmental statutory subrogee and to afford it special treatment as an arm of the state. See, e.g., R.C. 4123.93(B) and 4123.93(D), establishing that other parties besides the bureau can be statutory subrogees for purposes of these statutes. To the extent that the bureau now argues that no statute of limitations should apply, it has waived or forfeited that argument in this case by failing to assert it in the trial court. Moreover, because we hold that a six-year statute of limitations applies to a statutory subrogee\u2019s claim to recover its subrogation interest under R.C. 4123.931(G), the bureau\u2019s claim in this case is timely regardless of whether the statute of limitations applies to it or not. Accordingly, there is also no need to address this question in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 37} Finally, the bureau asserts that the limitations period for recovery of its subrogation interest under R.C. 4123.931(G) should not begin to run (i.e., that the statutory subrogee\u2019s claim does not accrue) until the statutory subrogee has actual knowledge that a settlement between a claimant and a third-party tortfeasor has occurred that excluded the subrogation interest. Because the claim in this case would have been timely filed under the six-year statute of limitations even if the claim accrued at some point later than the date of the injury, we need not address this issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 38} For all the foregoing reasons, we hold that a claim brought by a statutory subrogee pursuant to R.C. 4123.931(G) to recover its subrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>interest is a claim \u201cupon a liability created by statute\u201d and is therefore subject to the six-year statute of limitations of R.C. 2305.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">{\u00b6 39} Because the bureau\u2019s complaint in this case was timely filed, the trial court erred in dismissing the complaint. We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b452-6\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Moore, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and McGee Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b452-7\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in judgment.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b452-8\">Carla D.

After McKinley settled with Heritage, he sought a declaratory judgment in Washington County Common Pleas Court that R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931 are unconstitutional, in an effort to prevent the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>bureau from proceeding under those statutes to recover a share of the settlement. In the event that the statutes were upheld as constitutional, McKinley asked the court to declare the amount of the bureau\u2019s recovery under R.C. 4123.931. The trial court held the statutes unconstitutional, but the Fourth District Court of Appeals reversed and upheld the facial constitutionality of R.C. 4123.93 and 4123.931. See <em>McKinley v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>170 Ohio App.3d 161, 2006-Ohio-5271, 866 N.E.2d 527, \u00b6 1-4. McKinley appealed that decision to this court, and we accepted his discretionary appeal and stayed the briefing schedule. 112 Ohio St.3d 1489, 2007-Ohio-724, 862 N.E.2d 116. In <em>McKinley v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 538, 2008-Ohio-1736, 885 N.E.2d 242, this court summarily affirmed the judgment of the court of appeals on authority of <em>Groch v. Gen. Motors Corp., </em>117 Ohio St.3d 192, 2008-Ohio-546, 883 N.E.2d 377. Upon remand to the trial court in the wake of that affirmance, McKinley apparently voluntarily dismissed his complaint under Civ.R. 41(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-9\">. We acknowledge that the bureau did raise an argument based on <em>Sullivan </em>in the court of appeals. The appellate court did not address the argument in its opinion, likely for reasons similar to those supporting our decision not to consider applying <em>Sullivan.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b452-9\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Amv\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-10\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 4123.931 grants the Bureau of Worker\u2019s Compensation (\u201cBWC\u201d) and self-insured employers several ways to recoup workers\u2019 compensation benefits paid out to an injured employee. I write separately to note that not all causes of action arising from R.C. 4123.931 have a six-year statute of limitations. I concur because the BWC theoretically has a cause of action against defendant-appellant, Heritage WTI, Inc. (\u201cHeritage\u201d), under R.C. 4123.931(G), which does have a six-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\">{\u00b6 41} R.C. 4123.931(A) establishes that the payment of workers\u2019 compensation benefits \u201ccreates a right of recovery in favor of a statutory subrogee against a third party, and the statutory subrogee is subrogated to the rights of a claimant against that third party. The net amount recovered is subject to a statutory subrogee\u2019s right of recovery.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\">{\u00b6 42} Thus, pursuant to R.C. 4123.931(A), any payments made by the third party to the claimant are subject to being dispersed to the statutory subrogee. This is a standard subrogation arrangement, and the rights of the statutory subrogee are limited to the rights of the claimant. Since the claimant has no rights against a third party once the statute of limitations has passed, neither does the statutory subrogee. Thus, the statutory subrogee is limited to the two-year statute of limitations for personal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\">{\u00b6 43} A statutory subrogee has another method to recover benefits. Pursuant to R.C. 4123.931(H), the statutory subrogee may itself bring an action against the third-party tortfeasor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-14\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cA statutory subrogee may institute and pursue legal proceedings against a third party either by itself or in conjunction with a claimant. If a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>statutory subrogee institutes legal proceedings against a third party, the statutory subrogee shall provide notice of that fact to the claimant. If the statutory subrogee joins the claimant as a necessary party, or if the claimant elects to participate in the proceedings as a party, the claimant may present the claimant\u2019s case first if the matter proceeds to trial. If a claimant disputes the validity or amount of an asserted subrogation interest, the claimant shall join the statutory subrogee as a necessary party to the action against the third party.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 45} Again in R.C. 4123.931(H), the statutory subrogee\u2019s cause of action is derivative, arising directly from the injury to the claimant. Thus, the rights of the statutory subrogee are limited to those of the claimant, including being subject to a two-year statute of limitations on a personal-injury action.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 46} The BWC\u2019s claim here is brought pursuant to R.C. 4123.931(G), which provides something completely different to the statutory subrogee; it is a cause of action belonging exclusively to the statutory subrogee. R.C. 4123.931(G) makes the statutory subrogee a mandatory player in settlement discussions between the claimant and the third party. It provides that if the statutory subrogee is not given notice of settlement negotiations \u2014 which has not been alleged in this case \u2014 or \u201cif a settlement or compromise excludes any amount paid by the statutory subrogee,\u201d then \u201cthe third party and the claimant shall be jointly and severally liable to pay the statutory subrogee the full amount of the subrogation interest.\u201d Thus, if the amount set forth in the settlement agreement between the claimant and the third party does not address the payments made by the statutory subrogee, the claimant and third party are liable to repay the statutory subrogee in full. This is significant, because in the normal course under R.C. 4123.931(B), the statutory subrogee receives from the settlement proceeds only a certain ratio of what it had paid out.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 47} A claim brought under R.C. 4123.931(G) is not a subrogation claim. It is a unique claim created by statute that punishes claimants and third parties for failing to include statutory subrogees in settlement negotiations. As \u201can action * * * upon a liability created by statute,\u201d an R.C. 4123.931(G) action has a six-year statute of limitations pursuant to R.C. 2305.07.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 48} This appeal concerns only Heritage. Any battles between McKinley and the BWC over the distribution of the settlement amount subject to the BWC\u2019s rights under R.C. 4123.931(B) do not concern Heritage. Any claim that the BWC might have brought under R.C. 4123.931(H) was subject to the two-year statute of limitations. A claim brought under R.C. 4123.931(G) against Heritage does have a six-year statute of limitations. Whether such a claim under R.C. 4123.931(G) has any basis in fact is up to the trial court. The BWC has not alleged that it did not receive notice of settlement negotiations. The BWC\u2019s only hope for recovery from Heritage would be a provision in the settlement agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>ment that specifically excludes payments made by the BWC. The trial court should proceed on the BWC\u2019s case against Heritage on that limited basis.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A6V\">Michael DeWine, Attorney General, Alexandra T.
