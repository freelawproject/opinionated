SAIF withdrew its claims for conversion, and the court entered judgments on jury verdicts for SAIF on its claims for money had and received. Defendants appealed the judgments awarding SAIF damages on its claims for money had and received. SAIF cross-appealed, assigning error to the dismissal of its other claims based on the same transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">In the first of the consolidated cases, <em>SAIF v. Anderson, </em>124 Or App 651, 863 P2d 509 (1993), the Court of Appeals held that the Department of Insurance and Finance (DIF)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> has exclusive jurisdiction in a case in which a health care provider is alleged to have made excessive charges in violation of ORS 656.248(3). Accordingly, the court reversed on defendant\u2019s appeal and affirmed on SAIF\u2019s cross-appeal. In a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the Court of Appeals decided <em>SAIF v. DeShaw, </em>124 Or App 677, 863 P2d 513 (1993), on identical grounds. For the reasons that follow, we reverse the decisions of the Court of Appeals and remand both cases to that court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">Defendants are licensed chiropractors. Some of defendants\u2019 patients are insured by SAIF under the workers\u2019 compensation system. As noted, SAIF filed separate complaints against defendants in circuit court, alleging claims for civil ORICO, common law fraud, conversion, and money had and received. SAIF\u2019s underlying theory in both cases was that defendants had charged SAIF more for services than they charged the general public for the same services, in violation of ORS 656.248(3). Specifically, SAIF asserted that Anderson billed SAIF \u201cminimum office visit\u201d charges without billing those same charges to some of his private-pay patients. SAIF asserted that DeShaw gave some of his patients a discount for paying cash. SAIF predicated its civil ORICO claims on the ground that such conduct constituted \u201ctheft by deception.\u201d ORS 164.085.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Pursuant to ORCP 21, defendants moved to dismiss all SAIF\u2019s claims. They argued that, under ORS 656.248(13),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> DIF had exclusive jurisdiction over medical fee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>disputes between workers\u2019 compensation medical service providers and insurers predicated on ORS 656.248(3). The circuit court denied those motions, but later granted each defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on SAIF\u2019s ORICO and common law fraud claims for insufficient evidence of defendants\u2019 intent to deceive SAIF. SAIF withdrew its conversion claims.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Each jury returned a verdict for SAIF \u2014 $9,000 in Anderson, and $7,415.14 in <em>DeShaw </em>\u2014 on the remaining claims for money had and received. Judgments were entered on the verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Defendants appealed, arguing that, under ORS 656.248(13), DIF has exclusive jurisdiction over medical fee disputes and, therefore, that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over SAIF\u2019s money had and received claims predicated on ORS 656.248(3). SAIF cross-appealed, arguing that the circuit court erred in directing verdicts against SAIF\u2019s civil ORICO <em>and </em>common law fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In <em>Anderson, </em>the Court of Appeals relied on this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Brown v. Transcon Lines, </em>284 Or 597, 588 P2d 1087 (1978), to determine whether an administrative remedy is exclusive:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-6\">\u201cThe threshold determination is the source of the plaintiffs claim. If the claim preexists the statute, then the administrative remedy is exclusive only if, by enacting the statute, the legislature intended to abolish the previously recognized claim. However, if the claim derives from the statute, and the statute does not imply a claim in a court, then the administrative remedy is exclusive, provided that it is not \u2018demonstrably inadequate.\u2019 <em>[Brown,] </em>284 Or at 602.\u201d <em>Anderson, </em>124 Or App at 654.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">Applying that test, the Court of Appeals determined that SAIF\u2019s civil ORICO, common law fraud, and money had and received claims derived solely from ORS 656.248(3) (provider shall not charge an insurer more than the provider charges the general public). The court concluded that that statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>does not imply the availability of a claim in court. <em>Id. </em>at 655. Therefore, the court reasoned, the administrative remedy is exclusive, provided that it is not \u201cdemonstrably inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court determined that that administrative remedy is not \u201cdemonstrably inadequate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 655-56.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As a result, the court concluded, the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over all of SAIF\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals held that the circuit court erred in failing to dismiss SAIF\u2019s claim for money had and received, but correctly dismissed SAIF\u2019s ORICO and common law fraud claims. <em>Id. </em>at 657. The Court of Appeals did not reach the merits of SAIF\u2019s cross-appeal, viz., it did not determine whether there was sufficient evidence to submit SAIF\u2019s ORICO and common law fraud claims to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">On review, SAIF argues that, notwithstanding that ORS 656.248(13) provides an administrative remedy for medical fee disputes, the circuit court has jurisdiction over SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendants argue that DIF has exclusive jurisdiction over medical fee disputes and that the circuit court therefore has no jurisdiction to consider SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-6\">ORICO</p>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">The legislature enacted ORICO in 1981. Or Laws 1981, ch 769. As pertinent here, ORICO provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-8\">\u201cIt is unlawful for any person employed by, or associated with, any enterprise to conduct or participate, directly or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>indirectly, in such enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity [.]\u201d ORS 166.720(3).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\">\u201cPattern of racketeering activity\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-5\">\u201cengaging in at least two incidents of racketeering activity that have the same or similar intents, results, accomplices, victims or methods of commission or otherwise are interrelated by distinguishing characteristics, including a nexus to the same enterprise, and are not isolated incidents, provided at least one of such incidents occurred after November 1, 1981, and that the last of such incidents occurred within five years after a prior incident of racketeering activity.\u201d ORS 166.715(4).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">\u201cRacketeering activity\u201d is defined, in part, as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u201cto commit, to attempt to commit, to conspire to commit, or to solicit, coerce or intimidate another person to commit:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\u201c (a) Any conduct that constitutes a crime, as defined in ORS 161.515, under any of the following provisions of the Oregon Revised Statutes:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">&lt;&lt;* * \u2756 * ^</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\u201c(K) ORS * * * 164.075 to 164.095 * * * relating to theft, burglary, criminal trespass and related offenses[J\u201d ORS 166.715(6).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">As is evident from the statutes set forth above, an ORICO violation necessarily must be predicated on conduct constituting certain defined crimes. A violation of ORICO is a Class A felony. ORS 166.720(5)(a). ORICO also provides for civil remedies. ORS 166.725.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>WORKERS\u2019 COMPENSATION LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">In 1983, the legislature enacted ORS 656.248(3), providing that \u201c[i]n no event shall a provider charge more than the provider charges to the general public.!\u2019 Or Laws 1983, ch 816, \u00a7 6; <em>see </em>OAR 436-10-090(9) (1990) (parallel regulation).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In 1990, the legislature enacted ORS 656.248(13), quoted above at note 5, authorizing the director of DIF to resolve medical fee disputes between worker compensation insurers and medical service providers. Or Laws 1990, ch 2, \u00a7 14; see OAR 436-10-110 (1990) (parallel regulation).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">In support of its ORICO claims, SAIF alleged that defendants committed theft by deception when, with intent to defraud, they created or confirmed SAIF\u2019s false impression that their billings to SAIF were in conformity with ORS 656.248(3). The question is whether, by authorizing the director of DIF to resolve medical fee disputes between insurers and providers pursuant to ORS 656.248(13), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>legislature intended to deprive the circuit courts of subject matter jurisdiction to consider SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"> As a threshold matter, the question argued by the parties arises only if SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims amount to \u201cdisput\u00e9is] between an insurer * * * and a medical service provider regarding the amount of * * * fee[s] for medical services.\u201d ORS 656.248(13). Whether they do is a question of statutory interpretation and, hence, a question of legislative intent. <em>PGE v. Bureau of Labor and Industries, </em>317 Or 606, 610, 859 P2d 1143 (1993). We resolve such questions first by examining the text and context of the relevant statute, using rules of statutory construction that bear directly on how to read that text and context.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">Defendants are \u201cmedical service providers],\u201d within the plain, natural, and ordinary meaning of the terms. SAIF is an \u201cinsurer\u201d by definition. ORS 656.005(14). The context of ORS 656.248(13) indicates that disputes \u201cregarding the amount of a fee for medical services\u201d include disputes over whether a provider has charged more than he or she charges the general public: ORS 656.248(3), prohibiting such charges, is a separate subsection of the same statute that contains ORS 656.248(13).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The question remains, however, whether SAIF\u2019s <em>ORICO </em>claims amount to disputes regarding \u201cthe amount of * * * fee[s] <em>for </em>medical services.\u201d SAIF suggests that they do not, because ORICO claims do not require proof of a violation of ORS 656.248(3) as a necessary element of those claims. Instead, SAIF argues, \u201cthe effect of [ORS 656.248(3)] is only of an evidentiary nature in proving [that] defendant^] intended to engage in a pattern of [ORICO] predicate acts of theft by deception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Assuming that SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims encompass medical fee disputes premised on ORS 656.248(3), they also require proof of defendants\u2019 intent to defraud SAIF, so as to establish that defendants committed the predicate crime of theft by deception. ORS 166.715(6)(a)(K); ORS 164.085-(l)(a). SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims also require proof that defendants engaged in a \u201cpattern of racketeering activity.\u201d ORS 166.720(3). As a result, SAIF\u2019s disputes with defendants are more than medical fee disputes under ORS 656.248(13). For the reasons that follow, we hold that the legislature did not intend the DIF director\u2019s jurisdiction over medical fee disputes to be exclusive in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">ORICO was enacted in 1981. As of that year, SAIF could bring a civil ORICO claim predicated on theft by deception. In 1983, the legislature enacted ORS 656.248(3), prohibiting charges in excess of those charged to the general public. Consequently, as of 1983, an ORICO predicate crime of theft by deception could be based on a violation of ORS 656.248(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">However, in 1990, the legislature enacted ORS 656.248(13), authorizing the DIF director to resolve medical fee disputes \u201cnotwithstanding any other provision of the [Workers\u2019 Compensation Law],\u201d and \u201cin such summary manner as the director may prescribe. \u2019 \u2019 Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that ORICO claims based on violations of ORS 656.248(3) encompass medical fee disputes within the meaning ORS 656.248(13), the question is whether, by enacting ORS 656.248(13), the legislature intended to abolish those ORICO claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\"><em>Brown, </em>on which the Court of Appeals relied, analyzed the question whether a worker had a common law claim for wrongful discharge on the day he was fired, and whether the legislature negated that claim by creating an administrative remedy for the discharge. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">\u201cAs a general rule, if a statute which provides for a new remedy shows no intention to negate, either expressly or by necessary implication, a pre-existing common law remedy, the new remedy will be regarded as merely cumulative, rather than exclusive, with the result that a plaintiff may resort to either the pre-existing remedy or the new remedy. This rule is particularly applicable when the new statutory remedy is not an adequate one. Prior decisions of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>are consistent with this general rule.\u201d 284 Or at 610-11 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">Consistent -with <em>Brown, </em>we conclude that, by enacting ORS 656.248(13), the legislature did not intend to negate SAIF\u2019s preexisting ORICO remedy for theft by deception that involves ORS 656.248(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">We hold, therefore, that by authorizing the director of DIF to resolve medical fee disputes between insurers and providers, ORS 656.248(13), the legislature did not intend to deprive the circuit courts of subject matter jurisdiction to consider SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims. The Court of Appeals\u2019 decisions to the contrary are in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In its cross-appeals to the Court of Appeals, SAIF raised the issues whether there was sufficient evidence in each case to support its ORICO claims.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> That court did not reach the merits of SAIF\u2019s cross-appeals. SAIF does not ask us to address those issues on review. Instead, SAIF asks us to remand those issues to the Court of Appeals, in the event that we reverse that court\u2019s decision. We do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">The decisions of the Court of Appeals on SAIF\u2019s ORICO claims are reversed. The cases are remanded to the Court of Appeals for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b176-6\"> SAIF also named North Salem Chiropractic Clinic, Anderson\u2019s assumed business name, as a defendant in its action against Anderson, and Steven A.
