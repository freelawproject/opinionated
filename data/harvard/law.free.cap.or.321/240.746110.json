Petitioners are electors who timely submitted written comments addressed to the Attorney 'General\u2019s draft ballot title. Therefore, they are entitled to petition this court seeking a different title. ORS 250.085(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">The Attorney General certified this ballot title to the Secretary of State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">ENDS MOST GOVERNMENT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT, CONTRACTING, PUBLIC SERVICES</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">QUESTION: Shall statute ban most state and local government affirmative action in employment, contracting, public services, used to cure past discrimination?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">SUMMARY: Adopts statute. Bans state, local government affirmative action in employment, contracting, public services, used to cure past discrimination. Does not affect action needed to qualify for federal funds.' Governments must base employment decisions only on education, ability, experience, standardized testing techniques with scoring equity. Governments must base contracting decisions solely on open competitive bidding. Governments may base financial aid for education solely on applicant\u2019s financial need, ability. Creates board to decide questions of discrimination or preference in employment, education, contracts instead of courts. Repeals statutes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">Petitioners assert that the Caption, Question, and Summary in the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title are deficient in various particulars. We have considered those arguments, but conclude that the ballot title certified by the Attorney General complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1), ORS 250.085(5), and therefore certify that ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-12\">Ballot title certified. This decision shall become effective in accordance with ORAP 11.30(9).</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b279-13\">GRABER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Acz\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-14\">In these consolidated cases, two sets of petitioners challenge the ballot title for a proposed initiative measure. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>one respect, I disagree with the majority\u2019s decision to certify the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">Petitioners Posey and Carson contend, in part, that the Attorney General\u2019s Caption, Question, and Summary fail to comply substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1), because they fail to mention a key provision that is not derivative of the measure\u2019s ban on affirmative action: the creation of an arbitration board to hear \u201cquestions of discrimination or preference * * * in lieu of\u2019 courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">The provision creating and empowering a \u201cCivil Rights Arbitration board\u201d is one of the two new substantive sections that would be enacted by the proposed initiative measure. It is worded independently of Section 1 of the measure and is not necessarily coextensive with the matters covered in Section 1. For example, Section 1 uses the terms \u201caffirmative action, reverse discrimination, quotas or set-a-sides,\u201d while Section 2 uses the terms \u201cdiscrimination or preference.\u201d Additionally, Section 1 covers employment, contracting, provision of public services, and financial aid for education, while Section 2 covers \u201cEmployment, Education, and Contracts.\u201d Those differences, along with the length and nature of Section 2, suggest that Section 2 is a subject and a chief purpose of the proposed measure, which is apart from the subject and chief purpose to ban most forms of governmental affirmative action, and which therefore should be included in the Caption and Question.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">Notwithstanding its importance, Section 2 of the proposed measure is not mentioned to voters at all in the Caption or Question and is not explained fully in the Summary. I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that the Attorney General\u2019s ballot title complies substantially with the requirements of ORS 250.035(1) despite that omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">In order to inform voters of this missing half of the equation, I would revise the ballot title as follows. (I also would make editorial changes to make room for the additional material within the applicable word limits and, at the same time, to make the ballot title easier to read.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b280-8\">BANS MOST KINDS OF GOVERNMENT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION; CREATES NEW BOARD</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>QUESTION: Shall statute ban most kinds of government affirmative action; create new administrative board to decide discrimination questions instead of courts?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-4\">SUMMARY: Adopts statute; repeals and amends statutes. Bans state, local governments from using affirmative action to remedy past discrimination in employment, education, contracting, or public services, except as required to qualify for federal funds. Governments must:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-5\">\u2014 base employment decisions solely on education, ability, experience, standardized testing with scoring equity;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-6\">\u2014 base contracting decisions solely on open competitive bidding;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-7\">\u2014 base financial aid for education solely on applicant\u2019s ability, financial need.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b281-8\">Creates new administrative board to decide questions of discrimination, preference in employment, education, and contracts, instead of courts.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">For the foregoing reasons, I would modify the ballot title and certify it as modified. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<judges id=\"b281-10\">Unis and Durham, JJ., join in this dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
