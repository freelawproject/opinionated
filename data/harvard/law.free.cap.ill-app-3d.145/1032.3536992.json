O\u2019Donnell\u2019s libel action filed in 10 counts against defendants Field Enterprises, Inc., James Hoge, Ralph Otwell, Gregory E. Favre, Lois Wille, Jim Casey, Maurice Possley, Tom Page Seibel, Michelle Stevens, Pat Wingert, Jonathan Landman, Hanke Gratteau, Chicago Tribune Company, Stanton R. Cook, James D. Squires, Charles T. Brumback, William H. Jones, Lynn Emmerman, Thomas Powers, CBS Inc. and Walter Jacobson. The individually named defendants are or were officers, editors or reporters for the respective corporate defendants. We affirm.</p> <p id=\"b1056-4\" pgmap=\"1056\">During 1981, the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Organized Crime Division of the Chicago Police Department (OCD) conducted a joint investigation of unlawful drug activities in the city of Chicago. The joint investigation was given the code name Operation Top Brass.</p> <p id=\"b1056-5\" pgmap=\"1056\">As a result of Operation Top Brass, on October 13, 1981, the Federal government indicted plaintiff, a medical doctor, in six counts for unlawfully distributing a controlled substance, phendimetrazine. Another medical doctor was indicted in seven counts for unlawfully distributing phendimetrazine. A pharmacist was indicted in five counts for unlawful possession with intent to distribute Talwin tablets. Another pharmacist was charged in a 26-count criminal information with unlawful possession with intent to distribute Talwin tablets and glutethimide, a water insoluble powder used as a hypnotic and sedative. Talwin, when mixed with the blue colored amphetamine pyribenzamine, is known as \u201cT\u2019s and Blues,\u201d a heroin substitute. On the same day, also as a result of Operation Top Brass, a Cook County grand jury returned indictments against 75 persons for unlawfully dealing in drugs. Many of the persons indicted were members of a Chicago street gang known as the El Rukns.</p> <p id=\"b1056-6\" pgmap=\"1056(119) 1057(12)\">The United States Department of Justice, through the United States Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois, Dan K. Webb, made an official public announcement of the Federal indictments on October 13, 1981. At about the same time, the Chicago Police Department OCD made several arrests stemming from Operation Top Brass. Later in the day, an OCD police sergeant brought some of the people who were arrested to the narcotics section at police headquarters. The suspects were taken to a processing room where many news media reporters were gathered. There, the sergeant provided information concerning the arrests and Operation Top Brass to the news media reporters. Included in the information was the fact that plaintiff had been indicted as part of the joint Federal and local investigation.</p> <p id=\"b1057-3\" pgmap=\"1057\">Based upon the information that the news media reporters obtained from both the Federal and local governmental and public proceedings, on October 14 through October 16, 1981, the Chicago Tribune and the Chicago Sun-Times newspapers printed news headlines and articles regarding Operation Top Brass. The articles included the fact that plaintiff was indicted as part of the special drug investigation. On October 13 and October 14, Walter Jacobson, a newscaster for CBS affiliate WBBM-TV, also reported about the events of the Operation Top Brass investigation and the resulting indictments and arrests. The relevant newspaper articles are included as exhibits to plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint, and they are reproduced here as an appendix. However, the complaint does not allege or quote any specific statements that were made by Jacobson during his televised newscasts. In March 1982, plaintiff was tried on the six-count indictment in the Federal district court, and he was found not guilty on all counts. Thereafter, plaintiff filed this libel action.</p> <p id=\"b1057-4\" pgmap=\"1057\">We agree with plaintiff that his complaint sufficiently alleges that the statements about him in the newspaper articles are factually false and defamatory. However, we believe that what is at issue here is not whether the news media reports are factually false, but whether defendants are protected from a libel action by a privilege based upon the news media\u2019s first amendment right to report governmental and public proceedings that deal with matters of public concern. See Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn (1975), 420 U.S. 469, 495, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 349-50, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 1046.</p> <p id=\"b1057-5\" pgmap=\"1057\"> Plainly, the news media\u2019s constitutional right to report governmental and public proceedings is rendered ineffectual unless the right is expansive enough to enable the news media to report news from the proceedings untrammeled by the specter of a libel action. Thus, there is a special privilege that protects the news media from libel actions when it publishes information obtained from governmental and public proceedings that deal with matters of public concern. Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611 (1977);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn (1975), 420 U.S. 469, 495-96, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 349-50, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 1046-47.</p> <p id=\"b1057-6\" pgmap=\"1057(13) 1058(203)\">While the privilege is not absolute, it is broader in scope than the qualified or conditional privileges that are a part of the law of libel.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the privilege exists even though the publisher does not believe that the defamatory statements from the proceedings are true and even though the publisher knows that they are false. (Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611, comment a; see W. Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts sec. 115 (5th ed. 1984).) If reports in governmental and public proceedings dealing with matters of public concern are false, the news media must nevertheless be able to report to the people what it sees and hears \u2014 the news media\u2019s belief or knowledge as to the truth notwithstanding. If the news media cannot report what it sees and hears at governmental and public proceedings merely because it believes or knows that the information is false, then self-censorship by the news media would result. (Compare Cox Broadcasting Corp. v. Cohn (1975), 420 U.S. 469, 496, 43 L. Ed. 2d 328, 350, 95 S. Ct. 1029, 1046-47.) The first amendment cannot tolerate a tenet which engenders self-censorship by the news media. Rosenbloom v. Metromedia, Inc. (1971), 403 U.S. 29, 50, 29 L. Ed. 2d 296, 315, 91 S. Ct. 1811, 1823.</p> <p id=\"b1058-3\" pgmap=\"1058\"> If a news media account is not a complete report of the proceedings, it nevertheless remains under the aegis of the privilege so long as it is a fair abridgment of the proceedings. However, when a news media account is neither complete nor a fair abridgment of the proceedings, then the privilege is lost. (See Catalano v. Pechous (1980), 83 Ill. 2d 146, 168, 419 N.E.2d 350, 360, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611 (1977).) Here, it is admitted that the news media accounts are not complete reports of the governmental and public proceedings. Therefore, the critical issue is whether the news media accounts are a fair abridgment of the proceedings and thus protected by the privilege. On defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss, we must determine whether there is a genuine and material question of fact on the issue. Compare Meyer v. Murray (1979), 70 Ill. App. 3d 106, 114, 387 N.E.2d 878, 884.</p> <p id=\"b1058-4\" pgmap=\"1058(21) 1059(80)\"> Plaintiff argues that the newspaper articles are not a fair abridgment of the proceedings because they falsely connect him to the illicit drug activities of the El Rukn street gang, falsely link him with the unlawful distribution of Talwin, and falsely charge that he was one of the initial sources of such drugs in the distribution chain. Specifically, plaintiff states: \u201cAny and all references to Dr. O\u2019Donnell and his alleged connection with the El Rukn street gang are wholly false. That lack of connection between Dr. O\u2019Donnell and the El Rukn street gang formed the basis for plaintiff\u2019s defamation complaint.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b1059-3\" pgmap=\"1059\">To determine whether the newspaper articles are a fair abridgment of the proceedings, the Federal and local governmental and public proceedings must be viewed together. The U.S. Department of Justice Information Release of October 13, 1981, which included the announcement of plaintiff\u2019s indictment, the indictments of another doctor and a pharmacist, and the criminal information of another pharmacist, states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1059-4\" pgmap=\"1059\">\u201cMr. Webb stated that these Federal Charges are the result of a lengthy coordinated investigation by federal and local law enforcement authorities aimed at the illegal distribution of Talwin (a heroin substitute) and other abused controlled substances. Mr. Webb indicated that these types of controlled prescription drugs are sold by \u2018pill pushers\u2019 in Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods, and his office is going to vigorously prosecute the medical providers, such as pharmacies and doctors, who are the initial sources of such drugs in the distribution chain.</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b1059-5\" pgmap=\"1059\">These indictments resulted from an investigation conducted by the Chicago Office of the Drug Enforcement Administration and the Illinois Department of Law Enforcement.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b1059-6\" pgmap=\"1059\">The affidavit of the Chicago Police Department OCD sergeant states that on October 13, 1981, he gave the news media the following information:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1059-7\" pgmap=\"1059\">\u201cThe information which I gave to the reporters included the facts that these indictments and arrests were the result of a joint DEA-Chicago Police Department investigation; that many of those indicted for pill-pushing at the street level as a result of the joint investigation were members of the El Rukn street gang; that others indicted for diverting drugs from legitimate uses were doctors, and that others were pharmacists; and the names of several of those indicted as a result of the investigation. Among the names of the indictees which I read to the reporters was that of Dr. James G. O\u2019Donnell.\u201d</blockquote> <p id=\"b1059-8\" pgmap=\"1059(35) 1060(221)\">When the reports of the Federal and local government and public proceedings are read together, the only reasonable conclusion that can be reached is that the gist or sting of the defamation that is conveyed is the same as the gist or sting of the defamation that is conveyed from the newspaper articles. The gist or sting of the defamation in both instances is that plaintiff is a medical doctor who was indicted by the Federal government and that the Federal charges against plaintiff were a result of a lengthy, coordinated investigation by the Federal government and the Chicago Police Department OCD aimed at the illicit distribution of Talwin (a heroin substitute) and other controlled substances. In addition, the gist or sting of the defamation in both instances includes statements that these types of controlled prescription drugs are sold by pill pushers in Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods; that many of those indicted for pill-pushing at the street level were members of the El Rukn street gang; that others indicted as part of the same law enforcement investigation for diverting drugs from legal use included plaintiff; and that the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office \u201cis going to vigorously prosecute\u201d the pharmacists and doctors, which included plaintiff, \u201cwho are the initial sources of such drugs in the distribution chain.\u201d It follows that as a matter of law, the newspaper articles are a fair abridgment of the governmental and public proceedings from which they were made. Whether or not the statements in the newspaper articles are factually false is not relevant.</p> <p id=\"b1060-3\" pgmap=\"1060\"> Plaintiff further argues that the newspaper articles state that he was indicted for distributing pyribenzamine, rather than phendimetrazine. However, the newspaper articles do not make that mistake. The newspaper articles state that the pharmacists \u2014 not the doctors\u2014 were indicted for distributing pyribenzamine. As an example, one newspaper article states: \u201cFederal grand jury indictments also have been returned against two doctors in connection with distribution of a \u2018speed\u2019 derivative, and four pharmacists accused of dealing in \u2018T\u2019s\u2019 and \u2018blues,\u2019 Talwin and pyribenzamine, which in combination act like heroin.\u201d Moreover, unlike phendimetrazine,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> pyribenzamine is not a controlled substance. 21 U.S.C. sec. 801 et seq. (1982); Ill. Rev. Stat. 1985, ch. SGVa, par. 1201 et seq.</p> <p id=\"b1060-4\" pgmap=\"1060(65) 1061(187)\">In addition, we believe that the privilege that exists here is not defeated merely because there may be a misstatement or some discrepancies between the statements in the newspaper articles and the statements from the governmental and public proceedings upon which they are based. No matter how carefully a reporter or publisher attempts to summarize a speech or proceeding, the summary is bound to convey a somewhat different impression than the speech or proceeding itself. It is for this reason that first amendment freedoms of speech and of the press must be given breathing space to survive. (See National Association for the Advancement of Colored People v. Button (1963), 371 U.S. 415, 433, 9 L. Ed. 2d 405, 418, 83 S. Ct. 328, 338.) Thus, when it comes to these special freedoms, some public misstatements must be tolerated by each of us in order that the freedoms be maintained for all of us. (See Time, Inc. v. Pape (1971), 401 U.S. 279, 292, 28 L. Ed. 2d 45, 54, 91 S. Ct. 633, 640.) Within this context, we believe that in order to constitute an unfair abridgment of a governmental or public proceeding so as to defeat the privilege that is involved here, the abridgment must significantly change the defamation appearing in the governmental or public proceeding. With regard to this case, we conclude that any purported misstatement appearing in the newspaper articles does not significantly change the defamation occurring in the governmental and public proceedings.</p> <p id=\"b1061-3\" pgmap=\"1061\"> Plaintiff\u2019s next argument centers on the editorial printed in the Chicago Sun-Times. Plaintiff argues that the editorial \u201cserved to underscore and highlight the falsities published in the news story.\u201d Specifically, plaintiff states: \u201cHeadlined \u2018A cheer for T\u2019s and blues crackdown,\u2019 the editorial focused on the alleged indictment charging plaintiff and other professionals with supplying drugs to the El Rukn gang. The editorial suggested that plaintiff was \u2018high on the list\u2019 of those arrested. Further, the editorial stated, \u2018We hope the law reserves the utmost scorn \u2014 and strongest penalties \u2014 for professionals ultimately convicted of helping the El Rukns maintain their drug stranglehold on so many Chicago neighborhoods.\u2019 The editorial concluded by hailing the action taken against \u2018the worst of the T\u2019s and blues exploiters in Chicago.\u2019 \u201d</p> <p id=\"b1061-4\" pgmap=\"1061(161) 1062(70)\">We believe that whether the editorial is read independently or in conjunction with the newspaper articles, it cannot form the basis of a libel action because the editorial merely contains the ideas and opinions of the editor. There is no such thing as a false idea or opinion. Thus, expressions of ideas and opinions, even in the most pejorative terms, are protected by the first amendment. No matter how defamatory ideas or opinions may seem, in our system of government we depend for their correction not on the conscience of judges or juries in libel actions, but on the competition of other ideas and opinions. (See National Association of Letter Carriers v. Austin (1974), 418 U.S. 264, 284, 41 L. Ed. 2d 745, 761-62, 94 S. Ct. 2770, 2781; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), 418 U.S. 323, 339-40, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789, 805, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 3007.) The free flow of ideas and opinions imperative to our system of government demands strict adherence to this principle. Therefore, a defamatory expression of an idea or opinion is not actionable. However, if an expressed opinion or idea is, in effect, partly factual, in that it implies undisclosed defamatory facts as its basis, then it may be actionable. See Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 566 (1977); W. Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts sec. 113 (5th ed. 1984).</p> <p id=\"b1062-3\" pgmap=\"1062\"> Here, it is clear that the ideas and opinions in the editorial do not imply undisclosed defamatory facts as their bases. To the extent that the editorial makes disclosed factual statements, the statements are privileged for the same reason that the statements in the newspaper articles are privileged; they are a fair abridgment of governmental and public proceedings that deal with matters of public concern.</p> <p id=\"b1062-4\" pgmap=\"1062\">Plaintiff relies mainly upon Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson (7th Cir. 1983), 713 F.2d 262, to support his argument that the newspaper articles and the editorial are not privileged and are not a fair abridgment of the governmental and public proceedings. However, we are neither bound (City of Chicago v. Groffman (1977), 68 Ill. 2d 112, 118-19, 368 N.E.2d 891, 894; Sorenson v. Fio Rito (1980), 90 Ill. App. 3d 368, 373-74, 413 N.E.2d 47, 52) nor persuaded by the opinion in Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. We decline to follow the Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. opinion.</p> <p id=\"b1062-5\" pgmap=\"1062\"> Plaintiff\u2019s next argument relates to discovery and the law applicable to motions to dismiss. Defendants filed motions to dismiss pur-, suant to section 2 \u2014 619 of the Code of Civil Procedure (Ill. Rev. Stat. 1981, ch. 110, par. 2 \u2014 619). Defendants alleged in their motions that the newspaper articles are substantially true accounts of plaintiff\u2019s indictment and therefore nonactionable, that the newspaper articles are substantially true accounts of governmental and public proceedings and therefore privileged, and that the newspaper articles are not libelous and therefore nonactionable. In support of their motions, defendants filed: (1) a copy of the U.S. Department of Justice Information Release of October 13, 1981; (2) the affidavit of the police sergeant from the Chicago Police Department OCD stating the information that he gave to the news media on October 13, 1981; and (3) a copy of the Federal grand jury charges showing the six-count indictment against plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b1062-6\" pgmap=\"1062(65) 1063(95)\">Plaintiff sought discovery before responding to the motions to dismiss, but in the trial court, he \u201cagreed that additional discovery beyond that which defendants voluntarily submitted was not necessary to respond to *** whether the publications and/or broadcasts were substantially true and whether the inaccuracies in the news reports were not libelous in any event.\u201d In view of plaintiff\u2019s satisfaction that no further discovery was needed to decide these broad issues, plaintiff\u2019s contention that he needed additional discovery to respond to the narrow issue of whether the newspaper articles are privileged is unavailing. A decision as to whether the newspaper articles are privileged involves no more than the application of the law to the same discoverable facts that would be necessary to decide \u201cwhether the publications and/or broadcasts were substantially true and whether the inaccuracies in the news reports were not libelous in any event.\u201d Plaintiff\u2019s position is therefore without merit.</p> <p id=\"b1063-3\" pgmap=\"1063\"> Plaintiff next states that \u201caffidavits under section 2 \u2014 619 cannot be used to establish factual defenses, only affirmative defenses, as a matter of law,\u201d and that \u201cunder a section 2 \u2014 619 motion to dismiss all well pled facts within the complaint must be taken as true.\u201d From these principles, plaintiff postulates \u201cthat the defendants were not entitled to prevail on their privilege arguments on a motion to dismiss.\u201d We disagree.</p> <p id=\"b1063-4\" pgmap=\"1063\">Section 2 \u2014 619 provides that a defendant may, within the time for pleading, file a motion for dismissal of the action upon any of nine stated grounds, and if the grounds do not appear on the face of the pleading attacked, the motion shall be supported by affidavit. The last of the stated grounds under section 2 \u2014 619 is that \u201cthe claim asserted against defendant is barred by other affirmative matter avoiding the legal effect of or defeating the claim.\u201d In applying this stated ground to defamation cases, it has been consistently held that the issue of a privilege is an affirmative defense, and it may be raised by and determined upon a motion to dismiss under this section. See Kilbane v. Sabonjian (1976), 38 Ill. App. 3d 172, 175, 347 N.E.2d 757, 760-61. Compare Edwards v. University of Chicago Hospitals &amp; Clinics (1985), 137 Ill. App. 3d 485, 489, 484 N.E.2d 1100, 1104, and Newell v. Field Enterprises, Inc. (1980), 91 Ill. App. 3d 735, 749, 415 N.E.2d 434, 446.</p> <p id=\"b1063-5\" pgmap=\"1063\">It follows that defendants\u2019 documents and affidavit in support of their motions to dismiss are being used not to establish a factual defense, but rather, to establish the existence of an affirmative defense as a matter of law. It also follows that establishment of the affirmative defense of privilege defeats the alleged cause of action even though the well-pleaded facts in the complaint are admitted for the purpose of defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss. We therefore conclude that plaintiff\u2019s contention that defendants were not entitled to prevail on their privilege arguments on a motion to dismiss is untenable.</p> <p id=\"b1063-6\" pgmap=\"1063(32) 1064(327)\"> With respect to defendants CBS and Jacobson, the complaint does not quote or state specific statements that were made by Jacobson in his televised newscasts. Rather, the complaint merely states the conclusion \u201c[t]hat the report contained false, malicious and defamatory libels of and concerning the plaintiff.\u201d While notice pleading prevails under the Federal rules (Conley v. Gibson (1957), 355 U.S. 41, 45-47, 2 L. Ed. 2d 80, 84-85, 78 S. Ct. 99, 101-03; Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(a)(2)), a civil complaint in Illinois is required to plead the ultimate facts which give rise to the cause of action. We are concerned here only with the specificity of the allegations. The allegations are sufficiently specific if they factually set forth the elements necessary to state a cause of action. (People ex rel. Scott v. College Hills Corp. (1982), 91 Ill. 2d 138, 145, 435 N.E.2d 463, 467.) It is obvious that the elements of a cause of action for libel are not factually set forth unless the defamatory words of the defendant are included. Thus, it has long been the rule that in an action for libel, the words alleged to be defamatory must be set forth clearly and with particularity. (Wilson v. Hunk (1977), 51 Ill. App. 3d 1030, 1035, 367 N.E.2d 478, 482; American Pet Motels, Inc. v. Chicago Veterinary Medical Association (1982), 106 Ill. App. 3d 626, 632, 435 N.E.2d 1297, 1302; American International Hospital v. Chicago Tribune Co. (1985), 136 Ill. App. 3d 1019, 1020, 483 N.E.2d 965, 968.) In Brown v. Glickstein (1952), 347 Ill. App. 486, 491, 107 N.E.2d 267, 269, the court held that an allegation that defendants \u201cdid make divers false, malicious and scandalous statements of and concerning the plaintiff\u201d is \u201ca mere conclusion and does not set forth slanderous or libelous words with required particularity.\u201d We therefore believe that in order to sufficiently allege a libel action, the particular words that are defamatory must either be pleaded in the complaint or appear in an exhibit that is part of the complaint. Thus, with respect to defendants CBS and Jacobson, we conclude that the complaint is fatally defective.</p> <p id=\"b1064-3\" pgmap=\"1064\"> Plaintiff states: \u201cIf any such defect exists, obviously it can be cured by amendment if the case is remanded. Given the trial court\u2019s ruling, it would have been futile to make such an amendment previously.\u201d We disagree. The record clearly demonstrates that defendants furnished plaintiff\u2019s attorneys a tape of Jacobson\u2019s televised newscasts long before the motions to dismiss were heard or ruled upon. It is the responsibility of the plaintiff to ensure that the complaint sufficiently states a cause of action, and if it does not, to file an amendment at the earliest opportunity. A plaintiff cannot cavalierly assume that he will be given leave to file an amendment to properly state a cause of action for the first time at his own whim. Since plaintiff did not know what the trial court\u2019s ruling on the motions to dismiss would be before the ruling was announced, it would not have been futile \u201cto make such an amendment previously.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b1065-2\" pgmap=\"1065\">Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of plaintiff\u2019s libel action against all defendants.</p> <p id=\"b1065-3\" pgmap=\"1065\">Affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b1065-4\" pgmap=\"1065\">WHITE, J., concurs.</p> <footnote label=\"1\"> <p id=\"b1057-7\" pgmap=\"1057\">The Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611 (1977) provides: \u201cThe publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or of a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgment of the occurrence reported.\u201d</p> </footnote> <footnote label=\"2\"> <p id=\"b1058-5\" pgmap=\"1058\">For convenience, the term libel is being used in this opinion as including slander. In Illinois, all distinctions between libel and slander, except as to whether the defamation was written or spoken, have been abolished and the rules applicable to slander are now applicable to libel as well. (Mitchell v. Peoria Journal-Star, Inc. (1966), 76 Ill. App. 2d 154, 158-59, 221 N.E.2d 516, 518-19.) For a discussion as to the common law difference between libel and slander, see Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), 418 U.S. 328, 369-77, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789, 822-26, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 3022-25 (White, J., dissenting). See also Ill. Rev.

Defendants raised the defense of substantial truth, and the privilege that protects fair and accurate summaries of government proceedings. I have concluded that the trial court properly relied on defendants\u2019 showing that the statements were substantially true, and properly decided not to reach the issue of privilege. I disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis which disregards the defense of substantial truth and instead addresses the privilege defense. I also disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis of the scope of the privilege defense.</p> <p id=\"b1065-7\" pgmap=\"1065\">It has long been recognized that truth is a defense to a defamation action and that literal truth need not be established. (Altman v. Amoco Oil Co. (1980), 85 Ill. App. 3d 104, 406 N.E.2d 142; Kilbane v. Sabonjian (1976), 38 Ill. App. 3d 172, 347 N.E.2d 757; Mitchell v. Peoria Journal-Star, Inc. (1966), 76 Ill. App. 2d 154, 221 N.E.2d 516.) A showing of the truth of the \u201cgist or sting\u201d of the defamatory imputation is sufficient. (Kilbane v. Sabonjian (1976), 38 Ill. App. 3d 172, 347 N.E.2d 757; Mitchell v. Peoria Journal-Star, Inc. (1966), 76 Ill. App. 2d 154, 221 N.E.2d 516.) In the present case, the gist or sting of the defamatory imputation contained in the news reports is that plaintiff was indicted for distributing illegal drugs after being one of many targets under investigation in a major government operation.</p> <p id=\"b1065-8\" pgmap=\"1065(116) 1066(127)\">Plaintiff contends that the news reports are false in that they link him to the gang members who were indicted for unlawful delivery of Talwin, while plaintiff\u2019s indictment contains no such link. The news reports, however, are not based solely on the strict language of plaintiff\u2019s indictment. They report information disseminated from the office of the United States Attorney through an information release, and from Sergeant Terrence J. McCue of the Chicago police department. The information release states that plaintiff was charged with distributing a controlled substance, phendimetrazine, outside of the course of his professional practice. The information release goes on to place plaintiff\u2019s indictment into the context of the entire operation: \u201c[T]hese Federal charges are the result of a lengthy coordinated investigation by federal and local law enforcement authorities aimed at the illegal distribution of Talwin (a heroin substitute) and other abuse controlled substances. [The United States Attorney] indicated that these types of controlled prescription drugs are sold by \u2018pill pushers\u2019 in Chicago\u2019s neighborhoods, and his office is going to vigorously prosecute the medical providers, such as pharmacists and doctors, who are the initial sources of such drugs in the distribution chain.\u201d Sergeant McCue\u2019s affidavit accompanying defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss also placed plaintiff\u2019s indictment in the context of the massive investigation. It mentioned that many of those indicted were members of the El Rukn street gang and that one of the doctors indicted was plaintiff.</p> <p id=\"b1066-3\" pgmap=\"1066\">The link between plaintiff\u2019s indictment for distributing one drug and the gang members\u2019 indictments for delivering another drug, then, came from the government officials announcing the indictments. The reports accurately characterized plaintiff as one target in an investigation of massive proportions involving the illegal distribution of drugs by doctors, pharmacists and gang members. That is the real gist or sting of the articles. The news reports\u2019 mischaracterization of plaintiff as a supplier of controlled substances to the gang members is nothing more than sloppy reporting on the part of the reporters. It does not amplify the real gist or sting of the statements. The government officials linked the doctors and pharmacists with the street gang in their releases, and the press truthfully arid accurately reported this link. Thus, the trial court properly granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss because the news reports were truthful and truth is a defense to a defamation action.</p> <p id=\"b1066-4\" pgmap=\"1066\">Notwithstanding my conclusion that the majority unnecessarily relied on the privilege defense in affirming the trial court, I find that the majority distorts the law relating to that privilege. The relevant privilege is stated in the Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611 (1977): \u201cThe publication of defamatory matter concerning another in a report of an official action or proceeding or a meeting open to the public that deals with a matter of public concern is privileged if the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement of the occurrence reported.\u201d Illinois recognizes this privilege. Catalano v. Pechous (1980), 83 Ill. 2d 146, 419 N.E.2d 350, cert. denied (1981), 451 U.S. 911, 68 L. Ed. 2d 300, 101 S. Ct. 1981; Lulay v. Peoria Journal-Star, Inc. (1966), 34 Ill. 2d 112, 214 N.E.2d 746.</p> <p id=\"b1066-5\" pgmap=\"1066(34) 1067(67)\">In order to bolster its conclusion that the issue of falsity is irrelevant here, the majority states that \u201cthe privilege exists even though the publisher does not believe that the defamatory statements from the proceedings are true and even though the publisher knows that they are false.\u201d In support of this broad statement, the majority cites two authorities, comment a to sec. 611 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1977), and sec. 115 of Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts (5th ed. 1984). The majority misconstrues the law as stated in these two authorities, and fails to recognize other pertinent law.</p> <p id=\"b1067-3\" pgmap=\"1067\">Comment a to section 611 does state that \u201cthe privilege exists even though the publisher himself does not believe the defamatory words he reports to be true and even when he knows them to be false.\u201d Our supreme court, however, has expressly refused to indicate approval of the \u201cneutral reporting\u201d doctrine, which provides \u201cthat a newspaper, under some circumstances, is protected against liability in reporting a defamatory statement about a public official or public figure even if the newspaper knew that the statement was false.\u201d (Catalano v. Pechous (1980), 83 Ill. 2d 146, 170, 419 N.E.2d 350, 361.) In the face of this language from our supreme court, I do not believe that we should adopt the rule stated in comment a to section 611.</p> <p id=\"b1067-4\" pgmap=\"1067\">Furthermore, the Restatement does not stop at comment a. In comment b, it goes on to explain that the language in comment a has been significantly limited by holdings of the Supreme Court. \u201cThe privilege stated in this Section permits a person to publish a report of an official action or proceeding *** even though the report contains what he knows to be a false and defamatory statement. The constitutional requirement of fault is met in this situation by a showing of fault in failing to do what is reasonably necessary to insure that the report is accurate and complete or a fair abridgement.\u201d (Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611, comment b (1977).) Thus, the Restatement recognizes that the privilege to publish a false and defamatory statement made by a government official is only protected when both the common law privilege\u2019s element of fairness and the constitutional privilege\u2019s element of fault are met.</p> <p id=\"b1067-5\" pgmap=\"1067\">The element of fairness which permeates the common law privilege for summaries of governmental proceedings is also seen in comment f to section 611: \u201cNot only must the report be accurate, but it must be fair.\u201d The report should not be written in such a way that \u201cconveys an erroneous impression.\u201d For example, whether the \u201creport of one side of a trial is not as complete as that of the other side is a factor to be considered in determining whether the report, as a whole, is unfair.\u201d (Restatement (Second) of Torts sec. 611, comment f (1977).) The majority\u2019s statement, permitting the publication of false defamatory statements without any qualification, ignores this fundamental element of fairness.</p> <p id=\"b1068-2\" pgmap=\"1068\">The element of fault and underlying concern for truth extends throughout the law relating to the constitutional privilege for summaries of governmental proceedings. In considering these constitutional mandates in connection with section 611 of the Restatement, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts states:</p> <blockquote id=\"b1068-3\" pgmap=\"1068\">\u201cIn the Second Restatement of Torts [sec. 611], the position has been taken that malice in the sense of an improper motive or purpose in publishing a fair and accurate report of public proceedings containing a defamatory statement about the plaintiff will not constitute an abuse of the privilege or constitute the kind of fault that will justify the imposition of liability on the defendant, even when the publisher believed the defamatory statement made about the plaintiff to be false. But there is substantial judicial authority to the contrary, and the result does not appear to be constitutionally mandated.\u201d W. Keeton, Prosser &amp; Keeton on Torts sec. 115, at 838 (5th ed. 1984).</blockquote> <p id=\"b1068-4\" pgmap=\"1068(318) 1069(36)\">The Supreme Court has indicated its concern with publishers\u2019 knowledge of falsehood on numerous occasions. In Time, Inc. v. Pape (1971), 401 U.S. 279, 28 L. Ed. 2d 45, 91 S. Ct. 633, the court states that \u201ca constitutional zone of protection [exists] for errors of fact caused by negligence. The publisher who maintains a standard of care such as to avoid knowing falsehood or reckless disregard of the truth is thereby given assurance that those errors that nonetheless occur will not lay him open to an indeterminable financial liability.\u201d (401 U.S. 279, 291, 28 L. Ed. 2d 45, 54, 91 S. Ct. 633, 640.) While the court in Time, Inc. v. Pape recognized the first amendment\u2019s need for \u201cbreathing space,\u201d and the need to tolerate some error, it added a final cautionary note: \u201c \u2018Neither lies nor false communications serve the ends of the First Amendment, and no one suggests their desirability or further proliferation.\u2019 \u201d (Time, Inc. v. Pape (1971), 401 U.S. 279, 292, 28 L. Ed. 2d 45, 55, 91 S. Ct. 633, 640, quoting St. Amant v. Thompson (1968), 390 U.S. 727, 732, 20 L. Ed. 2d 262, 267, 88 S. Ct. 1323, 1326.) The court in St. Amant also stated that: \u201cThere must be sufficient evidence to permit the conclusion that the defendant in fact entertained serious doubts as to the truth of his publication. Publishing with such doubts shows reckless disregard for truth or falsity and demonstrates actual malice.\u201d (St. Amant v. Thompson (1968), 390 U.S. 727, 731, 20 L. Ed. 2d 262, 267, 88 S. Ct. 1323, 1325.) This reasoning was emphasized in another case: \u201c[T]here is no constitutional value in false statements of fact. Neither the intentional lie nor the careless error materially advances society\u2019s interest in \u201cuninhibited, robust, and wide-open\u2019 debate on public issues.\u201d Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc. (1974), 418 U.S. 323, 340, 41 L. Ed. 2d 789, 805, 94 S. Ct. 2997, 3007, quoting New York Times Co. v. Sullivan (1964), 376 U.S. 254, 270, 11 L. Ed. 2d 686, 701, 84 S. Ct. 710, 721.</p> <p id=\"b1069-3\" pgmap=\"1069\">I recognize that these Supreme Court cases were not construing language such as the broad statements in comment to section 611 and in the majority opinion in the present case. However, those broad statements permit the publication of a defamatory statement which the publisher knows is false, and I find the Supreme Court\u2019s underlying concern for avoiding an abuse of the applicable privilege of utmost importance and relevance here.</p> <p id=\"b1069-4\" pgmap=\"1069\">Furthermore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s rejection, without discussion or any attempt to distinguish, Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. Jacobson (7th Cir. 1983), 713 F.2d 262. The majority states that it declines to follow that case, which it says plaintiff relies mainly upon \u201cto support his argument that the newspaper articles and the editorial are not privileged and are not a fair abridgement of the governmental and public proceedings.\u201d Plaintiff does not, however, rely on the case as support for its argument against privilege. Plaintiff relies on Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. only as support for his argument that the news reports were not substantially true and were libelous per se. Moreover, the language in that case regarding the publishing of defamatory statements known to be false is dicta, and it is doubtful that plaintiff would rely on it. The court there reviewed the Illinois cases which discuss whether the privilege to republish government reports is forfeited by proof of actual malice, but declined to decide the issue, concluding that the issue would become moot if the jury, on remand, found the news report was not a fair summary. Thus, plaintiff does not rely on this dicta, and the majority unnecessarily rejects it. Additionally, I find nothing objectionable in the applicable language in that case. See Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Co. v. Jacobson (7th Cir. 1983), 713 F.2d 262, 272-73.</p> <p id=\"b1069-5\" pgmap=\"1069\">In sum, I disagree with the breadth of the majority\u2019s statements permitting the publication of defamatory statements known to be false. The issue need not have been addressed. Moreover, such a broad statement endangers the constitutional principles set forth by the Supreme Court, misconstrues the law cited by the majority, and ignores our supreme court\u2019s refusal to adopt such a policy.</p> <p id=\"b1069-6\" pgmap=\"1069\">I adopt the majority\u2019s rationale regarding the discovery and procedural issues. I also conclude that the trial court properly found that the statements were substantially true and correctly granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss plaintiff\u2019s complaint.</p> <p id=\"b1070-4\" pgmap=\"1070\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b1070-5\" pgmap=\"1070\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1071-4\" pgmap=\"1071\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b1071-5\" pgmap=\"1071\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1072-2\" pgmap=\"1072\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b1072-4\" pgmap=\"1072\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1073-2\" pgmap=\"1073\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b1073-3\" pgmap=\"1073\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1074-2\" pgmap=\"1074\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"b1074-3\" pgmap=\"1074\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1075-4\" pgmap=\"1075\">Appendix</p> <p id=\"A2b\" pgmap=\"1075\">[[Image here]]</p> <p id=\"b1075-16\" pgmap=\"1075\">[[Image here]]</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
