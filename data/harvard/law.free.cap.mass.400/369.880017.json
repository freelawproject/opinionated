See G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, (1) (a) (1) (1984 ed.). Prior to trial, he moved to suppress testimony concerning incriminating statements he had made on the day of his arrest. That motion was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Testimony was taken at a pretrial hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress. John J. Hagan stated that at all relevant times he was employed as a police officer in the town of Littleton. He resided, however, in Holliston where, on the morning of March 30, 1985, he went jogging, dressed in a sweat suit and not showing any badge or insignia of office as a policeman. Near Phipps Hill, at 11 A.M., Hagan noticed a line of automobiles stopped at an intersection. When the light turned green, one of these vehicles remained stationary, and others were forced to drive around it. The vehicle was in gear, and the engine was running. Hagan observed the defendant at the wheel, apparently unconscious or asleep. After rapping on a window and getting no response, Hagan opened the door on the driver\u2019s side and immediately detected an odor of alcohol inside. He shook the defendant, who remained unresponsive. Hagan noted a very strong odor of alcohol on the defendant\u2019s breath. He asked a passerby to summon an ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">At this point, the defendant roused himself. Hagan asked if he was all right; the defendant said \u201cyes.\u201d Hagan asked whether he was ill or had any history of fainting or epilepsy. The defendant said \u201cno.\u201d Hagan asked whether he knew who and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>where he was. The defendant gave his name and said \u201che was coming from Framingham and he was going home.\u201d The vehicle then started to move. Hagan reached in and \u201cput the vehicle into the parked position.\u201d The defendant reached for the keys, but Hagan removed them from the ignition.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">Hagan questioned the defendant further. In response to questions, the defendant admitted that he had been drinking on the morning in question, that he had lost consciousness due to drinking and lack of sleep, and that his drinking had \u201caffected his operation to drive.\u201d When a Holliston police officer arrived on the scene, Hagan \u201cconveyed [his] observations\u201d to the officer, including his opinion that the defendant had been driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Hagan never identified himself to the defendant as a police officer, nor did he arrest the defendant or advise him of his rights. He testified that it was his understanding that his jurisdiction as an officer extended only to Littleton and contiguous towns, not including Holliston. He became involved, not as a police officer but as a certified emergency medical technician and as a \u201cconcerned citizen.\u201d On cross-examination, Hagan conceded that he did not return the automobile keys to the defendant, and he admitted that he would not have given Tynes his keys, if asked; but he said that the defendant was at all times free to leave on foot, if he chose.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">The Holliston police officer, Charles Todd, testified that he arrested the defendant and advised him of his rights while driving the defendant in a cruiser to the Holliston police station. The defendant did not testify at the suppression hearing. In light of the uncontested testimony of Hagan and Todd, the judge found that Hagan had acted as a private citizen when querying the defendant; the defendant had not been in custody when Hagan questioned him; and \u201cthe Defendant\u2019s statements were voluntary, intelligently given.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">In this appeal, the defendant argues that (1) suppression of his pretrial statements were compelled by <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436 (1966)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>; (2) the prosecutor\u2019s closing statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>was prejudicial because it implied, incorrectly, that drinking and driving (without more) is a crime in Massachusetts; (3) the judge\u2019s instructions misstated the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof as enunciated in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169 (1985); (4) the judge\u2019s use in his instructions of this court\u2019s statement of the legislative purpose behind G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1984 ed.), was inflammatory; and (5) in the alternative, the standard defined in <em>Connolly </em>should be revised so as to permit conviction under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, only on proof that intoxication caused the defendant to operate his vehicle in an \u201cunsafe\u201d manner. We transferred this case from the Appeals Court on our own motion, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">1. <em>The Miranda question. </em>\u201cIn <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 461 (1966), the Supreme Court formulated a series of prophylactic rules . . . designed \u2018to secure the privilege against self-incrimination\u2019 from overreaching and coercion during custodial interrogation. Custodial interrogation was defined as \u2018questioning initiated by <em>law enforcement officers </em>after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way\u2019 (emphasis supplied). <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra, </em>at 444.\u201d (Citation omitted.) <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 676 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). The judge found that the defendant was not in custody when Hagan asked him questions and, implicitly, that there was no violation of <em>Miranda </em>in this case because its strictures apply only to custodial interrogation by law enforcement officers or their \u201cprivate proxies.\u201d <em>Mahnke, supra </em>at 677. Hagan performed in neither capacity when he interrogated the defendant. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It is undisputed that Hagan wore no badge of office; nor did he give any verbal indication that he was employed anywhere as a police officer. Therefore, we see no reason to suppose that the defendant\u2019s will was affected in any way by that force of \u201ccompulsion [which is] inherent in custodial surroundings,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, supra </em>at 458; as a consequence, the animating concerns of <em>Miranda </em>are simply not implicated here. See <em>Berkemer </em>v. <em>McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984) (where lone police officer detains motorist, asks modest number of questions, and requires performance of field sobriety test[s] at location visible to passersby, motorist is not \u201cin custody\u201d for purposes of Miranda). See also <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736-737 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">More than this, the record shows that Hagan did not suppose himself to possess a police officer\u2019s authority to arrest or otherwise to detain the defendant. Indeed, this court has recently held that \u201c[w]hen a police officer makes a warrantless arrest outside of his jurisdiction, and not in \u2018fresh and continued pursuit\u2019 of the suspect within the meaning of G. L. c. 41, \u00a7 98A, then he acts as a private citizen . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Grise, </em>398 Mass. 247, 250 (1986), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gullick, </em>386 Mass. 278, 282 (1982). \u201cWhen police officers leave their jurisdiction \u2018they cease[] to be officers . . . . \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, from the standpoint of the law, Hagan acted as he portrayed himself \u2014 in the capacity of a private citizen, to whose acts <em>Miranda </em>does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The defendant argues, however, that we should view Hagan as acting in the role of an adjunct or assistant to the Holliston police and not as an ordinary citizen. Without question, \u201cthe police may not accomplish through private proxies what they cannot do directly.\u201d <em>Mahnke, supra. </em>Statements may be suppressed for failure to give Miranda warnings where the interrogator \u201cwas \u2018functioning as an instrument of the police\u2019 <em>(United States </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>466 F.2d 493, 495 [10th Cir. 1972]; cf. <em>Coolidge </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 487 [1971]), or acting as an agent of the police pursuant to a scheme to elicit statements from the defendant by coercion or guile <em>Mahnke, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">This argument is not persuasive. The mere fact that Hagan helped the local police is insufficient to render him an agent or an instrument of the police. This is so, not only because Hagan\u2019s efforts were no different from what would be desired or expected on the part of any private citizen, but also because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>there is no evidence that the Holliston police even knew about Hagan\u2019s opportunity to interrogate the defendant prior to its occurrence. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, supra </em>at 677-678. The motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">2. <em>The prosecutor\u2019s argument. </em>Over the defendant\u2019s objection, the prosecutor was permitted to argue to the jury in his summation that \u201c[i]f you find Mr. Tynes the way he was in the morning could have done all those things [stopping at traffic lights, parking in narrow spaces, braking or steering swiftly to avoid trouble] significantly the same way as if he hadn\u2019t had anything to drink, find him not guilty.\u201d The defendant argues that the prosecutor was permitted in effect to state incorrectly that \u201cdrinking and driving [is] a crime,\u201d because the jury could have inferred from the prosecutor\u2019s statement that they were free to convict if they found \u201cthe defendant was in any way at all affected by the alcohol he had taken.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Our law provides punishment for drivers whose \u201cconsumption of alcohol diminished [their] <em>ability </em>to operate a motor vehicle safely\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Connolly, </em>394 Mass. 169, 173 (1985). The prosecutor\u2019s words did nothing more than focus the jury\u2019s attention on the appropriate question whether the defendant\u2019s ability to perform normal driving tasks was diminished by any intake of alcohol. The prosecutor\u2019s statement did not imply that a conviction may rest on proof simply that the defendant was affected \u201cin <em>any </em>way\u201d by his drinking; rather, the statement implied, correctly, that a conviction may rest only on proof that alcohol affected him in a <em>particular </em>way, i.e., by diminishing his capacity to drive safely. There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">3. <em>Jury instructions. </em>The defendant maintains that the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury on the meaning of driving \u201cunder the influence\u201d in violation of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, were erroneous.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>We have stated previously that it is the Commonwealth\u2019s burden in prosecutions under this statute to prove in relevant part that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol diminished the defendant\u2019s <em>ability </em>to operate a motor vehicle safely\u201d (emphasis in original), i.e., that his consumption of intoxicants left him with \u201ca diminished <em>capacity </em>to operate safely\u201d (emphasis in original). <em>Commonwealth v. Connolly, supra. </em>The charge given here was in accordance with the principles set forth in <em>Connolly.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u201cThe test of the charge is the impression created by it as a whole . . . .\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Benders, </em>361 Mass. 704, 707 (1972). All told, the judge made no fewer than five references to the requirement that intoxication must be found to have diminished the defendant\u2019s capacity to drive safely, and he used these words to sum up: \u201cIf the intoxicating liquor had adversely affected the defendant\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely, he is guilty. If it hasn\u2019t, he is not guilty.\u201d Viewing the charge as a whole, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Concerning the defendant\u2019s claim that the charge was inflammatory, the defendant argues first that he was prejudiced by the judge\u2019s instruction that \u201c[t]he purpose of this statute [G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24] is to protect the public from drivers whose judgment and alertness and ability to respond promptly and alertly to unexpected emergencies have been diminished by the consumption of alcohol.\u201d The general rule is that \u201c[a] judge may inform a jury about the legislative purpose of a statute, if he does so accurately.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Brunelle, </em>361 Mass. 6, 12 (1972). The challenged portion of the charge is virtually a verbatim quotation from the relevant decision of this court. See <em>Connolly, supra. </em>Thus, the accuracy of the judge\u2019s statement of the legislative purpose is not in doubt. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">The defendant also contends that the judge erred by inflaming the passions of the jury when he instructed that \u201c[a] person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he is affected by it to the extent that his . . . ability to respond promptly and effectively to unexpected emergencies is diminished because of the consumption of alcohol.\u201d The defendant views this reference to \u201cunexpected emergencies\u201d as having the improper effect of \u201cfocusing the jury\u2019s thoughts on concern for personal safety rather than on proof of the elements of the offense with which the defendant was charged.\u201d But these words do nothing more than the words used in reference to the Legislature\u2019s intent. Again, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">4. <em>Reconsideration of Connolly. </em>The defendant maintains that <em>Connolly </em>was wrongfully decided. He urges us to hold that, in order to convict a motorist pursuant to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24, the Commonwealth must prove not merely that the defendant\u2019s capacity for safe driving was diminished by consumption of alcohol, see <em>Connolly, supra, </em>but rather that drinking rendered his actual operation of his vehicle unsafe. We have reaffirmed our position in <em>Connolly </em>in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Marley, </em>396 Mass. 433, 436-437 (1985). The defendant offers no persuasive argument which would incline us to change our views. As we pointed out in <em>Marley, supra </em>at 437, <em>\u201cConnolly </em>did not announce any new legal principles but merely clarified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the meaning of \u2018operating under the influence\u2019 under G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lyseth, </em>250 Mass. 555, 558 (1925).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-9\"> In his motion to suppress and his arguments at the hearing pursuant to it, the defendant also contended that his statements to Hagan were inadmis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>sible because, in his \u201cconfused, startled and disoriented condition,\u201d the statements were not voluntary. In his brief, however, the defendant has not renewed this argument for purposes of his appeal. Thus, we deem it waived. See Mass. R. A. P. 16(a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b390-8\"> In pertinent part, the charge given to the jury was as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">\u201cA person- who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor does not have to be drunk or completely unconscious as a result of the intake of such intoxicating liquor.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">\u201cA person is under the influence if at the time of [sz'c] his consump-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>tian of intoxicating liquor has diminished his ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">\u201cThis includes all of the well-known and easily recognized conditions [and] degrees of intoxication. It also includes any condition which results from indulging in any degree in intoxiating liquor and which has negatively affected the defendant\u2019s intellect and control of himself, and thus diminished his capacity to operate safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">\u201cAgain, to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor, it is not necessary to be intoxicated. A person is under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he is affected by it to the extent that his judgment, alertness, and ability to respond promptly and effectively to unexpected emergencies is diminished because of the consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-9\">\u201cAnd this condition may result even if the mental or physical faculties are not impaired. The purpose of this statute is to protect the public from drivers whose judgment and alertness and ability to respond promptly and alertly to unexpected emergencies have been diminished by the consumption of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-10\">\u201cThe Commonwealth must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant\u2019s consumption of alcohol distinguished [sz'c] the defendant\u2019s ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-11\">\u201cThe Commonwealth is not required to prove that the defendant actually drove in an unsafe or erratic manner, but it must prove that the defendant has a diminished capacity to operate safely.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b393-6\"> We are not persuaded that the <em>Connolly </em>standard permits the jury to convict motorists on the sole basis of speculation or surmise as to their operating capacities. Jurors are often asked to determine whether particular individuals had particular capacities in particular circumstances. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>McHoul, </em>352 Mass. 544, 546-547 (1967) (capacity to appreciate wrongfulness of conduct; capacity to conform conduct to legal norms).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The defendant argues, in addition, that the <em>Connolly </em>standard conflicts with that part of G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 24 (1) (e), which creates a conclusive presumption of innocence where a motorist\u2019s blood is shown to have had, at the relevant time, a percentage by weight of alcohol of .05 or less. The relevance of this argument escapes us, for the record does not show that any scientific evidence was ever gathered in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
