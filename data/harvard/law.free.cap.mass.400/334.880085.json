The defendant was sentenced to a term of natural life on the murder conviction, a concurrent life term on the rape conviction, and a concurrent term of <em>9\u00a5\u00bf </em>to 10 years on the kidnapping conviction, all to be served at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole (now Cedar Junction). The defendant filed timely appeals of his convictions. The defendant contends that trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise objections to the trial judge\u2019s charge constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. He challenges the jury instructions as creating a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice in various respects. He claims that the instruction on joint venture diluted the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof and that the instructions with regard to voluntary intoxication not only erroneously required a higher level of intoxication but also shifted the burden of proof to the defendant. He finally claims that the jury verdict is flawed as it is impossible to ascertain whether it was unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">On April 26, 1984, the defendant and John Murray<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> met the victim at \u201cThe Raft,\u201d a lounge in Lowell, and later drove her to the defendant\u2019s apartment. In a statement that the defendant gave to the police,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> he claimed that both men had consensual intercourse with the victim then forced her to have sex with them. They then tied a bandanna around her mouth, forced her into the defendant\u2019s car, drove her to the river, pulled her from the car, bound her hands and feet and threw her into the river. He further stated that they watched her struggle for about five minutes until she disappeared under the surface of the water and they left. In his testimony at trial the defendant repudiated his statement and claimed that he never had intercourse with the victim, that he drove Murray and the victim to the river but fell asleep and did not know what happened to the victim until later when Murray responded to his inquiry about the victim by saying that she was \u201cfloating down the river.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>Because the defendant was convicted of first degree murder, we will review the convictions under the broad standard of G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E, to determine whether there is a \u201csubstantial likelihood that a miscarriage of justice has occurred.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 584 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">1. <em>Jury instructions, </em>a. <em>Voluntary intoxication. </em>The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s charge required the jury to find <em>extreme </em>drunkenness before considering intoxication in relation to premeditation. He further claims that the charge imposed a requirement that the jury find <em>significant </em>impairment before weighing the effect of the voluntary intoxication on the defendant\u2019s mental state with regard to extreme atrocity or cruelty. The Commonwealth contends that the instructions merely directed the jury to consider what effect the intoxication, if any, had on the defendant\u2019s capacity to deliberate or to reason. Since the jury found the defendant guilty of first degree murder by reason of both premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty, we need only consider either ground and, therefore, we analyze the instructions on extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">While voluntary intoxication cannot be used to excuse criminal conduct, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 455 (1984) , the jury may consider the defendant\u2019s voluntary intoxication in determining whether the defendant murdered with extreme atrocity or cruelty. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 648-649 (1982). Furthermore, the jury may consider evidence of the defendant\u2019s intoxication with regard to whether the prosecution has proved specific intent beyond a reasonable doubt, where specific intent is an element of the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, </em>394 Mass. 584, 593-594 (1985).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s charge on intoxication as it relates to extreme atrocity or cruelty was erroneous as it required the jury to find \u201csignificant impairment\u201d before they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>could consider that factor.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, </em>380 Mass. 672, 685 (1980), this court held that a defendant\u2019s mental state is a factor to be considered by the jury in determining whether the defendant\u2019s acts were \u201cso shocking as to amount to extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d \u201cImpairment of a defendant\u2019s ability to make a decision in a normal manner may have a direct bearing on the degree of murder, and consequently, on the issue of extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 686. Consequently, evidence of intoxication triggers the defendant\u2019s entitlement to the jury\u2019s determining \u201cas one of the circumstances or facts in the case whether the defendant was so intoxicated at the time the murder was committed that his criminal culpability should be reduced.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 649 (1982). Mental impairment, whether it be from mental illness or intoxication, is one factor for the jury to consider in relation to extreme atrocity or cruelty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, supra; Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gould, supra. </em>We have, however, previously upheld a charge instructing the jury \u201cthat mental impairment due to intoxication could be relevant to the manner in which murder was committed only if the jury found that [the defendant\u2019s] mental capacity was \u2018substantially\u2019 reduced by consumption of alcohol.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, </em>399 Mass. 863, 880 (1987). There is no material difference between the charge here and the one upheld in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The defendant further claims that the language of the instructions referred to above shifted the burden of proof to the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>fendant. We disagree. \u201c[I]ntoxication is not a defense to murder in the first degree that the Commonwealth must disprove. In this respect, it is quite unlike that narrow category of defenses (such as self-defense) that by their very nature negate essential elements of the crime and for this reason their nonexistence must be proved by the Commonwealth beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>392 Mass. 393, 405 (1984). Moreover, \u201cwe have expressly disavowed any intent to . . . \u2018transform[ ] an evidentiary factor which the jury can consider into an entirely new element of the crime of murder committed with extreme atrocity and cruelty. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sinnott, supra </em>at 879-880, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cun-neen, </em>389 Mass. 216, 228 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">With regard to the charge of extreme atrocity or cruelty, the judge in the present case clearly stated that the impairment was merely a factor to be considered in determining \u201cwhether or not, given the totality of all of the circumstances, those facts indicate extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d He included an extensive charge on the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the presumption of the defendant\u2019s innocence, and the fact that \u201c[t]he defendant has no burden of disproving anything.\u201d Thus, viewing the instructions as a whole, on this aspect of the case, they did not shift the burden of proof to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">b. <em>Joint enterprise. </em>The defendant claims that the judge\u2019s charge regarding joint venture diluted the Commonwealth\u2019s burden of proof, particularly by illustrating joint venture with a case, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Drew, 4 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 30 (1976), where the Appeals Court upheld a conviction because there was evidence, \u201calthough scanty,\u201d that would permit the jury to infer that the defendant was acting as a \u201clookout.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 31-32.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>Commonwealth claims that the instruction was in fact more favorable to the defendant than required.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">Under a theory of \u201cjoint venture,\u201d the prosecution must prove that the defendant \u201cintentionally assisted the principal in the commission of the crime and that he did this, sharing with the principal the mental state required for that crime.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Donovan, </em>395 Mass. 20, 26 (1985), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Richards, </em>363 Mass. 299, 307-308 (1973). This court has held that the \u201cjury may infer the requisite mental state from the defendant\u2019s knowledge of the circumstances and subsequent participation in the offense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, </em>377 Mass. 461, 470, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 881 (1979). In the present case, the judge charged the jury extensively on \u201cjoint venture\u201d (covering seventeen pages of transcript). He instructed that mere acquiescence in the crime was not enough.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In response to the jury question during deliberation, the judge cautioned the jury that mere presence would not suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">Federal courts have rejected the use of instructions in conspiracy cases which state that \u201cslight evidence\u201d is enough to support a finding that an individual was a member of a conspiracy.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number><footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Marsh, </em>747 F.2d 7, 13 n.3 (1st Cir. 1984). <em>United States </em>v. <em>Malatesta, </em>590 F.2d 1379, 1382 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 846 (1979) <em>(Malatesta II). </em>The Federal courts found that the use of the words \u201cslight evidence\u201d might imply that the degree of proof was less than for other crimes, i.e., proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>In view of the charge as a whole in the present case, however, the judge\u2019s reference to \u201cscanty evidence\u201d did not create an impression that the degree of proof was less than \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Thus, there was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">2. <em>Verdict unanimity. </em>The defendant claims that it is impossible to tell whether the verdict was unanimous as to each basis for the first degree murder conviction because there was no instruction with regard to unanimity and the jury merely indicated on the jury slip that both premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty formed the basis of that conviction. Contrary to the defendant\u2019s assertion, the judge did give a general instruction regarding unanimity: \u201cRemember now \u2014 I haven\u2019t mentioned it before. Maybe at the very beginning \u2014 your verdict must be unanimous. All twelve of you must reach the same conclusion.\u201d Since there is no evidence to the contrary, we may assume that the jury followed this duty. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Caine, </em>366 Mass. 366, 375 (1974); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lemar, </em>22 Mass. App. Ct. 170, 172 (1986). Furthermore, the jurors affirmed the verdict after it was delivered by the foreman. Finally, the evidence supported a finding of guilty of first degree murder on both grounds, premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">3. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>The defendant claims that the failure of trial counsel to object to the judge\u2019s charge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>constituted ineffective assistance of counsel in violation of his rights under both the State and Federal Constitutions. We disagree. This court has held that if the State standard is satisfied, the Federal standard is necessarily satisfied as well. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Howell, </em>394 Mass. 654, 657 (1985). In determining whether there has been ineffective assistance of counsel we must analyze \u201cthe specific circumstances of the given case to see whether there has been serious incompetency, inefficiency, or inattention of counsel \u2014 behavior of counsel falling measurably below that which might be expected from an ordinary fallible lawyer \u2014 and, if that is found, then, typically, whether it has likely deprived the defendant of an otherwise available, substantial ground of defence.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Saferian, </em>366 Mass. 89, 96 (1974). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Triplett, </em>398 Mass. 561, 568 (1986); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuller, </em>394 Mass. 251, 256 (1985); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 457-458 (1984). Normally, this court will not reverse a conviction on this basis unless the defendant shows \u201cthat better work might have accomplished something material for the defense.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Satterfield, </em>373 Mass. 109, 115 (1977). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>392 Mass. 493, 499 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">In the present case, we have concluded that the jury were properly instructed on the crime of first degree murder by reason of extreme atrocity or cruelty. In view of the charge as a whole, the evidence of the defendant\u2019s guilt on grounds of both premeditation and extreme atrocity or cruelty, and his own testimony demonstrating his ability to function unimpaired by the amount of alcohol he consumed, the defendant was not deprived of a substantial ground of defense. Further, even if the judge\u2019s instructions were otherwise flawed, a first degree murder conviction was proper on the basis of extreme atrocity or cruelty. Thus, the <em>Saferian </em>standard is not met in the present case and a new trial is not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">4. <em>Relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E. </em>We have reviewed the whole case on the law and the facts and we determine that the result is consonant with justice. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Toney, </em>385 Mass. 575, 588 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Tavares, </em>385 Mass. 140, 157-158, cert. denied, 457 U.S. 1137 (1982). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>evidence supported the jury\u2019s verdict on not only the murder charge but also the rape and kidnapping charges. According to the defendant\u2019s own testimony, he observed Murray attempting to force the victim to have oral sex with him. At the defendant\u2019s suggestion that the victim would start screaming, Murray tied a bandanna around the victim\u2019s mouth and told the defendant not to worry when he questioned Murray. After Murray asked him if he would help him \u201cget rid of the girl,\u201d he drove Murray and the victim (who still had the bandanna tied around her mouth and may have been crying) to the river. When questioned by the defendant, Murray told the defendant that the victim was \u201cfloating down the river.\u201d Before they went to the police station he and Murray made up the story about a man meeting the victim at The Raft and her leaving with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">The statement that the defendant made to the police clearly related that he and Murray both raped the victim, then agreed to kill her because she had seen their faces. They then took her against her will to the river, tied her hands and feet, threw her into the. river and watched until she stopped struggling and went under the water. Two witnesses testified that the defendant had admitted killing the victim. Medical evidence showed intact sperm in the victim\u2019s vagina indicating intercourse within a few hours before her death. The semen was of two different types and matched the types of Murray and the defendant. In the defendant\u2019s apartment the police found strands of the victim\u2019s hair and her watch, as well as clothesline and a bandanna resembling the ones used to gag and bind the victim. The police officer testified that a few days after the murder the defendant took them to the murder scene to show them the route he took to the river on the night of the murder, the spot on the riverside where he and Murray bound the victim, where they threw her into the river, and where they disposed of her underwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">In view of the facts of this case, we decline to grant relief under G. L. c. 278, \u00a7 33E.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\n<em>Judgments affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b351-6\"> John Murray, originally a codefendant in this case, committed suicide prior to trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b351-7\"> The statement was given on May 2, 1984. It was read to the jury and introduced in evidence. The defendant\u2019s motion to suppress the statement had been denied and the defendant did not object further at trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\"> The judge must so instruct the jury, if requested, where evidence tends to show that the defendant was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs at the time of the commission of the crime. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Henson, supra </em>at 593.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b353-6\"> The judge charged: \u201cDid he have a substantially reduced or significantly impaired mental process? Did alcohol or the voluntary ingestion of drugs seriously or significantly impair his mental facilities, if he was in fact under any substantial influence? Was he sober? Was he as the phrase is, \u2018buzzed,\u2019 or under the influence of drug or narcotic to such a degree as that his rational capacity was significantly impaired? Was that impairment substantial? Had he clouded his mental capacities?</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u201cIf he was under such a significant impairment, then you may and will weigh that factor along with all of the other factors that you find concerning the manner by which and method employed and degree of force and the time that it took and degree of force by which [the victim] had her life taken from her. It is for you to say whether or not, given the totality of all of the circumstances, those facts indicate extreme atrocity or cruelty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b354-7\"> The judge charged: \u201cNow I want to draw your attention to two actual cases . . . to . . . illustrate the principle of law that I am now discussing . . . One was the case of Charles Perry, and the other was a case of a woman named Darlene Drew .... With respect to Charles Perry, . . . there were no facts in evidence from which a jury could have concluded that Perry . . . could aid in any way in the commission of the crime. [But] with respect to Darlene Drew, the Court said that the evidence, though <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>scanty, permitted the jury to infer that [she was] a lookout.... The point I make is this, with respect to Perry ... the principle is, mere knowledge that the crime is going to be committed, even if it\u2019s coupled with the subsequent concealment of a completed crime, does not make one guilty .... |T]t\u2019s necessary that the accused in this case, Roland Sylvester, willfully associate himself in some way with this criminal venture and willfully seek by act or omission of his to make that criminal venture succeed.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b355-13\"> The judge stated: \u201cIt is not possible to convict a defendant because of any mere acquiescence in the commission of a crime, without any participation as an actor by counseling, aiding or abetting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">While mere presence may not suffice, this court has stated: \u201c[I]f an individual is, by agreement, in a position to render aid, he is an abettor even if he does not participate in the actual perpetration of the crime, \u2018[f]or the presence of the abettor under such circumstances, must encourage and embolden the perpetrator to do the deed, by giving him hopes of immediate assistance.\u2019\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Soares, supra </em>at 471-472, quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Knapp, </em>9 Pick. 495, 518 (1830).
