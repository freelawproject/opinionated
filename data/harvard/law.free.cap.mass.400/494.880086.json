The plaintiff seeks actual and punitive damages from the defendant claiming fraud, breach of warranty, unfair and deceptive pricing of coins, false grading of coins, and the sale of altered and adulterated coins. The plaintiff, through counsel, sought to depose the defendant Willis. Willis then moved for a protective order, see Mass. R. Civ. P. 26 (c), 365 Mass. 772 (1974), to preclude Hale and Dorr from representing the plaintiff at the deposition because of \u201cthe very real conflict between Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation of a high-level corporate officer and its representation of a plaintiff against another high-level corporate officer and Standard.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The trial judge invited the parties to submit affidavits regarding the allegations of conflict of interest set forth in the motion. Each party filed affidavits. Thereafter, the judge determined that Hale and Dorr had a conflict of interest. He ordered that Hale and Dorr withdraw from its representation of the plaintiff. Pursuant to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 118, first par. (1984 ed.), a single justice of the Appeals Court stayed the disqualification order pending appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On our own motion, we transferred the case. We vacate the order of disqualification.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>We recite the prior related proceedings and summarize the affidavits filed with this court. Prior to the commencement of this action, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) began an investigation involving Standard Financial Management Corporation (Standard) and its principal officers (who were its owners), the defendant and Taglione. The investigation concerned allegations of overgrading, overpricing, and misrepresentation of the grade and investment quality of rare coins sold to the public. During 1986, a financial officer of Standard, John Doe (see note 1, supra), consulted Hale and Dorr concerning the FTC investigation. According to the affidavit of the Hale and Dorr attorney, Doe was informed that he was neither a target nor a subject of the FTC investigation. The Hale and Dorr attorney also communicated with an attorney who represented Willis in the FTC proceeding to ascertain the status of the investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The affidavits of both attorneys agree that they spoke on two occasions. The affidavit of Willis\u2019s attorney indicates that he discussed his professional opinion as to the \u201croles, and the potential exposures\u201d of both Willis and Doe. The affidavit of the Hale and Dorr attorney, however, indicates that the two attorneys did not discuss \u201cany common or mutual approach, method, or strategy to deal with the Federal Trade Commission.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The judge ruled that because Hale and Dorr had a conflict of interest, the firm could not represent the plaintiff. The judge noted that it was clear that all the attorneys involved had acted in good faith to protect the interests of their clients. Nonetheless, the judge determined that because the interests of the plaintiff and the former Hale and Dorr client, Doe,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> were adverse, Doe\u2019s interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>disclosures he made to his attorney was threatened by Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiff here. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 4-101, as appearing in 382 Mass. 778 (1981). The judge also looked to the common law rule of disqualification enunciated in <em>T.C. Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Pictures, </em>113 F. Supp. 265 (S.D.N.Y. 1953), to determine that disqualification of Hale and Dorr was the appropriate remedy. The judge considered affidavits submitted by Doe, his attorney, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, and Willis\u2019s attorney in the FTC matter, and found that they established the \u201cinescapable conclusion\u201d that Hale and Dorr received certain confidential information during its representation in the FTC matter which may now be used to advance the plaintiff\u2019s claim against Willis and which may actually work to the detriment of Hale and Dorr\u2019s former client.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Finally, the judge looked to Canon 9 of the ABA Model Code of Professional Responsibility (code), which states that a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety and concluded that Hale and Dorr should cease its representation of the plaintiff. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 9-101, as appearing in 382 Mass. 795 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">1. <em>Canon 4. </em>We recognize that the case is in a far different posture from that in which it was before the trial judge. The record before us differs significantly from the record before the trial judge. See note 6, <em>supra. </em>On appeal, the major issue is consent.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In determining whether disqualification was ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>propriate, the judge focused on Canon 4 and the attorney\u2019s duty to preserve client confidences. The judge looked to the judicially created protection of the \u201csubstantial relationship\u201d test.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Although many courts have employed this test to analyze the propriety of successive representation,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> we have not explicitly adopted this test.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Masiello </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>394 Mass. 842, 848 n.5 (1985). Nor is it necessary to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">The applicability of this test is questionable in circumstances in which the former client, after full disclosure, consents to subsequent representation by the law firm of a potentially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>adverse interest. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Agosto, </em>675 F.2d 965, 973-974 (8th Cir. 1982); <em>Melamed </em>v. <em>ITT Continental Baking Co., </em>592 F.2d 290, 293 (6th Cir. 1979); <em>In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, </em>530 F.2d 83, 89 (5th Cir. 1976); <em>\u2022Interstate Properties </em>v. <em>Pyramid Co., </em>547 F. Supp. 178, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). \u201cSince the substantial relationship standard was developed primarily to protect the client who would not otherwise be able to <em>prove </em>a breach of his confidence, there would be little reason for the courts to interfere with an informed client decision to waive that judicially created protection. Thus, a greater deference to the desires of the parties in the successive representation cases seems fully appropriate.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Note, Developments in the Law \u2014 Conflicts of Interest in the Legal Profession, 94 Harv. L. Rev. 1241, 1334 (1981).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">Both the plaintiff and the former client consent to Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation; therefore, we need not decide whether to adopt the substantial relationship test. Pursuant to the order of the single justice of the Appeals Court, the plaintiff supplemented the record to include a second affidavit of the former client revealing that he has no objection to Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiff. Moreover, the former client stated that he has consulted an attorney in a different law firm to determine whether he should withdraw his consent to Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation of the plaintiff.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On the basis of this advice and his review of all the documents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>filed with this court, the former client stated that there was no reason for him to withdraw his consent. In addition, the plaintiff submitted an affidavit stating that he has been informed of Hale and Dorr\u2019s potential conflict of interest. After consideration of this factor, the plaintiff stated that he consents to Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation of both himself and the former client. Given that both clients consent to Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation after full disclosure of the relevant circumstances, we conclude that disqualification is unnecessary.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Willis contends the substantial relationship test should apply, despite the consent, because he and the former client were in a joint defense posture in the FTC proceeding.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The record before us, however, does not support Willis\u2019s claim that there was a joint defense in the FTC action. The affidavits of Doe and his attorney make clear that, in contrast to Willis, Doe was informed as early as 1984 that he was not a target of the FTC investigation. The FTC investigation focused on the two owners of Standard, the defendant and Taglione, and Standard. The FTC investigation was not focused on the company\u2019s employees. Thus, the record does not support Willis\u2019s claim of the existence of a joint defense agreement or posture.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">2. <em>Canon </em>5.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition to the concerns regarding the potential for a breach of the duty to preserve client confidences, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>this case also involves Canon 5 considerations. See S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 5-105, as appearing in 382 Mass. 781 (1981). Simultaneous representation of clients with adverse interests is broadly proscribed in DR 5-105 (A) and (B). The only exception to this prohibition on simultaneous representation is contained in DR 5-105 (C), which permits a lawyer to represent multiple clients \u201cif it is obvious that he can adequately represent the interest of each and if each consents to the representation after full disclosure.\u201d <em>In McCourt Co. </em>v. <em>FPC Properties, Inc., </em>386 Mass. 145, 146 (1982), we noted that these provisions expressly forbid one attorney from defending a client in one action and then subsequently representing a new client against the former client, unless each client, after full disclosure, consents. See <em>Masiello </em>v. <em>Perini Corp., </em>394 Mass. 842, 845-846 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">As previously noted, on the basis of the record before us, it is clear that both clients have consented to Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation after full disclosure of the consequences of the simultaneous representation. We have not, however, utilized the second aspect of DR 5-105 (C) concerning the requirement that it must be \u201cobvious\u201d that an attorney can represent both interests.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Moreover, the code does not define \u201cobvious.\u201d This language has been described as somewhat troubling because a literal reading of the language of DR 5-105 (C) makes \u201crepresentation of conflicting interests nearly impossible. . . . Once it is shown that the exercise of the lawyer\u2019s independent professional judgment would be or would likely be adversely affected (DR 5-105 [A]), how could it ever be \u2018obvious\u2019 that he could adequately represent the interest of each party?\u201d <em>In re Complaint as to the Conduct of Porter, </em>283 Or. 517, 529 n.5 (1978). To read the \u201cobvious\u201d aspect of DR 5-105(C) in that fashion would result in the virtual elimination of the consent element of the provision. In <em>Unified Sewerage Agency </em>v. <em>Jelco Inc., </em>646 F.2d 1339, 1348 n.12 (9th Cir. 1981), the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>stated that \u201cobvious\u201d must be assessed in reference to an objective standard under which the ability of the attorney to represent adequately the interests of each client is \u201cfree from substantial doubt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In <em>Gorovitz </em>v. <em>Planning Bd. of Nantucket, </em>394 Mass. 246, 250 (1985), and <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 788 (1979), we encouraged deference to the exercise of an attorney\u2019s best judgment as to whether such employment will bring the attorney into conflict with the code.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Hale and Dorr has determined that its representation will not violate the provisions of the code. We see no basis in the record before us to conclude that Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation \u201ctaints the legal system or the trial of the cause before [the court].\u201d <em>Borman, supra. </em>Finally, the clients affected by this potential conflict of interest have been apprised of the ramifications of Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation and both clients have consented.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In these circumstances, we are unwilling to read the \u201cobviousness\u201d requirement of DR 5-105 (C) to justify \u201coverriding the client\u2019s right to take a calculated risk, and, with full knowledge, engage the attorney of his choice.\u201d <em>Unified Sewerage Agency of Wash. County, Or., supra </em>at 1349-1350.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">3. <em>Canon 9. </em>Finally, the judge relied on the dictates of S.J.C. Rule 3:07, Canon 9, as appearing in 382 Mass. 795 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>(1981), that a lawyer should avoid even the appearance of impropriety to determine that disqualification was appropriate. We do not believe, however, given the circumstances of this case, that there is an appearance of impropriety in Hale and Dorr\u2019s continued representation of the plaintiff. Canon 9 should not be read to alter the \u201cdelicate balance\u201d created by the other canons between a client\u2019s right to counsel of his choice and the maintenance of professional standards. <em>Whiting Corp. </em>v. <em>White Mach. Corp., </em>567 F.2d 713, 715 (7th Cir. 1977). <em>Interstate Properties </em>v. <em>Pyramid Co. of Utica, </em>547 F. Supp. 178, 183 (S.D.N.Y. 1982). If Canon 9 is the only disqualification consideration, generally it is \u201csimply too weak and too slender a reed on which to rest a disqualification order.\u201d <em>Freeman </em>v. <em>Chicago Musical Instrument Co., </em>689 F.2d 715, 723 (7th Cir. 1982). See <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>McAlpin, </em>625 F.2d 433, 445 (2d Cir. 1980), vacated on other grounds, 449 U.S. 1106 (1981); <em>Board of Educ. of the City of N.Y. </em>v. <em>Nyquist, </em>590 F.2d 1241, 1247 (2d Cir. 1979); <em>Interstate Properties </em>v. <em>Pyramid Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We vacate the order of disqualification and remand the matter to the Superior Court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b511-8\"> Standard Financial Management Corporation, doing business as New England Rare Coin Galleries, has filed a suggestion of bankruptcy; the suit has proceeded against the defendant and Paul F.

The single justice of the Appeals Court granted the parties leave to supplement the record and the affidavits before us of all the affected clients reflect the clients\u2019 consent to Hale and Dorr\u2019s representation after full disclosure of the relevant considerations. The trial judge did not have the benefit of these affidavits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b513-7\"> The plaintiff asserts that the defendant lacks standing to request Hale and Dorr\u2019s disqualification. Willis is not and has never been a client of Hale and Dorr. We need not resolve this issue, however, because the defendant did not request disqualification of Hale and Doit in his motion for a protective order. The judge decided, sua sponte, that disqualification was necessary. On appeal, the defendant is urging affirmance of the order of the trial judge. The defendant has standing to argue that the order is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">Some courts permit third parties, generally opposing counsel, to seek disqualification on the basis of conflict of interest. See, e.g., <em>Kevlik </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number><em>Goldstein, </em>724 F.2d 844, 847-848 (1st Cir. 1984); <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp. </em>v. <em>Daniel Int'l Corp., </em>563 F.2d 671, 673 (5th Cir. 1977). Other courts permit only former clients to move for disqualification. See, e.g., <em>Fred Weber, Inc. </em>v. <em>Shell Oil Co., </em>566 F.2d 602, 608 (8th Cir. 1977), cert. denied, 436 U.S. 905 (1978), overruled on other grounds, <em>In re Multi-Piece Rim Prods. Liab. Litigation, </em>612 F.2d 377 (8th Cir. 1980), vacated sub nom. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. </em>v. <em>Risjord, </em>449 U.S. 368 (1981); <em>In re Yarn Processing Patent Validity Litigation, </em>530 F.2d 83, 88-89 (5th Cir. 1976). Because these motions are frequently used to obtain a tactical advantage, see <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 787 (1979), limitations on standing rules have been advocated. See Greene, Everybody\u2019s Doing It \u2014 But Who Should Be?

Rev. 205 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b514-7\"> That test provides that \u201cthe former client need show no more than that the matters embraced within the pending suit wherein his former attorney appears on behalf of his adversary are substantially related to the matters or cause of action wherein the attorney previously represented him, the former client.

It will not inquire into their nature and extent.\u201d <em>T.C. Theatre Corp. </em>v. <em>Warner Bros. Pictures, </em>113 F.
