During cross-examination of the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness, the judge declared a mistrial. Prior to the second trial, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss both indictments on double jeopardy grounds. The motion was denied by the same judge who declared the mistrial. The defendant then petitioned this court for relief pursuant to G. L. c. 211, \u00a7 3 (1984 ed.); a single justice reserved decision and reported the case to the full court pursuant to Mass. R. Civ. P. 64, 365 Mass. 831 (1974). We conclude that the defendant is entitled to dismissal of the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>The facts are these. On February 25, 1985, the defendant\u2019s case was called for trial. The jury were empanelled and sworn. The prosecutor made an opening statement, then examined the Commonwealth\u2019s first witness, Colin Godet, the son of the alleged victim. During cross-examination, a contretemps between defense counsel and the judge resulted in a mistrial. It unfolded as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-5\">Defense counsel: \u201cMr. Godet, what\u2019s your mother\u2019s name?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The witness: \u201cMary Godet.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-7\">Defense counsel: \u201cNow, are you aware of any suit which she has filed since the accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-8\">The prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-9\">The judge: \u201cThat goes out. Don\u2019t answer that. That is just immaterial to this case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-10\">Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, there is a civil lawsuit which could have a bearing on this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-11\">The prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-12\">The judge: \u201cWait a minute now. I have excluded it. You\u2019re saying it now in front of the jury. You\u2019re bringing it to their attention.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-13\">Defense counsel: \u201cExcuse me, your Honor. Mr. Godet, has your mother or your father\u2019s estate filed a suit resulting from this accident?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-14\">The prosecutor: \u201cObjection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-15\">The judge: \u201cDo you want me to call a mistrial because of your conduct?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-16\">Defense counsel: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t.[<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>] Excuse me, your Honor. The question is withdrawn.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-17\">The judge: \u201cThe jury will ignore those questions. They have nothing to do with this criminal case. NoW, I think that is unfair for you to be doing that. If the District Attorney wants a mistrial, I\u2019ll call a mistrial. I think it\u2019s unfair.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-18\">The prosecutor: \u201cMay I see you at side bar?\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-19\">The judge: \u201cI\u2019ll not only call a mistrial, I\u2019ll fine you because I have already told you not to do this.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Defense counsel: \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019m sorry if I misunderstood \u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-5\">The judge: \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re sorry or not.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-6\">The prosecutor: \u201cI would be pressing for a mistrial.\u201d The judge: \u201cThe mistrial is granted.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b133-7\">The judge: \u201cI\u2019m going to call a mistrial on this case. Those questions are really prejudicial to this case and for an attorney to do that, and then when I direct him not to do it, to continue to do it \u2014 you\u2019re lucky I don\u2019t fine you. The jury will be excused and this case will go back to the list for a new jury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">We note that, while the judge may have been wrong in his evidentiary ruling,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> defense counsel was wrong to pursue the point within the hearing of the jury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He should have sought a side bar conference. He did not do so. Neither wrong is dispositive, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">\u201cThe double jeopardy provision [<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>] protects one not merely from double punishment but from double trials. . . . \u2018[I]n view of the importance of the right, and the fact that it is frustrated by any mistrial, the prosecutor must shoulder the burden of justifying the mistrial if he is to avoid the double jeopardy bar. His burden is a heavy one.\u2019 <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>[434 U.S. 497, 505 (1978)]. See <em>Wade </em>v. <em>Hunter, </em>336 U.S. 684, 689 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>(1949). This burden consists of demonstrating \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 [for declaration of a mistrial].\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 78-79 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">In denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge held that a mistrial was necessary because no curative instructions could have mitigated the damage done by (1) defense counsel\u2019s \u201cunfair questioning of the witness\u201d and (2) his apparent \u201clack of respect ... for the Court.\u201d The first contention, focusing on unfairness to the prosecution, is belied by the fact that the judge initially responded to counsel\u2019s disclosure of the pend-ency of a civil suit with a curative instruction to disregard that disclosure. Once the cat was out of the bag, as it were, counsel\u2019s more specific question as to the suit \u201cresulting from this accident\u201d added no significant prejudice to the Commonwealth.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Where the mere reiteration of a curative instruction is sufficient to avoid prejudice, the necessity for a mistrial is not manifest.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Turning to the judge\u2019s second basis for declaring the mistrial, we recognize his concern that the vociferousness of his own reaction to the defendant\u2019s counsel \u201cwas not lost on the jury . . . resulting in prejudice to the defendant.\u201d However, we are \u201cdeferential to the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion in ruling that a \u2018manifest necessity\u2019 exists for a mistrial \u2018only if it is clear from the record that the judge has given careful consideration to the available alternatives and to the defendant\u2019s interest in having the trial concluded in a single proceeding. \u2019 <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>385 Mass. 517, 519 (1982). The discretion of a trial judge where double jeopardy is concerned is more restricted than the discretion commonly granted to trial judges for more routine matters that arise before, during, and after trials. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>379 Mass. 607, 617 (1980).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, supra </em>at 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Additionally, we have stated that, before a mistrial is declared, \u201ccounsel must be given full opportunity to be heard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>No opportunity was given counsel to argue the propriety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>of the question or of the necessity of a mistrial. We must conclude that the judge responded without meaningful consideration of alternatives. Thus, no \u201cmanifest necessity\u201d for a mistrial was shown.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">It follows that the defendant\u2019s motion for dismissal on double jeopardy grounds should have been granted. The case is remanded to the single justice for the entry of an order allowing the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-20\">We treat this case as one in which a mistrial was declared over the objection of the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-10\">See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elliot, </em>393 Mass. 824, 828 (1985) (defendant may question victim about civil suit based on the crime charged to reveal bias and personal interest). See also G. L. c. 229, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 2 (1984 ed.) (child of deceased in wrongful death action entitled to portion of damages recovered).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-11\"> Defense counsel also submitted a sworn affidavit in support of the motion to dismiss. His characterization therein of his behavior after the judge sustained the prosecutor\u2019s first objection (that he \u201cattempted to lay a better foundation by asking the witness his mother\u2019s name, and whether he lived with her, to show that her civil suit could benefit him\u201d) is not wholly supported by the record. However, the fact that the witness was nineteen years old and was the son of the victim and was living with his mother and sister was before the judge when he made his rulings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b133-12\">The Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part: \u201c[n]o person shall ... be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\u201d See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Roby, </em>12 Pick. 496, 501 (1832); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Steward, </em>396 Mass. 76, 78 (1985) (\u201cdouble jeopardy principles have long been a part of the common law of Massachusetts\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\"> The fact that the evidence is arguably admissible, see note 2, <em>supra, </em>adds strength to this comment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
