The Appeals Court, pursuant to its rule 1:28 (summary disposition), issued an order vacating and reversing the dismissal, and remanding the case for further proceedings. 23 Mass. App. Ct. 1103 (1986). We allowed the application of the defendant, Cooley Dickinson Hospital, for further appellate review. We reverse the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">Noel B. Monahan (his wife is also a plaintiff but we refer to Monahan in the singular hereinafter) commenced this action in September, 1981, alleging that the defendants treated him negligently for head injuries he sustained in an automobile accident three years earlier. The case was first called for trial on February 27, 1985. After several continuances granted at the request of both Monahan and the defendants, the trial date was set for January 21,1986. On January 17,1986, Monahan\u2019s counsel moved for another continuance. The motion was accompanied by a memorandum, an affidavit of counsel, and a letter dated January 16, 1986, from Monahan\u2019s physician, Dr. Timothy Rowe, chief of the Mental Health Clinic of the Northampton Veterans\u2019 Administration Medical Center. Dr. Rowe stated that Monahan \u201cis totally emotionally disabled by Post Traumatic Stress Disorder incurred during combat in Vietnam. He is in continuous and intensive treatment in our Mental Health Clinic here .... His emotional condition is highly unstable and I do not feel he is capable of withstanding the emotional stress of a legal proceeding at this time that will revive very painful memories of injury and death. His involvement now could seriously jeopardize his marginal adjustment and result in a psychiatric hospitalization. I recommend that he have a period of at least three months to stabilize before becoming re-involved in this case.\u201d According to counsel\u2019s memorandum, the defendants were aware of Monahan\u2019s medical history. In fact, the central issue in dispute was whether Monahan\u2019s disability resulted from his Vietnam experiences or the alleged negligence of the defendants. Monahan\u2019s testimony (counsel argued) was, therefore, indispensable to his prima facie case. Moreover, Monahan had only sought one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>previous continuance due to a scheduling problem of an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Counsel\u2019s affidavit stated that he had first learned of Dr. Rowe\u2019s concern on the previous day which was Thursday, January 16. He apparently attempted to have the motion heard on the next day, but because of the unavailability of the motion judge, he was unable to do so. The court was closed the following Monday, January 20, in observance of Martin Luther King Day. The motion was therefore not heard until Tuesday, January 21, the day assigned for trial. The motion judge denied the motion. The case was then called to trial by the trial judge. Counsel informed the trial judge that he was unable to proceed in Monahan\u2019s absence. The defendants requested that the case be dismissed with prejudice. The judge allowed the motion to dismiss with prejudice. On February 3, 1986, Monahan filed a motion for relief from judgment. This was also denied a few days later by the motion judge. Monahan appealed the dismissal of his complaint and the denial of his motion for relief from judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The instant case involves the interplay of Mass. R. Civ. P. 40 (b), 365 Mass. 802 (1974), and 41 (b) (2), 365 Mass. 804 (1974). Rule 40 (b) states that \u201c [continuances shall be granted only for good cause . . . .\u201d 365 Mass. 802 (1974). Rule 41 (b) (2) provides that \u201c[o]n motion of the defendant, with notice, the court may, in its discretion, dismiss any action for failure of the plaintiff to prosecute . . . .\u201d 365 Mass. 804 (1974). Unless the court expressly states otherwise, the involuntary dismissal operates as an adjudication upon the merits. Mass. R. Civ. P. 41 (b) (3), 365 Mass. 805 (1974). The dismissal will only be reversed upon a determination that it is so arbitrary, capricious, whimsical or idiosyncratic that it constitutes an abuse of discretion. <em>Bucchiere </em>v. <em>New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., </em>396 Mass. 639, 641-642 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Involuntary dismissal is a drastic sanction which should be utilized only in extreme situations. As a minimal requirement, there must be convincing evidence of unreasonable conduct or delay. A judge should also give sufficient consideration to the prejudice that the movant would incur if the motion were de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>nied, and whether there are more suitable, alternative penalties. Concern for the avoidance of a congested calendar must not come at the expense of justice. The law strongly favors a trial on the merits of a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">We conclude that, in the unusual circumstances of this case, the dismissal was erroneously Draconian because the motion for continuance should have been allowed. The record does not contain any showing that the defendants would have been prejudiced by a continuance or that the judge considered an alternative penalty. The legitimate illness of a litigant is generally \u201cgood cause\u201d for granting a continuance. Mass. R. Civ. P. 40 (b); <em>Ten </em>v. <em>Svenska Orient Linen, </em>573 F.2d 772, 774-775 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 439 U.S. 834 <em>(1978);Pollard </em>v. <em>Walsh, </em>194 Colo. 566, 567 (1978). The plaintiff\u2019s legitimate illness was beyond his control and to penalize him severely for it would be a serious injustice without consideration of alternatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">The defendants also argue that Monahan\u2019s motion was properly denied on procedural grounds. They claim that the motion did not comply with Mass. R. Civ. P. 40 (c),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 365 Mass. 802 (1974), which speaks to the information that must be present in an affidavit in support of a motion for continuance. The defendants point out that the letter from Monahan\u2019s physician was unsworn, and that counsel\u2019s affidavit contained no statement of expectation that Monahan would be able to testify at some future date. This argument, however, ignores the threshold language in the rule which provides that \u201c[t]he court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>need not entertain any motion for a continuance\u201d unless supported by an affidavit which contains the specified information. The \u201cneed not\u201d language is discretionary to the extent that if the affidavit is defective the court may still \u201centertain\u201d the motion. The dictionary defines \u201centertain\u201d as \u201cto treat,\u201d \u201cto deal with\u201d or \u201cto receive.\u201d Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary 853 (2d ed. 1959). The record indicates that the motion judge held a hearing on Monahan\u2019s motion and thereafter refused to grant the continuance. Thus, the judge apparently chose to \u201centertain\u201d the motion by deciding the merits of Monahan\u2019s request. In the absence of a hearing or a specific finding that the motion was procedurally defective, we will not assume otherwise. The judgment of dismissal is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Mass. R. Civ. P. 40 (c) states: \u201c(c) Affidavit or Certificate in Support of Motion. The court need not entertain any motion for a continuance based on the absence of a material witness unless such motion be supported by an affidavit which shall state the name of the witness and, if known, his address, the facts to which he is expected to testify and the basis for such expectation, the efforts which have been made to procure his attendance or deposition, and the expectation which the party has of procuring his testimony or deposition at a future time. Such motion may, in the discretion of the court, be denied if the adverse party will admit that the absent witness would, if present, testify as stated in the affidavit. The same rule shall apply, with the necessary changes in points of detail, when the motion is grounded on the want of any material document, thing, or other evidence. \u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b146-6\">Hennessey, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMeo\">(concurring). I concur, but I add that I have some apprehension that the result here may be misinterpreted by some lawyers and litigants. The trial judges have (and must have) broad discretion in dealing with requests for continuances in civil proceedings. Dismissal may well be called for, when a litigant\u2019s course of action has been unreasonable, and the order for dismissal by a judge of the trial court should ordinarily have finality. The court here calls for restraint by judges in ordering dismissals: \u201cInvoluntary dismissal is a drastic sanction which should be utilized only in extreme situations.\u201d <em>ante </em>at 128. My view is that the appellate court must show similiar restraint in contemplating reversal of an order of dismissal. I add that I think the court\u2019s opinion is consistent with my thoughts: <em>\u201cin the unusual circumstances of this case . . . </em>the motion for continuance should have been allowed\u201d (emphasis supplied) <em>ante </em>at 129.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
