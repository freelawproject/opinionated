Pidge, Jr., was convicted by a jury of the murder in the first degree of William McCart. He was also convicted of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon upon Glenn Marrone and upon Dorothy Blackler Troy. The defendant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the murder conviction and to concurrent terms of six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>to ten years and two and one-half years to three years on the assault and battery convictions. He appealed the convictions, and we now reverse and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">On Friday evening, October 5, 1984, the defendant met Glenn Marrone and William McCart at a Sudbury restaurant. The defendant and Marrone knew each other through a mutual friend, Dorothy Bladder Troy, but the defendant had never met McCart. At the restaurant, all three men were drinking alcoholic beverages. The three men left and went to another restaurant where they continued drinking. At the second restaurant, the defendant and McCart got into an argument. At approximately 1:30 a.m. on October 6, 1984, the three men left the restaurant and drove to Troy\u2019s house. The defendant had been staying at Troy\u2019s house, and Marrone frequently visited Troy and often did yard work for her. Marrone and the defendant each testified that he had a key to Troy\u2019s house, but Troy denied ever having given the defendant a key. On the way to the house, Marrone drove his automobile; the defendant sat in the passenger\u2019s seat, and McCart sat in the back seat. McCart and the defendant again began to argue.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">From this point, Marrone\u2019s version of the events differs substantially from the defendant\u2019s. Marrone was the Commonwealth\u2019s chief witness. He testified that he kept a knife, which he used on his family\u2019s boat, in the front seat of his automobile. According to Marrone, the defendant grabbed the knife during the ride to Troy\u2019s house and waved it. McCart then punched the defendant and gave him a bloody nose. Marrone stopped the vehicle and the defendant got out and said he would walk. Marrone told the defendant to throw away the knife and get back in the vehicle. The defendant got back in the vehicle and said he had thrown the knife away. Marrone got out of the vehicle and looked for the knife but could not find it. He then drove to Troy\u2019s house without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">When the three arrived at Troy\u2019s house, McCart and the defendant went inside but Marrone remained behind to lock the vehicle and get his cigarettes. When Marrone entered the house, he heard McCart yelling for help. He saw both men struggling on their hands and knees with the defendant leaning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>over McCart. Marrone saw his knife in the defendant\u2019s hand and saw blood on the floor beneath McCart. Marrone jumped on the defendant in an effort to aid McCart, and the defendant turned and stabbed Marrone in the side. Troy and the other residents of the house were awakened and went to the kitchen area. The defendant stood up and whirled around, cutting Troy\u2019s hands. The defendant then ran out of the house. McCart died of a six-inch stab wound to the chest. It was stipulated that Marrone\u2019s knife or one similar to it caused the wound.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">After the defendant left the house, Troy aided Marrone by putting towels on his wound. When she loosened his trousers to get at the wound, the knife sheath fell from Marrone\u2019s pants. By this time, the police had arrived, and Marrone told them that he put the sheath in his pants when he got out of the car to look for the knife on the ride to Troy\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The defendant\u2019s version of the incident differed substantially from Marrone\u2019s. He said he never picked up a knife during the ride to Troy\u2019s house. He was arguing with McCart in the car when McCart, without provocation, suddenly punched him in the back of the head. The defendant turned around, and McCart punched him in the nose causing him to bleed and rendering him unconscious. He regained consciousness in front of Troy\u2019s house where both Marrone and McCart were yelling at him. He became frightened and ran into the house. McCart grabbed him and started punching, and Marrone immediately began to punch him as well. All three fell to the floor in a struggle, and the defendant saw a knife in someone\u2019s hand. He was being choked, started to black out, and feared for his life when he grabbed the knife and started slashing randomly. He heard everyone yelling at him to get out, so he left and turned himself in to the police the next day.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">On appeal, the defendant argues that he is entitled to a new trial because he was not permitted to introduce evidence of specific instances of McCart\u2019s violent conduct of which the defendant was aware. We agree. In <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Forties, </em>396 Mass. 733, 735 (1986), we held that a defendant asserting self-defense in a homicide case \u201cshould be allowed to prove that at the time of the killing he knew of specific violent acts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>recently committed by the victim.\u201d Such evidence is relevant on the issue whether the defendant acted justifiably in reasonable apprehension of bodily harm. <em>Id. </em>at 735-736. Prior to <em>Fontes, </em>a defendant who claimed self-defense was permitted to introduce evidence of the victim\u2019s reputation for violence at the time of the incident, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Edmonds, </em>365 Mass. 496, 502 (1974), and of threats by the victim to him, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>318 Mass. 587, 589-590 (1945). <em>Fontes </em>is the first case in Massachusetts which holds that evidence of specific violent acts by the victim toward others of which the defendant was aware are admissible when a defendant claims self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">During the defendant\u2019s testimony, his counsel requested a lobby conference regarding questions he was about to ask concerning the defendant\u2019s state of mind at the time of the killing. According to the defendant\u2019s counsel, the defendant would have testified that his state of mind was influenced by what he knew about violent acts committed by McCart. The defendant would have testified to a conversation he had with Marrone at the restaurant on the night of the killing. After the defendant and McCart had an argument, McCart went to the men\u2019s room and Marrone told the defendant, in the words of defendant\u2019s counsel, \u201cthat he ought not be arguing with this kid. He told him that McCart was a very tough young man and . . . that he had assaulted other people and that he was charged and had been over in the Framingham District Court on charges that he assaulted some person with a switch-blade knife and that he had assaulted some other person with a rock. Also, that he had even assaulted a police officer with some kind of weapon. \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The prosecutor objected to the introduction of this testimony and the judge ruled that it was inadmissible. The ruling was erroneous. For reasons stated in <em>Fontes, supra, </em>the defendant should have been allowed to introduce evidence of specific instances of McCart\u2019s recent violent conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>The Commonwealth argues that <em>Fontes, supra, </em>should not apply because the defendant\u2019s trial took place before the <em>Fontes </em>decision. However, where an issue is properly preserved and pending on direct appeal, the defendant is entitled to the benefit of a new rule of law announced after his trial. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bellamy, </em>391 Mass. 511, 515 (1984). The Commonwealth further argues that we need not apply <em>Fontes </em>retroactively because the decision was not constitutionally compelled. Although we have held that, in some circumstances, rules which are not constitutionally required need not apply retroactively, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Parham, </em>390 Mass. 833, 838 n.3 (1984), we think that <em>Fontes </em>should apply to those defendants who have preserved the issue at trial and raised it on direct appeal. <em>Bellamy, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">The Commonwealth also argues that, even if <em>Fontes </em>applies, the judge\u2019s refusal to admit the proffered evidence is harmless error. We disagree. At the trial, the critical issue was whether the jury believed the testimony of Marrone or the defendant\u2019s version of self-defense. The excluded testimony would have enhanced the defendant\u2019s assertion of self-defense because the defendant\u2019s claim that he was in fear would have been more plausible. With this additional evidence to substantiate the defendant\u2019s explanation that he was in fear, the defendant could then have appeared to be more credible in the eyes of the jury. The exclusion of the evidence of McCart\u2019s prior violent conduct known to the defendant was prejudicial. Consequently, the defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">We do not treat the other issues raised by the defendant concerning an evidentiary ruling and instructions to the jury because it is not likely that they will reappear in a new trial. The judgments are reversed, the verdicts set aside, and the cases are remanded to the Superior Court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-7\"> Copies of certified records from the Framingham District Court contained in the record appendix indicate that McCart was charged with three counts of assault and battery by means of a dangerous weapon: one involving a switchblade knife; one involving a rock; and one involving the use of a shod foot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
