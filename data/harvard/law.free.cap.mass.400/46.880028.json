Mass. Sept. 17, 1981), a judge of the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts declared that the Department of Public Welfare (department) violated Federal law by promulgating and enforcing a regulation requiring the deduction of Federal energy assistance benefits in computing entitlements to emergency assistance benefits. The judge enjoined the State defendants from continuing that practice. However, due to constraints imposed by the Eleventh Amendment to the Constitution of the United States, the judge did not order retroactive relief. Thereafter, the plaintiffs, having been members of the plaintiff class certified in <em>Ingerson, </em>requested retroactive benefits from the department. The department rejected their requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">The present action was brought for the recovery of the retroactive benefits. The plaintiffs were successful in the Superior Court. However, the judgment was silent with respect to the right of the plaintiffs to recover attorneys\u2019 fees. The defendant appealed, and, in <em>Crane </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Pub. Welfare, </em>395 Mass. 435 (1985) <em>(Crane </em>I), this court affirmed the decision that the plaintiffs were entitled to retroactive benefits on the ground that a regulation of the department required the correction of underpayments resulting from \u201cadministrative error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 443-445. However, we remanded to that court the issues whether the plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees, and, if so, the amount thereof. <em>Id. </em>at 445-446.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>On remand, a judge of the Superior Court concluded that the plaintiffs were not entitled to attorneys\u2019 fees. Nevertheless, recognizing the possibility of an appeal, the judge stated in his memorandum of decision that \u201cthe extensive affidavits submitted by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys and paralegal provide a factual basis that the number of hours spent in preparing this case appear to be reasonable and that the hourly fees charged appear to be in accord with the average hourly rate for attorneys of similar experience and ability in the greater Boston area. See <em>Hensley </em>v. <em>Eckerhart, </em>461 U.S. 424, 433 (1983).\u201d The plaintiffs appealed from the denial of attorneys\u2019 fees, and the defendant appealed from so much of the judgment as determined that the hours and fees were reasonable. We granted the plaintiffs\u2019 application for direct appellate review. We now reverse the portion of the judgment that denied the fees and affirm the part that concluded that the hours and fees were reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Section 1988 of 42 U.S.C. (1982) authorizes trial judges to award reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees to \u201cthe prevailing party\u201d in \u201cany action or proceeding to enforce a provision of [\u00a7 1983].\u201d Section 1983 provides that persons acting under color of State law who deprive another of rights secured by the Constitution or laws of the United States \u201cshall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress.\u201d Section 1983 actions need not be based on \u201ccivil rights\u201d legislation. <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, </em>387 Mass. 312, 316 (1982), citing <em>Maine </em>v. <em>Thiboutot, </em>448 U.S. 1, 4-8 (1980). Section 1983 creates a \u201cspecies of tort liability\u201d in favor of persons who are deprived of rights secured by Federal law. <em>Memphis Community School Dist. </em>v. <em>Stachura, All </em>U.S. 299, 305 (1986), quoting <em>Carey </em>v. <em>Piphus, </em>435 U.S. 247, 253 (1978). See <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra </em>at 313-314.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Asserting this court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction\u201d not only under State law but under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1982), as well, the complaint alleges a wrong under Federal law requiring a monetary remedy. Whether the order the plaintiffs seek is deemed to be one for the retroactive payment of benefits, or for compensation in the form of money damages, is inconsequential. In either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>event, the plaintiffs assert a species of tort liability on account of the deprivation of their rights secured by Federal law. This, then, is an \u201caction ... to enforce a provision of [\u00a7 1983]\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1988, and it is no less so because it is also an action under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The question remains whether it can fairly be said that the plaintiffs \u201cprevailed\u201d in their action to enforce \u00a7 1983. In <em>Crane I, </em>we did not focus on \u00a7 1983. Instead, we held that the plaintiffs were entitled to retroactive benefits because of a department regulation that required the correction of underpayments resulting from \u201cadministrative error.\u201d 106 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 322.090(G) (1979). <em>Id. </em>at 443-444. But, we could as well have based our holding on \u00a7 1983. It is not unlikely that we would have done so, if, instead of first proceeding in the Federal court to obtain a declaration that the State welfare regulation was invalid, the plaintiffs had elected at the outset to proceed in the State court to obtain both that declaration and money damages. The plaintiffs should not be penalized by this court\u2019s decision to base its holding on State law rather than on \u00a7 1983. Nor should the plaintiffs be penalized for taking their grievance involving questions of Federal law to the Federal court in the first instance. For these reasons, and to implement Congress\u2019s desire to create an incentive under \u00a7 1988 for plaintiffs to seek enforcement of rights secured by Federal law, see <em>Exeter-W. Greenwich Regional School Dist. </em>v. <em>Pontarelli, </em>788 F.2d 47, 51 (1st Cir. 1986), we conclude that the plaintiffs are entitled to reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees for work done in connection with these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Our conclusion is firmly supported in principle by <em>Stratos </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Welfare, supra. </em>In that case, we recognized that \u201c[c]omplaints brought under \u00a7 1983 may often allege both a violation of Federal constitutional provisions, which provide a basis for action under \u00a7 1983, and a violation of State law, which, standing alone, would not support an action under \u00a7 1983. In such a case, the plaintiff need not obtain a final, favorable determination of his constitutional claims in order to claim an attorney\u2019s fee under \u00a7 1988. It is enough that the constitutional claims are \u2018substantial,\u2019 and arise from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>the same nucleus of facts on which the State law claims are based\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 317. Although the present case is distinguishable from <em>Stratos, </em>in that the plaintiffs claim violation of rights secured not by the Federal Constitution, but by Federal statutory and regulatory law, the distinction is not substantive. \u201cThe fee incentive is equally useful and necessary whether the right in question is secured by Federal law [constitutional or otherwise] alone, or by State law as well.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">We briefly discuss the defendant\u2019s contention that the judge erroneously determined that the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees are reasonable. The defendant challenges the judge\u2019s determination on three grounds: (1) paralegal time devoted to clerical or secretarial work is not compensable; (2) the attorneys spent excessive time on the cases; (3) the rates were too high.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">On the basis of the paralegal\u2019s affidavit, the judge was entitled to conclude that the paralegal\u2019s work was not merely ministerial but required the exercise of judgment. Such work is compensable under \u00a7 1988. See <em>Burney </em>v. <em>Pawtucket, </em>728 F.2d 547, 550 (1st Cir. 1984); <em>United Nuclear Corp. </em>v. <em>Cannon, </em>564 F. Supp. 581, 589 (D.R.I. 1983). Compensation for such services \u201cencourages cost-effective delivery of legal services and, by reducing the spiraling cost of [\u00a7 1983] litigation, furthers the policies underlying [\u00a7 1983].\u201d <em>Cameo Convalescent Center, Inc. </em>v. <em>Senn, </em>738 F.2d 836, 846 (7th Cir. 1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1106 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">Whether counsel spent excessive time on this litigation was a question of fact for the judge, not this court, to resolve. The judge\u2019s conclusion that the time devoted by counsel in these cases was reasonable was warranted by the materials before him. There is no suggestion in the record that the judge was not guided by correct legal principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Lastly, the defendant demonstrates no error in the judge\u2019s finding that \u201cthe hourly fees charged appear to be in accord with the average hourly rate for attorneys of similar experience and ability in the greater Boston area.\u201d The judge applied the correct measure, which is the \u201cprevailing market rates in the relevant community, regardless of whether plaintiff is represented by private or nonprofit counsel.\u201d <em>Blum </em>v. <em>Stenson, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>465 U.S. 886, 895 (1984). Prevailing market rates are \u201cthose prevailing in the community for similar services by lawyers of reasonably comparable skill, experience, and reputation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 895-896 n.ll.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">The judgment of the Superior Court denying the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys\u2019 fees is reversed. The judge shall enter an order that the plaintiffs are entitled to the full amount of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
