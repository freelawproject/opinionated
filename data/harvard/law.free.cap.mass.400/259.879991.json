Royal Ins. Co., </em>394 Mass. 450 (1985). <em>See Morrissey </em>v. <em>Peerless Ins. Co., post </em>1003 (1987). In <em>Cardin, </em>we held that a policy provision could not exclude an insured\u2019s recovery for losses caused by an uninsured motorist which the Legislature required be insured against, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, or the insured be given the option of insuring against, G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C. The instant case raises the applicability of the <em>Cardin </em>holding to a household member other than the named insured. It also raises the issue whether an exclusion similar to the one in <em>Cardin </em>can be validly applied to prevent an insured from recovering amounts in excess of the statutory compulsory minimum coverage amount. See G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">The defendant insurers appeal from a judgment entered in the Superior Court, on cross motions for summary judgment, declaring that a member of the household of an insured may not be denied uninsured motorist coverage by application of the \u201cregular use exclusion\u201d in his parents\u2019 insurance policies. The judge ruled that our decision in <em>Cardin </em>v. <em>Royal Ins. Co., supra, </em>invalidating the \u201cregular use exclusion\u201d as inconsistent with G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> applied. The judge also ruled that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u00a7 113L\u2019s reference to \u201cpersons insured thereunder\u201d should be read to apply to both the insured and household members when the policy has offered them coverage. Finally, the judge declared that each defendant is to pay the plaintiff \u201can amount not in excess of the monetary limit of the uninsured portion of [its] policy.\u201d The defendants appealed and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\">The facts are not in dispute. On August 24, 1981, the plaintiff, Scott Johnson, was injured while operating a motorcycle owned by him. The injury resulted from a collision with an uninsured motor vehicle. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was a member of the household of his parents, Roy E. Johnson and Margaret Johnson. Each parent had an insurance policy covering separate vehicles which provided for $100,000 coverage for uninsured motorist claims.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Scott Johnson\u2019s motorcycle was not listed on the coverage selection page of either policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">Each policy provided, in the relevant coverage section (Part 3), that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">\u201cWe will <em>not </em>pay for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-8\">\"</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-9\">3. Anyone injured while occupying an auto owned or regularly used by you or a household member but which is not an auto shown on the Coverage Selections page.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">The plaintiffs presented a claim for $100,000 to each defendant under the uninsured coverage portion of each policy. The de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>fendants denied the claims, indicating that the exclusion quoted above precluded coverage for the injuries sustained by Scott Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">1. The defendants initially seek to distinguish the case at bar from <em>Cardin </em>on the ground that the injury in <em>Cardin </em>involved an injury to a named insured, whereas here the plaintiff is a member of the insureds\u2019 household. The insurers argue that coverage of household members is not required by statute but is offered by contract, and that therefore the contractual regular use exclusion may properly be applied to household members.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">As support for their position, the defendants point to the language of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, which mandates coverage \u201cunder provisions approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder.\u201d They contend that the term \u201cpersons insured thereunder\u201d in \u00a7 113L, should be read as referring to those persons insured under the statutorily defined motor vehicle liability policy, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as it appeared in 1968, when G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, was enacted making uninsured coverage compulsory. At that time, persons insured under a motor vehicle liability policy as defined by G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, as amended through St. 1967, c. 736, were \u201cthe insured and any person responsible for the operation of the insured\u2019s motor vehicle with his express or implied consent.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">Contrary to the defendant\u2019s contention, however, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, does not attempt to define the term \u201cpersons insured thereunder.\u201d The term as used in \u00a7 34A is part of the definition of \u201c[m]otor vehicle liability policy.\u201d Additionally, G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, was enacted as part of an over-all system of compulsory motor vehicle liability insurance. Uninsured motorist coverage is distinct from automobile liability insurance. <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos., </em>397 Mass. 38, 41 (1986). <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 452. It is not an additional liability coverage but rather \u201climited personal accident insurance.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>The distinction between the two coverages compels the conclusion that reference to G. L. c. 90, \u00a7 34A, in attempting to define the term \u201cpersons insured thereunder\u201d in G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, is, therefore, inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L, was enacted to protect the public from injury caused by negligent and financially irresponsible motorists. <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 454. It was intended to protect \u201cthe named insured and members of his family in the event of death or injury caused by the negligence of an uninsured motorist, whether such accident victims are occupants of a motor vehicle or pedestrians.\u201d 1968 Senate Doc. No. 1030, at 6-7. We conclude, therefore, that the Legislature intended to include household members within the protection of \u00a7 113L at the time of its enactment. In our view the term \u201cpersons insured thereunder\u201d as used in \u00a7 113L refers to those persons who are designated within the applicable policy provision as being insured for the purpose of uninsured motorist coverage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">The policies here involved are the Massachusetts Automobile Insurance Policy, Second Edition (issued in 1979), as amended by the 1981 Mandatory Endorsements. Part 3. \u201cBodily Injury Caused by An Uninsured Auto,\u201d provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">\u201c1. We will pay damages to or for:</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">1. You, or any household member.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-9\">2. Anyone occupying your auto with your consent at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-10\">3. Anyone else for damages he or she is entitled to recover because of injury to a person covered under this Part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">The parties have stipulated that Scott Johnson was a member of his parent\u2019s household. Scott Johnson was, therefore, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>insured under Part 3 of both his parents\u2019 policies and within the statutory mandate embodied in \u00a7 113L by the terms of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">2. The defendants recognize that, \u201cno matter how explicit the exclusionary language may be, it cannot prevail if it is contrary to the statutory language or the legislative policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L.\u201d <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 453. They contend, however, that the regular use exclusion is valid and enforceable as to uninsured coverage in excess of the compulsory minimum of $10,000 required by \u00a7 113L. We disagree with respect to that coverage required to be offered by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">The defendants\u2019 position is inconsistent with the result reached in <em>Cardin. </em>Had the defendants\u2019 reasoning been applied to the facts in <em>Cardin, </em>the plaintiff there would have been subject to the exclusion above the compulsory minimum. Instead, we held the exclusion invalid as to not only the compulsory minimum of $10,000, but also the $15,000 of optional underinsurance coverage required to be offered by G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113C, as amended through St. 1971, c. 520, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201cWhile the Legislature has set minimum coverage limits of \u2018at least\u2019 $10,000 per person per accident, that does not mean that the legislative purpose has been met whenever that person receives the statutory minimum, regardless of her actual dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>ages.\u201c <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 454 (footnote omitted). We also noted in a footnote the increased scope of the legislative purpose relative to underinsurance coverage since <em>Royal Indent. Co. </em>v. <em>Blakely, </em>372 Mass. 86 (1977). <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 454 n.5. Accordingly, we hold the exclusion at issue invalid to the extent it conflicts with the legislative purpose underlying uninsured motorist coverage as expressed inG.L.c. 175, \u00a7\u00a7 113L and 113C.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">3. The remaining policy coverage at issue involves coverage above the compulsory minimum required by \u00a7 113L and optional amounts required to be offered by \u00a7 113C. For the reasons expressed below, we conclude that the regular use exclusion may be applied to uninsured motorist benefits outside the mandate of \u00a7\u00a7 113L and 113C and provided strictly at the option of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">It is important to note that this coverage was not at issue in <em>Cardin, supra. </em>In <em>Cardin, </em>the plaintiff carried $10,000 of coverage required by \u00a7 113L. In addition, she elected to purchase the full $15,000, of coverage required to be offered by \u00a7 113C, so that the aggregate uninsured motorist coverage available to the plaintiff and at issue was $25,000. Thus no issue was presented with respect to coverage in excess of the \u00a7\u00a7 113L and 113C limits. Neither was the issue presented in <em>Lumbermens Mut. Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>DeCenzo, </em>396 Mass. 692 (1986). In <em>DeCenzo, </em>where we upheld the application of an exclusion restricting coverage to the highest single limit in any one policy, underinsurance coverage was not compulsory so that Cardin\u2019s refusal \u201cto sanction reductions in coverage for which the Legislature has not provided\u201d had no application. <em>DeCenzo, supra </em>at 695, quoting <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 455. At the time of DeCenzo\u2019s son\u2019s accident in 1979, one year before the enactment of the amendment to \u00a7 113L, which made under-insurance coverage compulsory, see St. 1980, c. 532, \u00a7 2, legislative policy did not invalidate restrictions in coverage and therefore DeCenzo\u2019s coverage was determined by the terms of his policy. <em>DeCenzo, supra </em>at 695. See <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, </em>385 Mass. 1013 (1982) (upholding \u201cregular use exclusion\u201d barring recovery of underinsured motorist ben<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>efits for a 1978 accident). See also <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>398 Mass. 782 (1986) (regular use exclusion applied to medical payments coverage where medical payments coverage not compulsory).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Read together, <em>Cardin </em>and <em>DeCenzo, </em>demonstrate that application of a policy exclusion limiting uninsured motorist coverage is restricted only to the extent that such coverage or the offer of it is mandated by statute. There is no statutory basis for holding that uninsured motorist coverage offered solely at the option of the insurer be exempted from the exclusion at issue. The Legislature, having left the offer of such additional coverage entirely to the discretion of the insurer, cannot be said to have expressed a policy decision to void application of the contractual terms of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">\u201cWe must construe the words of the policy according to \u2018the fair meaning of the language used, as applied to the subject matter,\u2019 ... as long as the statutory language or legislative policy of G. L. c. 175, \u00a7 113L, is not contravened.\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Am. Ins. Cos., </em>397 Mass. 38, 40 (1986) (citations omitted). With respect to uninsured motorist coverage above that required by \u00a7 113L, this principle must comprehend the language and legislative policy of \u00a7 113C as well. Any benefits provided above those which are the subject of \u00a7\u00a7 113L and 113C are purely optional and thus entirely a matter of contract. Here the exclusion is explicit and unambiguous; see, <em>Cardin, supra </em>at 453; <em>Royal-Globe Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Schultz, supra, </em>and therefore the terms of the policy operate to exclude that coverage outside the mandate of \u00a7\u00a7 113L and 113C.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">Accordingly, we affirm so much of the judgment allowing the plaintiffs to recover uninsured motorist benefits under the Massachusetts automobile insurance policies issued by the defendants in the amount of $25,000, and reverse that part of the judgment entitling the plaintiffs to recover under the policies issued by the defendants in excess of that amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b276-10\">General Laws c. 175, \u00a7 113L (1984 ed.), provides in pertinent part: \u201c(1) No policy shall be issued or delivered in the commonwealth with respect to a motor vehicle, trailer or semitrailer registered in this state unless such policy provides coverage in amounts or limits prescribed for bodily injury or death for a liability policy under this chapter, under provisions approved by the insurance commissioner, for the protection of persons insured thereunder who are legally entitled to recover damages from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles, trailers or semitrailers and hit-and-run motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness or disease, including death resulting therefrom.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b277-11\"> Roy E.
