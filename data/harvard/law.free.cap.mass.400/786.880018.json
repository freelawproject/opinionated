(WCVB-TV Channel 5), broadcast a series of news reports about Jones\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The background investigation for the reports was prepared by defendant Michael Taibbi. The plaintiff was later released when police failed to charge him formally with the crimes. This action, initiated by Jones in 1979, alleges invasion of privacy and defamation as a result of those news broadcasts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> A judge in the Superior Court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We transferred the case to this court on our own motion. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">In 1977 and early 1978, Los Angeles was the scene of a series of murders of young women which became known as the \u201cHillside stranglings.\u201d In February, 1978, Taibbi, then an investigative reporter for Channel 5, learned from a Massachusetts prison guard that one George Shamshak, an inmate at the Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole (now Cedar Junction), had information about the \u201cHillside strangler.\u201d Shamshak alleged that the plaintiff, then working in the Los Angeles area, had committed two or three of the Hillside murders. Shamshak indicated that the murders had occurred while he was staying with the plaintiff in California after an escape from M.C.I., Walpole. Massachusetts State police Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>William Bergin obtained similar information concerning Sham-shak, and proceeded to investigate.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">In early March, 1978, Taibbi learned from Bergin that two LAPD detectives had come to Massachusetts to question Sham-shak. Bergin informed Taibbi that Shamshak, describing Jones as a \u201clifelong\u201d or \u201cboyhood\u201d friend, had implicated Jones in two or three of the murders and that polygraph tests appeared to confirm his story. Shamshak had also identified photographs of the victims from a photographic array, and Bergin had no doubts about his veracity. Taibbi contacted the LAPD about its investigation and agreed to refrain from publicizing the information about Jones in return for being given advance knowledge of and permission to film Jones\u2019s arrest, if made. James Mitchell, a Los Angeles reporter, received similar information from the LAPD and also reached an agreement concerning the reporting of Jones\u2019s possible arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">In March, 1978, Shamshak was transferred from Massachusetts to California, and the LAPD placed Jones under surveillance. Throughout this period, as it sought corroborating evidence, the LAPD did not express doubt about Shamshak\u2019s story. Shamshak had passed several polygraph tests and possessed detailed knowledge of some of the murders which was not known by the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">In late March, Taibbi and a Channel 5 cameraman traveled to California to film a series of reports on the investigation and possible arrest of Jones. On March 30, 1978, the LAPD arrested Jones in a parking lot. Taibbi and Mitchell were present and Channel 5 filmed the arrest from a parking lot accessible to the public. News of the arrest was broadcast almost immediately by other members of the news media. The LAPD held a press conference and termed the arrest of Jones a \u201cmajor break.\u201d Jones was booked and held as a suspect in the Hillside stranglings, but was never formally charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">Channel 5 announced the break in the Hillside case during its 11 p.m. newscast on March 30,1978. The newscast included a background report by Taibbi. Taibbi described Shamshak\u2019s allegations that he had seen Jones murder at least two, and perhaps three, young women in the back of a van. Taibbi <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>reported that the results of four polygraph tests supported Shamshak\u2019s allegations, and noted that the Massachusetts police believed that Shamshak\u2019s story \u201cheld.\u201d State police Lieutenant Colonel John Donovan was interviewed by Taibbi about the investigation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The report also included interviews with members of Shamshak\u2019s family, who stated that they believed Shamshak. On the other hand, the report included Donovan\u2019s statement that California authorities had yet to find corroborative evidence. Taibbi concluded by posing several \u201cunanswered questions\u201d which cast doubt on Shamshak\u2019s credibility. Taibbi questioned, for example, whether Shamshak was a participant in the murders rather than an \u201cinnocent witness,\u201d and noted that, while Shamshak knew \u201cmuch, much more than he could have learned from news accounts of the killings, . . . often, on crucial points, he\u2019s been way off the mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">During the next few days, Channel 5 reported on developments in California and in Massachusetts. The March 31,6 p.m. newscast included a segment by Taibbi which included a film of Jones\u2019s arrest and reported that Jones had been booked on suspicion of murder on the basis of Shamshak\u2019s information. Taibbi described the LAPD surveillance of Jones, and quoted a source who said Jones was \u201cthe kind of man who dropped coins in blind mens\u2019 [&gt;zc] cups and who stopped to help stranded motorists on the highways.\u201d An interview with Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates was shown in which Gates stated there was \u201cabsolutely no question\u201d that Shamshak\u2019s information was \u201cthe best thing we\u2019ve had to go on.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The newscaster stated that \u201cLos Angeles police charged Jones with two counts of first degree murder.\u201d The newscast then repeated Taibbi\u2019s March 30 background report and continued with a report quoting Jones\u2019s former fianc\u00e9e saying that Jones could not be connected with the murders. There was also a segment reporting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>on a news conference held by the Massachusetts State police, in which Detective Bergin explained the State police role in the investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Subsequent newscasts repeated some of these reports, as well as ongoing official investigations in Maine and Massachusetts into possible connections between the stranglings and similar murders in those States. Beginning on April 1, 1978, at 6 p.m. , Channel 5 reported that the LAPD had not corroborated Shamshak\u2019s allegations. The newscaster stated that there was not \u201cenough evidence yet to file murder charges against Jones,\u201d and, on the 11 p.m. newscast, it was reported that \u201cPolice in Los Angeles are still trying to find some hard evidence to justify a murder charge.\u201d On April 3, Channel 5 reported that Jones had been released \u201cbecause of a lack of evidence.\u201d Taibbi reported that the LAPD investigation of Jones was not over, but that \u201cJones had a solid alibi for one of the nights in question,\u201d and was not at the moment a suspect in the killings. Two later newscasts reported the fact that Jones had been released.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">The defendant American Broadcasting Companies, Inc. (ABC), reported Jones\u2019s arrest in its March 31, \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and \u201cABC Evening News\u201d programs. At least one news segment on the \u201cGood Morning America\u201d program included the Channel 5 film of Jones\u2019s arrest with Taibbi\u2019s voice-over commentary. Additional reporting was done by several ABC correspondents, who used portions of Channel 5 film in their reports.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">I. <em>Defamation.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b807-8\">1. <em>Defamatory publication. </em>The threshold issue we confront is whether the broadcasts in question are \u2018\u201creasonably susceptible of a defamatory connotation,\u2019 so as to warrant their submission to a jury to determine if in fact the defamatory connotation was conveyed.\u201d <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>New Times Publishing Co., </em>639 F.2d 54, 60 (2d Cir. 1980), quoting <em>James </em>v. <em>Gannett Co., </em>40 N.Y. 2d 415, 419 (1976). <em>Bufalino </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>692 F.2d 266, 269 (2d Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 462 U.S. 1111 (1983). <em>Lal </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., </em>551 F. Supp. 356, 360 (E.D. Penn. 1982), aff\u2019d, 726 F.2d 97 (3d Cir. 1984). Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>ment (Second) of Torts \u00a7 614 (1977). The determination whether the communication complained of is capable of a defamatory meaning is for the court. Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 614 comment b. Where the communication is susceptible of both a defamatory and nondefamatory meaning, a question of fact exists for the jury. <em>Id. </em>See <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Suburban Restaurants, Inc., </em>374 Mass. 528, 530 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The plaintiff argues that the repetition of Shamshak\u2019s allegations was false and defamatory. An imputation of crime is defamatory per se. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., 361 </em>Mass. 849, 853 (1975). <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Lyons, </em>303 Mass. 116, 118-119 (1939). Absent a privilege, \u201cthe republisher of a defamatory statement \u2018is subject to liability as if he had originally published it.\u2019\u201d <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>Daily Hampshire Gazette, </em>395 Mass. 32, 36 (1985), quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 578 (1977). See generally W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, Torts \u00a7 112, at 789 (5th ed. 1984); R. Sack, Libel, Slander, and Related Problems \u00a7 II.6.1. (1980); L. Eldredge, Defamation \u00a7 44a at 232 (1978). Liability for a defamatory statement may not be avoided \u201cmerely [by] adding a truthful preface that someone else has so stated.\u201d <em>Ricci </em>v. <em>Venture Magazine, Inc., </em>574 F. Supp. 1563, 1572 (D. Mass. 1983). See <em>Maloof </em>v. <em>Post Publishing Co., </em>306 Mass. 279, 280 (1940). The defendants do not contend that Jones committed the murders to which Shamshak referred. Thus, the defendants\u2019 repetition of Sham-shak\u2019s accusations, not shown to be true, was defamatory as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The plaintiff also argues that the broadcasts in question were false and defamatory independently of Shamshak\u2019s accusations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff\u2019s claims can be separated into two categories: (1) that Taibbi and Channel 5 made untrue assertions of fact during the broadcasts,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and (2) used certain cinematic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>techniques or made editorial decisions which either implied the probable guilt of Jones, or indorsed, espoused, or otherwise concurred in Shamshak\u2019s accusations against Jones.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">a. <em>Untrue assertions of fact. </em>As a basis for his claim, the plaintiff first relies on a statement that he had been charged with two counts of murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We conclude below that this statement is privileged. See <em>Williams </em>v. <em>WCAU-TV, </em>555 F. Supp. 198 (E.D. Pa. 1983). The plaintiff also bases his claim on the contention that the report falsely stated that Shamshak had passed four separate polygraph tests. We conclude, however, that the statement was essentially true. See <em>infra </em>at 800. Finally, the plaintiff argues that the description of him as Shamshak\u2019s \u201clifelong\u201d or \u201cboyhood\u201d friend was false and defamatory.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The description of someone as a friend (or even relative) of a criminal ordinarily is not in itself defamatory. See <em>Bufalino </em>v. <em>Associated Press, supra </em>(statement that one has a family relationship with mafia not ordinarily actionable). Even if we assume, however, that the statement was susceptible of a defamatory meaning, we conclude that the defendant has failed to establish the requisite degree of fault necessary to impose liability for that statement. <em>Infra </em>at 800.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">The plaintiff also refers to statements made by Bergin during the course of a news conference. The statements by Bergin do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>not imply anything about the plaintiff or the veracity of Sham-shak\u2019s allegations, and we conclude that they cannot be considered defamatory as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">b. <em>Indorsement ofShamshak\u2019s charges. </em>With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s \u201cindorsement\u201d theory, we conclude that the broadcasts are not susceptible of the interpretation placed upon them by the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">c. <em>Truth as a defense. </em>The defendants argue that the broadcasts were substantially true and accurate accounts of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest and detention within the context of an arrest and investigation by Massachusetts State police officials and the LAPD. However, the defendants cannot escape liability merely by attributing defamatory statements or actions to a third party. It is the truth of the underlying defamation that must be shown in order to establish the defense of truth. <em>Lal </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., supra. </em>See <em>Maloof v. Post Publishing Co., supra. </em>Eldredge, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 67. Since the defendants do not contend that the plaintiff committed the multiple murders as alleged by Shamshak, the reports cannot be considered substantially true. See <em>Lal </em>v. <em>CBS, Inc., supra </em>at 361. <em>Rouch </em>v. <em>Enquirer &amp; News, </em>137 Mich. App. 39, 43 n.2 (1984), aff\u2019d, 427 Mich. 157 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">2. <em>Privilege. </em>There are, however, various recognized privileges permitting the publication of fair reports of certain proceedings even when the accounts contain defamatory statements. <em>Medico </em>v. <em>Time, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 134, 137 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 836 (1981). There is a well established privilege to publish reports of judicial, legislative, or other official proceedings. See <em>Cowley </em>v. <em>Pulsifer, </em>137 Mass. 392, 393-394 (1884); <em>Barrows </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>7 Gray 301, 311-312 (1856); <em>Coffin </em>v. <em>Coffin, 4 </em>Mass. 1, 32-33 (1808). See generally S. Metcalf, Rights and Liabilities of Publishers, Broadcasters and Reporters \u00a7 1.78 (1986), and cases cited therein. The common law fair report privilege is embodied in the Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 (1977).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The defendants argue that, even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>if the broadcasts in question are not substantially true, they are protected under this privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">As that privilege is commonly applied, it clearly affords protection to the defendants against one of the plaintiff s claims. For example, \u201c[t]he publication of the fact that one has been arrested, and upon what accusation, is not actionable, if true.\u201d <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., </em>279 Mass. 176, 188 (1932), quoting <em>Commercial Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>149 F. 704, 706 (6th Cir. 1907). The reporting and broadcast of the plaintiffs arrest is therefore clearly privileged. The newscaster\u2019s statement that the plaintiff had been charged with murder is not so clearly protected. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania has applied the privilege in a case similar to the facts of the instant case. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>WCAU-TV, supra </em>at 203-204. During a news report of a bank robbery, the plaintiff in <em>Williams </em>was filmed while under arrest, in handcuffs, being led by police officers to a police van. The audio portion of the broadcast stated that another suspect had earlier been taken into custody, and that both men \u201c[would] be charged with the bank robbery.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203. The plaintiff was released shortly after his arrest and never was charged with the robbery. The court, however, concluded that the report was not rendered substantially inaccurate by the inclusion of the statement which, together with the accompanying film, implied that the plaintiff would be charged with the bank robbery, and held the broadcast to be privileged as a substantially accurate report of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest. <em>Id. </em>at 204. We conclude that similar reasoning applies here, and that the report of the plaintiff\u2019s arrest did not become substantially inaccurate merely because the report incorrectly stated that the plaintiff had been charged with murder. Over the course of several days of reporting the plaintiff\u2019s arrest, only once was it incorrectly reported that the plaintiff had been charged with a crime, and Taibbi\u2019s reports provided an accurate account of the plaintiff\u2019s status at all times. Although the plaintiff was not actually charged, the impact of that statement did not create a substantially greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>defamatory sting than an accurate report that the plaintiff had only been booked on suspicion of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-5\">We consider the remaining portions of the broadcast which form the basis of the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claim to determine whether they fall within the ambit of the official proceedings privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">In its discussion of this privilege, the Restatement explains that: \u201cAn arrest by an officer is an official action, and a report of the fact of the arrest or of the charge of crime made by the officer in making or returning the arrest is therefore within the conditional privilege covered by this Section. On the other hand statements made by the police or by the complainant or other witnesses or by the prosecuting attorney as to the facts of the case or the evidence expected to be given are not yet part of the judicial proceeding or of the arrest itself and are not privileged under this Section.\u201d Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 611 comment h (1977). Accordingly, \u201c[tjhere is also no privilege to report the unofficial talk of such officials as policemen, as distinct from their official utterances or acts, such as an arrest\u201d (footnotes omitted). W. Prosser &amp; W. Keeton, <em>supra </em>at 836. <em>Phillips </em>v. <em>Evening Star Newspaper Co., </em>424 A.2d 78, 89 (D.C. 1980) (reliance on unofficial police \u201chot line\u201d not privileged).</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">We conclude that unofficial statements made by police sources are outside the scope of the fair report privilege. See <em>id.; Bufalino </em>v. <em>Associated Press, </em>692 F.2d 266, 272 (2d Cir. 1982) (\u201cOnly reports of <em>official </em>statements or records made or released by a public agency are protected by the \u00a7 611 privilege\u201d [emphasis in original]). Cf. <em>Patterson </em>v. <em>Tribune Co., </em>3 Fla. Supp. 2d 107 (Fla. Cir. Ct. 1983), appeal dismissed, 446 So.2d 111 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1984) (newspaper report on complaint filed with sheriff\u2019s office, based on information supplied by that office at an official briefing, was privileged); <em>Sbarbati </em>v. <em>New York Post, </em>10 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 2190 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984) (press conference by district attorney announcing a criminal investigation); <em>Steer </em>v. <em>Lexleon, Inc., </em>58 Md. App. 199 (1984) (publication of erroneous police department press release of arrest). Cf. <em>Molnar </em>v. <em>Star-Ledger, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>193 N.J. Super. 12, 15-16, 21 (1984) (publication of erroneous information from deputy fire chief that plaintiff landlord had refused to take a lie detector test regarding fire at his property is protected by qualified privilege to report statements made by a public official with respect to matters within the scope of his official responsibilities); <em>Ingenere </em>v. <em>ABC, </em>11 Media L. Rep. (BNA) 1227 (D. Mass. 1984) (television broadcast privileged when it relied upon investigative memoranda and letters from the General Services Administration which were not available to the public). Thus, the statements of Shamshak\u2019s mother and sister were not privileged and must be considered under the standards discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">With respect to Taibbi\u2019s republication of Shamshak\u2019s allegations, it appears from an Associated Press report contained in the record, that at a press conference held by the LAPD after the arrest of Jones, Los Angeles Police Chief Gates outlined the substance of Shamshak\u2019s allegations against Jones. Therefore, the defendants may be entitled to rely on Gates\u2019s description of Shamshak\u2019s allegations as privileged. Should it be demonstrated that Shamshak\u2019s allegations were made public as part of an official statement by the LAPD, the defendants would be privileged to report that statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">3. <em>Standard of liability. </em>In order to impose liability for the publication of unprivileged, false, and defamatory statements, the plaintiff must demonstrate some degree of fault on the part of the publisher. <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., </em>418 U.S. 323, 347 (1974). Public officials and public figures may recover for publication of a defamatory falsehood upon proof of actual malice. <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 283 (1964). With respect to private persons, however, liability may be imposed upon proof of negligent publication of a defamatory falsehood. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass. 849, 858 (1975). In all cases, a \u201cplaintiff\u2019s recovery is limited to actual damages which are compensatory for the wrong done by the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 860.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">The defendants argue that the plaintiff\u2019s status is that of a limited issue public figure, and, therefore, that he must meet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>the actual malice standard. The Court in <em>Gertz </em>identified a limited issue public figure as one who \u201cvoluntarily injects himself or is drawn into a particular public controversy and thereby becomes a public figure for a limited range of issues,\u201d and consequently has achieved \u201cspecial prominence in the resolution of public questions.\u201d <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra </em>at 351. In determining the plaintiff\u2019s status as a limited issue public figure, this court must look \u201cto the nature and extent of an individual\u2019s participation in the particular controversy giving rise to the defamation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 352. See <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire, </em>443 U.S. 111, 134-136 (1979); <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>443 U.S. 157, 166-169 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Even if we assume that the serial murders which lead to the plaintiff\u2019s arrest constitute a \u201cpublic controversy,\u201d see <em>Schultz </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, </em>468 F. Supp. 551, 558 (E.D. Mich. 1979) (disappearance of James R. Hoffa recognized as public controversy), \u201c[a] private individual is not automatically transformed into a public figure just by becoming involved in or associated with a matter that attracts public attention.\u201d <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 167. S. Metcalf, Rights and Liabilities of Publishers, Broadcasters and Reporters, \u00a7 162 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">The United States Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of a plaintiff\u2019s limited public figure status in <em>Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>is instructive. In <em>Wolston, </em>the Court was required to determine whether the plaintiff, the nephew of admitted Soviet spies, became a limited purpose public figure by virtue of his failure to appear during a 1957-1958 grand jury investigation of Soviet intelligence activities in the United States, and his subsequent citation for contempt. The Court found that the plaintiff had neither \u201cvoluntarily thrust\u201d nor \u201cinjected\u201d himself into any public controversy, but rather had been \u201cdragged unwillingly\u201d into the investigation, and that he played \u201conly a minor role\u201d and \u201climited his involvement to that necessary to defend himself against the contempt charge\u201d; and concluded that he was not a \u201climited-purpose public figure\u201d within the meaning of <em>Gertz. Wolston </em>v. <em>Reader\u2019s Digest Ass\u2019n, supra </em>at 161, 166-167. Here, it is fair to conclude that the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>was \u201cdragged unwillingly\u201d into the investigation of the Hillside stranglings, rather than having \u201cvoluntarily thrust\u201d or \u201cinjected\u201d himself into the proceedings. <em>Wolston, supra </em>at 166. Therefore, we perceive no conduct on the part of the plaintiff which would cause him to be considered a limited-purpose public figure.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">The defendants argue that the plaintiff became an involuntary public figure. \u201cHypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, but the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare.\u201d <em>Gertz </em>v. <em>Robert Welch, Inc., supra </em>at 345. Wolston, <em>supra </em>at 166, and <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Proxmire, supra </em>at 135, emphasize that a significant aspect in the determination of a plaintiff\u2019s public figure status is the plaintiff\u2019s voluntary participation in a particular controversy. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit recently has reiterated the Supreme Court\u2019s recognition in <em>Gertz </em>that involuntary public figures will be \u201cfew and far between.\u201d <em>Dameron </em>v. <em>Washington Magazine, Inc., </em>779 F.2d 736, 743 (D.C. Cir. 1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1141 (1986). Although the <em>Dameron </em>court held the plaintiff to be an involuntary, limited purpose public figure, <em>id. </em>at 741, the nature of the plaintiff\u2019s public sector employment, which caused him to be a primary actor in a matter of public concern, was a determining factor. We conclude that, on the facts of this case, <em>Gertz </em>and its progeny compel a conclusion that the plaintiff is not a public figure, and thus retains his status as a private person.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Given our conclusion that the plaintiff is a private person for the purposes of this action, he need prove only the negligent publication of a defamatory falsehood to recover from the defendants for actual damages. <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., </em>367 Mass, at 858. \u201cUnder the negligence standard adopted in <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Essex County Newspapers, Inc., supra, </em>the defendants are required to act \u2018reasonably in checking on the truth or falsity ... of the communication before publishing it. \u2019 \u201d <em>Appleby </em>v. <em>Daily Hampshire Gazette, </em>395 Mass, at 36, quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 580B comment g (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">Applying this standard to the conduct of Channel 5 and Taibbi, we conclude that a jury could find that Channel 5 and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>Taibbi acted negligently in publishing their reports of Sham-shak\u2019s allegations. Cf. <em>King </em>v. <em>Globe Newspaper Co., ante </em>705, 709 (1987) (where reporter \u201chad obvious reasons to doubt the veracity and accuracy\u201d not of source, but of source\u2019s undisclosed informant, evidence would warrant jury finding of actual malice). Sufficient facts existed to permit the jury to find that the defendants had or should have had reasonable doubt as to the truth of Shamshak\u2019s allegations. For example, Taibbi was aware, from information obtained from a former Boston police officer, that Shamshak had not proved to be a reliable informant in the past. More importantly, Taibbi himself recognized certain inconsistencies in Shamshak\u2019s story, reporting that \u201coften, on crucial points, he\u2019s been way off the mark.\u201d Therefore, if it is determined that the republication of Shamshak\u2019s allegations was not privileged, it is for the jury to determine whether Taibbi\u2019s decision to broadcast the allegation that Shamshak had seen Jones murder at least two, and perhaps three, women in the back of a van, was reasonable under the circumstances. The same determination must also be applied to the comments of the members of Shamshak\u2019s family concerning the veracity of Shamshak\u2019s story.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">However, concerning the statements that Shamshak had passed four separate polygraph tests and that Shamshak was a \u201cboyhood pal\u201d of the plaintiff, we conclude that summary judgment was correctly granted. Although the Massachusetts State police officer who interviewed Shamshak and procured the polygraph tests stated in his affidavit that Shamshak had passed two <em>sets </em>of polygraph tests, the record makes clear that at least one set comprised \u201cfour different tests,\u201d and we conclude that the report was not inaccurate as a matter of law. It is also true that Shamshak and the plaintiff were acquainted for some indefinite time, and it is doubtful that liability would arise merely from the characterization of the relationship complained of by the plaintiff. In addition, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the sources of these statements were unreliable, and, as to these statements, we perceive no evidence of conduct on the part of the defendants which could be considered negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>II. <em>Invasion of Privacy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s remaining claim against Taibbi and Channel 5, and his sole claim against ABC, is for invasion of his \u201cright against unreasonable, substantial or serious interference with his privacy.\u201d G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">The plaintiff asserts that the ABC reports of his arrest invaded his privacy in two respects. He claims that the film of his arrest (1) \u201cgave unreasonable publicity to a private fact,\u201d and (2) \u201cconveyed the false light impression that sufficient credible evidence inculpating Jones, amounting to probable cause, existed to warrant the extraordinary action of taking Jones into custody.\u201d We view these assertions to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">The plaintiff\u2019s claim based on the disclosure of a \u201cprivate fact\u201d must fail because ABC has disclosed no private fact. The theory that the plaintiff\u2019s arrest was a private affair is without merit. A person\u2019s arrest must be recorded by the police, and that record is public information. Moreover, the public has a right to be informed about matters in which it has a legitimate concern. See, e.g., <em>Attorney Gen. </em>v. <em>Collector of Lynn, </em>377 Mass. 151, 156 (1979) (when \u201cpublic interest in obtaining information substantially outweighs the seriousness of any invasion of privacy, the private interest in preventing disclosure must yield to the public interest\u201d). Where the information concerning a plaintiff is already public, a defendant is not liable merely for giving further publicity to that information. Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 652D comment b (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">The plaintiff argues that ABC\u2019s broadcast of his arrest cast him in a \u201cfalse light\u201d and constituted an invasion of privacy under G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B. We need not address the issue whether G. L. c. 214, \u00a7 1B, encompasses a false light claim for invasion of privacy.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We note only that (1) the impression created by the report was not false, as alleged by the plaintiff, and (2) nothing in ABC\u2019s broadcasts involved a distortion or high degree of offensiveness in the portrayal of the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>arrest sufficient to constitute false light invasion of privacy. See generally Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 652E.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Although the plaintiff also raises an invasion of privacy claim against Taibbi and Channel 5, that portion of the plaintiff\u2019s argument does not rise to the level required to merit our consideration of the issue. Mass. R. A. P. 16 (a) (4), as amended, 367 Mass. 919 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">ill. <em>Conclusion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the publication of the statements of Shamshak\u2019s family, to the effect that he (Shamshak) was telling the truth and therefore, inferentially, that Jones was the Hillside strangler, was not privileged. Therefore, it is for a jury to determine whether the defendants\u2019 decision to broadcast those statements was reasonable under the circumstances. With respect to the plaintiff\u2019s claim regarding the republication of Shamshak\u2019s allegations, as we have stated above, the republication of Shamshak\u2019s allegations would be privileged if made public as part of an official statement by the LAPD. The burden is on the defendants to prove, when the issue is properly raised, the existence of a privilege to publish a defamatory communication. <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>National Semiconductor Corp., </em>18 Mass. App. Ct. 132, 134 (1984). Restatement (Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 613(2). The defendants have made no showing that Shamshak\u2019s allegations were made public during an official proceeding as required by the privilege. The mere fact that the statements to the press after Jones\u2019s arrest concerning Shamshak\u2019s allegations were made by the Los Angeles police chief is insufficient to establish that those allegations were privileged. We conclude that, for the purposes of summary judgment, the defendants have failed to satisfy their burden of proof on this issue. Therefore, on remand, the trial court shall determine whether Shamshak\u2019s allegations were made public as part of an official statement by the LAPD. If the republication of Shamshak\u2019s allegations is not privileged, it is also for a jury to determine whether the defendants\u2019 decision to broadcast the allegations was reasonable. Summary judgment was properly granted with respect to the remainder of the plaintiff\u2019s defamation claims. Summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>judgment was also properly granted with respect to the plaintiff\u2019s invasion of privacy claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">The case is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\"> Under California law, when a person is taken into police custody without a warrant and later released with no formal charges listed against him, \u201c[(\u00a1hereafter, such arrest shall not be deemed an arrest, but a detention only.\u201d Cal. Penal Code \u00a7 849(c) (Deering 1985). However, in his complaint, answers to interrogatories, and in his brief to this court, the plaintiff categorizes his detention as an arrest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> The original complaint, which was brought against several additional defendants, including another journalist and a State police officer,' sought damages for alleged violations of Jones\u2019s right to privacy and his civil rights, for defamation and for false imprisonment. The case was removed to the United States District Court, which dismissed the Federal civil rights claim. <em>Jones </em>v. <em>Taibbi, </em>508 F. Supp. 1069 (D. Mass. 1981). The plaintiff thereupon dismissed or dropped the claims against the other defendants. An amended complaint was subsequently filed in the Superior Court against Taibbi, Channel 5, and the American Broadcasting Companies, Inc.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b806-6\"> The plaintiff does not raise any issue as to these statements on appeal, and, therefore, we need not consider them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> The plaintiff does not contend that the statements by Gates are defamatory, and therefore we do not consider them.

We need address only the first three assertions. The contention that Jones was not \u201carrested\u201d is contradicted by Jones himself. He characterizes the event as an arrest in his answers to interrogatories and brief to this court.

The record is unclear as to whether Shamshak\u2019s allegations were disclosed in official statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> While the scope of \u00a7 611 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as to what statements are official statements is not clearly defined, see <em>Cianci </em>v. <em>New Times Publishing </em>Co., 639 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>F.2d 54, 70 (2d Cir. 1980), the developing law appears to be that statements made at a press conference by law enforcement officials relating to an arrest and the investigations forming the basis of the arrest should be considered official statements and therefore should fall within the fair report privilege. <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>Younger, </em>30 Cal. 3d 770, 776-777 (1982). See <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Guam Publications, Inc., </em>643 F.2d 615, 617 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 454 U.S. 940 (1981) (privilege applies to republication of information appearing in police bulletin); <em>Mathis </em>v. <em>Philadelphia Newspapers, Inc., </em>455 F.

See also <em>Kilgore </em>v. <em>Koen, </em>133 Or. 1, 12 (1930) (privilege applies to republication of statements made by police). Cf. <em>Yerkie </em>v. <em>Post-Newsweek Stations, Michigan, Inc., </em>470 F. Supp. 91, 94 (D.

While this court has not determined what statements constitute official statements, in an analogous situation, the court said that a newspaper is not liable for republishing stories from reputable wire services. <em>See Appleby </em>v. <em>Daily Hampshire Gazette, </em>395 Mass. 32, 37-38 (1985). The same reasoning may apply to republishing public statements by the police. The court correctly leaves that issue open.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Last, assuming the statements do not fall under the privilege of \u00a7 611, the statements may be protected under Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"805\">*805</page-number>(Second) of Torts, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 612. That section provides in relevant part: \u201c(1) one who provides a means of publication of defamatory matter published by another is privileged to do so if. . . the person providing the means of publication reasonably believes that the other is privileged to publish it.\u201d Although statements may be privileged under this section, there would be a factual issue to be resolved by the fact finder as to whether the republisher \u201creasonably\u201d believed that the person providing the information initially was privileged to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"Apa\">A court\u2019s obligation is to \u201c \u2018make an independent examination of the whole record\u2019 in order to make sure that \u2018the judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field of free expression. \u2019 \u201d <em>Bose Corp </em>v. <em>Consumers Union of U.S., Inc., </em>466 U.S. 485, 499 (1984), quoting <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U.S. 254, 285 (1964). The court, however, may not supply missing facts in an effort to fulfil its obligation. The task of supplying the needed facts is for the parties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b819-9\"> In his brief, the plaintiff asserts that \u201c[t]he exclusive Shamshak family interview, filmed before [the plaintiff\u2019s] detention, containing the answers of family members to Taibbi\u2019s leading questions, and Taibbi\u2019s comments, is an obvious [(Indorsement of Shamshak\u2019s veracity, and therefore of his defamatory accusations.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s indorsement theory is not valid in this case, and the court so states. See <em>ante </em>at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-10\">The court also states, <em>ante </em>at 790 n.5, that the plaintiff argues that Taibbi\u2019s questions during the course of the interview with Gates constituted an indorsement of Shamshak\u2019s allegations. Again, the indorsement theory is not valid in this case and therefore liability may not be imposed on that basis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b819-11\"> An Associated Press report contained in the record indicates that Police Chief Gates held a press conference and disclosed the substance of Shamshak\u2019s allegations. The record, however, does not disclose the source of the defendants\u2019 information. Therefore, the issue whether the allegations were part of the official statements of the police department must be left open.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b821-6\"> There may be no factual dispute as to the source of the defendants\u2019 information. If the facts are not in dispute and if the defendants file a new motion for summary judgment, the judge again should consider whether those statements fall within the fair report privilege as a matter of law. Although the court has not yet followed the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Celotex Corp. </em>v. <em>Catrett, 477 </em>U.S. 317 (1986) and <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Liberty Lobby, </em>Inc., <em>477 </em>U.S. 242 (1986), I believe that, in ruling on the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment, the judge should follow those cases and place on the plaintiff a somewhat greater burden because the plaintiff has the burden of proof on the issue of fault and opposes the motion.
