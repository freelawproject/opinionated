(applicant), which seeks to construct a shopping mall on a site known as Sweeden\u2019s Swamp in Attleboro, and the Department of Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE), which reviewed and approved the applicant\u2019s plans pursuant to the Wetlands Protection Act (WPA), G. L. c. 131, \u00a740.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The applicant appeals from an order by a judge of the Superior Court, which nullified DEQE\u2019s approval and remanded the matter to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>agency for further review. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1) (1984 ed.). We reverse the judge\u2019s order and affirm the ruling by DEQE.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Efforts to build on Sweeden\u2019s Swamp began in February, 1979, when a developer known as Mugar Group, Inc./Federated Stores Realty, Inc. (Mugar), filed an environmental notice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>form with the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs (EOEA). See Massachusetts Environmental Policy Act (MEPA), G. L. c. 30, \u00a7\u00a7 61-62H (1984 ed.). In March, Mugar filed with the conservation commission of the city of Attleboro (ACC) a notice of intent to alter wetlands pursuant to the WPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After a public hearing, the ACC authorized construction of Mugar\u2019s project in May, 1979.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> A group of ten Attleboro residents then invoked their statutory right to have the commission\u2019s action reviewed by DEQE. Later, ownership of the proposed project was transferred from Mugar to Attleboro Mall, Inc., then an affiliate of the Edward J. DeBartolo Corporation (DeBartolo). On April 21, 1982, DEQE\u2019s southeast regional office<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> issued a superseding order which determined that \u201c [bjecause of irreparable harm to several interests of the [WPA] the project as proposed is denied.\u201d DeBartolo appealed to DEQE\u2019s central office in Boston, claiming its right to a formal adjudicatory hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">Formal hearings were not held, however, until more than two years had passed. In the interim, in April of 1983, DEQE adopted new regulations (1983 regulations) applicable to the use of \u201cbordering vegetated wetlands,\u201d one of the kinds of land the applicant proposed to develop at Sweeden\u2019s Swamp. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.55 (2) (1983) (definition of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>bordering vegetated wetlands). In place of the regulations promulgated in 1978, which had permitted review of such wetlands proposals on a case-by-case basis, DEQE put in force what amounts to a per se rule; with exceptions not relevant here, the new rule prohibits approval of any proposal which results in the loss of more than 5,000 square feet of bordering vegetated wetlands. See 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 10.55 (3) and (4) (a)-(b) (1983) (prohibitions); 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.55 (4) (c) (1983) (exception).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">In DEQE\u2019s preface to its 1983 regulations, it is stated that \u201cthe interests of the [WPA] cannot be protected other than by leaving the existing wetland plant community intact.\u201d This is so because \u201cwhile engineering solutions can protect the statutory interests at stake in most projects located in or near [some kinds of freshwater wetlands], this is not the case with bordering freshwater wetlands. The complex natural functioning of these wetlands cannot be replicated, and no amount of engineering will enable such areas to be filled or substantially altered without seriously impairing the statutory interests they serve.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b678-6\">According to the 1983 regulations themselves, however, the per se rule contained in \u00a7\u00a7 10.55 (3) and (4) was to \u201ctake effect on April 1, 1983,\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.10 (1), and projects already in the regulatory pipeline were to be \u201cgrandfathered\u201d by force of provisions barring application of the new rules \u201cto any Notice of Intent filed prior to the effective date [April 1, 1983].\u201d <em>Id. </em>This grandfather clause guaranteed that \u201c [a]ll proceedings and actions commenced under the Act prior to the effective date\u201d would go forward to the case-by-case review authorized \u201cunder the prior applicable regulations [the 1978 rules].\u201d 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.10 (3) (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b679-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>In December, 1983, DeBartolo conveyed the stock of Attleboro Mall, Inc., to the Newport Galleria Group, an affiliate of the Pyramid Companies of Syracuse, New York (Pyramid);<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and Pyramid (hereafter, applicant) decided to proceed with the adjudicatory hearing originally sought by DeBartolo.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In May, 1984, it submitted revised plans for development of the mall at Sweeden\u2019s Swamp. The changes made were designed primarily to mitigate the adverse impact of the project with respect to the interests protected by the WPA.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b680-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>On June 22, 1984, DEQE issued a superseding order of conditions in draft form which approved the project as revised. On August 8, 1984, the adjudicatory hearing commenced. Over fourteen days of hearings, the hearing officer considered expert testimony and documentary evidence relevant to the impact of the redesigned project on the following statutory interests: ground water protection, prevention of pollution, protection of drinking water, storm damage prevention, flood control, and protection of fisheries. While the hearings progressed, the applicant responded to criticisms by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts by proposing alterations to its plans.</p>\n<p id=\"b680-5\">On January 28, 1985, the hearing officer issued a tentative decision, concluding that \u201c [t]he overall concept of this development is consistent with the protection of the interests of the Wetlands Protection Act.\u201d The hearing officer found that, while 70% of the water entering this 49.6 acre wetland now \u201cleaves the site untreated\u201d because it passes through by way of three major channels without making contact with the vegetation,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> the applicant\u2019s plan would direct 100% of the entering water into contact with an artificially created 26.3 acre wetland whose herbaceous plants would be at least as efficient at filtration as the existing red maple swamp, and probably more so. In effect, the project as planned would replace a relatively large but inefficient wetland with one smaller in size but \u201cmore valuable . . . from a pollution attenuation point of view.\u201d Because he concluded that the techniques for creating herbaceous wetlands were tested and reliable, he found that \u201cthe applicant\u2019s plan with regard to wetlands replication is feasible and satisfies the interests of the [A]ct with regard to pollution control.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b680-6\">The hearing officer found that the current suitability of the aquifer for drinking wells was slight, but relevant. Although he found that \u201cuse of the proposed parking area will contribute to pollution loading . . . and decrease the overall ability of the project to prevent pollution,\u201d he concluded that the project\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>\u201cmall pad\u201d feature \u201cwill prevent contaminants from entering the groundwater from the parking lot\u201d and that its design is \u201csufficient to protect the [statutory interests] in protection of ground water and drinking water, in addition to having a pollution attenuation function.\u201d Concerning the related statutory interests in prevention of flooding and storm damage prevention, he found that \u201cno increased flooding will occur on site or off site during a worst case Type II48 hour 100 year intensity storm, and there will be no increase in peak flow from the site in its developed condition.\u201d Concerning the statutory interest in protection of fisheries, the hearing officer found that, despite the regional office\u2019s finding of significant fisheries interests at Sweeden\u2019s Swamp, subsequent inquiries showed \u201cno significant fisheries on site\u201d nor downstream at Seven Mile River; and that the proposal will have, \u201cif anything, a positive impact on fisheries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-5\">The hearing officer added to the order of conditions a requirement that the mail\u2019s environmental function be monitored for at least five years following construction. He also recommended that DEQE retain \u201cjurisdiction to order whatever remedial actions are necessary including measures to limit pollution loading of the wetland and the construction of water treatment facilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b681-6\">On March 13, 1985, the commissioner issued his final decision and order of conditions by which he adopted the hearing officer\u2019s decision and approved the applicant\u2019s revised plans. In response to the plaintiffs\u2019 principal legal objection, that the applicant\u2019s plans were so altered as to \u201cconstitute a new filing\u201d and therefore to require de nova review by the filing of a new notice of intent with the ACC, the commissioner found that (a) remand to the local body would be pointless because the ACC had never sought remand after approving a plan which would have filled \u201call 50 acres\u201d of the wetlands at issue, and (b) the plaintiffs sought a refiling of the case only to place its review under the new regulations which would prohibit wetland alterations of the size and scope contemplated here. While agreeing with MACC that \u201cpublic comment on wetlands projects is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>important,\u201d the commissioner saw no need for more public participation than the review process had already afforded. He characterized the revisions as \u201cchanges imposed by the Department,\u201d and stated that his staff knew of no case in which such changes had caused DEQE to require refiling.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-5\">As to the apparent inconsistency between the approval of the applicant\u2019s revised plans and the preface to DEQE\u2019s 1983 regulations, the commissioner observed that the per se rule in the 1983 regulations was reasonable because it served a purpose \u201cto standardize decisions.\u201d In his view, a change of approach by DEQE was \u201cespecially important in the administration of the wetlands program, in which there are 351 different administering agencies \u2014 the city and town conservation commissions.\u201d The commissioner concluded, however, that \u201c[i]t is not inconsistent for the Department to believe that as a general rule the filling of more than 5,000 square feet of bordering wetland will not protect the interests of the act and at the same time approve the filling of much more than 5,000 square feet when forced to apply the case by case method of analysis\u201d to the \u201cunusual\u201d facts before it. The commissioner concluded that DEQE\u2019s promulgation and application of the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d was not at odds with the department\u2019s policy as stated in the preface to the 1983 regulations. Finally, the commissioner addressed an alleged contradiction between his decision and DEQE\u2019s own statement in the 1983 preface \u201cthat the functions served by bordering vegetated wetlands cannot be replicated in their totality by engineering means.\u201d He found that there was no contradiction in light of testimony from the director of DEQE\u2019s wetlands programs who had supervised preparation of the preface. In the director\u2019s opinion, the applicant\u2019s plan to create a substitute wetland relied not on \u201can engineering solution to replace the pollution attenuation and fisheries values of the existing wetland, but rather [on] a biological solution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b682-6\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Superior Court in Suffolk County pursuant to G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1). The judge issued his ruling on September 25, 1986. He found that the new plans contained \u201csignificant changes,\u201d see note 10, <em>supra, </em>but he neither explained the nature of their significance to the statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>interests, nor did he find that DEQE had erred by not requiring the applicant to file a new notice of intent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> He did rule, however, that \u201cthe interests of the [WPA] cannot be protected other than by leaving the existing wetlands plant community intact,\u201d and that it was \u201cerror of law for DEQE to have grandfathered the new owners into the 1978 regulations, as they [sic] are diametrically opposed to the mandates of the 1983 regulations.\u201d It is from this decision that the applicant appeals, arguing that the Superior Court judge erred in holding as matter of law that DEQE was obliged to apply the requirements of its 1983 regulations retroactively. Because the plaintiffs argue that DEQE\u2019s decision cannot stand even if the judge erred, we shall discuss the merits of the judge\u2019s decision first; then we will analyze the plaintiffs\u2019 remaining concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">1. <em>The decision in the Superior Court. </em>The applicant argues, too broadly we think, that the judge erred when requiring retroactive application of new rules because, in its view, an agency is always entitled to limit new regulations to prospective application if, <em>in the agency\u2019s judgment, </em>retroactive application would be unfair to parties who have invested time and money, or otherwise altered their positions in reliance on the continuing applicability of old regulations. In support of this proposition, the applicant has cited numerous decisions in which Federal courts have upheld \u201cgrandfather clauses\u201d as serving governmental purposes \u201clegitimate\u201d enough to withstand challenge under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. See <em>Minnesota </em>v. <em>Clover Leaf Creamery Co., </em>449 U.S. 456, 467-468 (1981); <em>New Orleans </em>v. <em>Dukes, 427 </em>U.S. 297, 303-306 (1976); <em>Sklar </em>v. <em>Byrne, </em>727 F.2d 633, 640-642 (7th Cir. 1984); <em>Trafelet v. Thompson, </em>594 F.2d 623, 631 &amp; n. 11 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 906 (1979). The judge, in his ruling, appears also to have relied on Federal case law. The judge stated, \u201cIn deciding the retroactive effect of newly adopted administrative rules, [rejviewing courts must look to the standard established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>Supreme Court in <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 203 (1947).\u201d Additionally, the judge relied primarily on the tests set forth in <em>Sierra Club </em>v. <em>EPA, </em>719 F.2d 436, 467-468 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied sub nom. <em>Alabama Power Co. </em>v. <em>Sierra Club, </em>468 U.S. 1204 (1984).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In our view, since neither Federal constitutional nor statutory issues are involved on the facts of this case, the proper standard of judicial review is to be drawn from State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">The relevant question here is whether the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d in the 1983 regulations violates the statutory mandate of DEQE as set forth in G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40. We have held that courts should \u201cnot hesitate to overrule agency interpretations . . . [when they] are arbitrary, unreasonable or inconsistent with the plain terms of the [empowering statute].\u201d <em>Finkel-stein </em>v. <em>Board of Registration in Optometry, </em>370 Mass. 476, 478 (1976). Reliance interests are among the factors that agencies properly may consider when promulgating or applying rules in the context of the agency\u2019s statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">When the judge ruled that DEQE erred as matter of law in grandfathering the applicant\u2019s project, he effectively substituted his own judgment, that grandfathering is \u201cdiametrically opposed to the mandates of the 1983 regulations\u201d and the statutory mandate, for DEQE\u2019s determination to the contrary. The propriety of that substitution, of judicial judgment for administrative determination, is doubtful. \u201cWe give substantial deference to the construction placed on a statute ... by the agency charged with its administration,\u201d <em>Manning </em>v. <em>Boston </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>Redevelopment Auth., ante </em>444, 453 (1987); and deference is especially appropriate where the Legislature \u201chas seen fit to delegate broad rulemaking authority to the [agency].\u201d <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>v. <em>SEC, </em>606 F.2d 1031, 1050 (D.C. Cir. 1979). Accord <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 208 (1947) (where statutory grant of substantive administrative discretion is broad, reversal of agency\u2019s judgment is warranted only when abuse of discretion is \u201cplain\u201d). As we have noted in another context, \u201c [i]t is significant that [the WPA] is entirely \u2018procedural\u2019 in that it [only] prescribes the steps to be taken before any dredging or landfill activities may be conducted in certain wetland areas.\u201d <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Port Auth., </em>364 Mass. 639, 647-648 n.10 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">The Act \u201cdoes not lay down absolute use prohibitions.\u201d <em>Coons </em>v. <em>Carstensen, </em>15 Mass. App. Ct. 431, 435 (1983). It vests in DEQE precisely that \u201cbroad authority to effectuate [its] purposes\u201d which commands judicial deference. <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Board of Registration &amp; Discipline in Medicine, </em>378 Mass. 519, 524 (1979). Where deference of this kind is due, a reviewing court must treat DEQE\u2019s regulations, including 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7\u00a7 10.10 (1) and (3) (the grandfather clause), as presumptively rational \u201cand not declare [them] void unless [their] provisions cannot by any reasonable construction be interpreted in harmony with the legislative mandate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 525, quoting <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 855 (1977). \u201c[N]o more need be discerned than some rational relation between the regulation and the empowering statute.\u201d <em>White Dove, Inc. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Marine Fisheries, </em>380 Mass. 471, 477 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In this case, the range of potentially rational regulations is quite broad because the WPA requires no more of DEQE than that it \u201cimpose such conditions [on landfill projects affecting wetlands] as will contribute to the protection of the interests described ... [in the Act, to the end that] all work [on such projects] shall be done in accordance therewith.\u201d G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (1984 ed.). Although the protected interests are stated with some specificity, see note 3, <em>supra, </em>the statute is silent with respect to what may or may not constitute \u201cprotection.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>Into this silence, the judge read the language of the 1983 preface, \u201cthat the interests of the Act cannot be protected other than by leaving the existing wetland plant community intact.\u201d He concluded that the \u201cnear prohibition\u201d in the 1983 regulations on the filling of bordering vegetated wetlands \u201cbecomes essential to performance by DEQE of its lawful obligation,\u201d and any \u201cdifferent course constitutes irresponsibility.\u201d He erred, however, in not giving due deference to DEQE\u2019s determination that the grandfather clause is not inconsistent with the language of the preface or the statutory mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">As to the language of the preface, we think it just as reasonable to read it, in light of the regulations it explains, as meaning by its reference to the \u201cexisting wetland plant community\u201d that portion of the State\u2019s wetlands which would be kept essentially \u201cintact\u201d <em>by </em>the new regulations, i.e., those wetlands not subject in 1983 to a notice of intent. Nor do we perceive that the presence of the grandfather clause in the 1983 regulations was in any way violative of the statutory mandate. The WPA does not command DEQE to protect all wetlands from all development. Rather, it commands the agency to condition all work on wetlands so as to protect the statutory interests in prevention of pollution, flooding, and storm damage, and in preservation of water supplies and wildlife. Even though the 1983 regulations which prospectively bar case-by-case review of development proposals may be reasonable (a point which we need not decide), it remains true that a grandfather clause carrying forward the prior approach allowing case-by-case review may also be within the statutory mandate. To the extent that a grandfather clause permits case-by-case review where a project is already in the administrative pipeline, such an approach may also be reasonable because DEQE properly may determine, on the basis of its knowledge of the number and nature of the projects in its pipeline, that such grandfathering will not be so administratively burdensome as to prevent effective, efficient protection of the statutory interests. When consideration is given to the additional facts that, by virtue of being grandfathered, the applicant\u2019s project did not escape review, and that none of the hearing officers\u2019 favorable findings was chai-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>lenged by the judge, it is clear that DEQE\u2019s actions have been consonant with the statutory mandate. Accordingly, we hold that the judge\u2019s nullification of DEQE\u2019s decision was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-5\">2. <em>The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining objections. </em>What we have said effectively answers most of the questions raised by the plaintiffs. In its amicus brief MACC argues that even if, as a procedural matter, the applicant is entitled to review under the 1978 regulations, DEQE\u2019s decision to allow filling at Sweeden\u2019s Swamp was erroneous. MACC contends that the rule making process which culminated in the 1983 regulations shows that DEQE had concluded that \u201cexcept in limited circumstances expressly set forth, <em>no wetlands that border bodies of water may be altered by any project\u201d </em>(emphasis in original). DEQE\u2019s actual conclusion was very different. Contrary to MACC\u2019s view, DEQE did not determine in 1983 that case-by-case review was incapable of determining whether, in an individual case, filling or alterations of wetland might be consistent with protection of the statutory interests.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Nothing in G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, sustains this view. It is primarily to the statute that we look to determine the proper range of an agency\u2019s power to shape regulations. Additionally, to the extent we give deference to the agency\u2019s decision, the deference is to the regulations as they were promulgated, including the grandfather clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">We note also that DEQE has expertise, not only with respect to what conditions will protect the statutory interests in a given case but also with respect to what adjudicatory techniques will be administratively feasible in service of those interests. DEQE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>had discretion to decide that the general rule need not apply to projects already in development and in process of review. Additionally, the hearing officer found, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the existing wetland does not function efficiently in service of the statutory interests. He found further that the project, as planned, would result in creation of an environmental entity whose \u201cfunctioning\" would be \u201cbiological,\u201d that is to say, \u201cnatural.\u201d That the feasibility of recreating functional wetlands was debated by the experts who testified is not a ground for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that the judge erred in not requiring the applicant to seek de nova review by filing a new notice of intent with the ACC.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> By the literal terms of the WPA, anyone planning to \u201calter\u201d a wetland must file a notice of intent with local authorities including \u201csuch plans as may be necessary to describe such proposed activity and its effect on the environment.\u201d G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40 (1984 ed.).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">The hearing officer decided, pursuant to the terms of \u00a7 10.06 (5) of the 1978 regulations, that the revisions did not amount to such a \u201csignificant change of the activity\u201d as to \u201crequire a new filing,\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> because (1) it had been DEQE\u2019s practice not to remand to the local level so long as \u201cthe general intent of a proposal [as here, to build a mall in Sweeden\u2019s Swamp] remains the same\u201d; (2) the WPA contemplates changes subsequent to initial filings and vests final authority to approve plans in DEQE; (3) local opponents were not denied a foil opportunity to oppose the revised proposal; and (4) the design changes were intended to reduce the adverse environmental impact of the project below the levels already approved by a local conservation commission which had not sought remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>The judge, on the other hand, characterized the revisions as \u201csignificant,\u201d and he referred to the plans as \u201cnew\u201d; but, despite the plaintiffs\u2019 contention to the contrary, the judge did not find that DEQE had erred by misapplying \u00a7 10.06 (5). The word \u201csignificant\u201d is defined in the regulations to apply to a wetland which \u201cplays a role in the provision or protection of an interest of the Act.\u201d 310 Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.02 (42) (1978) (defining \u201c[significant\u201d). See also 310 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 10.04 (1983) (same). This definition was promulgated, not for use in the context of \u00a7 10.06 (5), but for use when the agency must determine whether it <em>has jurisdiction </em>to determine, in the words of the statute, that \u201cthe area on which the proposed work is to be done is significant\u201d to protection of enumerated environmental interests. Where jurisdiction is concerned, it is clearly apt for DEQE to define \u201csignificant\u201d broadly, as it is clear the Legislature intended to place within DEQE\u2019s protective purview any wetland which, in DEQE\u2019s opinion, might play a role in flood control or the prevention of pollution.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">However, after DEQE has taken jurisdiction, the question changes to that of whether the statute requires similar breadth in defining the change which may mandate remand for local reconsideration. We think it does not, for the result would be to deny to DEQE the exercise of discretion which is so clearly contemplated by G. L. c. 131, \u00a7 40, and by \u00a7 10.06 (5) of the 1978 regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-6\">Additionally, as stated by the Appeals Court in <em>Hamilton </em>v. <em>Conservation Comm\u2019n of Orleans, </em>12 Mass. App. Ct. 359, 368 (1981), \u201cit is apparent that the Legislature has assigned to local authorities acting under [the WPA] the role of making an initial review of an application for the familiar purposes of bringing local knowledge to bear on local conditions and reducing the administrative burden on a Statewide agency.\u201d While the statute requires that the notice which triggers local review must include \u201csuch plans as may be necessary to describe [the] proposed activity and its effect on the environment,\u201d the statute nowhere intimates that all subsequent proceedings under the Act must remain directed to the specific plans initially filed with local authorities. Moreover, the statute contains several <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>indications to the contrary, for it empowers DEQE to review any local determination sua sponte, and to issue orders \u201csuperseding]\u201d any orders issued locally. Implicit in this power of DEQE is a power to revise, or to request revisions, and to approve them when appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">The question is whether the statutory requirement of bringing local knowledge to bear on local conditions is inadequately protected when DEQE permits altered plans to go forward to final approval without remand for additional local review. While the changes submitted to DEQE were not scrutinized locally and are undeniably \u201csubstantial\u201d in terms of environmental effect, these same changes were found by DEQE to reduce the adverse environmental impact of a project previously approved on the local level.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">We note that local residents and officials have had an opportunity to be heard by way of a public hearing and to apply local knowledge by way of initial approval. Local opponents have been heard at length during the process of review. We attach some importance to the Legislature\u2019s presumed intent that the DEQE\u2019s review procedures operate efficiently in individual cases, so the WPA\u2019s Statewide mandate may be effectively implemented. Obviously, if a change or set of changes is meaningful enough to win DEQE\u2019s approval, those changes must be substantial in terms of their environmental impact. We cannot conclude that the Legislature intended to burden every meaningful change in an applicant\u2019s proposal with de nova review, regardless whether or not the change was one as to which the process of review might benefit from local participation. See <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 302, 307 (1985) (nothing in \u00a7 40 requires local participation as condition precedent to determination by DEQE).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In this case, the interveners have not attempted to demonstrate, except in the most speculative and conclusory ways, how remand could improve the process. Implicit in DEQE\u2019s position is the insight that, where local authorities have seen fit, on the basis of local understanding of local conditions, to approve wholesale destruction of a local wetland, the process of review is not likely to be meaningfully informed by remand for local consideration of proposals not so destructive, and indeed the likely consequence of such remand would be needless delay. Since unnecessary delay is not what the Legislature could rationally have intended, we do not read the WPA to require such delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">Last, there remains the question whether the applicant\u2019s plans were in fact less destructive or more protective of statutory interests than the plans approved locally. On this point, we defer to DEQE\u2019s expertise and review only to determine whether its decision was supported by substantial evidence. See <em>Wolbach </em>v. <em>Beckett, supra; Raytheon Co. </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>364 Mass. 593, 595-596 (1974). While the testifying witnesses disagreed concerning the feasibility of the applicant\u2019s proposal, there was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the proposal is workable and substantially more protective of statutory interests than the plans they replaced. In these circumstances, no new notice of intent could have served any statutory purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">The judgment of the Superior Court is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for entry of a judgment affirming the decision of DEQE.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b675-13\"> The statute, as then in effect, provided in pertinent part: \u201cNo person shall remove, fill, dredge or alter any bank, fresh water wetland, coastal wetland, beach, dune, flat, marsh, meadow or swamp bordering on the ocean or on any estuary, creek, river, stream, pond, or lake, or any land under said waters or any land subject to tidal action, coastal storm flowage, or flooding . . . without filing written notice of his intention to so remove, fill, dredge or alter, including such plans as may be necessary to describe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>such proposed activity and its effect on the environment and without receiving and complying with an order of conditions and provided all appeal periods have elapsed.

If our decision turned upon an evaluation of the strength of the applicant\u2019s reliance on the applicability of the 1978 regulations, we would have to decide whether the letter is properly before us.

The new plan contemplated a two-story building; 2. The plan attempted to reproduce or \u2018replicate\u2019 wetlands on the site to replace the substantial quantity of wetlands which would be destroyed by the construction project; 3. The plan attempted to control storm water run-off and pollution through the use of an \u2018exfiltration pad\u2019 under the mall; 4. The plan included wetlands areas not originally included as part of the project proposed by the Mugar Group; 5. The plan included additional land areas, creating new abutters; 6.

In the view we take, the first three factors are irrelevant to this appeal. While we agree that the \u201cstatutory interest\u201d is of crucial significance, we do not agree that the 1983 regulations (and their ban on filling more than 5,000 square feet of any bordering vegetated wetland) were statutorily compelled.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The citizens\u2019 group argues, to the contrary, that adoption of the 1983 regulations amounted not merely to a procedural change but to adoption of the substantive policy position that nothing short of an absolute ban on large-scale development is consistent with protection of the statutory interests. To support this contention, the group points to DEQE\u2019s stated conclusion in the preface \u201cthat destruction of bordering vegetated wetlands must be curtailed if the interests identified in the Act are to be protected.\u201d To \u201ccurtail,\u201d however, is not to prohibit absolutely but to \u201cdiminish,\u201d \u201clessen,\u201d or \u201creduce.\u201d Webster\u2019s New Int\u2019l Dictionary 558 (2d ed. 1959).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\"> The plaintiffs candidly acknowledge that a decision to require notice would scuttle the project.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b688-8\"> The 1978 regulation provided: \u201cIf there is a significant change of the activity . . . , the [reviewing agency] may require a new filing of a Notice of Intent.\u201d 310 Code Mass.
