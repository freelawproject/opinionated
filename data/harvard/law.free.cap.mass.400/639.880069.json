McDonough, for forcible, unnatural sexual intercourse with a child under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The acts were alleged to have occurred between August 22, 1979, and May 14, 1982. After trial in the Superior Court in Suffolk County, the jury returned a verdict of guilty of statutory rape. G. L. c. 265, \u00a7 23 (1986 ed.).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant was sentenced to a term of from seven to twelve years at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Cedar Junction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The defendant appealed, and we transferred the case to this court on our own motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">We state some of the relevant evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The victim lived with his mother in South Boston until he was six or seven years old. When he was approximately four years old, his mother showed him something that he was \u201cgoing to be doing.\u201d The victim demonstrated to the jury how his mother had put her fingers in his mouth in a sexually explicit manner. He testified that she stated that this conduct would make friends and would make people happy. When he was four to five years old, he met the defendant at his mother\u2019s apartment and performed fellatio on him in his mother\u2019s presence. The victim testified that he was scared when he did this; he thought that his mother would hit him if he refused.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The victim could not remember how many times he had performed oral sex on the defendant, but he knew that it was more than once.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">In January, 1982, when the victim was approximately six years old, he started to visit his father. In June, 1982, the father obtained temporary custody of the child. Permanent custody was granted to the father in April, 1983. In May, 1983, he told his father that he had performed fellatio on the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The victim testified that he did not tell his father <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>right away because he was nervous, afraid, and embarrassed. When his father asked why he had done this, he answered that his mother had taught him and \u201ctold [him] it was a good way to make friends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">The victim\u2019s father informed the State police. Lt. Thomas L. McLaughlin of the State police spoke with the victim on August 10, 1983. The victim told the lieutenant that his mother initially had introduced him to pornographic material which depicted some of the acts she was talking about, required him to place his penis on her vagina, and told him that fellatio makes other people happy. He also told the lieutenant that he had performed fellatio upon the defendant and a male social worker for the Department of Social Services.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Lt. McLaughlin then called the defendant\u2019s home on January 5, 1984, to ask the defendant to come to the police station. The defendant went voluntarily to the station three hours later. He spoke with the lieutenant and with Corporal Jack Nasuti. Lt. McLaughlin read the defendant the Miranda warnings. The defendant then signed and dated a Miranda card. During an approximately forty-five minute conversation, the defendant admitted that the victim had performed fellatio upon him three or four times over a period of two or three months.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">The defendant testified that he knew the victim and the mother. He denied allowing the victim to perform fellatio on him. When asked whether he remembered telling Lt. McLaughlin that the victim had \u201csucked [his] penis maybe four or five times,\u201d the defendant replied that he \u201cmight have said that, but out of fear or something.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred by (1) excluding the victim\u2019s hospital records; (2) refusing to allow two physicians to testify as expert witnesses; (3) excluding evidence of allegedly false accusations of rape; (4) allowing Lt. McLaughlin to testify as to the victim\u2019s fresh complaint; (5) \u201cimproperly\u201d instructing the jury on fresh complaint evidence; and (6) denying the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress his statements at the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>1. <em>Hospital records. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred by excluding certain medical records of the victim. The judge based his ruling on the grounds that the records contained hearsay and privileged matter. The defendant claims that the Commonwealth failed to prove that the records came within the psychotherapist-patient privilege, G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B (1986 ed.), primarily because a resident physician of Children\u2019s Hospital Medical Center, Dr. Barbara Burr, failed to qualify as a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Conversations between a psychotherapist and a patient, relative to the diagnosis and treatment of the patient\u2019s mental and emotional condition set forth in writing in a hospital record otherwise admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79, may be inadmissible because of the statutory privilege. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20B, defines \u201ccommunications\u201d to include not only the conversations but also any record, memoranda, or notes thereof. <em>Usen </em>v. <em>Usen, </em>359 Mass. 453, 455-456 (1971). A trial judge may also exclude portions of an otherwise competent hospital record if he determines that the record\u2019s impact would be more prejudicial than probative. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 642 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The judge stated that he had examined each page of the records that defense counsel wished to read to the jury. He found that most of the otherwise relevant material in the records was \u201ctotem pole,\u201d or multiple, hearsay,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> with the exception of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>portions relating to diagnosis and treatment which were inadmissible under the psychotherapist-patient privilege or the social worker-client privilege. G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 (1986 ed.). He further found that the apparent purpose of introducing the records was to attack the victim\u2019s credibility, by showing that his father had psychiatric problems of his own. The judge noted that, although he had conducted extensive voir dire examinations to allow defense counsel to develop that theme, it had never been developed. After impounding and identifying privileged information, the judge copied and distributed the record to both counsel. The judge indicated that he had permitted counsel for the defendant to examine the hospital records in order to permit the defendant full confrontational rights when his counsel examined the victim\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20B, defines a \u201c[psychotherapist\u201d as \u201ca person licensed to practice medicine who devotes a substantial portion of his time to the practice of psychiatry <em>or </em>a person who is licensed as a psychologist by the board of registration of psychologists; provided, however, that such person has a doctoral degree in the field of psychology or is a registered nurse\u201d (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The defendant\u2019s claim that Dr. Burr does not qualify as a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d is based on his argument that a person licensed to practice medicine who devotes a substantial portion of his or her time to psychiatry is not qualified unless that person also possesses a doctoral degree in psychology or is licensed as a nurse. This interpretation flies in the face of the clear language of the statute, the legislative history, and common sense. The statutory definition of a \u201cpsychotherapist\u201d requires either a license to practice medicine and a substantial portion of time devoted to psychiatry <em>or </em>a license as a psychologist and a doctoral degree in psychology. General Laws c. 233, \u00a7 20B, was amended in 1977 by inserting the language on which the defendant relies. St. 1977, c. 817. The proviso regarding the doctorate was part of the new provision bringing psychologists within the prior definition. It is unreasonable to assume that the Legislature intended the requirement of a doctoral degree in psychology to apply also to the original provision regarding physicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>In this case, Dr. Burr testified that she was a physician; that she had completed two years of a fellowship in child psychiatry, and that she was a resident in adult psychiatry at the time of trial. The judge ruled that Dr. Burr was a \u201cphysician specializing in psychiatry.\u201d We note that this court recently held in <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>399 Mass. 131, 136 (1987), that the same doctor qualified as a psychotherapist within the meaning of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B. There was no error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The defendant claims that the hospital records were relevant to the victim\u2019s bias, motive, and credibility. He also argues that the judge\u2019s \u201cprohibition against use of the medical reports\u201d to address the victim\u2019s mental stability and credibility deprived him of his constitutional right to cross-examination. This, the defendant maintains, resulted \u201cin the denial of due process and of a fair trial, effective cross examination and confrontation as guaranteed by the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the United States Constitution [and] Article 12 of the Massachusetts Declaration of Rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The defendant\u2019s characterization of the judge\u2019s ruling is misleading. The record establishes that the judge permitted counsel for the defendant to examine the hospital record and to use material from the hospital record to impeach the victim\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>The one passage from the hospital record which the defendant particularly complains of not being allowed to use stated:<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cIn spite of some strengths, [the victim] is a child with a severe psychiatric disorder. This is manifest by cognitive confusion over the events of his life (e.g. inability to distinguish real episodes of sexual abuse from the abundant and constant suggestions he receives from his father) . . . .\u201d This passage appears in the victim\u2019s discharge summary from Children\u2019s Hospital, which was dictated by Dr. Burr and signed by Dr. Robert Riskind. It is repeated in a three-page letter to a social worker at Boston Children\u2019s Services, dated February 7, 1984, and signed by Dr. Burr, Dr. Riskind, Ester Schleifer, a licensed social worker, and Lee Farrington, a social work intern.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that this statement was an appropriate part of the hospital record, and further assuming, without deciding, that the statement was not inadmissible as an unusual or controversial diagnosis, <em>Diaz </em>v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co., </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 448, 454 (1982), any error in excluding the statement was not prejudicial; the statement was cumulative of evidence before the jury. Defense counsel cross-examined the victim extensively and vigorously in an effort to impeach his credibility and to bring forth inconsistencies in his testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The issue of the victim\u2019s credibility was more than adequately explored in the jury\u2019s presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">As to the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional claim, the Supreme Court has recently held in <em>Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Ritchie, </em>480 U.S. 39 (1987), that a criminal defendant charged with various sexual offenses was entitled only to have a trial judge review a confidential file in camera to determine whether it contained information that probably would have changed the outcome of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>his trial. The Court held that the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania had erred in holding that defense counsel must be allowed to examine the confidential information. The Court stated that \u201c[t]o allow full disclosure to defense counsel in this type of case would sacrifice unnecessarily the Commonwealth\u2019s compelling interest in protecting its child abuse information.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1003. That case concerned a statutory privilege protecting records of a State protective service agency charged with investigating cases of suspected mistreatment and neglect of children. We note that the State\u2019s interest in protecting the confidentiality of patients\u2019 communications with psychotherapists is at least as strong as its interest in protecting disclosures to a State protective services agency. The judge below did more than is required under this Federal standard. We conclude that there was no violation of the defendant\u2019s Federal constitutional rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">2. <em>Expert testimony. </em>The defendant argues that the judge erred in ruling that Dr. Burr and Dr. Riskind were not qualified to render an opinion whether the victim could distinguish real episodes of sexual abuse from imagined ones. After an extensive voir dire, the judge found that, while Dr. Riskind was qualified as an expert, he had no personal knowledge of the victim\u2019s mental and emotional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Dr. Riskind, a board certified psychiatrist, had been chief of service and attending psychiatrist at the specialized pediatric unit at Children\u2019s Hospital, where the victim was treated. While all children admitted to the unit were assigned to him as the attending physician, Dr. Riskind testified that he never reviewed the victim\u2019s referral information and that he never interviewed the victim individually. Further, while he had to sign every official hospital document regarding children on his units, he had never discussed with Dr. Burr the statement which the defendant wished to introduce.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">Dr. Burr testified that she had first seen the victim in January, 1984, a significant time after the alleged incidents. Her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>opinion at that time was that he was a child who \u201chad difficulty forming relationships with adults, trusting adults, and talking about his feelings.\u201d Dr. Burr testified further that she had done no psychological testing of the victim, and that the victim \u201cwas unable to discuss any issues pertaining to alleged sexual abuse with [her].\u201d She acknowledged, and the judge ruled, that \u201cshe is not in a position to assist this jury to determine whether or not the [victim], has or does not have the capacity to give objective evaluations and judgments about the real world, and, thus, appropriately advise the jury as to whether or not he was impaired to such an extent that fantasy overtook reality.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">\u201c[T]he qualification of a witness to offer an expert opinion on a given question is for determination by the trial judge as <em>a </em>preliminary issue of fact.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Seit, </em>373 Mass. 83, 92 (1977). \u201cWhether we say that he has a wide discretion in deciding the question, or that his ruling will be reversed only for error in point of law ... the result is that such decisions at trial level are rarely upset on appellate review\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>385 Mass. 639, 645 (1982); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gaulden, </em>383 Mass. 543, 549 (1981). The judge\u2019s findings were amply supported by the evidence; there was no error. See <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Thornton, </em>368 Mass. 528, 540-541 (1975). Cf. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Garabe-dian, </em>399 Mass. 304, 310 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">3. <em>Prior accusations of rape. </em>At trial, defense counsel sought to introduce in evidence numerous allegedly false accusations of rape that were made by the victim.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> After a lengthy and extensive voir dire, the judge ruled that only one of the prior accusations was admissible for the limited purpose of impeaching the victim\u2019s credibility. On appeal, the defendant argues that the judge erred in excluding evidence regarding the victim\u2019s other allegations.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>At the voir dire, Lt. McLaughlin provided a list of persons upon whom the victim had allegedly performed fellatio. After disregarding references to other sexual activities, and to other children, the judge reduced the list to approximately eight names.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The defendant sought to call several of the accused persons to testify as to the falsity of the accusations. The judge allowed counsel for the defendant to ask whether the victim had mentioned the defendant to Lt. McLaughlin, but prohibited inquiry as to the other names unless he could show that the accusations were false. In a memorandum of decision and order, the judge set forth in detail his reasoning and his conclusions on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">Based on Lt. McLaughlin\u2019s list and the essentially duplica-tive list of the victim\u2019s father, the judge determined that defense counsel had made a showing that some accusations had been made by the victim. However, only one accusation, concerning the male social worker for the Department of Social Services, was shown to contain an independent basis for a claim of falsity because one Linda Saucier, who was allegedly present when the victim performed fellatio upon the social worker, provided an independent third-party basis of falsity. One individual testified and denied the allegations. The judge found that \u201chis denial did not, in itself, constitute sufficient evidence of falsity or even an exaggeration of truth as required in <em>[Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90 (1978), <em>S.C., </em>385 Mass. 733 (1982), and <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682 (1982)].\u201d As to the other names, however, he ruled that there was \u201c \u2018 \u201cnot a scintilla of evidence\u201d showing that the statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>were anything but true accounts of past events. Rather, the defendant ] engaged in speculation that the statements demonstrated the victim\u2019s \u201cidiosyncratic and distorted perceptions.\u201d Conjecture about \u201cdistorted perceptions\u201d cannot substitute for some evidence which would warrant the jury in finding the statements inaccurate. \u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Lefkowitz, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 513, 515-516 (1985).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The judge also stated that \u201cthe defendant was not denied his right to develop a defense of bias at trial as he was allowed extensively to cross-examine the victim and his father and adequately to put before the jury the issue of the [victim\u2019s parents\u2019] child custody battle. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Elder, </em>389 Mass. 743, 751 (1983) (\u2018where evidence of bias is available by other means, no evidence of the complainant\u2019s prior sexual history should be admitted\u2019).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b666-6\">The judge concluded that, although the defendant had adequate time and wide latitude to develop a claim of bias through a theory of false accusations, the evidence fell short of what is required. The judge ruled that \u201c[i]n the case at bar, with respect to all but one of the supposedly prior false allegations of rape, it was not demonstrated that the \u2018statements were false or even an exaggeration of the truth. \u2019 \u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, </em>386 Mass. 682, 692 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-7\">The defendant claims that he complied with the prerequisites for admission of prior false allegations of rape set forth in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bohannon, </em>376 Mass. 90, 95 (1978) <em>(Bohannon </em>I). He is mistaken. While his offers of proof \u2014 a police report, a probation report, and certain medical records \u2014 may constitute independent third-party records that allegations were made, they in no way provide a factual basis for concluding that the accusations were false.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">\u201c[T]he exception to the general rule barring evidence of prior false accusations is a narrow one. <em>Bohannon I </em>involved \u2018special circumstances,\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, </em>379 Mass. 166, 169 (1972) . . . and is applicable only in \u2018unusual fact situations where justice demands.\u2019 <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Trenholm, </em>14 Mass. App. Ct. 1038, 1039 (1982).\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 489 (1987). In <em>Com</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number><em>monwealth </em>v. <em>Sperrazza, supra </em>at 169, we described the \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d of <em>Bohannon I </em>as follows: \u201c[T]he witness was the victim in the case on trial, her consent was the central issue; she was the only Commonwealth witness on that issue, her testimony was inconsistent and confused, and there was a basis in independent third-party records for concluding that the prior accusations of the same type of crime had been made and were false.\u201d No such \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d warrant applying the exception of <em>Bohannon I </em>to this case. In <em>Bohannon I, </em>consent was the central issue. Here it was not an issue at all. Unlike <em>Bohannon I, </em>this victim was not the only witness on the central issue. The defendant himself admitted to Lt. McLaughlin that he allowed the victim to perform fellatio on him four or five times. At trial, after initially denying that he had made that statement, the defendant admitted that he \u201cmight have said it.\u201d Most important, there was no basis in \u201cindependent third-party records for concluding that the prior accusations of the same type of crime . . . were false.\u201d <em>Sperrazza, supra </em>at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">It was well within the judge\u2019s discretion to rule that defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof was insufficient to permit testimony of other witnesses and cross-examination of the victim regarding accusations of sexual misconduct against individuals other than the male social worker for the Department of Social Services. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, supra </em>at 692-693; <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Hicks, </em>23 Mass. App. Ct. 487, 490 (1987). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">4. <em>Fresh complaint. </em>The indictment charges the defendant with rape of the victim \u201cbetween August 22, 1979, and May 14, 1982, the exact date . . . unknown.\u201d The victim\u2019s father obtained temporary custody of the boy in June, 1982. The father testified that he did not recall if the victim stated to him, while he had temporary custody, that the defendant had sexually abused him.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Within one month after the father\u2019s obtaining permanent custody in April, 1983, the victim began telling him about sexual abuse by his mother and by the defendant. The father reported the incident to the State police, and the victim spoke with Lt. McLaughlin on August 10, 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>Defense counsel called the victim\u2019s father as a witness and elicited from him his son\u2019s story concerning his sexual abuse by his mother and the defendant. He cannot, therefore, complain on appeal that the judge allowed in evidence the victim\u2019s complaint to his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">As to the child\u2019s complaint to Lt. McLaughlin, the defendant objected to admission of the lieutenant\u2019s testimony because of the time that had elapsed between the alleged incidents of abuse and the child\u2019s complaint to the officer. When he admitted the conversation, the judge noted that \u201csince the child has already testified that he was under some fear of the mother by virtue of physical abuse, [and] that as soon as he had an opportunity, he described what had occurred . . . according to our case law, such is considered a fresh complaint even though a considerable period of time has elapsed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\u201cThe determination whether statements are sufficiently prompt to constitute fresh complaints rests within the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, </em>399 Mass. 668, 673 (1987), citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, supra </em>at 691. The test is whether the victim\u2019s actions were reasonable in the particular circumstances of the case. <em>Id. Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 473 (1982). \u201cThere is no absolute rule of law as to the time within which the victim of a sexual assault must make [his or] her first complaint of the assault in order to qualify that complaint for admission in evidence as a fresh complaint.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bedard, </em>6 Mass. App. Ct. 959, 959 (1978). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>370 Mass. 388, 391-393 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-7\">In the present case, the victim was a young child whose sexual encounters with the defendant were coached and monitored by his mother, with whom he lived. He testified several times that \u201cshe said if I didn\u2019t do it, she would hit me. So I kept on doing it.\u201d The victim told his father approximately one month after his father gained permanent custody. His father then told the State police the following month; and the child\u2019s interview with Lt. McLaughlin came two months later. Thus, the child\u2019s conversation with the lieutenant, which the judge admitted as fresh complaint, occurred three months after the father gained permanent custody of the boy.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>We have stated that, \u201cwhere a young victim has been under the control of, and in reasonable fear of, a defendant who is a close relative, the promptness of a complaint is usually measured from the date when the victim leaves the defendant\u2019s control.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Comtois, supra </em>at 672 n.9, citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>King, </em>387 Mass. 464, 473 (1982). In the particular circumstances of this case, where fear of his mother compelled the child\u2019s sexual activity with the defendant, we think the same rule should apply. There was no abuse of discretion in admitting the corroborative testimony of the lieutenant.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">5. <em>Instructions to the jury. </em>The defendant next complains that the judge failed to give proper instructions regarding the fresh complaint testimony of Lt. McLaughlin. He argues that the judge did not instruct the jury that they must consider both whether the victim\u2019s complaints were made \u201creasonably promptly,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sherry, supra </em>at 691, and whether they corroborated his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">The defendant\u2019s argument relies on a selective reading of the transcript and ignores the judge\u2019s final instructions to the jury. When Lt. McLaughlin testified regarding the victim\u2019s fresh complaint, the judge gave a preliminary instruction, told the jury he would instruct them more fully at the conclusion of the case, and asked counsel whether he had stated the principle correctly. The defendant made no objection and offered no correction to the instruction which he now attacks. At the most, if there was error, we would review the challenged instructions only to determine whether the charge as given created a substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice. <em>Commonwealth v. Drew, </em>397 Mass. 65, 81 (1986). There was, however, no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">In his final instructions, the judge stated: \u201cIn considering such statements, you must first determine whether they were, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>in fact, a prompt complaint about the incident. If they were not a prompt complaint. . . you may not consider such statements at all.\u201d He added that they should only consider the fresh complaint evidence \u201cfor the purpose of determining whether or not the victim . . . was truthful when he testified here in court.\u201d The defendant\u2019s claim ignores the well-established principle that \u201c[w]e are concerned with the impression left with the jury by the charge as a whole.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ramey, </em>368 Mass. 109, 114 (1975). See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Doucette, </em>391 Mass. 443, 450 (1984); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Sellon, </em>380 Mass. 220, 231-232 (1980). We do \u201cnot [scrutinize] bits and pieces removed from their context.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Cundriff, </em>382 Mass. 137, 153 (1980), cert. denied, 451 U.S. 973 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">The judge\u2019s instructions, viewed as a whole, explained the principles of fresh complaint evidence with care and precision. There was no error, much less a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">6. <em>Voluntariness of the defendant\u2019s waiver. </em>The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the judge erred in denying his motion to suppress his January 5, 1984, statements to Lt. McLaughlin. He argues that the statements should have been suppressed because he lacked the mental capacity knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily to waive his Miranda rights during his interview with the police. The Commonwealth maintains that the defendant was not subjected to custodial interrogation and that, even if he were, he was properly informed of his Miranda rights and made a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of those rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">With court approval, the defendant underwent psychological tests to assess his mental capacity. The results of these tests were presented at a pretrial suppression hearing where the psychologists who had administered the tests, the defendant, and Lt. McLaughlin testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-8\">Based on the testimony and evidence presented, the judge made the following findings of fact. At approximately 6:30 p.m. on January 5, 1984, Lt. McLaughlin telephoned the McDonough residence and asked if the defendant would come to the police station to talk about his relationship with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>victim and his mother. The defendant arrived at approximately 9:50 p.m.; the lieutenant read him his Miranda rights prior to questioning. When asked if he understood his rights, the defendant replied several times that he did. The defendant testified that he understood that he could stop the questioning at any time but did not. He also stated that he wanted to answer any questions because he had \u201cnothing to hide.\u201d The interview took forty-five minutes and included one break. He was not arrested after his interview.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">The defendant\u2019s attorney hired Bruce Mermelstein, a psychologist, to conduct psychological tests to assess the defendant\u2019s capacity to understand and voluntarily waive his Miranda rights. Mermelstein testified that the only objective test administered, the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, indicated that the defendant\u2019s full scale I.Q. was within the borderline range of intelligence and that he was \u201cnot mentally retarded.\u201d He opined that the defendant had \u201cdiminished cognitive capacity\u201d and, therefore, did not have the mental capacity to understand his legal rights. On cross-examination, however, Mermelstein admitted that \u201cdiminished cognitive capacity\u201d was just another way of saying that he was \u201cjust not very bright. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">Based on those findings of fact, the judge made the following rulings of law. Since an individual\u2019s right to Miranda warnings is triggered by \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Haas, </em>373 Mass. 545, 551 (1977), <em>S.C., </em>398 Mass. 806 (1986), the initial issue is whether the defendant was subject to \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after . . . [being] taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>390 Mass. 729, 736 (1984), quoting <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 443 , 444 (1966). The judge applied the factors outlined in <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Bryant, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and concluded that the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>fendant \u201creasonably could not have perceived the interrogation[ ] as coercive in nature.\u201d The police never threatened or abused the defendant. There was no mention of arrest, nor did an arrest occur. Therefore, the judge found that the statements attributed to the defendant were the product of a noncustodial interrogation. Since no Miranda warnings were necessary, whether the defendant voluntarily and intelligently waived his Miranda rights was irrelevant. The judge concluded, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s statement was admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">The judge further ruled that, even if the defendant\u2019s statements were the product of \u201ccustodial interrogation[ ],\u201d they are nevertheless admissible if Miranda warnings were properly given and if a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver was effected. The judge found that the defendant\u2019s waiver was made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. As the judge indicated, the defendant was read his rights; stated that he understood those rights, signed the waiver portion of the Miranda card, and so testified at the suppression hearing. Although the defendant testified that he did not understand the Miranda rights at the relevant time, the judge correctly noted that he was not obligated to believe his testimony. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Day, </em>387 Mass. 915, 919 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">Furthermore, the judge found that the atmosphere of the interrogation was not threatening. After observing the defendant during his testimony and taking into consideration his educational and employment background, the judge was convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that he had sufficient mental capacity to understand his rights under <em>Miranda, supra; </em>that he did understand those rights; and that he effected a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver of those rights when he signed the Miranda card on January 5, 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">\u201cIn reviewing a trial judge\u2019s determination that a voluntary waiver was made, the judge\u2019s subsidiary findings will not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>disturbed, if they are warranted by the evidence, and his resolution of conflicting testimony will be accepted.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Tabor, </em>376 Mass. 811, 822 (1978), quoting <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Santo, </em>375 Mass. 299, 303 (1978). <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Mahnke, </em>368 Mass. 662, 666 (1975), cert. denied, 425 U.S. 959 (1976). While the judge\u2019s ultimate findings and conclusions of law are open for this court to review, a finding of voluntary waiver is \u201centitled to substantial deference by this court.\u201d <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>White, </em>374 Mass. 132, 138 (1977), aff\u2019d by an equally divided Court, 439 U.S. 280 (1978). The judge properly ruled that Miranda warnings, although given, were not required. Further, even if the defendant\u2019s statements were viewed as the result of custodial interrogation, the evidence amply supports the judge\u2019s ruling that the defendant knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights. While the reviewing court must scrutinize the record with special care when the suspect has a diminished or subnormal mental capacity, <em>Commonwealth v. Daniels, </em>366 Mass. 601, 606 (1975), such scrutiny in this case reveals nothing to criticize in the careful, thorough findings of the judge. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b656-13\">Five other defendants, including the child\u2019s mother, were also indicted for rape of the child.

When he went to get stitches at the hospital, he said that he had tripped and fallen down, because his mother had so instructed him and because he was afraid to tell the truth. The judge ruled that the records of the victim\u2019s hospital admissions on November 5, 1980, and January 14, 1981, were admissible on the ground that the records, showing head trauma, were relevant to the claim that the victim feared that his mother would hit him if he refused to perform fellatio on the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b657-10\">The victim\u2019s father testified that the victim told him that fellatio was something his mother had taught the victim and had made him practice on her finger. The victim added later that the defendant used to give his mother money for the acts he performed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b658-9\"> The male social worker was one of the five other persons indicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b659-7\"> Generally, evidence based on a chain of statements is admissible only if each out-of-court assertion falls within an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>Bouchie </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>376 Mass. 524, 527-531 (1978). McCormick, Evidence \u00a7 313, at 883 (3d ed. 1984). See Fed. R. Evid. 805. \u201cThe preparer\u2019s hearsay sources must carry the same indicia of reliability, arising from regularity and business motives, that bring his own act of recording the information within the statutory exception. Thus, unless statements on which the preparer relies fall within some other exception to the hearsay rule, the proponent must show that all persons in the chain of communication, from the observer to the preparer, reported the information as a matter of business duty or business routine.\u201d <em>Wingate </em>v. <em>Emery Air Freight Corp., </em>385 Mass. 402, 406 (1982). See <em>Julian </em>v. <em>Randazzo, </em>380 Mass. 391, 394 (1980); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Ennis, </em>2 Mass. App. Ct. 864 (1974)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b661-7\"> The defendant also argues that \u201cany privilege which could have existed was waived by the government in its inquiry of Barbara Burr.\u201d This argument is misplaced; the privilege belongs to the patient and must be waived by the patient. See, e.g., <em>Petition of the Dep\u2019t of Social Servs. to Dispense with Consent to Adoption, </em>399 Mass. 279, 290 n.21 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">The defendant further claims that the Commonwealth failed to show that \u201ccommunications were spoken between the alleged victim and a psychotherapist.\u201d We have reviewed the hospital records at issue in this case, and we conclude that the judge properly determined that they contained \u201ccommunications\u201d within the meaning of G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 20B.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">The defendant also objects to the judge\u2019s failure to distinguish between records protected by the social worker-client privilege, G. L. c. 112, \u00a7 135 (1986 ed.), and the psychotherapist-patient privilege, and his failure to designate the particular individual and record to which the privileges applied. He made no such objections at trial, however, and gives no indication on appeal as to how he was prejudiced thereby.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b662-7\"> As the defendant identifies no other particular statement as erroneously excluded, he waives his argument as to all but this portion of the record.

Johnson, a probation officer at the Probate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>Family Court Department for Suffolk County, who had interviewed the victim and had testified at the voir dire. The judge found that Johnson could state in definite terms neither what* names the victim mentioned, nor what exactly he said he had done with each person. Based on that testimony, the judge excluded any information he might have offered regarding prior accusations. He stated that Johnson\u2019s record and method of interview did not provide a proper foundation for any conclusion that the victim had accused anyone of rape.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b665-7\">The victim\u2019s father also testified at the voir dire and stated that the victim had told him about incidents of fellatio, and he provided the court with a list of those individuals.
