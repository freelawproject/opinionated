The first is a complaint for declaratory judgment by Mendel Kern, Inc. (Kern), against Workshop, Inc. (Workshop), and the other defendants<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> that it has a binding, long-term lease, option to purchase, and right of first refusal as to certain commercial property (the premises) on Merrimac Street in Boston. The second action is by Workshop for recovery of possession of the premises in summary process against Kern. Judgment was entered in the Superior Court declaring, among other things, that Kern had no lease or option to purchase the premises, and that Workshop in the summary process action was entitled to the possession of the premises. Kern appealed to the Appeals Court and we transferred the cases on our own motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-10\">From the trial judge\u2019s exhaustive and penetrating findings of fact, we learn that, as early as 1966, Kern and Workshop executed a ten-year lease which contained an option to renew for a further period of five years. During the initial ten-year period, a dispute arose and Kern sued Workshop in 1975, claiming, among other things, that Workshop had violated the covenant of quiet enjoyment.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">Meanwhile, Kern exercised its option to renew the lease. Kern and Workshop instructed their attorneys to pursue an amicable solution. Mr. Robert D. O\u2019Leary, representing Workshop, met with Kern\u2019s attorney on August 2 and 8, 1978. On August 10, 1978, Kern\u2019s attorney wrote to Mr. O\u2019Leary and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>enclosed a check for $100 as deposit for additional space at the premises. On August 11, at Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s office, the principals discussed additional space, options to renew for five-year periods through 1998, an option to purchase, a right of first refusal, and other matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">At this meeting, Mr. O\u2019Leary composed a \u201cletter of intent,\u201d outlining the matters discussed. Mr. O\u2019Leary wrote by hand the letter of intent and it was signed by Workshop. A typewritten copy of the letter was signed by Kem.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">1. <em>The letter of intent. </em>Kem argues that the letter of intent creates rights to a new lease, covering additional space, an option to purchase, a right of first refusal, as well as other matters. Workshop, on the other hand, claims that the letter of intent was not an operative document, that it contained none of these rights, but was rather a document that contemplated the execution of other documents such as a lease. The judge ruled that the letter of intent was not an operative document but a memorandum of future contractual intent. We agree. The language tends to support this conclusion. It is cast in the future tense. It provides that the old lease <em>\u201cwill be </em>further amended.\u201d Additional space <em>\u201cshall be incorporated </em>in the lease. \u201d Kem <em>\u201cshall be given </em>written permission\u201d to make certain changes in the premises. Kem \u201cshall have\u201d an option to renew. Existing mortgages \u201care to be subordinated\u201d to the new lease. The existing lawsuit by Kem against Workshop <em>\u201cshall be </em>terminated by the filing of an agreement for neither party.\u201d Finally, Kern\u2019s attorney <em>\u201cwill send </em>[a] letter acknowledging agreement to be signed upon receipt of this letter of intent.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">Following his receipt of the letter of intent, Kern\u2019s attorney wrote Mr. O\u2019Leary, who was then going on vacation, and advised him that the terms of the letter of intent would be \u201cembodied in a formal lease extension\u201d which would then be executed by the principals on Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s return from vacation.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">The letter of intent specified September 1, 1978, as the date by which \u201c[f]inal papers [were] to be executed.\u201d No final papers were tendered by that time. In fact, none of the items <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>of agenda in the letter of intent was accomplished. On October 26, 1978, Kern\u2019s attorney forwarded certain instruments (among them a proposed fifteen-page lease) to Mr. O\u2019Leary. Workshop\u2019s principal refused to consider executing the lease because September 1, 1978, the performance date, had passed. He recognized \u201cno deal\u201d between himself and Kern. For reasons that are not at all clear, the parties continued to play their customary roles of lessor and lessee and Kern continued to make rent payments to Workshop until January 18,1980, when the 1975 lawsuit was called for a pretrial conference.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">When the case was reached for trial on January 21, 1980, it was reported settled and an \u201cOrder for Entry of Dismissal Nisi\u201d was entered and on February 19, 1980, a judgment of dismissal was entered, dismissing the complaint without prejudice and without costs. Workshop pressed Mr. O\u2019Leary for a release which Kern gave to Workshop. The consideration recited for the release from Kern was the \u201cexecution of [a] long term lease between the parties in accordance with the terms thereof.\u201d There is no indication that Workshop ever gave a release to Kern.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Kern\u2019s attorney again on August 13, 1980, sent a set of documents, duplicating those that he sent in 1978, and again Workshop would not change its position. When a prospective buyer showed an interest in purchasing the premises, Mr. O\u2019Leary took the position that Kern had no lease which extended beyond June 1, 1981, and Kern\u2019s attorney countered by asserting a claim to a long-term lease that commenced in 1978 and ran for ten years with options to renew for a total of an additional ten years, with an option to purchase and a right of first refusal. The parties remained in this position until May, 1981, when the instant litigation was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The judge correctly concluded that the letter of intent was a memorandum in which the parties expressed an intention not to be bound until a final agreement was executed. See <em>Rosen-field </em>v. <em>United States Trust Co., </em>290 Mass. 210, 216 (1935). The letter of intent represented the expression of \u201cimperfect negotiation,\u201d and not a complete and final contract. <em>Id. </em>at 217. The judge accurately expressed the law that an intention to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>something is not necessarily a promise to do it. See <em>Tull </em>v. <em>Mister Donut Dev. Corp., </em>7 Mass. App. Ct. 626, 632 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The language which has been cited above seems to compel the conclusion that the parties contemplated being bound only by documents to be executed in the future. The fact that the parties intended that a final lease would be forthcoming is cogent evidence that they did not intend that the letter of intent, even when accepted by Kern, would constitute a binding agreement. See <em>Wasserman </em>v. <em>Roach, </em>336 Mass. 564, 567-568 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">However, even if the parties intended the letter of intent to be a binding contract, there manifestly was a failure to perform by September 1, 1978, the date upon which the parties had settled for performance. Kern took no steps to comply with this time constraint nor did it try to enlarge the time. Therefore, it will not be heard to complain now. See <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Compelio Coop. Bank, </em>344 Mass. 76, 79 (1962) (contract resembling an option cannot be permitted to run beyond the period which the parties contemplated).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">2. <em>Counsel\u2019s role. </em>Mr. O\u2019Leary was Workshop\u2019s attorney from the earliest days of the parties\u2019 negotiations in 1966 and continued to represent Workshop and its principal throughout the trial of this action and the present appeal. Three motions before three different Superior Court judges (including the trial judge) were brought by Kern to disqualify Mr. O\u2019Leary from trying the case. All three judges denied the motions. Workshop\u2019s principal insisted on Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s representation of him and Workshop. The trial judge made it clear that he would not permit Mr. O\u2019Leary \u201cto appear voluntarily as a witness for his clients while he was functioning as their trial counsel.\u201d Mr. O\u2019Leary was not called as a witness by Kern. There was no error in denying the motions to require Mr. O\u2019Leary to withdraw pursuant to S.J.C. Rule 3:07, DR 5-102 (A), as appearing in 382 Mass. 780 (1981). A judge should order disqualification only when the decision \u201cto forgo the testimony of counsel appears obviously contrary to the client\u2019s interests.\u201d <em>Borman </em>v. <em>Borman, </em>378 Mass. 775, 791 (1979). In this case, the record does not indicate that Mr. O\u2019Leary\u2019s decision not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>to withdraw affected his clients\u2019 hope of success. See <em>id. </em>However, Mr. O\u2019Leary should have shown the good sense to step aside voluntarily because his intimacy with all the facets of the case led him to lead, suggest, and almost testify while interrogating the witnesses. This is manifestly undesirable and it rendered the trial judge\u2019s task (already a formidable one), a most difficult one.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">3. <em>Judicial notice. </em>There was no error in the judge\u2019s not taking judicial notice of a redevelopment project within 200 yards of the premises because that project was not the subject of such general knowledge and notoriety as to require judicial notice. See <em>Mady </em>v. <em>Holy Trinity Roman Catholic Polish Church, </em>223 Mass. 23, 26 (1916).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">4. <em>Conclusion. </em>Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Superior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b294-12\"> We shall refer to the defendants as Workshop.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
