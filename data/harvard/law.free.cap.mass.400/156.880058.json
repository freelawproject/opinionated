L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4 (1) and (4). The commission, affirming the decision of the hearing commissioner, had decided that College-Town was liable because its supervisor had created a sexually harassing work environment, because it had failed to remedy the situation, and because it had retaliated against Rizzi in seeking to transfer her and in discharging her when she declined the transfer. College-Town argues that the commission\u2019s decision was not supported by substantial evidence and is incorrect as a matter of law. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">We summarize the facts as they were found by the hearing commissioner. Loretta Rizzi began working at College-Town in March, 1979, as a \u201cproduction clerical.\u201d Several weeks after Rizzi was hired, her supervisor, Chester Broad, began making sexually suggestive comments to her, such as \u201cYou have a sexy voice on the phone\u201d and \u201cYou have a sexy walk. I like the way you walk.\u201d On one occasion, Broad approached her as she sat at her desk, placed his hand on her back and said, \u201cBoy, you have a firm back for a broad your age.\u201d Later that month, Broad telephoned her from another company facility, and asked, \u201cHey, how about our getting together? I\u2019ll practice my judo and you practice your karate at your apartment.\u201d Another time, Broad came over to Rizzi as she sat at her desk, covered the slit in her dress, and said, \u201cFix your skirt.\u201d In June, 1979, Rizzi asked Broad to evaluate her performance in a meeting earlier that day. Broad responded, \u201cYou handled it very well. Do you know the best way you handled it? I liked the way your tits stood out in the red shirt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">In July or early August, 1979, the character of Broad\u2019s remarks changed. On one occasion, Broad looked around to see if anyone was listening, and then turned to Rizzi and asked, \u201cAre you a good f \u2014 ?\u201d Rizzi replied that it was none of Broad\u2019s business, and then went to the women\u2019s room and cried because she felt \u201ccheap and degraded.\u201d When Rizzi told a coworker of Broad\u2019s remarks, the coworker urged her to speak with Mike Levy, the director of manufacturing. Rizzi went to Levy\u2019s office on Friday, August 17, 1979, and told him that Broad had been sexually harassing her since April. Levy told her he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>did not want to hear details because he was not \u201cqualified to go into these things.\u201d Levy referred Rizzi to Claire Bergman in the personnel department. Rizzi was not able to meet with Bergman until the following Tuesday, at which time Rizzi told Bergman about Broad\u2019s harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">In the meantime, Broad propositioned Rizzi again, putting his head close to hers and saying, \u201cAre you a good f \u2014 ?\u201d Rizzi began to cry. Broad handed her some tissues, and said, \u201cHey, hey, hey, cut it out. You are going to get me in trouble. I say that to my wife\u2019s girlfriends all the time. They are in the same boat that you are in.\u201d Rizzi reported this incident to Bergman, and expressed concern that she might lose a promotion she had been seeking.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Bergman directed Levy to speak with Broad about the accusations, and then spoke with Broad herself. Broad denied the allegations and stated that, in fact, Rizzi had made sexually suggestive comments to him. Bergman decided to call a meeting of Broad\u2019s staff to determine the truth of the allegations. Broad and all the other women in the department, except Rizzi, attended. Rizzi was neither asked to the meeting nor notified of its occurrence and purpose. At the meeting, Bergman and Broad explained the allegations Rizzi had made against Broad. Broad remained in the room throughout the meeting. The coworkers were not asked any questions about the alleged incidents, but did \u201cexpress dismay at the allegations and were generally supportive of Broad.\u201d Three of Rizzi\u2019s coworkers later testified that they had never observed any conduct by Broad which might constitute sexual harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">College-Town made no further investigation, although vice president Carl Packer testified that he believed College-Town was never satisfied it had determined the truth of Rizzi\u2019s allegations. None of the staff was questioned at the meeting or individually. College-Town never provided Rizzi with the opportunity to present her case before her coworkers or to confront Broad. In fact, College-Town took no further action on the matter, did not further interview Rizzi, and did not issue a warning to or take disciplinary action against Broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>During the same period in 1979, Rizzi began seeking a promotion to a position in another department as assistant to Ed Gordon, director in charge of duplicates. Although Rizzi sought this position while Broad\u2019s harassment occurred, the harassment does not appear to have been her motive in seeking the position. Rizzi first complained to Levy and Bergman of Broad\u2019s harassment, in part, because of her concern that it might jeopardize her chances of receiving the promotion. Shortly before the meeting of the office staff concerning Rizzi\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment, Gordon informed Levy that Rizzi was not qualified for the position. Following the meeting of the office staff concerning the sexual harassment charges, Levy informed Rizzi that she was not qualified for the promotion. College-Town subsequently hired a person with more knowledge and experience. On October 9, 1979, Rizzi filed a complaint with the commission alleging that she had been sexually harassed and had been denied the promotion in retaliation for complaining about the harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">After Rizzi filed her complaint, Packer, Levy, and Bergman became concerned that tension in the allocation office was affecting productivity. They decided to transfer Rizzi to a similar position in a nearby facility; Rizzi could easily be transferred, they testified at trial, while Broad was considered essential. Bergman offered Rizzi the transfer on October 1, 1979. Rizzi declined, telling Bergman that she would consider only a position equivalent to the promotion that she had been seeking. Bergman told Rizzi to think about it over the weekend. On the following Monday, Rizzi again declined the transfer. At no time did Bergman tell Rizzi that the transfer was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">On October 25, 1979, Packer called Rizzi into his office, and said, \u201cLoretta, it has come to my attention that you are suing College-Town. It\u2019s been done before. Here is your vacation, your severance pay or whatever, and good luck. May I have your badge?\u201d Packer testified that Rizzi was fired for refusing the mandatory transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">On November 5, 1979, Rizzi amended her complaint to allege that her discharge was in retaliation for filing the original complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>After a hearing, the hearing commissioner found that Broad had sexually harassed Rizzi, that College-Town\u2019s investigation of Rizzi\u2019s allegations was incomplete, inadequate, insensitive to Rizzi and deferential to Broad, and that both the transfer and discharge were retaliatory. The hearing commissioner found that Rizzi was not offered the promotion because she was not qualified, and not in retaliation for complaining about Broad\u2019s sexual harassment. The hearing commissioner awarded Rizzi damages amounting to $10,000 for emotional distress resulting from the harassment and discharge, back pay of $7,733.81, plus interest at the statutory rate of twelve percent per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">College-Town appealed to the full commission, which affirmed the decision of the hearing commissioner, concluding that his decision was supported by substantial evidence and was correct in the application of the law. College-Town sought judicial review of the commission\u2019s decision in the Superior Court, arguing that the decision was not supported by substantial evidence and contained errors of law. The judge affirmed the commission\u2019s decision. College-Town appealed the judge\u2019s decision and this court, on its own motion, took the case for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">1. This court has not previously been presented with the questions whether sexual harassment constitutes discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), and on what basis an employer may be found liable. General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, as amended through St. 1965, c. 397, \u00a7 4, provides: \u201cIt shall be an unlawful practice: 1. For an employer, by himself or his agent, because of the race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, ... or ancestry of any individual, to refuse to hire or employ or to bar or to discharge from employment such individual or to discriminate against such individual in compensation or in terms, conditions or privileges of employment, unless based upon a bona fide occupational qualification.\u201d General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, as amended through St. 1974, c. 478, provides in part: \u201cThe provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>We conclude, and College-Town cites no authority to the contrary, that sexual harassment may constitute discrimination in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Chapter 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), prohibits employment discrimination on the basis of gender, and seeks the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to full participation in the workplace. A work environment pervaded by harassment or abuse, with the resulting intimidation, humiliation, and stigmatization, poses a formidable barrier to the full participation of an individual in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The discrimination prohibited by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (1), encompasses a work environment pervaded by abuse and harassment. Section 4 (1) applies not only to hiring, firing, and compensation, but also to the \u201cterms, conditions or privileges of employment.\u201d Clearly, within the broad sweep of that language falls conduct which creates a sexually harassing work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">2. College-Town argues that the hearing commissioner erred in concluding that Rizzi had been subjected to a sexually harassing work environment. We disagree. The hearing commissioner found that, over a period of several months, Broad had engaged in a pattern of unwelcome sexual conduct toward Rizzi, including offensive comments, touching, and sexual propositions. Broad\u2019s behavior was sufficiently pervasive to alter the conditions of Rizzi\u2019s employment, and thus created a sexually harassing working environment. As a result, Broad\u2019s conduct created a barrier, based solely on gender, to Rizzi\u2019s full and untrammelled participation in the workplace. General Laws c. 15 IB, \u00a7 4, was intended to remove these discriminatory barriers. Therefore, the hearing commissioner was warranted in concluding that Broad\u2019s conduct constituted discrimination based on sex within the meaning of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>3. College-Town argues that it should not be liable for Broad\u2019s conduct. College-Town contends that an employer should be liable for sexual harassment only if (1) a supervisor sexually harasses an employee in exercising the power to hire, fire, or determine compensation and promotion, or (2) the employer is aware of sexual harassment in the workplace, whether caused by supervisors, coworkers, or customers, and fails to take adequate steps to remedy the situation. While we agree that College-Town has described two instances in which an employer would be liable, College-Town has not defined the full scope of an employer\u2019s liability for sexual harassment in the workplace.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">College-Town argues that we should distinguish \u201cquid pro quo\u201d harassment, in which a supervisor conditions tangible job benefits on submission to sexual demands or harassment, from the creation of a sexually harassing work environment, without the conditioning of tangible job benefits. College-Town relies on Federal cases interpreting Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for this distinction, as does the dissent in this case. In interpreting our statute, we may look to the interpretations of Title VII of the analogous Federal statute; we are not, however, bound by interpretations of the Federal statute in construing our own State statute. <em>Massachusetts Elec. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 160, 167 (1978). \u201cTitle VII and the decisions construing it are not determinative of the questions presented in this case; rather the issue presented is purely one of the interpretation of a Massachusetts statute. . . . While interpretations of a Federal statute which is similar to the State statute under consideration are often helpful in setting forth all the various policy considerations, such interpretations are not binding on a State court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>construing its own State statute.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Id. </em>Even if we assume that Federal precedents support College-Town\u2019s position, we do not rely on those precedents.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>College-Town argues that it should not be \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for the conduct of a supervisor creating a sexually harassing work environment. We disagree with College-Town\u2019s reasoning and characterization of its liability. We are not presented with the question whether G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, imposes an affirmative obligation on an employer to ensure that its workplace is not pervaded by harassment based on race, color, religious creed, national origin, sex, or ancestry, regardless of the source of the harassment. College-Town is, in this case, vicariously liable for the acts of its agents \u2014 its supervisory personnel. General Laws c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, prohibits discrimination by \u201can employer, by himself or his agent.\u201d Furthermore, G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 9, provides that \u201c[t]he provisions of this chapter shall be construed liberally for the accomplishment of the purposes thereof . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It is clear that the Legislature intended that an employer be liable for discrimination committed by those on whom it confers authority. We disagree with College-Town\u2019s reasoning that the authority conferred on a supervisor is not related to the creation of a sexually harassing environment. That reasoning simply is not a realistic assessment of the dynamics of sexual harassment in the workplace. The Legislature sought to remove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>discriminatory barriers to full participation in the workforce. Supervisors who create a sexually harassing work environment present a serious barrier to that goal. Harassment by a supervisor stigmatizes an employee, and appears to reflect an attitude of the employer that the employee is not considered equal to other employees. In addition, harassment by a supervisor carries an implied threat that the supervisor will punish resistance through exercising supervisory powers, which may range from discharge to assignment of work, particularly exacting scrutiny, or refusal to protect the employee from coworker harassment. Quid pro quo harassment may be easier to identify as an abuse of the authority vested in a supervisor because of the effect on tangible job conditions, but it does not define the limit of a supervisor\u2019s authority. Although coworkers or even outsiders may also be capable of creating a sexually harassing work environment, it is the authority conferred upon a supervisor by the employer that makes the supervisor particularly able to force subordinates to submit to sexual harassment. See generally Note, Sexual Harassment Claims of Abusive Work Environment Under Title VII, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1449, 1461-1462 (1984); Note, Sexual Harassment and Title VII: The Foundation for the Elimination of Sexual Cooperation as an Employment Condition, 76 Mich. L. Rev. 1007, 1026-1027 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">The commission has consistently found an employer liable for sexual harassment of subordinates committed by its supervisors. <em>See Brodeur v. Harney\u2019s Superstore, </em>5 M.D.L.R. 1335 (1983); <em>Emmons </em>v. <em>Codex, </em>4 M.D.L.R. 1523 (1982). We note that \u201can administrative interpretation of a statute is accorded deference particularly \u2018where, as here, an agency must interpret a legislative policy which is only broadly set out in the governing statute.\u2019\u201d <em>School Comm. of Wellesley </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>376 Mass. 112, 116 (1978), quoting <em>Consolidated Cigar Corp. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Health, </em>372 Mass. 844, 850 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">We also note an anomaly in College-Town\u2019s position. College-Town concedes that an employer is liable for sexual harassment in the workplace if the employer is notified of the condition and fails to take adequate steps to remedy the sit\u00faa-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tian. If the harassment in this case had been committed by someone other than Rizzi\u2019s supervisor, Broad, and Rizzi had informed Broad of the situation, College-Town would thereby have been notified, and would have had an affirmative obligation to remedy the situation. At the same time, College-Town argues that it should not be vicariously liable for sexual harassment committed by Broad himself. We do not think that the Legislature intended employers to be liable for their supervisors\u2019 discriminatory acts in exercising their supervisory powers only after the employee complains to the employer. \u201cWe are not insensitive to the fact that \u2018employees are understandably reticent to complain or try to prove affronts of such a personal and debasing nature [as sexual harassment].\u201d\u2019 <em>Zirelli </em>v. <em>Director of the Div. of Employment Sec., </em>394 Mass. 229, 232 (1985), quoting <em>Colduvell </em>v. <em>Unemployment Compensation Bd. of Review, </em>48 Pa. Commw. 185, 187 (1979). The shortcomings of a system requiring notice to the employer are particularly pronounced where it is the employee\u2019s supervisor who commits sexual harassment. We see no reason why an employer should be liable for a supervisor who fails to remedy or report coworker harassment, but not for the supervisor\u2019s own harassment of subordinates.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">In this case, we conclude that the commission did not err in finding College-Town liable for Broad\u2019s sexual harassment. Broad was Rizzi\u2019s supervisor, and College-Town had conferred on him substantial authority over his subordinates. By the terms of G. L. c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, therefore, College-Town is liable for discrimination committed by Broad.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">4. The hearing commissioner also found that College-Town discriminated against Rizzi in violation of G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, by failing to take adequate steps to remedy the situation once Rizzi complained of Broad\u2019s harassment. College-Town does not contest that an employer who is notified of sexual harassment in the workplace and fails to take adequate remedial action violates G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">In this case, the hearing commissioner found that College-Town did not conduct a fair orthorough investigation of Rizzi\u2019s allegation of sexual harassment. Rizzi was never informed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>about the staff meeting, while Broad was present throughout. The staff were never questioned individually. Rizzi was never provided an opportunity to confront Broad, nor was she interviewed after Broad and the staff had been approached. No disciplinary action was taken, nor was a warning issued to Broad. The hearing commissioner concluded that the investigation was \u201cdeferential and inadequate.\u201d The commissioner\u2019s conclusion was supported by substantial evidence, and there was no error of law. See G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6; G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (as appearing in St. 1973, c. 1114, \u00a7 3); <em>Springfield Bd. of Police Comm\u2019rs </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>375 Mass. 782, 782-783 (1978); <em>Wheelock College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 130, 132-133 (1976); <em>Katz </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>365 Mass. 357, 364-365 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">5. College-Town argues that the hearing commissioner erred in finding that its attempted transfer and subsequent discharge of Rizzi were in retaliation for her claims of sexual harassment. We disagree. The Legislature recognized that a person who complained of discrimination risked retaliation, and separately prohibited retaliation. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a74 (4). The hearing commissioner found that College-Town decided to transfer Rizzi to relieve \u201ctension\u201d in the department where Rizzi and Broad worked, and did not consider moving Broad, who was deemed essential, while the plaintiff was regarded as easily replaceable. The commissioner also found that College-Town never informed Rizzi that the transfer was mandatory, and that its vice president, Packer, said when he fired her, \u201c[I]t has come to my attention that you are suing College-Town. It\u2019s been done before. Here is your vacation, your severance pay or whatever, and good luck. May I have your badge? \u201d Substantial evidence supported the hearing commissioner\u2019s conclusion, and there was no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">We reject College-Town\u2019s argument that, in refusing the transfer, Rizzi failed to mitigate damages, and the hearing commissioner therefore erred in awarding her back pay. First, the hearing commissioner found that Rizzi was never told that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>the transfer was mandatory. Therefore, she could not be required to accept the transfer to mitigate a discharge she did not know was forthcoming. Second, both the transfer and the discharge were in retaliation for Rizzi\u2019s allegations of sexual harassment. Rizzi was not required to submit to retaliatory treatment itself proscribed by G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4 (4), in order to reduce College-Town\u2019s liability for prior discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">6. College-Town contests the hearing commissioner\u2019s award of damages for emotional distress. There was no error in the hearing commissioner\u2019s decision to admit in evidence a letter from a psychologist who had treated Rizzi, and a statement of charges for the treatment. Although the hearing commissioner erroneously stated that the documents were admissible under G. L. c. 233, \u00a7 79G, the commission is not bound by the strict rules of evidence. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 11 (2). Furthermore, the commissioner was warranted in finding damages for emotional distress based on other evidence, including Rizzi\u2019s testimony about the harassment and retaliatory discharge. See <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>371 Mass. 303, 315-317 (1976); <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>20 Mass. App. Ct. 172, 182-183 (1985). Finally, College-Town argues that Rizzi\u2019s damages for emotional distress were compensable exclusively under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 26. College-Town is precluded from arguing this issue on appeal because it failed to raise it before the commission, and has shown no extraordinary circumstances excusing its failure or neglect. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. Moreover, even if College-Town had properly raised the issue, we do not agree that damages in this case resulting from the violation ofG.L.c. 15IB, \u00a7 4, are compensable exclusively under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act. See <em>Foley </em>v. <em>Polaroid Corp., </em>381 Mass. 545, 553 (1980). See also G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">7. College-Town argues that the commissioner did not have authority to award interest, and even if he did, he misapplied the rates and incorrectly calculated the interest. We conclude that the commissioner did not err in the award of interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>The commission is given broad authority to remedy discrimination, and that authority extends to awarding interest to make victims whole for their damages. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 5. See <em>Bournewood Hosp., Inc., supra </em>at 315-317; <em>Buckley Nursing Home, Inc., supra </em>at 181-182. See also <em>School Comm. of Newton </em>v. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n, </em>388 Mass. 557, 579-580 (1983). We note that the commission has looked to G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 6B, for guidance in determining the rate and in calculating interest. We conclude that the commission did not err in awarding interest from the commencement of the proceeding. Cf. <em>Gill </em>v. <em>North Shore Radiological Assocs., </em>385 Mass. 180, 183 (1982); <em>Charles D. Bonanno Linen Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>McCarthy, </em>550 F. Supp. 231, 247 (D. Mass. 1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">8. Finally, College-Town devotes a considerable portion of its brief to challenging the commissioner\u2019s findings of fact. Our review is limited to determining whether the commissioner\u2019s findings and conclusions were supported by substantial evidence, and whether there was an error of law. G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 6. G.

See <em>Smith College </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Comm\u2019n Against Discrimination, </em>376 Mass. 221, 224 (1978). Based upon our review of the entire record, we conclude that the commissioner\u2019s findings and decision, as approved by the commission, were supported by substantial evidence and there was no error of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b178-7\"> Although we need not, and do not, rely on Federal precedents to support our conclusion, we do observe that the Federal cases interpreting Title VII are in accord that sexual harassment, including the creation of a sexually harassing work environment, may constitute discrimination on the basis of sex under Title VII. <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB, </em>v. <em>Vinson, 477 </em>U.S. 57, 63-69 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b179-6\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-(2)(a)(l) (1982), makes it \u201can unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d Congress has defined \u201cemployer\u201d to include any \u201cagent\u201d of an employer. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e (b) (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b180-5\"> We think, also, that the Federal cases interpreting Title VII are in some disarray with regard to the precise limits to employer liability for harassment by supervisors of their subordinates. In <em>Henson </em>v. <em>Dundee, </em>682 F.2d 897, 909-910 (11th Cir. 1982), the United States Court- of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit distinguished sexual discrimination by supervisors which causes tangible job detriment from a sexually harassing work environment. The court concluded that, under Title VII, an employer is \u201cstrictly liable\u201d for sexual discrimination by supervisors that causes tangible job detriment. <em>Id. </em>at 910. \u201cWhen [the employer gave] its [supervisory personnel] authority to fire employees, it also accepted responsibility to remedy any harm caused by [the supervisors\u2019] unlawful exercise of that authority. The modem corporate entity consists of the individuals who manage it, and little, if any, progress in eradicating discrimination in employment will be made if the corporate employer is able to hide behind the shield of individual employee action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 909, quoting <em>Tidwell </em>v. <em>American Oil Co., </em>332 F. Supp. 424, 436 (D. Utah 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals reasoned that a sexually harassing work environment caused by a supervisor does not present the same basis for employer liability, reasoning that \u201c[t]he environment in which an employee works can be rendered offensive in an equal degree by the acts of supervisors, . . . coworkers, ... or even strangers to the workplace\u201d (citations omitted). <em>Id. </em>at 910. \u201cThe capacity of any person to create a hostile or offensive environment is not necessarily enhanced or diminished by any degree of authority which the employer confers upon that individual <em>.\u2019\u2019Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">Several Federal courts have concluded that notice to the \u201cemployer\u201d is not required where a supervisor sexually harasses subordinates.

The Court did state that \u201cCongress wanted courts to look to agency principles for guidance in this area.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that employers are not \u201calways automatically liable for sexual harassment by their supervisors,\u201d but also that \u201cabsence of notice to an employer does not necessarily insulate that employer from liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Four members of the Court concurred, finding the question of the employer\u2019s liability properly before the Court, and concluded that \u201csexual harassment by a supervisor of an employee under his supervision, leading to a discriminatory work environment, should be imputed to the employer for Title VII purposes regardless of whether the employee gave \u2018notice\u2019 of the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 78 (Marshall, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">It is not clear what application the Federal courts will give to \u201cagency principles\u201d in interpreting Title VII after <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB, </em>v. <em>Vinson, supra. </em>Whatever application the <em>Henson </em>distinction receives in cases interpreting Title VII, we conclude that, in enacting G. L. c. 151B, \u00a7 4, the Legislature intended that an employer be liable for discrimination committed by those on whom it confers authority, without an additional notice requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b186-7\">Lynch, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A30\">(dissenting in part, with whom Nolan and O\u2019Con-nor, JJ., join).

In an opinion notably devoid of precedential support the court concludes that College-Town is vicariously liable for the conduct of Broad. In so doing it relegates the strong body of contrary Federal precedent to a footnote, and ignores traditional common law principles for imposing liability upon an employer for the acts of its employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">In concluding that vicarious liability is appropriate in this case, the court follows neither the Court of Appeals in <em>Henson </em>v. <em>Dundee, </em>682 F.2d 897 (11th Cir. 1982), nor the United States Supreme Court in <em>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB, </em>v. <em>Vinson, 477 </em>U.S. 57 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">In <em>Henson, </em>the Court of Appeals ruled that, \u201c[wjhere, as here, the plaintiff seeks to hold the employer responsible for the hostile environment created by the plaintiff\u2019s supervisor or coworker, she must show that the employer knew or should have known of the harassment in question and failed to take prompt remedial action. <em>See Bundy </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>641 F.2d [934] 943 &amp; n.8; <em>Vinson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>23 Fair Empl.

Supp. 636, 641 (N.D. Ohio 1986) (relying on United States Court of Appeals decision in <em>Vinson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>753 F.2d 141 (D.C. Cir. 1985); <em>Jeppsen </em>v. <em>Wunnicke, </em>611 F. Supp. 78, 80-83 (D. Alaska 1985) (same). See also <em>Crimm </em>v. <em>Missouri Pac. Ry., </em>750 F.2d 703, 710 (8th Cir. 1984) (acknowledging respondeat superior requirement articulated in Henson); <em>Vermett v. Hough, </em>627 F. Supp. 587, 606-607 (W.D. Mich. 1986) (same). In a singular departure from this general rule the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in an opinion also significantly lacking in precedential support, held that any discriminatory activity by a supervisor is attributable to the employer. <em>Vinson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>753 F.2d 141 (D.C. Cir. 1985). In reviewing <em>that </em>decision, however, the United States Supreme Court held that the Court of Appeals was wrong in entirely disregarding agency principles and in imposing absolute liability on employers for the acts of their supervisors regardless of the circumstances of a particular case. The Supreme Court cited with approval the Restatement (Second) of Agency \u00a7\u00a7 219-237 (1958), and noted that the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission believes \u201cthat when a sexual harassment claim rests exclusively on a \u2018hostile environment\u2019 theory, ... the usual basis for a finding of agency will often disappear.\u201d <em>Meritor, supra </em>at 77-78. The grievance in <em>Meritor </em>involved a sexually harassing work environment claim (hostile environment), which was the same as the basis for the commission\u2019s finding of sexual harassment here. The underlying facts of the dispute in <em>Meritor </em>are significant. The plaintiff\u2019s employment and rapid advancement were based on merit and did not depend on the sexual activity upon which she based her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>complaint. During the period of her employment and rapid promotion, she had a voluntary, intimate sexual relationship with a supervisor which, among other things, involved forty or fifty instances of sexual relations over two years. This sexual activity stopped about one year prior to the incident which brought about her complaint. She was discharged for taking six weeks of unauthorized sick leave for a vaguely described condition. She was still on sick leave when the discharge occurred. She did not report her claim of sexual harassment to anyone prior to her discharge, nor did any other female employee file a complaint or grievance about the supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">On these facts, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit would have imposed liability on her employer under the same rule indorsed by the court here. The Supreme Court rejected that rule, however, and held that its application by the Court of Appeals was error. Although unwilling to lay down a definitive rule on employer liability because of the abstract quality of that case, the Supreme Court made clear that agency principles should provide guidance in determining employers\u2019 liability, but indicated that exceptions would be appropriate, such as where the conduct was so pervasive and so long continuing that the employer must have known about it or perhaps where no reasonable avenue of complaint was available.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">The court\u2019s opinion therefore ignores traditional common law concepts and cavalierly disposes of the significant contrary precedent without serious analysis. This, we are told, is because the result is mandated by the clear intent of the Legislature. If so, it is an intent nowhere expressed in the statute itself nor in any legislative history of which the reader is made aware. On so sterile a showing I am unable to discern a legislative intent that common law principles and Federal precedent be avoided in order to find an employer liable for unauthorized conduct not specifically forbidden by the statute. In so doing, the court applies a concept of discrimination recognized in the Federal decisions that the court conveniently ignores which, while condemning the conduct, would mandate a contrary re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>suit. On the contrary, I find no suggestion that the Legislature intended to impose liability on an employer because a supervisor created a \u201csexually charged atmosphere\u201d that was unrelated to gain or loss of employment or economic benefits, where the conduct was contrary to the employer\u2019s policy, of no benefit to the employer, and with no showing that the employer knew or should have known about the conduct. In such cases, I would find liability only where accepted agency principles would attribute the supervisor\u2019s conduct to the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Neither would I impose liability in this case because of the nature of the employer\u2019s investigation of the employee\u2019s complaints. The findings establish that the employer acted promptly on the plaintiff\u2019s complaints; action was commenced on the next business day. The investigation included those employees who would have been expected to have knowledge of the incidents. Even though no corroboration of the employee\u2019s complaints was divulged, the employer took remedial action by allowing the plaintiff to change her work area, and thereafter she told her employer everything was fine. Although the commission is critical of the employer\u2019s investigation, there was no corroboration of the employee\u2019s complaints on the record before it or other evidence not discovered by the employer. The employer was, therefore, faced with the problem of resolving a credibility contest between a recently hired employee and a comparatively senior supervisor. Nevertheless, the employer took action which could not fairly be termed an unreasonable response to the allegations. An employer should not have liability imposed on it for failing to conduct an investigation that would have been more in accordance with a lawyer\u2019s understanding of due process but which would have disclosed no additional facts and which could not have been expected to produce any different remedial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Although I find support in the record for the commission\u2019s belated findings of retaliatory discharge, I would reverse because the damages imposed would not be appropriate on that aspect of the case alone. I would not reach the question of the employee\u2019s entitlement to damages for emotional distress.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b187-7\">The Federal decisions are not in disarray as the court contends, but in general agreement except for the Court of Appeals decision in <em>Vinson </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>which is discussed in detail in the text.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
