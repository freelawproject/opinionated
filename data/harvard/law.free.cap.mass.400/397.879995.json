L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (1984 ed.), to overturn the decision of the State Racing Commission (commission) (1) upholding the defendant Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc.\u2019s (Wonderland) exclusion of the plaintiffs from Wonderland\u2019s premises, and (2) suspending the licenses of some of the plaintiffs. A judge in the Superior Court reversed the decision of the commission as to the plaintiff Edward Ross and affirmed it as to the remaining plaintiffs. The plaintiffs, except Ross, appealed. The defendants cross appealed as to Ross. We allowed the plaintiff appellants\u2019 application for direct appellate review, and now affirm the judgment below except as to Ross. We reverse the judgment as to Ross, and remand the case to the Superior Court with instructions to enter a judgment affirming the commission\u2019s decision as to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>On May 31, 1985, the plaintiffs, acting in concert, refused to enter their greyhounds for racing at Wonderland as scheduled. As a result, Wonderland\u2019s management and the commission made a decision to cancel that evening\u2019s racing. On the following day, Wonderland issued ejection notices to the plaintiffs pursuant to G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A (1984 ed.). That statute provides in part that \u201cany person licensed to conduct a horse or dog racing meeting . . . shall have the right to . . . eject from its premises any person whose presence on said premises is detrimental, in the sole judgment of the . . . said licensee, to the proper and orderly conduct of a racing meeting. Any person who has been notified by ... a licensee of a racing meeting not to enter or attempt to enter its premises and who thereafter, without the express approval of ... a licensee, enters or attempts to enter such premises while a racing meeting is being conducted therein, shall be punished .... Any person so excluded by ... a licensee shall have a right of appeal to the commission. The commission shall hold a hearing within ten days after any such person requests an appeal and may after such hearing by vote allow such person admission to such meeting.\u201d In accordance with \u00a7 10A, the notices sent by Wonderland to the plaintiffs had the effect of excluding the plaintiffs from Wonderland unless and until the commission on appeal gave them permission to enter. The notices also triggered the operation of 205 Code Mass. Regs. \u00a7 5.29 (17) (1981), which provides that a \u201cperson ejected from the grounds of an Association licensed by the Commission shall be refused admission to the grounds of all other licensed Associations in Massachusetts until he has been permitted to re-enter the track where he was originally ejected . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Pursuant to c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, the plaintiffs appealed their \u201cejections\u201d to the commission. The commission conducted a prompt hearing and rendered extensive findings and orders upholding Wonderland\u2019s action. The commission also suspended the licenses of some of the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">The commission found that the plaintiffs had \u201cconspired together and acting in concert intentionally <em>refused </em>to weigh in their greyhounds at Wonderland Park on May 31, 1985, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>knowing their actions would result in the cancellation of that evening\u2019s racing program\u201d (emphasis in original). The commission also found that the underlying motivation for the boycott was the plaintiffs\u2019 desire to \u201cshow strength and to gain leverage over both Wonderland and the Racing Commission to relax the Rules and Regulations of Greyhound Racing.\u201d Moreover, the commission found the ramifications of the boycott and the resulting cancellation of the races to be far reaching. Those ramifications included the risk of injury to patrons due to the possible unruliness of a crowd whose expectations for the evening had been thwarted, as well as the probable damage to Wonderland\u2019s reputation and the loss of revenue suffered by the Commonwealth, Wonderland, and nonboycotting kennels.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Based on its findings, the commission concluded that Wonderland had acted \u201creasonably and justifiably\u201d in excluding the plaintiffs from the race track pursuant to G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A. The commission reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 presence at the track following the events of May 31, 1985, \u201cwould have created a dangerous situation whereby the [plaintiffs] may have intimidated or coerced other licensees, who honored their commitments and brought dogs to the race track, into joining the boycott, possibly closing the race track definitely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">The commission, however, did set dates on which the plaintiffs would be entitled to return to the Wonderland track. Different dates were set for individual plaintiffs, the latest of which was June 1, 1986. June 1, 1986, was also the latest date set by the commission on which any plaintiff whose license had been suspended would again be eligible for licensing. Thus, none of the plaintiffs is now excluded from the Wonderland track or any other Massachusetts race track on account of the boycott, and no relevant license suspension is now in effect. Since the only relief the plaintiffs seek is that \u201cthe suspensions and ejections appealed [from] be reversed,\u201d and the periods of exclusion and license suspension have expired, we must determine at the outset what issues argued by the parties we ought to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">We do not treat as moot so much of the case as involves the constitutionality of the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusion from the Won<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>derland track (the ejection issue) or the suspension of the plaintiffs\u2019 licenses. We decide those issues because the ejections and license suspensions, if left standing, may adversely affect the plaintiffs\u2019 ability to obtain employment or to engage in racing in the future both in Massachusetts and elsewhere. General Laws c. 128A, \u00a7 11, provides: \u201cThe commission shall have full discretion to refuse to grant a license ... or to suspend or revoke the license of any licensee. If any license is suspended or revoked, the commission shall make a record of its reasdns for doing so and such record shall be made available to any person requesting to inspect the same.\u201d The commission concedes that it could take the plaintiffs\u2019 record into account in determining the severity of sanctions for future violations of its regulations, and it is reasonable to suppose that, in other jurisdictions, the plaintiffs may be harmed by an unfavorable record in this Commonwealth. These potential adverse consequences are sufficient to justify our consideration of the ejections and the license suspensions. The principle is akin to that involved when an appellate court reviews a criminal conviction even after the defendant has completed his sentence. See <em>Sibron </em>v. <em>New York, </em>392 U.S. 40, 57 (1968); <em>Department of Youth Servs. </em>v. A <em>Juvenile, </em>384 Mass. 784, 786 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The plaintiffs also argue that their ejection by Wonderland, coupled with the commission\u2019s notifying all other Massachusetts race tracks of that action, resulting in the plaintiffs\u2019 exclusion from those tracks as well as Wonderland\u2019s, prior to any hearing, effectively suspended their licenses and did so in violation of their statutory and constitutional rights. However, the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that they were entitled to a preejection hearing is moot because they have been given a hearing and their ejection was upheld. A determination by us that the ejections should not have been effective before the hearing would not advance the plaintiffs\u2019 entitlement to the relief they seek in this case, which is that the record of their ejection be expunged altogether. The plaintiffs\u2019 attack on their exclusion from tracks other than Wonderland\u2019s is also moot because the plaintiffs are no longer excluded and their record, which may affect future opportunities, is not affected by whether their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>ejection from Wonderland affected their rights to enter other Massachusetts tracks. Of course, we have discretion to answer questions which are moot, and we have occasionally chosen to do so when the question was of public importance and appeared likely to be repeated but also to evade review. <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>396 Mass. 1001 <em>(1985). Lockhart v. Attorney Gen., </em>390 Mass. 780, 782-784 (1984). But, we are not persuaded that we ought to address the moot issues in this case, especially because the plaintiffs\u2019 challenges are in large measure constitutionally based and we have a long tradition of not unnecessarily deciding constitutional questions. <em>Id. </em>at 784.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">Turning to the issues which are not moot, we first address the question whether G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, authorizes the exclusion of persons the commission has licensed under G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 9A, to participate in horse and dog racing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>10A provides that \u201cany person\u201d whose presence is detrimental to the orderly conduct of racing may be ejected. The statute does not expressly discriminate between licensees and others, and the statute must be accorded its plain and ordinary meaning. <em>Telesetsky </em>v. <em>Wight, </em>395 Mass. 868, 872 (1985). <em>Baldiga </em>v. <em>Board of Appeals of Uxbridge, </em>395 Mass. 829, 832 (1985). Furthermore, \u00a7 10A, providing for ejections of persons from premises where racing is conducted, was added to G. L. c. 128A after \u00a7 9A, providing for licensing owners and trainers of dogs, and \u00a711, providing for suspension of licenses, had been added. That fact suggests that the Legislature added \u00a7 10A in response to its perception that license suspensions and revocations were insufficient to maintain order at horse and dog racing tracks, and that it was necessary to authorize the commission and those licensed to conduct horse and dog racing to take swift action against anyone whose presence imperils the normal operation of the track. Only if \u00a7 10A applies to licensees can this goal be realized. Finally, our construction of \u00a7 10A as authorizing the ejection of licensees accords with the construction given to the statute by the commission. The commission\u2019s construction is entitled to weight. <em>Casa Loma, Inc. </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n, </em>377 Mass. 231, 235 (1979). <em>Board of Educ. </em>v. <em>Assessors of Worcester, </em>368 Mass. 511, 515 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">In addition to their argument that the Legislature did not intend c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, to apply to licensed racing participants, the plaintiffs argue that, by affirming their exclusion from Wonderland\u2019s track, and by suspending their licenses, the commission violated their Federal and State constitutional rights of free speech and assembly.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We are unpersuaded by the plaintiffs\u2019 arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The First Amendment safeguards the \u201ccommunication or expression of ideas or information.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, </em>387 Mass. 864, 868 (1983). The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>tiffs\u2019 principal contention is that the boycott constituted \u201csymbolic speech\u201d or \u201cexpressive conduct\u201d entitled to First Amendment protection. But, we are not told what idea or information, if any, was expressed or intended to be expressed by the boycott, and we discern none. \u201c[I]t is the obligation of the person desiring to engage in assertedly expressive conduct to demonstrate that the First Amendment . . . applies. To hold otherwise would be to create a rule that all conduct is presump-, tively expressive. In the absence of a showing that such a rule is necessary to protect vital First Amendment interests, we decline to deviate from the general rule that one seeking relief bears the burden of demonstrating that he is entitled to it.\u201d <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 U.S. 288, 293 n.5 (1984). The plaintiffs have not demonstrated that their boycott constitutes speech entitled to First Amendment protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">The plaintiffs\u2019 claim that the commission violated their right to freedom of association guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments fares no better than their claim that their freedom of speech was violated. \u201cFreedom of association guarantees an opportunity for people to express their ideas and beliefs through membership or affiliation with a group.\u201d <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, supra </em>at 871-872. The plaintiffs\u2019 failure to show any interference with their right to express their beliefs is fatal to their argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 next contention is that the provision in G. L. c. 128A, \u00a7 10A, empowering a person licensed to conduct a racing meeting to exclude from the track \u201cany person whose presence is detrimental ... to the proper and orderly conduct of a racing meeting,\u201d is unconstitutionally vague and therefore void. The plaintiffs correctly point out that a statute is unconstitutionally vague if \u201cmen of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application.\u201d <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Constr. Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 395 (1926). <em>Gurry </em>v. <em>Board of Pub. Accountancy, </em>394 Mass. 118, 127 (1985). <em>Caswell </em>v. <em>Licensing Comm\u2019n for Brockton, supra </em>at 873. The plaintiffs\u2019 sole contention appears to be that men of common intelligence in the plaintiffs\u2019 circumstances would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>have been unable to foresee that management personnel at Wonderland would consider the plaintiffs\u2019 presence at the track on the days following the boycott detrimental to the conduct of racing. We disagree. We think it was reasonably foreseeable that Wonderland would conclude, as did the commission after hearing, that if the plaintiffs should return to the track pending the outcome of a hearing before the commission, there was a danger that other licensees would be coerced into joining the boycott \u201cpossibly closing the race track indefinitely.\u201d Therefore, we reject the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that G. L. c, 128A, \u00a7 10A, is void for vagueness.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">We comment briefly on another of the plaintiffs\u2019 contentions focusing on vagueness. The plaintiffs assert that, since there is a commission regulation providing for a fine if an owner or trainer fails to present his greyhound in timely fashion to be weighed, the plaintiffs could not have predicted that their engaging in a boycott would result in a penalty other than a fine, that is, in the suspension of their licenses. The argument has no merit. There is a clear distinction between an individual owner or trainer failing to be on time for a weigh-in, and a boycott. Furthermore, one who is on notice that his conduct is proscribed cannot properly challenge a sanction on the ground that he did not know which of several available sanctions would be imposed. See <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Gallant, </em>373 Mass. 577, 586 n.11 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">Next, we address the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the formal suspension of their licenses violated G. L. c. 30A and the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the plaintiffs had been given no notice before or during the commission hearing that, at the hearing, not only their ejection by Wonderland but also the possible suspension of their licenses was in issue. The plaintiffs\u2019 argument fails for at least two reasons. First, the plaintiffs were notified at the hearing that their licenses might be suspended, and they were given ample opportunity to be heard on that matter. See <em>Fitchburg Gas &amp; Elec. Light Co. </em>v. <em>Department of Pub. Utils., </em>395 Mass. 836, 845 (1985). The commission chairman expressly stated to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel at the hearing that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201clicense status <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>could ... be affected if we uphold the ejections of these people.\u201d He stated further, \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying is, based on the fact that this matter is before us, before this Commission makes any decision as to the status of these persons\u2019 licenses, we will make a determination as to their status as ejectees. And then at that point in time, depending on how that goes, we\u2019ll have to make a decision about licenses. But our own rules seem to require that a person ruled off for whatever reason should have their license suspended and/or revoked. That is something we\u2019re going to have to address.\u201d In response to counsel\u2019s inquiry whether \u201cthe suspensions as opposed to the ejections\u201d would be addressed in writing, the chairman said, \u201cIt will be certainly included in our findings, conclusions, and orders.\u201d It is clear that the plaintiffs were on notice that the hearing could result in license suspensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">The second reason that the plaintiffs\u2019 procedural due process and G. L. c. 30A notice arguments fail is that, even if notice was defective, the plaintiffs have demonstrated no prejudice. Only when \u201cthe substantial rights of [a] party may have been prejudiced\u201d is reversal of agency action on account of defective notice warranted. <em>Aristocratic Restaurant </em>v. <em>Alcoholic Beverages Control Comm\u2019n (No. 1), </em>374 Mass. 547, 551 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">We turn now to the defendants\u2019 cross appeal concerning Edward Ross. The commission upheld his ejection by Wonderland and suspended his license. The judge reversed because of \u201csubstantial doubt\u201d that Ross had knowingly participated in the boycott. The judge concluded that the commission\u2019s findings as to Ross were not supported by \u201csubstantial evidence.\u201d Lack of substantial evidence warrants the reversal of an agency decision. G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 14 (7) (e). Substantial evidence is \u201csuch evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d G. L. c. 30A, \u00a7 1 (6). We summarize the evidence before the commission in the next two paragraphs. We conclude that it reasonably supported the commission\u2019s findings. Since no defect appears in the commission\u2019s conclusions as to Ross,' and since the commission, not the judge or this court, is the finder of fact, the commission\u2019s action with respect to Ross must be affirmed. <em>Labor Relations Comm\u2019n </em>v. <em>University Hosp., Inc., </em>359 Mass. 516, 521 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>The evidence before the commission that we conclude constituted substantial evidence in support of the commission\u2019s decision was as follows. Ross was a trainer responsible for weighing-in certain greyhounds for races, including schooling races, which are nonwagering races designed to acclimate the greyhounds to racing conditions at Wonderland. On May 31, 1985, Ross arrived at the Wonderland parking lot as other plaintiffs\u2019 trucks were leaving. One of the plaintiffs told him that the scheduled races had been cancelled. Although Ross knew it was highly unusual for the races to be cancelled on a Friday night in May, and the weather offered no reason for cancellation, he made no further inquiry about the races having been cancelled or the reason therefor, and he left the lot with four greyhounds scheduled to race that evening in schooling races. There also was evidence before the commission that, prior to the boycott, Ross had signed a letter directed to the commission threatening to use \u201cother alternatives\u201d if certain trainers\u2019 grievances with the commission\u2019s rules were not addressed, and that Ross knew on the night of the boycott that the trainers were unhappy with the situation at Wonderland. We conclude that there was substantial evidence supporting the commission\u2019s decision as to Ross, and that the judge erred in reversing it.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">The judgment as to Ross is reversed, and the case is remanded to the Superior Court for the entry of a judgment affirming the commission\u2019s decision as to him. The judgment as to the other plaintiffs is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b418-6\"> General Laws c. 128A, \u00a7 9A (1984 ed.), provides in material part: \u201cFor the purpose of enabling the commission to exercise and maintain a proper control over horse and dog racing conducted under the provisions of this chapter, the rules, regulations and conditions prescribed by the commission under section nine shall provide for the licensing and registering at reasonable and uniform fees, of agents, assumed names, colors, partnerships and minor agreements and shall provide for the licensing at reasonable and uniform fees of veterinarians, blacksmiths, owners, trainers, jockeys and stable employees at horse tracks and veterinarians, owners and trainers of dogs participating in such racing, and any other persons having access to horses and dogs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-7\">The full text of G.

Any person so excluded by any commissioner or representative of the commission or by a licensee shall have a right of appeal to the commission.
