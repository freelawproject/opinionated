(Cullinet), the right to market and .sub-license a particular computer software system known as \u201cGen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>eral Ledger Plus\u201d anywhere in the world after the expiration of a five-year term during which, both parties agree, Cullinet had rights only in the United States and Canada.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The trial judge ruled that the licensing agreement \u201cwithout any substantial doubt\u201d demonstrated that Cullinet did not acquire worldwide rights to use and sublicense the system following the five-year term. He also concluded that both the negotiations of the parties and their conduct after the execution of the agreement confirmed the interpretation that the agreement did not give Cullinet worldwide rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-6\">The Appeals Court concluded that the agreement was ambiguous on the question whether worldwide rights were granted. <em>Cullinet Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>McCormack &amp; Dodge Corp., 23 </em>Mass. App. Ct. 231, 236 (1986). We agree with the Appeals Court\u2019s conclusion because it is not certain that the agreement on its face restricted Cullinet\u2019s use to the United States and Canada after five years. We note, however, that the absence of any explicit reference to worldwide rights in the agreement makes Cullinet\u2019s position doubtful in the face of a recital at the beginning of the agreement that \u201cCullinane desires . . . (c) to obtain a non-exclusive license to market and sublicense the System throughout the United States of America and Canada.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">After disagreeing with the trial judge on his construction of the agreement, the Appeals Court did not proceed to analyze the judge\u2019s findings that extrinsic evidence supported his interpretation of the agreement. Where an agreement is ambiguous, paroi evidence is admissible to show the intention of the parties. <em>Trafton </em>v. <em>Custeau, </em>338 Mass. 305, 307-308 (1959). <em>Kennedy Bros. </em>v. <em>Bird, </em>287 Mass. 477, 483 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">The Appeals Court granted that the judge\u2019s ultimate conclusion was not necessarily wrong. <em>Cullinet Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>McCor-mack &amp; Dodge Corp., supra </em>at 236. It thought, however, that his erroneous construction of what he saw as the doubt-free <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>meaning of the agreement itself \u201cmay have affected the conclusion that he reached based upon his consideration of the extrinsic evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 236-237. It ruled that a new trial was required. We allowed the defendant\u2019s application for further appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The judge quite properly heard evidence to aid in the construction of the agreement, even before he decided whether the agreement was ambiguous. See <em>Antonellis </em>v. <em>Northgate Constr. Corp., </em>362 Mass. 847, 851 (1973); <em>Robert Indus., Inc. </em>v. <em>Spence, </em>362 Mass. 751, 753 (1973). The Appeals Court did not fault this procedure <em>(Cullinet Software, Inc. </em>v. <em>McCormack &amp; Dodge Corp., supra), </em>but rather concluded that the judge\u2019s fact-finding may have been tainted by his ruling of law that the agreement without substantial doubt showed no worldwide rights in CuIIinet.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">We are aware of no authority or logic that supports the proposition that a new trial must be granted when the trial judge decides in favor of a party based on (1) an erroneous ruling of law and (2) findings of fact independently supporting the conclusion reached. There is not the least hint in the record that the judge consciously or unconsciously made findings of fact in order to support a result consistent with his ruling of law. Our reading of the record shows not only that the judge\u2019s findings concerning the parties\u2019 intentions based on their negotiations were warranted but that CuIIinet\u2019s principal witness appears not to have been forthright in his testimony. We reject the principle that because a trial judge erred on a point of law, his findings of fact which support the same result on a related but independent theory are so suspect that a new trial is automatically mandated. The Appeals Court\u2019s first stated reason for ordering a new trial lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The Appeals Court ordered a new trial on a second ground, the exclusion of a statement made under oath by CuIIinet\u2019s senior vice president and chief negotiator of the agreement, two months after the agreement was signed. On October 23, 1981, he testified in the course of a. deposition in unrelated litigation in which neither he nor CuIIinet was a party, in the presence of counsel for M &amp; D and others, that after five years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>Cullinet would be able to market the system outside the United States and Canada. Even if this self-serving, postexecution hearsay statement was admissible substantively to show Cul-linet\u2019s interpretation of the agreement (see <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fatalo, </em>345 Mass. 85, 87 [1962]), it concerned only the post-execution conduct of the parties and does not bear significantly on the judge\u2019s findings concerning the parties\u2019 preexecution conduct and intentions. If it was admissible as a prior consistent statement to support the witness\u2019s testimony in this case that he thought Cullinet had acquired worldwide rights after five years, it related to his testimony concerning postexecution events. That excluded evidence arguably might have rehabilitated the witness as to his testimony concerning preexecution events, but it could have had no significant impact on the judge\u2019s finding that preexecution circumstances show that the parties did not intend to grant Cullinet worldwide rights after five years. If there was error in the exclusion of the evidence, it was not prejudicial. The judge\u2019s findings concerning the parties\u2019 preexecution conduct resolved any ambiguity in the agreement in favor of M &amp; D. There is no need for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">\n<em>Judgment of the Superior Court affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-9\"> Such a recital may properly be considered in construing an ambiguous provision in an agreement. <em>Henry G.
