The case was transferred to this court on our own motion. We conclude that there was no error. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">The defendant, a specialist in obstetrics and gynecology, performed a hysterectomy on the plaintiff in June, 1973. During the course of the surgery, a suture placed near the plaintiff\u2019s right ureter caused the ureter to be displaced and to kink, obstructing it. The obstruction of the ureter was discovered within a few days of the hysterectomy, and was corrected by Dr. Alan H. Bennett in a second surgical procedure on June 19, 1973. The plaintiff underwent a third surgical procedure in 1980 to relieve problems caused by damage to the ureter from the first operation. The plaintiff filed this action, alleging medical malpractice, in 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">1. The plaintiff introduced in evidence a videotaped deposition of Dr. Bennett. Dr. Bennett stated his opinion that \u201cno surgeon should have placed a suture in that position.\u201d During the deposition, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked Dr. Bennett if he recalled discussing the matter previously with one Joan Holbrook Adams, a claims adjuster for the defendant\u2019s insurer. Dr. Bennett replied that he remembered no such conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">The defendant called Adams as a witness to impeach Dr. Bennett\u2019s testimony by his prior inconsistent statements. Adams testified that Dr. Bennett had told her that \u201che felt that there was no malpractice\u201d in the surgery that was done, and that \u201cthe case should be thrown out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">The plaintiff argues that, because the prior conversations between Adams and Bennett were a breach of confidentiality and an invasion of privacy, evidence of those conversations should not be admissible at trial. In essence, the plaintiff urges that we adopt a rule of exclusion. We decline to impose such an extraordinary remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">The plaintiff is correct in asserting that she has an interest in maintaining the confidentiality of information obtained by her physician in treating her. <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, </em>397 Mass. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>581, 586-587 (1986); <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, </em>395 Mass. 59, 68, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Carroll </em>v. Alberts, 474 U. S. 1012 (1985); <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., </em>392 Mass. 508, 522-524 (1984). The remedy for a breach of the physician\u2019s duty of confidentiality lies in an action for damages against the physician, not in the extreme sanction of an exclusionary rule. See <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, supra </em>at <em>588; Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, supra </em>at 69; <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 522-524. We also recognize that an opposing party should not be free to engage in clandestine, unauthorized conferences with a plaintiff\u2019s physician. See <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, supra </em>at 588 n.9. See also <em>Hammonds </em>v. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Sur. Co., </em>243 F. Supp. 793, 805 (N.D. Ohio 1965); <em>Petrillo </em>v. <em>Syntex Laboratories, Inc., </em>148 Ill. App. 3d 581, 610 (1986); <em>State </em>v. <em>Alby, </em>125 Wis. 2d 468, 473-474 (1985). We conclude that the plaintiff\u2019s interests are protected by the rules governing discovery, and by the causes of action for invasion of privacy and breach of the duty of confidentiality. See <em>Tower </em>v. <em>Hirschhorn, supra </em>at 585-588; <em>Alberts </em>v. <em>Devine, supra </em>at 70-71; <em>Bratt </em>v. <em>International Business Machs. Corp., supra </em>at 523-524.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">2. The plaintiff argues that Adams\u2019 testimony concerning her conversations with Dr. Bennett should have been excluded as hearsay, or in the alternative, the judge was required to give a limiting instruction to the jury. Tliis argument is without merit. Adams\u2019 testimony was properly admissible as a prior inconsistent statement made by Dr. Bennett, and the judge properly overruled the plaintiff\u2019s objection on hearsay grounds. <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Old Colony St. Ry., </em>189 Mass. 594, 596 (1905). Furthermore, the plaintiff did not request that a limiting instruction be given, and therefore cannot claim error in that no such instruction was given. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costa, </em>354 Mass. 757 (1968). There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">3. The plaintiff\u2019s final ground of appeal is that the judge\u2019s instructions on negligence constituted reversible error. During his instructions, the judge reversed the names of the parties, and was immediately corrected. The judge stated that his slip of the tongue, while a mistake, was probably not negligence. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Later, a juror asked, \u201cif we were to look at whether an error was made and determine that that was not a negligent error, are we then precluded from assigning any damages at all to that?\u201d The judge responded in the affirmative. The plaintiff argues that the judge\u2019s instructions led the jury to conclude that negligence required a higher form of misconduct, such as recklessness, than actually is required in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">We note that the plaintiff did not object to the judge\u2019s instructions. Even if the plaintiff had objected, we would find no error in the judge\u2019s instructions. The judge properly defined the standard: \u201cA doctor undertakes to use a reasonable degree of care such as ordinarily possessed by others providing medical care and treatment, having regard to the current state of care and treatment to patients in hospitals, but he does not warrant a cure or guarantee [a] good result.\u201d See <em>Brune </em>v. <em>Belinkoff, </em>354 Mass. 102, 109 (1968); Riggs v. <em>Christie, </em>342 Mass. 402, 405-406 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The plaintiff also contends that the judge erred in declining to give certain of her requested instructions. We disagree. The plaintiff\u2019s requested instructions either were covered in substance by the judge\u2019s charge, were not correct statements of the law, or were not warranted on the evidence. There was no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
