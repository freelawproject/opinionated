Waiving for the present occasion any inquiry into the propriety of hearing affidavits from such a source (a practice which this court is not to be considered as approving), we see nothing in the affidavits, both of which are to th,e same'effect, which would warrant the granting of a new-trial; These jurors simply state that at the trial, as well as now* they believed, from the evidence, that the deceased struck;defendant a blow with his fist, and that defendant immediately fired and killed the deceased; but they do not express any dissatisfaction.with the verdict which, they joined in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>finding, nor any doubt even of its correctness. Nor do they say that they were misled by, or misunderstood, any of the instructions given to the jury by the Circuit Judge\u2019in his charge. It seems to us, therefore, that, in any view of- the case, the motion must be refused, and it is, accordingly, so ordered.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A2XF\"><em>Izlar, Glaze &amp; Herbert, Raysor &amp; </em>Summers, and <em>8.
