Spencer left her position as an employee relations specialist in the DEA\u2019s Office of Personnel in 1998. Although Spencer applied for disability retirement, she claimed that she did so because the DEA failed to provide her with reasonable accommodations that would have enabled her to continue to perform her job. Accordingly, Spencer filed suit against Appellee John Ashcroft, Attorney General (the \u201cAttorney General\u201d), alleging: (1) a violation of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 701-797 (2000) (the \u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d), based on her employer\u2019s failure to provide reasonable accommodations; (2) a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e to 2000e-17 (2000) (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), based on her race (African-American); and (3) that she had been constructively discharged from the DEA because she was forced to work without reasonable accommodations.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">On June 22, 2004, a jury trial was held and on June 24, 2004, the jury returned a defense verdict on the two counts submitted to it for decision. First, the jury found that Spencer was unable to perform the essential functions of her job, with or without reasonable accommodations. Second, the jury found that Spencer was not intentionally discriminated against on the basis of her race. Spencer\u2019s final claim, constructive discharge, was not before the jury because the district court had previously dismissed that charge because Spencer failed to exhaust available administrative remedies. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-11\">Spencer\u2019s first issue on appeal is that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the weight of the evidence. Spencer, however, failed to move for judgment as a matter of law at the close of the evidence. Thus, this court\u2019s review is limited to \u201cwhether there was <em>any </em>evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict, irrespective of its sufficiency, or whether, plain error was committed which, if not noticed, would result in a \u2018manifest miscarriage of justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Bristol Steel &amp; Iron Works, Inc. v. Bethlehem Steel Corp., </em>41 F.3d 182, 187 (4th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b394-12\">Moreover, the Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o otherwise qualified individual with a disability in the United States ... shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination ... under any program or activity conducted by any Executive agency.\u201d \u00a7 794(a). The Rehabilitation Act imposes on agencies a duty to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d to a disabled employee who could perform a job\u2019s essential functions with such accommodations, unless the provision of accommodations would place an \u201cundue hardship\u201d on the agency. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (2000). Based on a careful review of this record, we find that ample evidence supports the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-13\">Spencer next argues that certain comments of the district court prevented her from receiving a fair and impartial trial. Because \u201c[i]t was the jury, not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>trial judge, that found\u201d for Spencer, \u201cto argue that she was deprived of a fair trial,\u201d Spencer must show that the judge\u2019s comments \u201csomehow affected the outlook or deliberations of the jurors.\u201d <em>Rowsey v. Lee, </em>327 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2003). Although Spencer did not object at trial to the court\u2019s comments, \u201cwhere a trial judge\u2019s comments were so prejudicial as to deny a party an opportunity for a fair and impartial trial, the absence of objections will not preclude this Court\u2019s review since counsel will be loathe to challenge the propriety of a trial judge\u2019s utterances for fear of antagonizing him and thereby prejudicing a Ghent\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Stillman v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., </em>811 F.2d 834, 839 (4th Cir.1987). The Supreme Court, however, has ruled that \u201cexpressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, and even anger\u201d \u2014 an accurate description of all of the comments to which Spencer now objects\u2014 do \u201c[not] establish ] bias or partiality\u201d on the part of a judge. <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555-56, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). Against this background, and again, a comprehensive review of this record, we find that Spencer did not demonstrate that she was prejudiced by the trial judge\u2019s comments. Moreover, the judge\u2019s lengthy instructions, both at the beginning and end of the trial, that \u201c[n]othing the Court may say or do during the course of the trial is intended to indicate nor should be taken by you as an indication of what your verdict should be\u201d cured any prejudice that might have arisen from these comments. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Villarini, </em>238 F.3d 530, 537 (4th Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Finally, Spencer contends that the district court improperly dismissed her claim for constructive discharge. The Rehabilitation Act expressly incorporates the standards of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). \u00a7 794(d). The ADA, in turn, follows the \u201cpowers, remedies and procedures\u201d set forth in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (2000). Thus, like a Title VII plaintiff, Spencer was required to exhaust her administrative remedies before instituting a lawsuit. <em>See Brown v. Gen. Servs. Admin., </em>425 U.S. 820, 829-32, 96 S.Ct. 1961, 48 L.Ed.2d 402 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">Exhaustion of administrative remedies may be satisfied where the claim in question is sufficiently related to properly exhausted claims to be within the scope of a reasonable investigation. <em>See, e.g., Ong v. Cleland, </em>642 F.2d 316, 319 (9th Cir.1981) (absence of perfect \u201cfit\u201d between administrative complaint and Title VII charge not necessarily fatal, especially since Title VTI\u2019s procedural requirements are not to be interpreted too technically or applied too mechanically). Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has made clear that a claim for constructive discharge is not necessarily saved by the \u201ccontinuing violations\u201d doctrine. <em>See Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002) (termination and failure to promote acts are discrete acts requiring exhaustion); see <em>also Young v. Nat\u2019l Ctr. for Health Serv. Research, </em>828 F.2d 235, 237-38 (4th Cir.1987) (citations omitted) (constructive discharge is a discrete discriminatory act requiring administrative exhaustion). We find that Spencer failed to demonstrate that her claim for constructive discharge was \u201cimbedded\u201d within her EEO complaint. As a result, this claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment in favor of the Attorney General, in addition to the dismissal of Spencer\u2019s claim for constructive discharge. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
