No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-29\">At the crux of Jennings\u2019 appeal is his claim that he provided substantial assistance to the government, and that his assistance contributed to the prosecution and conviction of two drug dealers in 2000. Jennings contends that the Assistant United States Attorney (\u201cAUSA\u201d) for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Northern District of Georgia acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d when she promised \u2014 but failed \u2014 to send a letter of recommendation in support of a sentence reduction on Jennings\u2019 behalf to the AUSA for the Southern District of Florida.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">\u201cDetermining whether a motion for reduction of sentence will be filed is reserved to the government, which must ascertain what information the defendant has as well as the truthfulness and usefulness of this information before deciding whether it is appropriate to file a section 5K1.1 motion at sentencing or a Rule 35(b) motion for a convicted defendant thereafter.\u201d <em>United States v. Orozco, </em>160 F.3d 1309, 1315-16 (11th Cir.1998). Judicial review of a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion is unavailable except when the refusal is based on an unconstitutional motive. <em>See Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 1843-44, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992) (\u201cwe hold that federal district courts have authority to review a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a substantial assistance motion and to grant a remedy if they find that the refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive\u201d). The exercise of prosecutorial discretion is immunized from judicial review except \u201cwhen there is an allegation <em>and </em>a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation, such as race or religion.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502 (11th Cir.l993)(emphasis in original) (discussing a prosecutor\u2019s refusal to file a motion pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">Jennings alleges no unconstitutional motive underpinning the government\u2019s failure to file a substantial assistance motion. Absent such an allegation (which, as we have noted, needs to be sufficiently supported), the district court denied properly Jennings\u2019 motion to require the government to file a Rule 35(b) motion for sentence reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">Jennings makes no claim of error in his appellate briefs stemming from the district court\u2019s jurisdictionally premised denial of Appellant\u2019s motion for a downward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 for post-conviction rehabilitation. Issues not raised in the appellant\u2019s brief are deemed waived. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001). And, in any event, the Sentencing Guidelines provide for no downward departure based upon post-sentence rehabilitation when resentencing for an offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.19.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> As the government points out, the only statutory basis for modification of an imposed term of imprisonment is 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); Appellant points to \u2014 and we see \u2014 satisfaction of no basis under \u00a7 3582(c) which could support district court authority to reduce Appellant\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
