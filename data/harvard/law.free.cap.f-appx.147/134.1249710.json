Williams, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his employment discrimination action, which he filed against the State of Georgia Department of Defense National Guard Headquarters and several of its employees, pursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e <em>et seq. </em>The district court dismissed the action based on Williams\u2019s failure to file his complaint within the limitations period of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(l). We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s interpretation and application of a statute of limitations. <em>See United States v. Am. States Ins. Co., </em>252 F.3d 1268, 1270 (11th Cir.2001); <em>Harrison v. Digital Health Plan, </em>183 F.3d 1235, 1238 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-24\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-25\">The relevant procedural history is straightforward. In his complaint, Williams stated that he filed his racial discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\u201cEEOC\u201d) on September 10, 2001 and received his right-to-sue letter on May 18, 2002. On August 8, 2002, Williams filed a complaint, alleging violations of Title VII, in the district court. However, he volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tarily dismissed that action without prejudice. Over two years later, on August 19, 2004, Williams filed the instant complaint, again alleging Title VII violations. The district court dismissed the case as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">A civil action under Title VII must be filed in the district court within 90 days of the claimant\u2019s receipt of a right-to-sue letter from the EEOC. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e \u2014 5(f)(1). The limitations period commences upon the claimant\u2019s receipt of the right-to-sue letter. <em>Stallworth v. Wells Fargo Armored Servs. Corp., </em>936 F.2d 522, 524 (11th Cir.1991); <em>Norris v. Florida Dept. of Health &amp; Rehab. Servs., </em>730 F.2d 682 (11th Cir.1984). Here, based on the facts alleged in the instant complaint, which include that Williams received the EEOC\u2019s right-to-sue letter on May 18, 2002, it is clear that he did not file this complaint within 90 days of receiving the EEOC\u2019s letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">Williams argues that dismissal of the present action was inappropriate because, in connection with the 2002 case, his former attorney, Charles Best, failed to properly serve the Defendants and conspired with the Defendants by selling to them the filing papers that were going to be served. In his brief, he also generally alleges that the dismissal of his action violates various constitutional principles and statutes, including Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">Construing Williams\u2019s arguments liberally, we note that his brief could be read as asserting that Best\u2019s conduct warranted equitable tolling of the limitations period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The burden is on the plaintiff to show that he is entitled to the extraordinary remedy of equitable tolling. <em>See Ross v. Buckeye Cellulose Corp., </em>980 F.2d 648, 661 (11th Cir.1993). We have held that attorney error, alone, is insufficient to toll the running of the statute of limitations. <em>Steed v. Head, </em>219 F.3d 1298, 1300 (11th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Sandvik v. United States, </em>177 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.1999)). Moreover, we have declined to apply equitable tolling after a timely-filed complaint was dismissed without prejudice and a subsequent complaint was filed beyond the limitations period. <em>See Bost v. Fed. Express Corp., </em>372 F.3d 1233, 1242 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also Justice v. United States, </em>6 F.3d 1474, 1478-79 (11th Cir.1993) (stating general rule that filing of lawsuit later dismissed without prejudice does not automatically toll the statute of limitations); <em>Stein v. Reynolds Secs., Inc., </em>667 F.2d 33, 34 (11th Cir.1982) (\u201c[t]he fact that dismissal of an earlier suit was without prejudice does not authorize a subsequent suit brought outside of the otherwise binding period of limitations\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">On this record, Williams neither filed his complaint within the applicable 90-day limitations period nor has he met his burden to show entitlement to equitable tolling. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Williams\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-8\">. <em>See Tannenbaum v.
