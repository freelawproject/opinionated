After reviewing the record and the contentions of the parties, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-25\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b133-26\">On 12 February 2002, Schafler initiated an action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Indian Springs and various other defendants. She alleged, <em>inter alia, </em>that Indian Springs improperly rejected a tenant to whom she had agreed to lease her condominium. The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss and denied Schafler\u2019s motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-27\">On appeal, we affirmed the district court\u2019s order of dismissal. Additionally, we granted Indian Springs\u2019s motion for appellate attorneys\u2019 fees and remanded the case to the district court to determine the amount to be awarded. At a subsequent evidentiary hearing before a magistrate judge, Hugo Alvarez, an attorney of the firm representing Indian Springs on its defense of Schafler\u2019s appeal, testified regarding his firm\u2019s representation. He testified that his firm is appointed by CNA Insurance and that CNA Insurance has paid his firm the fees at issue. Adopting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>the report and recommendation of the magistrate judge, the district court awarded Indian Springs $3,290 in attorneys\u2019 fees. Schafler moved for reconsideration and argued that Indian Springs had no standing to make a claim for attorneys\u2019 fees because those fees had already been paid by its insurance company. The district court denied Schafler\u2019s motion for reconsideration, and Schafler timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">On appeal, Schafler argues that the district court erred in awarding Indian Springs attorneys\u2019 fees because the legal work completed by Alvarez had already been paid by Indian Springs\u2019s insurance company.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">An award of attorneys\u2019 fees is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Mut. Serv. Ins. Co. v. Frit Indus., Inc., </em>358 F.3d 1312, 1322 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c\u2018An abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination or bases an award [or a denial] upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Under Florida law, a prevailing party may be entitled to payment of attorneys\u2019 fees by a losing party if that party or its attorney \u201cknew or should have known that a claim or defense when initially presented to the court or at any time before trial: (a) was not supported by the material facts necessary to establish the claim or defense; or (b) would not be supported by the application of then existing law to those material facts.\u201d Fla. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 57.105(1). The purpose of this rule \u201c \u2018is to discourage baseless claims, stonewall defenses and sham appeals in civil litigation by placing a price tag through attorney[s]\u2019 fees awards on losing parties who engage in these activities.\u2019\u201d <em>Schwartz v. Millon Air, Inc., </em>341 F.3d 1220, 1227 (11th Cir.2003) (citation omitted). Accordingly, recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees has been permitted in situations where the client\u2019s attorney has received payment from a source other than the client, <em>Fairley v. Patterson, </em>493 F.2d 598, 605-06 (5th Cir.1974) (court properly awarded attorneys\u2019 fees to a party whose attorneys had received already compensation for their service from a tax free foundation), or where the client would be indemnified by insurance for attorneys\u2019 fees, <em>Church of Scientology of California v. Cazares, </em>638 F.2d 1272, 1291 (5th Cir.1981) (citing <em>Perez v. Rodriguez Bou, </em>575 F.2d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1978) (finding no merit \u201cin defendant\u2019s argument that attorneys\u2019 fees should not be awarded because plaintiffs ... were not charged for the legal services they received\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">Both the Florida Supreme Court and the district courts in this Circuit employ the federal lodestar approach to set reasonable fee awards. <em>See Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 781 (11th Cir.1994) (per curiam); <em>Fla. Patient\u2019s Comp. Fund v. Rowe, </em>472 So.2d 1145, 1150 (Fla.1985). Under the lodestar formula, a court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>first determine the attorney\u2019s reasonable hourly rate. <em>Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 781. In arriving at this figure, the court may consider the twelve factors discussed in <em>Johnson v. Georgia Highway Express, Inc., </em>488 F.2d 714, 717-19 (5th Cir.1974), which provided the prior formula for calculating attorneys\u2019 fees. <em>Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 781 n. 6. These factors include: (1) the time and labor required, (2) the novelty and difficulty of the questions, (3) the degree of skill necessary to serve the client properly, (4) the attorney\u2019s inability to accept other employment because he accepted the case, (5) the customary fee, (6) whether the fee is fixed or contingent, (7) time limitations imposed by the client or the circumstances, (8) the amount of damages involved and the relief or results obtained, (9) the experience, reputation, and ability of the attorneys, (10) the \u201cundesirability\u201d of the case, (11) the nature and length of the attorney\u2019s professional relationship with the client, and (12) awards in similar cases. <em>Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19. Next, the court takes the reasonable hourly rate and multiplies it by the \u201creasonable number of compensable hours.\u201d <em>Loranger, </em>10 F.3d at 781. This formula does not require a district court to consider insurance coverage or the existence of indemnification agreements. <em>Id.; see Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In this case, the magistrate judge heard testimony that CNA Insurance had paid for Indian Springs\u2019s representation on appeal. However, a district court determining the amount of a reasonable fee under the lodestar formula need not consider insurance coverage or other indemnification agreements, <em>see Johnson, </em>488 F.2d at 717-19, and recovery of attorneys\u2019 fees is allowed even though the client\u2019s attorney has received payment from another source, <em>see Fairley, </em>493 F.2d at 605-06; <em>Church of Scientology, </em>638 F.2d at 1291. Further, the reduction of an attorneys\u2019 fee award against a plaintiff because of the defendant\u2019s insurance coverage would undermine the purpose of an award of attorneys\u2019 fees, which is to discourage baseless appeals. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in calculating the appellate attorneys\u2019 fees to be $3,290.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Because we conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in setting the amount of appellate attorneys\u2019 fees at $3,290, even though Indian Spring\u2019s counsel had already been paid by an insurance company, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b134-8\">. Additionally, Schafler argues that Alvarez committed perjury in an affidavit submitted to our court by stating (1) that Indian Springs \" \u2018retained\u201d \u2019 his law firm, when in fact his firm is appointed by Indian Springs\u2019s insurance company; and (2) that Indian Springs \" \u2018is responsible\u201d ' for paying his firm's fees, when in fact its insurance company paid the fees. Appellant's Opening Brief at 9. Schafler thus requests that we refer Indian Springs\u2019s counsel for criminal prosecution. In response, Indian Springs requests that we admonish Schafler. We decline both requests.</p>\n<p id=\"A-J\">In her reply brief, Schafler also contends that the district court lacked jurisdiction to determine the amount of the attorneys\u2019 fees award because it previously had dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction. This argument has no merit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
