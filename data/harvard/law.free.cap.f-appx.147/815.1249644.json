Tallapoosa County, </em>50 F.3d 1579, 1581 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">After reviewing the record and reading the parties\u2019 briefs, we conclude that the district court erred in part in granting the defendants\u2019 motion for partial summary judgment. Congress created two types of coverage under the FLSA: (1) \u201cindividual\u201d coverage and (2) \u201centerprise\u201d coverage. <em>See, e.g. Dunlop v. Indus. America Corp., </em>516 F.2d 498, 500-01 (5th Cir.1975).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant Dolphin Exterminating Company did not attain \u201centerprise\u201d coverage until 2002 when it grossed in excess of $500,000 in sales. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 203(s)(l)(A)(ii) (enterprise engaged in commerce \u201cis an enterprise whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000\u201d). However, Alonso can qualify for individual coverage. We note that \u201capplication of the FLSA to [varying] situations is essentially a line-drawing exercise.\u201d <em>Brennan v. Wilson Bldg., Inc., </em>478 F.2d 1090, 1094 (5th Cir.1973). We also note that the \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d phrase \u201cis to be given a broad, liberal construction.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We conclude from the record that Alonso was \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d through his duties as a laborer transporting fumigation materials and chemicals, which had traveled in interstate commerce to defendants\u2019 customers within the state. Although these duties required no transportation outside the state of Florida, the materials and chemicals, which had traveled in interstate commerce, continued to flow in interstate commerce until they reached Dolphin Exterminating Company\u2019s customers. <em>See id. </em>at 1095 (holding elevator operators who transported passengers delivering interstate mail, parcel post, and freight \u201cengaged in commerce\u201d because the goods they transported continue to flow in interstate commerce until delivered to the tenants of the building in which the elevators were operated).</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of partial summary judgment on Alonso\u2019s enterprise coverage claim, but reverse as to his individual coverage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-10\">AFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b835-17\">. The parties consented to a magistrate judge handling all proceedings in this case. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 et seq.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-6\">. A jury trial was conducted <em>to </em>determine whether overtime was owed to Alonso for 2002. The district court entered a final judgment based on the jury's verdict in favor of Alonso and awarded him attorney\u2019s fees and costs for a total judgment of $34,532.25. That judgment has not been appealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b836-12\">. <em>In Bonner v. City of Prichard, </em>661 F.2d 1206 (11th Cir.1981), we adopted as binding precedent all decisions of the Fifth Circuit handed down prior to the close of business on September 30, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
