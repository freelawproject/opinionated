This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), which this court must follow \u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b417-26\">Relying on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), Prieto also argues that his constitutional rights were violated because the guidelines in effect when he was sentenced were mandatory and imposed binding requirements on all sentencing judges. The Government agrees that Prieto preserved the <em>Booker </em>error and that the district court committed <em>Booker </em>error when it sentenced Prieto under mandatory, rather than advisory, guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>When a <em>Booker </em>error is preserved, this court \u201cwill ordinarily vacate the sentence and remand,\u201d unless the error is harmless. <em>United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 285 (5th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). As the Government concedes that it cannot satisfy its burden of proof under the harmless error standard, Prieto\u2019s sentence must be vacated, and this case must be remanded for resentencing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We do not reach Prieto\u2019s contention that a greater sentence at resentencing would implicate due process and ex post facto concerns. Because we remand this matter to the district court for resentencing in light of <em>Booker </em>and <em>Mares, </em>such an argument is premature and need not be addressed. <em>Amar v. Whitley, </em>100 F.3d 22, 23 (5th Cir.1996) (noting that a federal court lacks jurisdiction and the judicial resources to issue advisory opinions); <em>Matter of Talbott Big Foot, Inc., </em>924 F.2d 85, 87 (5th Cir.1991) (stating that the court does not give opinions upon moot questions, abstract propositions, or rules of law not at issue). We leave to the district court\u2019s discretion whether it will impose the same sentence with the same departures or enhancements.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b417-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
