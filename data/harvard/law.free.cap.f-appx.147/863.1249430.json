Flanagan, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of her habeas corpus petition, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. Flanagan contends that because she is actually innocent, it was erroneous for the district court to dismiss her \u00a7 2241 petition. Further, Flanagan insists she is not trying to circumvent the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) time limitations for filing a \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate, and that the requirements for filing a successive \u00a7 2255 motion have no bearing on the instant petition. We affirm the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-11\">I. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b884-12\">The availability of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 presents questions of law which we review de novo. <em>Cook v. Wiley, </em>208 F.3d 1314, 1317 (11th Cir.2000). A federal prisoner\u2019s petition to challenge the imposition of her sentence must be brought under \u00a7 2255 \u201cunless it also appears that the remedy by motion is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of [her] detention.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Accordingly, a \u00a7 2241 petition attacking custody resulting from a federally imposed sentence may be entertained only if the petitioner establishes the remedy provided for under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective. <em>See Wofford v. Scott, 177 </em>F.3d 1236, 1245 (11th Cir.1999) (holding \u00a7 2241 may not be used to circumvent the restrictions on successive \u00a7 2255 motions); <em>McGhee v. Hanberry, </em>604 F.2d 9, 10 (5th Cir.1979) (holding a prior unsuccessful \u00a7 2255 motion is insufficient on its own to establish the ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The burden of coming forward with evidence affirmatively showing the inadequacy or ineffectiveness of the \u00a7 2255 remedy rests with the petitioner. <em>McGhee, </em>604 F.2d at 10. Remedies under \u00a7 2255 are considered inadequate if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b884-17\">1) that claim is based upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision; 2) the holding of that Supreme Court decision establishes the petitioner was Convicted for a nonexistent offense; and, 3) circuit law squarely foreclosed such a claim at the time it otherwise should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A_K\"><em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-18\">Flanagan\u2019s first \u00a7 2255 motion to dismiss was denied by the district court, although it is unclear whether it was denied on the merits or because it was filed six years after the final date of her conviction. The magistrate, however, noted in his Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>port &amp; Recommendation the district court likely dismissed the \u00a7 2255 motion due to untimeliness. Where a prisoner has filed an initial \u00a7 2255 motion that has already been denied, the district court does not have jurisdiction to act without us having granted the prisoner permission to file a second, or successive \u00a7 2255 motion to vacate. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">Here, Flanagan makes repeated claims of actual innocence as justification for advancing collateral attacks on her conviction and sentence in a \u00a7 2241 petition. It seems to be Flanagan\u2019s position that because her \u00a7 2255 was denied because of AEDPA\u2019s time limitations, and was not addressed on the merits, a \u00a7 2255 remedy is ineffective and a \u00a7 2241 petition is the only available avenue for her to advance her claims. However, this reasoning is incorrect, as we have held that just because a past \u00a7 2255 motion was unsuccessful does not mean the remedy it may provide is inadequate. <em>See McGhee, </em>604 F.2d at 10; <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1245. Moreover, while Flanagan cites to an Eleventh Circuit case as support for her actual innocence claims, because she does not cite to a new, retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision, she cannot satisfy any of the requirements of \u00a7 2255\u2019s savings clause, and thus, a \u00a7 2241 petition is an inappropriate avenue for her to advance her claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255; <em>Wofford, </em>177 F.3d at 1244.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-6\">II. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">The district court did not err when it dismissed Flanagan\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b884-13\">.
