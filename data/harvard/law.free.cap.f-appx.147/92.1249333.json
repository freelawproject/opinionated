She presents two issues: first, whether the administrative law judge (ALJ) failed to give proper weight to the opinions of her treating psychologist and psychiatrists; second, whether the evidence from one of her treating psychiatrists, Dr. Anne Tyson, which was submitted to and considered by the Appeals Council, constitutes new and material evidence that, for good cause shown, was not presented to the agency and thus requires a remand pursuant to sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Our task is to determine whether the Commissioner\u2019s decision denying Magill\u2019s application for benefits is supported by substantial evidence and based upon proper legal standards. <em>Lewis v. Callahan, </em>125 F.3d 1436, 1439 (11th Cir.1997). Substantial evidence is defined as \u201csuch relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1440</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">A treating physician\u2019s testimony must be given substantial or considerable weight unless \u201cgood cause\u201d is shown to the contrary. <em>Crawford v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>363 F.3d 1155, 1159 (11th Cir.2004); <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2). \u201c \u2018[G]ood cause\u2019 exists when the: (1) treating physician\u2019s opinion was not bolstered by the evidence; (2) evidence supported a contrary finding; or (3) treating physician\u2019s opinion was conclusory or inconsistent with the doctor\u2019s own medical records.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Barnhart, </em>357 F.3d 1232, 1240-41 (11th Cir.2004). For instance, an ALJ need not give a treating physician\u2019s opinion considerable weight if the applicant\u2019s own testimony regarding her daily activities contradicts that opinion. <em>Id. </em>at 1241.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">In contrast, good cause \u201cis not provided by the report of a nonexamining physician where it contradicts the report of the treating physician.\u201d <em>Lamb v. Bowen, </em>847 F.2d 698, 703 (11th Cir.1988). \u201cThe opinions of nonexamining, reviewing physicians ... when contrary to those of examining physicians are entitled to little weight in a disability case, and standing alone do not constitute substantial evidence.\u201d <em>See id. </em>(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, the ALJ must clearly articulate the reasons for giving less weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion, and the failure to do so is reversible error. <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241; <em>see also </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), 416.927(d)(2) (requiring the agency to \u201cgive good reasons\u201d for not giving weight to a treating physician\u2019s opinion).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-10\">Nothing in the record before us indicates that the ALJ failed to give considerable or substantial weight to Magill\u2019s treating psychologist and psychiatrists\u2019 opinions. For instance, neither Dr. O\u2019Shell nor Dr. Montero concluded that Magill was disabled for social security disability benefits purposes. Rather, in his mental status examination of Magill, Dr. O\u2019Shell concluded that she was well oriented in all spheres, alert, but depressed, with logical and coherent speech, a mildly impaired memory, a mild degree of conceptual disorganization, an open and cooperative attitude, partial awareness of problems, fair judgment, and an ability to attend and maintain focus. He subsequently noted that she had excellent motivation and could focus on a relevant topic, see different perspectives, and identify and express feelings. He assessed her Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) on four different occasions, placing her current GAF in a range from 40 to 55 and her past year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>GAF in a range from 45 to 80. Moreover, in evaluating her mental status, Dr. Montero concluded that she had normal thought processes and content, poor concentration, good orientation, recent memory impairment because of a short attention span, and little self-motivation. Dr. Montero did not assess Magill\u2019s GAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">These opinions do not contradict the ALJ\u2019s determination that Magill is markedly limited in performing detailed or complex tasks and has some limitations with regard to getting along with co-workers, but at the same time has the Residual Functioning Capacity (RFC) to perform a limited range of light work. In her decision, the ALJ noted both Dr. O\u2019Shell\u2019s and Dr. Montero\u2019s mental evaluations, and nothing indicates that the ALJ gave those opinions anything other than substantial weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Moreover, the ALJ explicitly adopted most of Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion, including the doctor\u2019s assessment that Ma-gill is markedly limited in performing detailed or complex tasks and that she has some limitations with regard to getting along with co-workers. Again, these findings do not compel a finding of mental disability for social security benefits purposes. The ALJ explicitly discredited Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion that Magill is markedly limited in her ability to complete a normal workday and workweek, because she found that Magill\u2019s own testimony about her ability to maintain activities of daily living contradicted this opinion. In particular, Magill testified that she lives alone, that she drives occasionally, shops, takes walks, goes to the swimming pool and laundry room, talks on the phone, and goes out to eat once or twice a week with a friend. Pursuant to <em>Phillips, </em>357 F.3d at 1241, the ALJ had good cause to discredit that portion of Dr. Tyson\u2019s testimony which contradicted this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">In the end, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s findings. The ALJ only discredited a portion of one of MagilPs treating psychiatrists\u2019 opinions, but she had good cause to do so. The ALJ did not discredit any other opinion evidence given by Magill\u2019s treating physicians. Indeed, the ALJ explicitly credited the opinion of another of Magill\u2019s treating physicians, Dr. Phen, who opined that Magill could not perform her past relevant work, but could perform other work. Moreover, the ALJ only gave greater weight to the non-examining, reviewing State psychologists\u2019 opinions after discrediting the portion of Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion. This is consistent with 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(d)(2), which provides that a treating source\u2019s medical opinion receives controlling weight only if consistent with other substantial evidence in the record, as well as 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(2)(i)-(ii), which provides that the ALJ must consider non-examining, reviewing State psychologists\u2019 opinions, as well as explain the weight given to these opinions when a treating source is not given controlling weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the second issue MagilPs appeal presents. We will order a remand based on new evidence only if the applicant shows that: \u201c(1) there is new, noncumulative evidence; (2) the evidence is \u2018material,\u2019 that is, relevant and probative so there is a reasonable probability that it would change the administrative result; and (3) there is good cause for the failure to submit the evidence at the administrative level.\u201d <em>Vega v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>265 F.3d 1214, 1218 (11th Cir.2001); <em>see also </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g) (sentence six). The non-cumulative requirement is satisfied by the production of new evidence not contained in the administrative record. <em>See Cannon v. Bowen, </em>858 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>F.2d 1541, 1546 (11th Cir.1988). Such evidence must relate to the time period on or before the date of the ALJ\u2019s decision. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.970(b); <em>see also Falge v. Apfel, </em>150 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.1998). The materiality requirement is satisfied if a reasonable possibility exists that the new evidence would change the administrative result. <em>See Falge, </em>150 F.3d at 1323. The good cause requirement is satisfied when the evidence did not exist at the time of the administrative proceedings. <em>See Cannon, </em>858 F.2d at 1546.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Magill had good cause for her failure to introduce her additional evidence at the administrative hearing, as the evidence did not exist until after the hearing concluded. Furthermore, the additional evidence is non-cumulative, as Dr. Tyson articulated a new diagnosis, obsessive-compulsive disorder. Dr. Tyson\u2019s subsequent evaluation also describes a much more negative view of Magill\u2019s mental status and functional abilities. For instance, she states, \u201cI do not know how she ever got hired, much less how she ever functioned on the job. She cannot complete tasks and judgment is poor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">However, as with Dr. Tyson\u2019s previous opinion, this additional evidence also is discredited by Magill\u2019s own testimony about her daily activities, as well as testimony from her other treating physicians and non-examining State psychologists. What is more, Dr. Tyson\u2019s obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis does not assess any new restrictions or limitations in addition to those the ALJ had already considered, partially adopted, and partially rejected. Indeed, Dr. Tyson\u2019s GAF assessment of 45/50 does not differ from the GAF assessments previously appraised. In sum, the additional evidence does not provide a reasonable possibility that the ALJ would change her decision, and is therefore immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">After carefully reviewing the administrative proceedings, the medical record, the proceedings in the district court, and considering the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to discredit a portion of Dr. Tyson\u2019s opinion. Moreover, because Magill\u2019s additional evidence is immaterial, we need not remand this case pursuant to sentence six of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
