Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005),<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> when it enhanced his sentence based upon the district court\u2019s finding that he was an armed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-27\">Cunningham pleaded guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), without a plea agreement. The maximum sentence for violation of \u00a7 922(g) \u2014 if the armed career criminal enhancement has no application \u2014 is 10 years imprisonment. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2). But a defendant who violates \u00a7 922(g) and who has been convicted previously of three or more offenses which are drug trafficking crimes or crimes of violence (\u201cpredicate offenses\u201d) faces a mandatory minimum 180-month sentence and maximum life sentence as an armed career offender under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). The indictment of Cunningham referenced five prior felony convictions\u2014 three of which served as predicate offenses for application of the section 924(e) enhancement \u2014 but the indictment failed to allege expressly that these offenses were section 924(e) predicate offenses or even that Cunningham was subject to an en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>hanced sentence as a career offender. Cunningham preserved a <em>Blakely </em>objection at sentencing and argues on appeal that his predicate convictions were neither admitted by him nor proved to the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">As Cunningham concedes, his argument runs counter to <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), wherein the Supreme Court determined that recidivism is no separate element of an offense; the government can seek an enhanced penalty based upon an earlier conviction without charging the fact of the earlier conviction in the indictment and without proving the earlier conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 1228-29; see also <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480(2004). Although the Supreme Court cast a shadow on <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Apprendi </em>exempted explicitly prior convictions from its declaration that a defendant\u2019s sentence may not be increased beyond the statutory maximum on the basis of judicial factual findings. <em>Id. </em>at 2362-63; <em>see United States v. Guadamuz-Solis, </em>232 F.3d 1363 (11th Cir.2000) (affirming the continued efficacy of <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>in the light of <em>Apprendi). Blakely, </em>too, allowed an exception for the fact of a prior conviction from its general proscription against the use of judicially determined facts to increase a sentence. <em>Blakely, </em>124 S.Ct. at 2536; <em>see Marseille, </em>377 F.3d at 1258 n. 14 (recognizing that <em>Blakely </em>leaves prior conviction fact-finding with the court). And again, in <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756, the Supreme Court reaffirmed its holding in <em>Apprendi </em>and again exempted prior convictions from the ambit of impermissible judicial fact-finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-8\"><em>Post-Booker, </em>this Court has said that <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law notwithstanding <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny. In <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960 (11th Cir.2005), we noted that the rationale for excepting prior convictions is clear: \u201c \u2018a prior conviction must itself have been established through procedures satisfying the fair notice, reasonable doubt, and jury trial guarantees.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 962, <em>quoting Jones v. United States, </em>526 U.S. 227, 119 S.Ct. 1215, 1227, 143 L.Ed.2d 311 (1999). Consequently, the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>conclusion that a mandatory application of the guidelines is inconsistent with a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights, \u201cis not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-9\">The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), which Cunningham calls to our attention as supplemental authority pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. 28(j), is not to the contrary. <em>Shephard </em>limits the kinds of material a court may consider in determining whether a prior conviction constitutes a \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 924(e); it nonetheless leaves that determination to the sentencing judge. <em>See United States v. Marcussen, </em>403 F.3d 982, 984 (8th Cir.2005) (stating that <em>Shepard </em>\u201clends further support to the rule that the sentencing court, not a jury, must determine whether prior convictions qualify as violent felonies\u201d). And Cunningham does not argue on appeal that his convictions were insufficient legally to trigger a \u00a7 924(e) enhancement. <em>Shephard </em>does not change our conclusions in this case. <em>See Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d at 962 n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-11\">Because the sentencing court was bound by the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, no issue of statutory <em>Booker </em>error is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>presented by this appeal. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1333 n. 10 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b972-19\"> Cunningham\u2019s brief was filed before the Supreme Court issued its <em>Booker </em>opinion; his brief relies on <em>Blakely v.
