We DENY Sulaman\u2019s PETITION.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-20\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b893-21\">Sulaman is a native and citizen of South Africa but is of Indian descent. On 1 August 2001, Sulaman, his wife Shereen, and their four children, Muhammed Waseen, Sumehyah, Muhammed Safwaan, and Aalia, were admitted to the United States as non-immigrant visitors with authorization to remain until 81 January 2002. On 29 March 2002, the Immigration and Natu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"874\">*874</page-number>ralization Service<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u201cINS\u201d) issued all of the petitioners notices to appear, charging them with removability under the INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), for remaining in the United States for a time longer than permitted. On 23 January 2002, Sulaman filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">In his application and testimony before the IJ, Sulaman claimed that he and his family had suffered past persecution because they are of Indian descent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In support of his claim, he recounted four specific incidents of alleged persecution, all of which occurred after he and his family relocated from Durban to Phuthadit Jhaba<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> sometime in 1995 or 1996.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, in December 2000, a group of blacks approached Sulaman and his family while they were at the beach. The group threatened to kill him and his family and then robbed them. They said it was time for them to go \u201cback to India\u201d and called them \u201cmongrel dogs,\u201d an epithet for people of Indian descent. Second, in June or July of 2001, Sulaman was robbed by a different group of black people. Third, Sulaman\u2019s children were targeted by other children at school because they were wealthy. His children were beaten by \u201cmainly black children\u201d two or three times weekly if they did not give them money, their book bags and lunches were stolen, and they suffered daily verbal abuse. According to Sulaman, the bullies attacked only other Indian children, and any complaints made to the school were ignored. Fourth, in March 2001, three black men visited Sulaman\u2019s factory when he was away and spoke to his wife. They asked why she was married to an Indian and offered to kill Sulaman to get him \u201cout of the way\u201d so that she could marry them. Sulaman believed that these men would kill his entire family if they came back. Neither Sulaman nor his wife saw these men again before they left the country, and Sulaman did not know their names and had never seen them before the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Sulaman never reported these incidents to the police because he believed that they would be unresponsive to his complaints because he is Indian and the police are black. Sulaman fears that, if he and his family return to South African, black people would kill his family and kidnap and rape his wife and daughters because the circumstances in South Africa were worsening. Although Sulaman and his family have never been arrested or detained in South Africa, he also would fear the government and the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Additionally, Sulaman testified about racial and ethnic tensions in South Africa <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"875\">*875</page-number>generally. Prior to 1994, Indians were discriminated against by whites on account of their race. Since the end of apartheid, Indians were discriminated against by blacks.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Sulaman believes that authorities will not protect his family because they are part of the Indian minority. Because of the lack of police protection, many Indians have formed vigilante groups, such as the People Against Gangsterism and Drugs (\u201cPAGAD\u201d), as a way to protect themselves.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">Sulaman\u2019s wife also testified before the IJ. She recounted, among other things, an incident in which her nephew was carjacked by blacks carrying AK-47 assault rifles. The police were called, and they chased the assailants and eventually killed them in a shootout.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The IJ also reviewed the U.S. State Department\u2019s South Africa Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for 2002 (\u201c2002 Country Report\u201d or \u201cReport\u201d). The 2002 Country Report noted continued incidents of \u201cvigilante action and mob justice\u201d throughout South Africa and stated that a recent study attributed the continuation to \u201cpolice inefficiency and the perception that courts failed to deliver justice.\u201d Additionally, the 2002 Country Report indicated that there was widespread concern among white farmers that they would be targeted for political and racial reasons, but according to police and academic studies, the perpetrators were \u201cusually common criminals motivated by financial gain.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 281-82. A 2002 study showed that the government failed to protect the inhabitants of commercial farms in general, and that black women farm residents were especially vulnerable. The 2002 Country Report also noted that the government had banned from the nation\u2019s airwaves a song considered to be racist and anti-Indian. In the section discussing discrimination against national, racial, or ethnic minorities, the Report made no mention of Indians suffering at the hands of blacks and instead noted that blacks, as well as other \u201cpreviously disadvantaged groups,\u201d were still underrepresented in managerial and professional positions within the workforce.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 299.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">The IJ denied Sulaman\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. After summarizing the evidence presented by Sulaman, the IJ made the following specific findings: (1) Sulaman\u2019s claim that the authorities will not protect his family was undermined by his wife\u2019s testimony that the police responded when her nephew carjacked and ultimately killed the perpetrators; (2) there was evidence that the South African government is making efforts to ensure that \u201cthere is no ... racism against those of Indian descent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 118, such as its banning a song perceived to be anti-Indian; (8) Sulaman and his family were victims of crimes, or, in some instances were perhaps verbally harassed because of their ethnicity, but there was no evidence which indicated that they were being persecuted on account of race; and (4) there was evidence that the difficulties encountered by Sulaman and his family began only after they moved to Phuthadit Jhaba, and that there was no evidence of a threat of persecution on a country-wide basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">Based on the background materials presented, the IJ also took note of the difficulties which plague South Africa as it makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"876\">*876</page-number>its transition from the previous apartheid government to its current multiparty parliamentary democracy. The IJ noted that the country suffers from a \u201ccertain amount of lawlessness,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 117, is rife with racial tensions between whites and blacks, and has seen episodes of vigilante justice. However, the IJ found that the background materials did not indicate that individuals of Indian descent are being targeted specifically. The IJ also noted that Sulaman talked only in general terms of discrimination against Indians by blacks.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">The IJ found that Sulaman failed to show past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution and that he failed to meet his burden of proving that \u201canyone in South Africa is interested in [him] due to any of the five enumerated grounds necessary for a grant of asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 119. Because Sulaman did not prove he was entitled to asylum, the IJ found that Sulaman also did not establish that he would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d experience persecution on account of race, as required to obtain withholding of removal relief. <em>Id. </em>at 121. Finally, the IJ concluded that Sulaman was not eligible for CAT relief. <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, the IJ ordered Sulaman, his wife, and his children removed from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Sulaman appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. In a <em>per curiam </em>opinion, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. First, the BIA concurred with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the \u201charm to the respondents constitutes discrimination and harassment, but not persecution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 3. Second, the BIA noted that Sulaman was not \u201cdetained, harmed, or threatened by the government on account of a protected ground.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Finally, the BIA concluded that Sulaman could not show that the government was unwilling or unable to control the alleged persecutors because he failed to request police aid.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-12\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b896-13\">On appeal, Sulaman advances four main arguments. First, he contends that he proved that he has a well-founded fear of future prosecution because (1) his testimony established a reasonable possibility of persecution on account of race, and (2) his testimony and information contained in the 2002 Country Report showed that the government is unable or unwilling to stop racially motivated persecution. Second, Sulaman argues that the substantial weight of the evidence demonstrated that he was persecuted on account of his race because he and his family were \u201cunprotected racial minorities in a country with an unparalleled history of violent racial persecution.\u201d Opening Brief of Petitioner Talim Sulaman at 51-52. Third and fourth, Sulaman avers that substantial evidence supports a finding that he was entitled to withholding of removal and/or CAT relief.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-14\">We review the BIA\u2019s factual determinations under the substantial evidence test, and we \u201cmust affirm the BIA\u2019s decision if it is \u2018supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u2019\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Because the substantial evidence standard is highly deferential, we can reverse the BIA\u2019s decision \u201conly if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Sepulveda v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., 401 F.3d 1226, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>1230 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (citation omitted). We review <em>de novo </em>to the extent that the ruling is based on the interpretation of applicable statutes. <em>Mazariegos v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1324 (11th Cir.2001). Although we normally review the BIA\u2019s decision only, if the BIA expressly adopted the reasoning of the IJ, as it did in this case, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as well. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">A. <em>Asylum</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b897-6\">any person who is outside of any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b897-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A) (emphasis added). The asylum applicant carries the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. <em>See Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284. To establish asylum eligibility, the alien must, with specific and credible evidence, establish (1) past persecution on account of a statutorily listed factor, or (2) a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d that the statutorily listed factor will cause future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a), (b); <em>Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1287.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-8\">Although the INA does not explicitly define \u201cpersecution,\u201d we have recognized that \u201c[n]ot all exceptional treatment is persecution,\u201d <em>Gonzalez v. Reno, </em>212 F.3d 1338, 1355 (11th Cir.2000), that \u201cpersecution ... requir[es] more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d <em>Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1231 (internal quotations omitted), and that \u201c[m]ere harassment does not amount to persecution,\u201d <em>id. </em>(internal quotations omitted). An alien\u2019s fear of future persecution generally must be based on an individualized risk of persecution. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(i). However, he need not show that he will be singled out for future persecution if he demonstrates a pattern or practice of persecution of people who are similarly situated. <em>Id. </em>at (b)(2)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-9\">In this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s conclusion that Sulaman did not suffer from past persecution. While Sulaman\u2019s testimony revealed that he and his family were robbed, his wife threatened, and his children bullied, these incidents, while certainly unpalatable, do not constitute persecution because they do not \u201crise above unpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\u201d <em>See Nelson v. INS, </em>232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir.2000). As for Sulaman\u2019s claim that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution, we again believe that substantial evidence supports the IJ and BIA\u2019s conclusions. Sulaman offered no particularized instances of violence aimed specifically at Indians nor evidence that, if he were to relocate to another part of South Africa, he and his family would still be targeted. Moreover, although the country conditions information contained in the record reflects that South Africa is still plagued by widespread racial tensions, it does not compel the conclusion that Sulaman will be persecuted on account of a protected ground upon his return or that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>there is a pattern or practice of persecution of Indians in the country. To the contrary, the record contains evidence of South African government\u2019s intervention when an anti-Indian song was broadcast as well as evidence of police protection in cases of violence directed towards Indians. Thus, the IJ and BIA did not err in concluding that there was no substantial evidence to satisfy the objective and subjective components of the well-founded fear of future persecution requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">B. <em>Withholding of Removal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">An alien who seeks withholding of removal under the INA must demonstrate that his \u201clife or freedom would be threatened in [the country of removal] because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>accord Mendoza v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003). The alien must show that he \u201cmore-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon his return\u201d to his country. <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. The standard for withholding removal is more stringent than the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum, and an applicant unable to meet the \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d standard for asylum is usually unable to qualify for withholding of removal. <em>See D-Muhumed v. United States Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 819 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b898-6\">In this case, Sulaman failed to meet the lower burden required to establish a \u201cwell-founded\u201d fear of future persecution in South Africa. Accordingly, he cannot meet the higher withholding of removal standard. We affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Sulaman\u2019s application for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-7\">C. <em>CAT Relief</em></p>\n<p id=\"b898-8\">To obtain withholding of removal under the CAT\u2019s implementing regulations, an alien must establish that he \u201cmore likely than not\u201d will be tortured upon return to his home country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2). \u201cTorture\u201d is defined as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AMN\">any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or her or a third person information or a confession, punishing him or her for an act he or she or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or her or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b898-10\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 208.18(a)(1). Because applicants seeking CAT relief must meet a higher burden of proof than applicants seeking asylum, those who cannot prove a \u201cwell-founded fear\u201d to obtain asylum usually cannot prove entitlement to relief under CAT. <em>See Al-Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1303.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-11\">In this case, Sulaman failed to demonstrate a \u201cwell founded fear\u201d of future persecution upon return to South Africa. It thus follows that Sulaman failed to show that it was more likely than not he would be tortured on account of a protected factor. Accordingly, the IJ and BIA did not err in denying Sulaman CAT relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-12\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b898-13\">Upon review of the record and the contentions of the parties, we.conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of Sulaman\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief. Accordingly, we DENY Sulaman\u2019s PETITION.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-5\">. On 25 November 2002, President Bush signed into law the Homeland Security Act of 2002 (\u201cHSA\u201d).
