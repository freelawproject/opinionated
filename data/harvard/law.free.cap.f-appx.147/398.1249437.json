Dupree, a former employee at a gas station owned by defendant Valero Energy Corporation\u2019s former subsidiary, appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in Valero\u2019s favor on Dupree\u2019s negligence claim. Dupree alleges that workplace exposure to gasoline fumes with the chemical additive t-amyl methyl ether (TAME) exacerbated his preexisting medical conditions \u2014 gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD), hiatal hernia, and hemorrhoids\u2014 and caused him to develop bilateral maxillary sinus disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Valero moved for summary judgment, arguing that there is no evidence that Dupree\u2019s alleged exposure to gasoline fumes and TAME caused his injuries. In addition to the pleadings and other evidence on file, Valero submitted evidence that included Dupree\u2019s deposition testimony, his medical records, and expert testimony that Dupree\u2019s alleged exposure to gasoline fumes and TAME did not cause his injuries. Valero also submitted a \u201cSummary Report\u201d and other documents that discuss the components of gasoline and TAME in general and the possible effects of exposure, including workplace exposure to service station workers. The \u201cSummary Report\u201d states that \u201cthe reported health effects of gasoline inhalation include intoxication, headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, eye nose, and throat irritation, and dizziness and mild anesthesia.\u201d The report also indicates that TAME can be absorbed dermally and may cause central nervous system depression. There is no mention of any injuries similar to those alleged to have occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Dupree did not file an opposition to the motion for summary judgment or any controverting evidence. Instead, he contends the evidence Valero submitted in support of its motion raises a genuine issue of material fact on causation. Specifically, Dupree argues that the \u201cSummary Report\u201d along with his medical records proves that exposure to gasoline fumes and TAME caused his injuries. Dupree provided no expert witness evidence, and in fact, withdrew his expert witness designations, maintaining that expert testimony is not required in this case because the hazards associated with gasoline fumes is common knowledge.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">The district court granted Valero\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Dupree\u2019s claims with prejudice. The district court concluded that expert testimony was required to establish a causal connection, but Dupree produced no expert witness who could link his medical conditions to gasoline or TAME exposure. The court also determined that Dupree\u2019s medical records and the documents discussing gasoline and TAME components and exposure risks did not raise a genuine issue of material fact on the causation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>We review a summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard applied by the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is proper if no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The parties agree that Texas substantive law applies in this diversity case.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">There is no expert testimony supporting Dupree\u2019s claims, Dupree has disclaimed any intent to rely on expert testimony, and the deadline to designate expert witnesses had passed when the district court ruled on the summary judgment motion. Moreover, there is nothing in the \u201cSummary Report,\u201d Dupree\u2019s medical records, or any other document in the record that indicates a link between Dupree\u2019s alleged chemical exposure and his alleged injuries. The medical records do not in any way state or demonstrate, even by implication, that Dupree\u2019s alleged injuries were caused by gasoline exposure. There is no evidence in the record that Dupree\u2019s alleged injuries were caused by exposure to gasoline fumes or TAME. On the record before the court, such a conclusion would be pure speculation. Because there is no evidence of an essential element of Dupree\u2019s claims, Valero is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-11\">In passing, Dupree also asserts that the district court abused its discretion by granting Valero\u2019s motion to quash Dupree\u2019s subpoena requesting a certified copy of Valero\u2019s Material Safety Data Sheets for TAME. Because Dupree offers no supporting argument, analysis, or authority, the argument is waived.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b420-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

On appeal, Dupree also asserts that Valero is liable as a manufacturer of TAME, but these claims are not supported by a fair reading of the pleadings in this case. Moreover, because causation is also an essential element of a products liability claim, our analysis of Dupree\u2019s negligence claim is dispositive of his products liability claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b420-16\">. <em>See </em>Fed.
