California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Sul has filed a response wherein he raises issues including an allegation of ineffective assistance of trial counsel. We conclude that the record is insufficiently developed to allow consideration on direct appeal of Sul\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See United States v. Brewster, </em>137 F.3d 853, 859 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-25\">Our independent review of counsel\u2019s brief, the record, and Sul\u2019s response discloses no nonfrivolous issues for appeal. Accordingly, the motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the appeal is DISMISSED without prejudice to Sul\u2019s right to raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b437-21\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
