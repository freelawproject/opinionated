No reversible error has been shown; we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-14\">Plaintiff filed suit against his employer, CCSD, and his supervisors, Hairston and Pearson, who are black. Plaintiff alleged that Pearson and Hairston, on the basis of race, discriminated against white teachers within the CCSD. Specifically, Plaintiff testified in a criminal proceeding against a white teacher, DW, who allegedly entered into a sex-for-grades arrangement with a 16-year old black male student.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In a previous appeal we concluded that Chavis had stated a claim under the second clause of section 1985(2) based on Plaintiffs evidenced allegations \u201cthat Defendants (because of their racial animosity towards DW) retaliated against Plaintiff \u2014 that is, sought to injure him \u2014 for truthfully testifying to her advantage at a criminal proceeding, that is, for attempting to enforce DW\u2019s right to the equal protection of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>laws.\u201d <em>Chavis v. Clayton County Sch. Dist., </em>300 F.3d 1288, 1293 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-5\">Plaintiff appeals some of the trial court\u2019s evidentiary decisions. We review evidentiary rulings of the district court for abuse of discretion. <em>Cabello v. Fernandez-Larios, </em>402 F.3d 1148, 1160 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">Plaintiff first argues that the district court improperly refused to allow him to present the testimony of five CCSD employees who would have testified about prior discriminatory acts against white teachers. Plaintiff claims that this evidence was crucial to show Defendants\u2019 intent to discriminate against white employees, including DW.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">At a pre-trial conference, the district court wished to keep the testimony \u201cclosely tailored\u201d to racially discriminatory remarks that Defendants made to Plaintiff; the court indicated that it did not want Plaintiff to call witnesses who merely would \u201ccome in and tell their gripes about Pearson and Hairston.\u201d The district court characterized this testimony as arising under Fed.R.Evid. 404(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">\u201cEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). But this evidence \u201cmay, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>And the district court may exclude such evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-10\">After a proffer, the district court excluded the testimony of John Ireland and Danny Langford, both CCSD teachers who said that, after they suffered adverse employment acts, they were informed by Plaintiff that they were being discriminated against and that they should hire a lawyer. The district court correctly noted that both Ireland and Langford admitted that they had no knowledge that the employment decisions against them were motivated by race.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> And the district court stated that Plaintiff himself could testify on what Defendants said to him about Langford and Ireland. We cannot say that the district court abused its discretion in excluding Langford\u2019s and Ireland\u2019s testimony. A risk of unfair prejudice to Defendants existed if this case turned into, as the district court stated, \u201ca relitigation of every personnel decision made while [Defendants] were in place down in the Clayton County School System.\u201d And since the only information about race discrimination that Langford and Ireland offered would have come from Plaintiff, the probative value of their testimony was not great.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-11\">Plaintiff also proffered the depositions of Wayne and Glenice Graves. The deposition of Ms. Graves, who was an assistant principal, showed that she was passed over for promotion by Hairston in favor of black persons and that she thought that she was \u201ca victim of Hairston.\u201d Mr. Graves, who was an assistant principal at a different school, stated in his deposition that he, too, was passed over for a promotion by Hairston and that he filed an EEOC claim, which he did not pursue, about this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-12\">As the district court suggested, a risk of substantially unfair prejudice to Defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>dants existed had the district court allowed this trial to become a set of mini-trials on Defendants\u2019 personnel decisions. And these mini-trials could have confused the jurors into thinking that the mini-trials were the main case. We also observe that the district court allowed Ms. Graves to present, on the issue of Defendants\u2019 racial animus, more probative testimony (1) that Pearson had a reputation in the community for not \u201cregard[ing] the white race with a great deal of respect\u201d and (2) that once she got to know Hairston, he seemed to prefer black administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Plaintiff also proffered the deposition of Morris Blasingame, a black CCSD employee. According to Plaintiff, Defendants were attempting to support the allegation that DW had sex with a black student by trying to find a black colleague of DW\u2019s with whom she might have had sex. Plaintiff insists that Blasingame\u2019s testimony would have shown that Defendants and the police threatened Blasingame that he would lose his job if he lied about having sex with DW. But our review of Blasingame\u2019s testimony shows that the detective investigating the DW ease \u2014 not Defendants \u2014 threatened Blasingame if Blasingame lied. Nothing in Blasingame\u2019s testimony connects Defendants with the detective\u2019s threats. Blasingame\u2019s testimony on this matter would have had no probative value on the issue of Defendant\u2019s racial animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">In sum, the district court was within its discretion to conclude that evidence of the adverse employment acts suffered by Ireland, Langford, and Mr. and Ms. Graves posed too great a danger of improperly swaying the jury to render its decision based on a relitigation of personnel issues rather than on Defendants\u2019 alleged retaliation against Plaintiff for his testimony in the DW case. And the testimony of Blasingame is not probative of the issues in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-9\">Plaintiff argues second that the district court erred by refusing to allow him to refresh the recollection of one of Defendants\u2019 witnesses, Ed Scott, a former principal who became a CCSD personnel director, on Hairston\u2019s reputation in the community for professional misconduct. Plaintiff sought to refresh Scott\u2019s memory by questioning him on a newspaper article accusing Hairston of racial misconduct against white employees. Plaintiff maintains that this evidence was relevant to show Defendants\u2019 racial animus.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-10\">Our reading of the record does not support Plaintiffs argument. Plaintiff asked Scott what Hairston\u2019s reputation in the community was for race discrimination. Scott answered that he did not have knowledge of Hairston\u2019s reputation in the community. But Scott did not say that he could not remember what Hairston\u2019s reputation was in the community. Thus, the record belies Plaintiffs statement that Scott\u2019s memory needed refreshing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Plaintiff has not demonstrated that the district court abused its discretion in refusing to allow Plaintiff to refresh Scott\u2019s recollection on Hairston\u2019s reputation in the community through the newspaper article.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b888-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b886-8\">. Part of Plaintiff's job was to investigate complaints of misconduct against teachers and other professionals.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\">. Ireland testified that he merely would be speculating about whether he felt he had been treated differently from a black coworker on the basis of race; and he admitted that he had engaged in some unprofessional conduct pri- or to the employment act taken against him. Langford stated that, although Plaintiff told him he was being discriminated against racially, he did not know whether he was being demoted because of his race.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b888-6\">. Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to introduce the newspaper article might be characterized more properly as an attempt to use extrinsic evidence to impeach Scott\u2019s testimony. But Plaintiff does not argue on appeal, nor did he argue at trial, that he wished to impeach Scott\u2019s testimony; this argument is abandoned. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b888-14\">.
