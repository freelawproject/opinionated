Robinson\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), stating that, in his opinion, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Although concluding that such allegations lacked merit, counsel asserts that Robinson\u2019s sentence violates <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Although Robinson was informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, he did not do so. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-24\">In the <em>Anders </em>brief, counsel asserts that the district court erred when it enhanced Robinson\u2019s sentence based on facts not present in the indictment, proved to a jury by a reasonable doubt, or admitted by the defendant. However, Robinson\u2019s offense level was not increased by any fact he did not admit in his factual basis to his guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-25\">Counsel also questions the validity of <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in light of <em>Blakely, </em>asserting that the district court erred when it calculated Robinson\u2019s criminal history category based on facts not present in the indictment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>found by a jury by a reasonable doubt, or admitted by the defendant. We find this claim meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Robinson\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
