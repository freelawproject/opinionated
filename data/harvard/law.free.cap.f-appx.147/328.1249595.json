On appeal, Vazquez-Moreno\u2019s attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), finding no meritorious issues for appeal, but questioning whether there was ineffective assistance of counsel. Vazquez-Moreno was informed of his right to file a supplemental pro se brief, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-17\">An allegation of ineffective assistance should not proceed on direct appeal unless it appears conclusively from the record that counsel\u2019s performance was ineffective. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Here, the record reveals quite competent representation, as Vazquez-Moreno received the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, when prior to his plea, he was a facing a possible sentence over twice as long. While the record is inadequate to show ineffective assistance, if Vazquez-Moreno possesses other evidence on this issue, he is free to assert this claim in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-18\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including Vazquez-Moreno\u2019s waiver of appeal rights in his plea agreement and at his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, and we have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Vazquez-Moreno\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
