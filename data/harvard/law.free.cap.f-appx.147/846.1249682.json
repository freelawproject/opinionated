On appeal, Vasquez-Torres argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), when it enhanced his sentence based on facts not charged in the indictment or admitted by him. After review, we vacate Vasquez-Torres\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-16\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b867-17\">Vasquez-Torres pled guilty without a plea agreement to unlawfully reentering the United States after being deported for conviction of a felony offense, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-18\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b867-19\">During the plea colloquy, the government set forth the following facts, which Vasquez-Torres admitted as true. Vasquez-Torres is a citizen of Mexico. On November 14, 1990, Vasquez-Torres was convicted in a state court in Texas of the felony offense of possession of marijuana. On December 13, 1994, Vasquez-Torres was convicted in United States District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina of conspiracy to import controlled substances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Vasquez-Torres subsequently was deported to Mexico on August 29, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-20\">On January 27, 2004, Vasquez-Torres was arrested in the Middle District of Florida for domestic battery and child abuse. Vasquez-Torres did not have permission to be back in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-21\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b867-22\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 8, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). The PSI increased the offense level by 16 levels because Vasquez-Torres previously had been deported in 1997 after a drug conviction for which the sentence exceeded 13 months. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Indeed, in 1994, Vasquez-Torres was sentenced to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment for conspiracy to import a controlled substance. The PSI also recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"848\">*848</page-number>In calculating Vasquez-Torres\u2019s criminal history category, the PSI assessed two points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), because, at the time of the instant federal illegal re-entry offense, Vasquez-Torres was wanted on a probation violation warrant from his prior state offense for marijuana possession.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">The PSI also assessed an additional criminal history point, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(e), because Vasquez-Torres illegally re-entered the United States on or before May 10, 1999, which was less than two years after his August 28, 1997, release from federal custody on the 1994 drug importation conviction.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> With a total offense level of 21 and a criminal history category of IV, Vasquez-Torres\u2019s Guidelines range was 57-71 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">Vasquez-Torres objected to the PSI\u2019s criminal history computation in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), arguing that the district court could not enhance his sentence based on the probation violation warrant or the illegal re-entry date of May 10, 1999, because neither was proven to a jury. While Vasquez-Torres objected on Sixth Amendment grounds, he did not object to the factual accuracy of the statements in the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">During the sentencing hearing, Vasquez-Torres renewed his <em>Blakely </em>objection. The district court overruled the objection, determining that Eleventh Circuit precedent established that <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">Vasquez-Torres then stated that he did not have any other objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements. However, Vasquez-Torres moved for a downward departure based upon cultural assimilation, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0. The district court overruled Vasquez-Torres\u2019s motion, stating: (1) \u201cthe more we keep him [in federal prison], the more we\u2019re preventing him from committing more crimes, especially returning to the United States\u201d; and (2) \u201cI might be more inclined to favorably receive this motion if not for the fact that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>has two prior drug convictions and they\u2019re not for personal use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">The district court then adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and sentenced Vasquez-Torres to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">On appeal, Vasquez-Torres argues that the district court erred under <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>when it increased his criminal history score two points based on the probation violation warrant for the state offense and one point based on the illegal re-entry date of May 10, 1999, being within two years of his release from custody on August 28, 1997, on the federal drug importation conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">Because Vasquez-Torres timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-15\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not violate Vasquez-Torres\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. Although Vasquez-Torres did object to the increase in his criminal history points based on the probation violation warrant and based on the illegal re-entry date of May 10, 1999, Vasquez-Torres objected only on <em>Blakely </em>constitutional grounds. Vasquez-Torres did not object to the factual statements in the PSI, which outlined the existence of his probation violation warrant, his release from custody on August 28, 1997, on the federal drug importation conviction, and his illegal re-entry date of May 10, 1999. Thus, he is deemed to have admitted the facts regarding those matters. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cBurge waived his objections to the factual statements about his relevant conduct in the presentence report and, therefore, admitted the facts in that report.\u201d); <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that sentence enhancement based on drug quantity did not violate <em>Booker </em>where defendant did not dispute the facts in the PSI).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not violate Vasquez-Torres\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights by increasing his sentence based on facts that he did not admit.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-16\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Vasquez-Torres under a mandatory Guidelines regime. Thus, we must determine whether the statutoiy error in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"850\">*850</page-number>Vasquez-Torres\u2019s sentencing is harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, and citation omitted). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless and the standard \u201cis not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">We conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden as to Vasquez-Torres\u2019s sentence. There is no evidence or other indication in the record suggesting what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. We recognize that under a mandatory Guidelines regime, the district court denied Vasquez-Torres\u2019s motion for a downward departure and stated that Vasquez-Torres should remain in prison. However, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">Thus, we vacate Vasquez-Torres\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing. We note that the district court correctly calculated Vasquez-Torres\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). On remand, the district court is required to sentence Vasquez-Torres under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 57-71 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b867-14\">. According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI\u201d), Vasquez-Torres was released from custody on the federal drug importation conviction on August 28, 1997.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b868-6\">. Under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d), two points should be added to a defendant\u2019s criminal history category \"if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence, including probation, parole, supervised release, imprisonment, work release, or escape status.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-7\">According to the commentary,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-8\">A defendant who commits the instant offense while a violation warrant from a prior sentence is outstanding (e.g., a probation, parole, or supervised release violation warrant) shall be deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of this provision if that sentence is otherwise countable, even if that sentence would have expired absent such warrant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d) app. 4. Because Vasquez-Torres committed the instant illegal re-entry offense while there was a probation violation warrant from a prior state sentence, Vasquez-Torres was deemed to be under a criminal justice sentence for the purposes of the two-point increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b868-13\">. Section 4A1.1(e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b868-14\">Add 2 points if the defendant committed the instant offense less than two years after release from imprisonment on a sentence counted under (a) or (b) or while in imprisonment or escape status on such a sentence. If 2 points are added for item (d), add only 1 point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b868-15\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-16\">Section 4Al.l(a) provides that three points should be added \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Section 4Al.l(b) provides that two points should be added \"for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least sixty days not counted in (a).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-17\">Because Vasquez-Torres\u2019s 1994 drug importation conviction carried a term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, it qualified as a prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month under \u00a7 4A 1.1(a), and thus qualified for the one point addition in \u00a7 4Al.l(e).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b869-11\">.

We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
