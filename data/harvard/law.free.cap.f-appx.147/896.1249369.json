Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Castro v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1986, 161 L.Ed.2d 846 (2005). We previously affirmed Castro\u2019s conviction. <em>United States v. Castro, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 981 (11th Cir.2004). After reconsideration, we affirm Castro\u2019s sentence, reinstate our previous opinion with the exception of Part III.D., and replace Part III.D. with the following discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-23\">Castro did not object during his sentencing hearing to the mandatory application by the district court of the Sentencing Guidelines. Our review, therefore, is limited to plain error. <em>United States v. Duncan, </em>400 F.3d 1297, 1301 (11th Cir.2005). \u2018We have discretion to correct an error under the plain error standard where (1) an error occurred, (2) the error was plain, (3) the error affected substantial rights, and (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court \u201capplied the Guidelines as if they were mandatory, and that constitutes error which is clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal after <em>Booker.</em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304 (internal quotations omitted). Castro, however, \u201ccannot meet the third prong of plain error review because he cannot show that this error affected his substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b917-24\">Castro \u201cbears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To meet this burden, Castro must show \u201ca reasonable probability of a different result if the guidelines had been applied in an advisory instead of binding fashion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court sentenced Castro at the low end of the Guideline range. Such a sentence, however, \u201cestablishes only that the court felt that sentence was appropriate under the mandatory guidelines system. It does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>not establish a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1361 (11th Cir.2005). Castro also quotes statements by the district court that it considered the Guidelines binding. These statements show that the district court erred by applying the Guidelines as mandatory, but they do not establish a reasonable probability that the district court would have imposed a different sentence if it applied the Guidelines as advisory. Castro, therefore, \u201ccannot meet his burden.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>400 F.3d at 1304.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">After reconsideration, we again affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">OPINION REINSTATED IN PART; AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
