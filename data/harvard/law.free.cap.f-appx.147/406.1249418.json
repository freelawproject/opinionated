He appeals his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-20\">For the first time on appeal, Rodriguez-Castillo contends that he was illegally sentenced pursuant to the formerly mandatory sentencing guidelines regime, in violation of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Rodriguez-Castillo\u2019s plea agreement contained a waiver-of-appeal provision by which he waived \u201cthe right to appeal the sentence imposed or the manner in which it was determined,\u201d except for a sentence above the statutory maximum or an upward departure from the applicable guidelines range. At his rearraignment, the magistrate judge incorrectly told him that he retained the right to appeal an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d Rodriguez-Castillo does not dispute the voluntariness of his plea. However, because we have considered the waiver issue as a jurisdictional matter, we raise this aspect of the waiver issue sua sponte. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>263 F.3d 436, 438 (5th Cir.2001). Because the magistrate judge inaccurately described the waiver provision, Rodriguez-Castillo\u2019s waiver cannot be deemed knowing and voluntary with respect to an \u201cillegal sentence.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ll(b)(l)(N); <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Sentencing a defendant pursuant to a mandatory guidelines scheme, standing alone, constitutes <em>\u201cFanfan </em>\u201d error, and such an error is \u201cplain.\u201d <em>See Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769; <em>United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 733 (5th Cir.2005). Rodriguez-Castillo makes no argument, and \u201cthere is no indication in the record from the sentencing judge\u2019s remarks or otherwise\u201d that the court would have imposed a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 522 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005)(No. 04-9517). Because Rodriguez-Castillo has not shown that the error affected his \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d <em>see id. </em>at 521, he has not demonstrated plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Rodriguez-Castillo also argues that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), and its progeny, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) is unconstitutional because it permits a sentencing judge to increase a sentence beyond the statutory maximum based on a factor that need not be submitted to a jury for proof or admitted by the defendant. Rodriguez-Castillo concedes that this argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), but he seeks to preserve the issue for possible Supreme Court review. This court must follow <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201c \u2018unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it .\u2019 \u201c <em>United States v. Izaguirre-Flores, </em>405 F.3d 270, 277-78 (5th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
