Martinez argues on appeal that the district court committed reversible error in sentencing him under the then-mandatory United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cfederal guidelines\u201d), in light of <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. -, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). For the reasons set forth more fully below, we vacate Martinez\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-10\">A federal grand jury returned a superseding indictment against Martinez, charging him with the above-referenced offense. This superseding indictment did not include a drug amount, other than the statutory amount of 50 grams or more of methamphetamine. Martinez subsequently pled guilty to this conspiracy offense, without the benefit of a plea agreement. Martinez, however, stipulated in a \u201cnotice of essential elements, penalty and factual basis\u201d (\u201cfactual basis), to the specific amounts of drugs that he distributed. The court adjudicated him guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">Prior to sentencing, a probation officer prepared a presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), which included the following description of Martinez\u2019s offense conduct. In June and July 2003, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) obtained federally authorized wiretaps of Javier Barajas, from which they learned that Barajas and another individual were responsible for distributing marijuana, cocaine, and methamphetamine in the Central Florida area. Beginning in July 2003, DEA agents made seven separate controlled drug purchases from Martinez, who was working with his father, Nicholas Martinez-Gomez, the person who had purchased the drugs from Barajas. The PSI also included the drug amounts to which Martinez stipulated as part of the factual basis, that is, that he personally sold a total of 995 grams of cocaine hydrochloride, 2,682 grams of marijuana, and 162 grams of methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-16\">Based on this offense conduct, the probation officer determined that Martinez was responsible for a total equivalent amount of 525.56 kilograms of marijuana, and set his offense level at 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6) (offense level applicable for offenses involving at least 400 kilograms, but less than 700 kilograms, of marijuana).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The probation officer also recommended a two-level decrease in this level, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(6) (\u201csafety valve relief\u2019), and a three-level downward adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, for acceptance of responsibility. With an adjusted offense level of 23, and a criminal history category of I, Martinez\u2019s resulting guideline range was 46 to 57 months\u2019 imprisonment. The probation officer also determined that no factors warranted a departure from this guideline range. Martinez raised no objections to the PSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-17\">On November 24, 2004, at sentencing, Martinez again stated that he had no objections to the PSI\u2019s factual statements and calculations, but he generally objected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>to the court\u2019s use of the federal guidelines, pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Blakely. </em>The district court implicitly overruled Martinez\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection and adopted the PSI\u2019s contents. Martinez then moved the court either to depart downward from his guideline range or to sentence him at the bottom of this range, based on (1) Martinez\u2019s lack of a criminal history, and (2) the fact that his father encouraged him to become involved in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Construing Martinez\u2019s oral departure motion as one made pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0, the court determined that the motion had no legal basis and denied it. After giving Martinez the opportunity to allocute, and after confirming that neither party objected to a sentence at the low end of the guideline range, the court sentenced him to 46 months\u2019 imprisonment, 3 years\u2019 supervised release, 75 hours\u2019 community service, and a $100 special assessment fee. The court also denied Martinez\u2019s motion to surrender at a later date because (1) the government had not consented to self-surrender, and (2) Martinez had continued using drugs while he was on supervised release pending sentencing. Martinez raised no objections to the court\u2019s pronouncement of sentence, other than those he raised during the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Filing his appeal brief after the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>Martinez argues on appeal that the court plainly erred in sentencing him based on the then-mandatory federal guidelines. Martinez contends that the court violated the Sixth Amendment by holding him accountable for more than the amount of drugs that was charged in his indictment, and by determining that it could not depart based on the fact that Martinez\u2019s father encouraged him to join the conspiracy. Martinez also asserts that his substantial rights were violated because his sentence was \u201cbased in part upon misinformation of a constitutional magnitude,\u201d and because the district court should have been given the opportunity to sentence him properly under <em>Booker. </em>Moreover, he summarily asserts that his sentence resulted in manifest error. Finally, Martinez generally contends that resentencing is mandated because (1) the federal drug laws under which he was sentenced are \u201cviolent and aggressive,\u201d and (2) his offense conduct involved nonviolent criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Although Martinez argues on appeal that our review is only for plain error, he properly preserved both his constitutional and non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>claims in the district court by citing to <em>Blakely </em>in his objection at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Dowling, </em>403 F.3d 1242, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that a defendant either must (1) refer to the Sixth Amendment; (2) <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or another related case; (3) assert his right to have the jury decide the disputed fact; or (4) raise a challenge to the role of the judge as factfinder to preserve a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim). Because Martinez timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely /Booker </em>claim on appeal <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted). Under harmless-error review, the government carries the burden of proof. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">In <em>Apprendi, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id., </em>530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. at 2362-63. Before Martinez\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Supreme Court revisited that rule in <em>Blakely, </em>in the context of Washington <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>state\u2019s sentencing guideline scheme, and clarified that \u201cthe \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant </em>.... In other words, the relevant \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without </em>any additional findings.\u201d <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Applying these principles, the Supreme Court held that Blakely\u2019s sentence \u2014 which was enhanced under the state guidelines based on the sentencing court\u2019s additional finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Blakely committed his kidnaping offense with deliberate cruelty \u2014 violated the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. In a footnote, however, the Court explicitly remarked that \u201c[t]he Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at - n. 9, 124 S.Ct. at 2538 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-15\">In a second and separate majority opinion, the Court in <em>Booker </em>concluded that, to best preserve Congress\u2019s intent in enacting the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the appropriate remedy was to \u201cexcise\u201d two specific sections \u2014 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(b)(1) (requiring a sentence within the guideline range, absent a departure) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e) (establishing standards of review on appeal, including <em>de novo </em>review of departures from the applicable guideline range) \u2014 thereby effectively rendering the Sentencing Guidelines advisory only. <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764. Thus, the guidelines range is now advisory; it no longer dictates the final sentencing result but instead is an important sentencing factor that the sentencing court is to consider, along with the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Id. </em>at -, 125 S.Ct. at 764-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-19\">Following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker, </em>in <em>United States v. Reese, </em>397 F.3d 1337 (11th Cir.2005), we re-examined on remand a defendant\u2019s guideline sentence that had been enhanced, over objection, because the defendant had possessed a firearm in connection with another felony offense. <em>Id. </em>at 1337. Concluding that the defendant\u2019s sentence was in violation of the Sixth Amendment, we vacated and remanded his sentence and ordered resentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinions in <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 1338.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-20\">In <em>Paz, </em>we similarly examined a <em>Blakely /Booker </em>challenge to a guideline enhancement based on the district court\u2019s factual finding on an amount of loss involved in an offense. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 947. We determined that the defendant\u2019s sentence was erroneous because (1) it was based on judicially determined facts that were not admitted by the defendant, and (2) it was enhanced under a mandatory guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>system. <em>Id. </em>at 948. Moreover, we concluded that the government could not prove that these errors were harmless because the sentencing transcript clearly showed that, had the district court treated the federal guidelines as advisory, the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment would have been shorter. <em>Id. </em>at 948-49. We, therefore, vacated and remanded Paz\u2019s sentence for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. Id. </em>at 949.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">Here, the court set Martinez\u2019s base offense level at 28, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(6), based on the fact that Martinez was responsible for a total equivalent amount of 525.56 kilograms of marijuana. Nevertheless, Martinez admitted this drug amount as part of his factual basis, and by not disputing this fact at sentencing. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that sentence enhancement based on drug quantity did not violate <em>Booker </em>where the defendant did not dispute the facts in the PSI); <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting <em>Booker </em>challenge under plain-error review because the defendant admitted facts relating to his relevant conduct by abandoning at sentencing his objections to various factual statements in the PSI). Thus, the court\u2019s determination of drug amount did not result in a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">As the government concedes, however, the court sentenced Martinez with the understanding that the federal guidelines were mandatory, instead of advisory. A non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, therefore, occurred. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31 (concluding that statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory [guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">We have determined that there are two harmless-error standards of review for <em>Booker </em>errors, dependent on whether the error is constitutional or statutory. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2005). We explained in <em>Paz </em>\u2014 an appeal involving a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 that, when a constitutional <em>Booker </em>error occurs, the government only may establish that it was harmless by showing, under a heightened standard, that \u201cit is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948 (internal quotation and marks omitted). On the other hand, in <em>Mathenia, </em>we determined that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-10\">non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Mathenia, 409 F.3d at 1290 (internal quotations and marks omitted).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">We further explained in <em>Mathenia </em>that \u201c[t]he non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet. It is as difficult for the government to meet that standard as it is for a defendant to meet the third-prong prejudice standard for plain error review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290. Nevertheless, we determined that the government had met this burden by citing to a statement by the district court that, if the Supreme Court determined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>that the federal guidelines were unconstitutional as mandatorily applied, the district court \u201cnonetheless [would] consider the guidelines as \u2014 for their persuasive value or as advisory, and the sentence [the court] would impose would be the same.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We, therefore, concluded in <em>Mathenia </em>that the government \u201cdemonstrated with fair assurance that the district court\u2019s error of applying the guidelines in a mandatory fashion did not affect, or had but a slight affect, on [the defendant\u2019s] ultimate sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1290-91.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Because this case involves only a non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, we must apply the test discussed in <em>Mathenia, </em>instead of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d test discussed in <em>Paz. </em>The district court did not state that it would have imposed a lighter sentence, but for the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines. However, the court, without objection, sentenced Martinez at the bottom of his guideline range. <em>But see United States v. Fields, </em>408 f.3d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding, under plain-error review, that the fact that the defendant was sentenced at the bottom his mandatory guideline range, without more, is insufficient evidence for the defendant to satisfy the prejudice prong). Moreover, unlike the facts in <em>Mathenia </em>and <em>Robles, </em>the government has not cited to evidence in the record showing that the court would have imposed an identical sentence if it had been proceeding under an advisory-guideline system.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">The record, therefore, does not show \u201cwith fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error.\u201d <em>See Mathenia, </em>at 1290-91. The government has not shown that Martinez\u2019s substantial rights were not violated, and, thus, it has not proven that the <em>Booker </em>error was harmless. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271-72 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that, despite the district court\u2019s grant of a motion for a downward departure for substantial assistance, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1, the government could not show that the court\u2019s mandatory application of the guidelines in sentencing the defendant was harmless, because the \u00a7 5K1.1 motion only gave the court limited discretion in considering the defendant\u2019s assistance).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the court\u2019s error in sentencing Martinez was not harmless. We, therefore, vacate and remand Martinez\u2019s sentence for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b942-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-12\">. The PSI calculated this total drug amount by applying the drag equivalency table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, and by converting the individual drag amounts to their marijuana equivalents.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b941-7\">. Phrasing this test conversely, we also have explained that non-constitutional error is harmless unless it \"resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the [re-suit].\u201d <em>See United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999)); <em>see also United States v. Petho, </em>409 F.3d 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b942-6\">. In reaching this conclusion in <em>Mathenia, </em>we cited to our decision in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324 (11th Cir.2005), in which we concluded \u2014 under the more stringent harmless error test for constitutional <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 that the error was harmless where the court unequivocally stated that its sentence would be the same even if the federal guidelines only were advisory. <em>See Mathenia, </em>at 1290.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
