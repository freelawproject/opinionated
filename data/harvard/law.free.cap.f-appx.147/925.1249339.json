The small boat carried five men, four of whom had been hired by the fifth man to drive the speed boat to Guatemala. On arriving at the speed boat, the four crew members, one of which was Wilfredo Cuero Hurtado, boarded it and departed for Guatemala.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-11\">Two days into the journey, with Hurtado captaining the speed boat, a United States navy helicopter spotted the speed boat and contacted the United States Coast Guard. Upon seeing the helicopter, Hurtado attempted to flee and the crew began dumping several bales of cocaine into the ocean. Despite the escape effort, the Coast Guard vessel overtook the speed boat and recovered the cocaine. A later analysis revealed that the bales contained 1,586.6 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-13\">Hurtado and the three other crew members were each indicted for one count of possession with intent to distribute five kilograms or more of cocaine while on board a vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and one count of conspiracy to commit the same, in violation of 46 App. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), 0), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii). Hurtado pleaded guilty to the possession count and the government dismissed the conspiracy count. Hurtado was sentenced to 210 months in prison. He now challenges his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-15\">Hurtado contends that during his Rule 11 hearing the district court failed to advise him of his right to: (1) plead not guilty and persist in that plea; (2) a have jury trial; (3) be represented by counsel, whether retained or appointed; (4) confront and cross examine adverse witnesses; (5) be protected from compelled self-incrimination; (6) testify and present evidence; and, (7) compel the attendance of witnesses. And, according to Hurtado, the court failed to inform him that he would waive these rights by pleading guilty. He argues that without being informed of these rights, he did not know and understand the consequences of his plea, and therefore, it was not made knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-16\">We review the issue of a Rule 11 violation for plain error when, as here, the defendant did not raise any Rule 11 issue before the district court. <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1290 (11th Cir.2003). Under that standard, the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>fendant has the burden to prove that (1) the district court committed an error (2) that is plain, (3) that affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, and (4) that seriously implicated the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">When a defendant enters a guilty plea, a district court must ensure that \u201cthe three core concerns of Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have been met: the guilty plea must be free from coercion; the defendant must understand the nature of the charges; and, the defendant must know and understand the consequences of his guilty plea.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1289. Recently, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca defendant who seeks reversal of his conviction after a guilty plea, on the ground that the district court committed plain error under Rule 11, must show a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Dominguez-Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, -, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 2340, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-8\">Here, the district court did not err. A defendant\u2019s written plea agreement is part of the record of his Rule 11 hearing. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>143 F.3d 1417, 1420 (11th Cir.1998). Hurtado\u2019s plea agreement stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-9\">The defendant acknowledges that [he] is entering into this agreement and is pleading guilty freely and voluntarily without reliance upon any discussions between the attorney for the government and the defendant and defendant\u2019s attorney and without promise of benefit of any kind ... and without threats, force, intimidation, or coercion of any kind.... The defendant also understands that [he] has the right to plead not guilty or to persist in that plea if it has already been made, and that [he] has the right to be tried by a jury with the assistance of counsel, the right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against [him], the right against compulsory self-incrimination, and the right to compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses to testify in [his] defense; but, by pleading guilty, defendant waives or gives up those rights and there will be no trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-11\">(R.l:35:13-14.) In other words, Hurtado\u2019s plea agreement informed him of his rights. The agreement also stated that Hurtado understood that by pleading guilty he gave up these rights. The magistrate judge, in front of whom Hurtado entered his guilty plea, twice asked Hurtado, \u201cdo you understand all the terms contained in the plea agreement?\u201d (R.4:10; 14-15.) Hurtado twice responded, \u2018Tes.\u201d (R.4:ll; 15.) Hurtado, then, cannot contend now that he wasn\u2019t informed of his rights, or that his guilty plea was not knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently given.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">Even if the district court had erred at the Rule 11 hearing, however, Hurtado would still lose. That\u2019s because he has not stated, in his initial brief or anywhere else, that he would not have pleaded guilty but for the magistrate judge\u2019s failure to inform him of all his Rule 11 rights. Without such an allegation, we cannot say that Hurtado\u2019s Rule 11 hearing was plainly erroneous. <em>See Dominguez-Benitez, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2340.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-15\">Hurtado also contends that his sentence violated the Sixth Amendment as interpreted by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Because Hurtado raised the <em>Booker </em>issue for the first time on appeal, we review his contention for plain error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied </em>\u2014 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>-, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">We have found that a district court might make two errors when sentencing a defendant <em>pre-Booker: </em>a constitutional error and a statutory one. \u201cThe constitutional error is the use of extra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge; the error is in the mandatory nature of the guidelines once the guidelines range has been determined.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations omitted). \u201cThe statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u2018under a mandatory [gjuidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">Here, the district court did not make a <em>Booker </em>constitutional error because Hurtado pleaded guilty to the facts underlying his conviction for possession of cocaine and the enhancement for captaining the boat under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3). The district court did make a <em>Booker </em>statutory error, however, because it sentenced Hurtado under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. We have held that this error is plain. <em>Id. </em>at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-7\">Hurtado argues that this error affected his substantial rights because the district court said at his sentencing hearing that it was \u201cgoing to give [Hurtado] the least sentence that [it could] give [him] under those guidelines.\u201d (R.5:7.) That, contrary to Hurtado\u2019s argument, is not enough to demonstrate that the district court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>statutory error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">First, we have held that \u201cthe fact that the district court sentenced the defendant to the bottom of the applicable guidelines range establishes only that the court felt that sentence was appropriate under the mandatory guidelines system. It does not establish a reasonable probability that the court would have imposed a lesser sentence under an advisory regime.\u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1361 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b948-10\">Second, as we stated in <em>Shelton, </em>\u201cthe plain error test is difficult to meet, and in particular, the burden of showing prejudice to meet the third-prong requirement is anything but easy.\u201d <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1331-32 (quotations omitted). In <em>Shelton, </em>the district court \u201cexpressed several times its view that the sentence required by the Guidelines was too severe\u201d and said that the low-range sentence it was permitted to give under the guidelines was \u201c \u2018more than appropriate.\u2019\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332. Those comments, taken together, were satisfactory to meet the heavy burden of showing under plain error review that the error affected his substantial rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-11\">Here, the district court expressed no such regret at having to apply the sentencing guidelines to Hurtado. Nor did it suggest that the guidelines were particularly harsh in his case. Rather, the district court merely sentenced him to the low end of guidelines, having considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, as it had every right to do. This, we held in <em>Fields, </em>is not enough to meet the third prong prejudice test under plain error review.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-13\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM Hurtado\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<author id=\"b948-14\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b948-15\">The court rejects appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim because, although the district court\u2019s error in sentencing appellant under a mandatory guidelines scheme is plain, appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>lant has not shown that the error affected his substantial rights. He has not done so because he can\u2019t point to anything the court said during the sentencing hearing that would permit us to conclude that but for the mandatory nature of the guidelines, the court would have imposed a lesser sentence. Put another way, the court failed to utter what I call the \u201cmagic words.\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>No. 422 F.3d 1285, 1288 (11th Cir.2005) (Tjoflat, J., dissenting). Were we writing on a clean slate, I would jettison the magic words formulation, which the court coined in <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>vacate appellant\u2019s sentence, and remand the case for resentencing under Booker\u2019s new sentencing model. As I explained in <em>Thompson, </em>the <em>Rodriguez </em>formulation \u201cfosters disrespect for the rule of law.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (\u201cThe court, in determining the particular sentence to be imposed, shall consider the need for the sentence imposed to ... promote respect for the law....).\u201d <em>United States v. Thompson, </em>422 F.3d at 1288.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
