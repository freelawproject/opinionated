However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>it appears that we do not have jurisdiction to consider this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-5\">We review \u201cquestions of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo.\" Brooks v. Ashcroft, </em>283 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2002). We are \u201cobligated to inquire into subject-matter jurisdiction sua sponte whenever it may be lacking.\u201d <em>Cadet v. Bulger, </em>377 F.3d 1173, 1179 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation and citation omitted). While we generally have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal, the petition for review must be filed within 30 days of the date of the final order of removal. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 242(a)(1), (b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), (b)(1). We have held that \u201c[s]ince the statutory limit for filing a petition for review in an immigration proceeding is \u2018mandatory and jurisdictional,\u2019 it is not subject to equitable tolling.\u201d <em>Dakane v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>399 F.3d 1269, 1272 n. 3 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 1549, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995)). A motion to reconsider filed with the BIA does not suspend the finality of the underlying BIA order and does not toll the review period. <em>Stone, </em>514 U.S. at 405-06, 115 S.Ct. at 1549 (construing the former 90-day period for filing a petition for review under the INA \u00a7 106(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">We conclude that we are without jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal issued on April 27, 2004. Beqiri was required to file a petition for review of his underlying claims by May 27, 2004, and he failed to do so. Although Beqiri filed a motion to reconsider (or reopen) the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal on May 26, 2004, the filing did not toll the limitations period for filing a petition for review in this Court. Moreover, Beqiri filed his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s order denying his motion to reconsider on August 2, 2004, which was more than 30 days after the BIA\u2019s final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-7\">Beqiri next argues that the BIA abused its discretion by not addressing the questions raised in his motion to reconsider. In his motion, Beqiri indicated that his reasons for seeking reconsideration were that additional documents were necessary to make a fair assessment of the case as the BIA had not done so in the first place. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reconsider or reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Assa'ad v. U.S. Att'y Gen., </em>332 F.3d 1321, 1341 (11th Cir.2003). \u201cJudicial review of denials of discretionary relief incident to deportation proceedings ... is limited to determining \u2018whether there has been an exercise of administrative discretion and whether the matter of exercise has been arbitrary or capricious.\u2019\u201d <em>See Garcia-Mir v. Smith, </em>766 F.2d 1478, 1490 (11th Cir.1985) (citation omitted) (addressing a motion to reopen). The BIA abuses its discretion when its decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements.\u201d <em>Mickeviciute v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 1159, 1162 (10th Cir.2003) (quotation omitted). We do not review issues that are not argued in the petition. <em>See Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-8\">A motion to reconsider \u201cshall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d INA \u00a7 240(c)(6)(C), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C); see <em>also </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). For that reason, motions to reconsider are distinguishable from motions to reopen. <em>Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 90-91 (2d Cir.2001); <em>Chudshevid v. INS, </em>641 F.2d 780, 783-84 (9th Cir.1981). \u201cA motion to reconsider asserts that at the time of the Board\u2019s previous decision an error was made.\u201d <em>Zhao, </em>265 F.3d at 90 (internal quotation omitted). When the BIA reconsiders one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>of its prior decisions, it reevaluates its prior decision on the factual record as it existed at the time the original decision was rendered. <em>Id. </em>In contrast, a motion to reopen asserts that the prior proceedings should be reopened for the introduction of new evidence so a new decision may be rendered on the basis of the new evidence. <em>Id. </em>at 90; <em>see also </em>INA \u00a7 240(c)(7)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(B); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">Motions to reopen are disfavored, especially in a removal proceeding, \u201cwhere, as a general matter, every delay works to the advantage of the deportable alien who wishes merely to remain in the United States.\u201d <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323, 112 S.Ct. 719, 724-25, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). \u201c[Tjhere are at least three independent grounds upon which the [BIA] may deny a motion to reopen: 1) failure to establish a prima facie case; 2) failure to introduce evidence that was material and previously unavailable; and 3) a determination that despite the alien\u2019s statutory eligibility for relief, he or she is not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1302 (11th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The proponent of a motion to reopen faces a \u201cheavy burden and [must] present[] evidence of such a nature that the Board is satisfied that if proceedings before the [IJ] were reopened, with all the attendant delays, the new evidence offered would likely change the result in the case.\u201d <em>Matter of Coelho, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 464, 473 (B.I.A. 1992) (citing <em>Doherty, </em>502 U.S. at 323, 112 S.Ct. at 724-25) (quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">We conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Beqiri\u2019s motion to reconsider. Beqiri did not raise any arguments or specify any errors of law or fact in the BIA\u2019s or IJ\u2019s decision as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) and 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1). To the extent that the motion is considered a motion to reopen, Beqiri\u2019s argument in his brief to this Court does not address how the new evidence undermines the IJ\u2019s decision. Though he mentions that his reasons for asking for reconsideration were somehow contained in the documents he submitted to the BIA, he does not argue how these documents would warrant a new decision based on their contents. He only argues that the BIA and IJ erred in their evaluation of (or failure to evaluate) the facts before them, at the time of their decision. As Beqiri only addressed errors that he asserts occurred before the IJ and BIA, and not how the new evidence would change the outcome of the case, he has thus abandoned any argument that the BIA abused its discretion in denying his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Upon review of the record, and having considered the briefs of the parties, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">PETITION DISMISSED IN PART, DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b108-16\">. Because Beqiri's removal proceedings commenced after April 1, 1997, the effective date of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (\"IIRIRA\"), this case is governed by the permanent provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\u201d), as amended by IIRIRA. <em>Gonzalez-Oropeza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>321 F.3d 1331, 1332 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
