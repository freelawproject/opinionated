On appeal, Castillo-Lagos argues that: (1) the district court violated his constitutional rights, pursuant to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by enhancing his term of supervised release based on the fact of a prior felony conviction that was neither alleged in the charging document nor admitted by him in the guilty plea, and (2) the district court\u2019s requirement, imposed pursuant to the DNA-collection requirements of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a(a), that he cooperate with the government in the collection of his DNA violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-20\">Because Castillo-Lagos raised his <em>Blakely/Booker </em>objection in the district court, we review his sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will reverse only for harmful error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal analysis regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 14135a(a). <em>See Padgett v. Donald, </em>401 F.3d 1273 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b92-21\">After thorough review of the record, as well as careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. However, we find <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional, or statutory, error. Because the government has not met its burden to show harmlessness, we vacate and remand Castillo-Lagos\u2019s sentence for resentencing, pursuant to the discretionary Sentencing Guidelines scheme now required by <em>Booker. </em>In all other respects, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-22\">The relevant facts are these. On September 30, 2004, Castillo-Lagos, who waived his right to an indictment, was charged, in a one-count information, with unlawful re-entry after deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326. He pled guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>without the benefit of a plea agreement and proceeded to sentencing. According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) was contacted by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office (\u201cJSO\u201d) on August 30, 2004 after Castillo-Lagos had fraudulently represented himself to the JSO as a Mexican citizen named Kevin Ramirez, in an attempt to obtain a background check. After ICE took Castillo-Lagos into custody, a review of his file revealed that he was a Honduran citizen who had been previously deported twice, on February 9, 2001 and on July 10, 2003. Castillo-Lagos\u2019s file further indicated that he did not have permission to be in the United States. Castillo-Lagos admitted to the ICE agents that he had re-entered the United States illegally in March 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">The PSI set Castillo-Lagos\u2019s base offense level at eight, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, and recommended the following: (1) a 4-level upward adjustment, pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), which applies when a defendant was previously deported, or unlawfully remained in the United States, after being convicted of a felony,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) a 2-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, under \u00a7 3El.l(a). With an adjusted offense level of 10 and a criminal history category I, Castillo-Lagos\u2019s Guidelines range was 6 to 12 months\u2019 imprisonment, followed by 2 to 3 years\u2019 supervised release. The statutory maximum term for his offense was 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and 3 years\u2019 supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">Castillo-Lagos objected to the PSI\u2019s enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D), arguing that the enhancement violated <em>Blakely. </em>He also asserted that because no prior felony conviction was alleged in the indictment, the maximum punishment for the offense should be 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and 1 year of supervised release. At the sentencing hearing, in response to the district court\u2019s inquiry about Castillo-Lagos\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection, defense counsel stated that Castillo-Lagos did not \u201cfactually dispute the presentence investigation report, just the legal consequences of those facts.\u201d The district court overruled the objections to the \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(D) enhancement and the calculation of the statutory maximum. The court adopted the PSI\u2019s factual findings and resulting Guidelines range sentenced Castillo-Lagos to a 6-month term of imprisonment followed by a 3-year term of supervised release. The district court further ordered, over Castillo-Lagos\u2019s objection, that he \u201ccooperate with the collection of DNA by whomever in the United States government ultimately has the responsibility for collecting DNA.\u201d This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">First, Castillo-Lagos argues that the district court erred by increasing the statutory maximum sentence applicable to his offense as a result of a prior conviction because the indictment did not allege that he had been convicted of an aggravated felony. He contends the sentence violated <em>Blakely </em>(now Booker), which, according to Castillo-Lagos, implicitly overruled the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998) (holding that fact of a prior conviction for purposes of enhancing a defendant\u2019s sentence may be determined by the sentencing court by a preponderance of the evidence). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">In <em>Blakely, </em>the Supreme Court held that, under the State of Washington\u2019s man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>datory sentencing guidelines system, the imposition of a sentencing enhancement based upon facts neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury violated the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial. <em>Blakely, </em>542 U.S. at -, 124 S.Ct. at 2534-38. Thereafter, the Supreme Court extended this holding to the federal Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at -, 125 S.Ct. at 760. Based on the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Booker, </em>we have stated that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) a Sixth Amendment error \u2014 the error of imposing a sentencing enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury, and (2) a statutory error \u2014 the error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">In the instant case, we easily conclude, based on our consistent line of <em>post-Booker </em>cases on the very issue presented here, that there was no <em>Booker </em>constitutional error. In <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>\u201cthe Supreme Court held that the government need not allege in its indictment and need not prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant had prior convictions for a district court to use those convictions for purposes of enhancing a sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Marseille, </em>377 F.3d 1249, 1257 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 637, 160 L.Ed.2d 480 (2004). The <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>decision \u201cwas left undisturbed by <em>Apprendi, Blakely, </em>and <em>Booker.\u201d Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1329; <em>see also United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.) (stating that the holding in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>was left undisturbed by Booker), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>No. 05-5141 (Jul. 1, 2005). Because Castillo-Lagos admitted to the fact of his prior conviction and a Sixth Amendment violation does not occur when a district court relies on prior convictions to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court did not commit <em>Booker </em>constitutional error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b94-15\">Despite the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation, because Castillo-Lagos was sentenced under a mandatory sentencing regime, there was <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional, or statutory, error. <em>United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (citing <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1300 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005)). \u201cThe use of the guidelines as mandatory was error, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment violation.\u201d <em>Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d at 1277 (citing <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-18\">The government bears the burden to establish the harmlessness of a <em>Booker </em>non-constitutional error and must show that the error did not affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948. \u201cThe non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005). A statutory <em>Booker </em>error is harmless if, \u201cviewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], \u2018or had but very slight effect.\u2019 If one can say \u2018with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error,\u2019 the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-19\">Here, the government has failed to meet its burden. Moreover, our own review of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>the record reveals no indication of what sentence the district court would have imposed had it known the Guidelines were advisory only. Accordingly, because \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done,\u201d the government has not met its burden to show that the error was harmless, and we must vacate Castillo-Lagos\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Compare United States v. Phillips, </em>413 F.3d 1288, 1293 (11th Cir.2005) (finding statutory error harmless where district court articulated alternate sentence using factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (citing <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292-93; <em>United States v. Petho, </em>409 F.3d 1277, 1280 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1327 (11th Cir.2005)).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Finally, we are unpersuaded by Castillo-Lagos\u2019s argument that the district court\u2019s requirement that he cooperate with the government in the collection of his DNA violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Federal law provides that a DNA sample shall be collected from each person in the custody of the Bureau of Prisons or on probation, parole, or supervised release, who was convicted of a qualifying federal offense. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a(a)(l), (2). A qualifying federal offense includes any felony. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14135a(d)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">In <em>Padgett, </em>we held that a Georgia DNA profiling statute did not violate the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. <em>See </em>401 F.3d at 1275, 1280.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We applied a balancing test and determined that because the \u201clegitimate interest in creating a permanent record of convicted felons for law enforcement purposes outweighs the minor intrusion involved in taking prisoners\u2019 saliva samples and storing their DNA profiles, given prisoners\u2019 reduced expectation of privacy in their identities,\u201d the statute did not violate the Fourth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 1280. As Castillo-Lagos concedes, no meaningful distinction exists between the Georgia DNA profiling statute that we upheld and the federal DNA profiling statute. According to our prior precedent rule, <em>Padgett </em>is the controlling law on this issue and we must follow it here. <em>See United States v. Hogan, </em>986 F.2d 1364, 1369 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[I]t is the firmly established rule of this Circuit that each succeeding panel is bound by the holding of the first panel to address an issue of law, unless and until that holding is overruled en banc or by the Supreme Court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">Based on the foregoing, we vacate and remand Castillo-Lagos\u2019s sentence to the district court for re-sentencing consistent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>with the remedial holding of <em>Booker. </em>We affirm on all other issues raised in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-7\">. In March 2003, Castillo-Lagos was convicted of illegal re-entry after a previous deportation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b94-11\">. The Supreme Court's recent decision in <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005), is not implicated here. Castillo-Lagos did not dispute his prior conviction. Accordingly, the district court did not resolve disputed facts, but based its sentence on admitted facts. <em>Id. </em>at 1263.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b95-6\">. We note that the district court correctly calculated Castillo-Lagos\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178-79 (11th Cir.2005) (stating after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \"[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate correctly the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). We do not mean to imply by our holding that on remand the district court must first impose a lesser sentence. Rather, on remand the district court is required to sentence Castillo-Lagos according to <em>Booker, </em>considering the properly calculated Guidelines range and \"other statutory concerns as well, <em>see </em>[18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b95-12\">.
