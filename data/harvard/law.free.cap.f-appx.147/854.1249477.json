Nunes appeals his 165-month sentence for assaulting three federal officers, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 111(a) and (b). The district court enhanced his sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(C), based on his status as a career offender. On appeal, Nunes argues that the district court erred in sentencing him under the then-mandatory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After review, we vacate Nunes\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b875-19\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b875-20\">In a written plea agreement, Nunes pled guilty to three counts of assaulting a federal officer. During his plea colloquy, Nunes stated that the three officers grabbed him, that he injured the officers during an ensuing melee, but that he was justified in doing so. Nonetheless, Nunes pled guilty \u201cbecause I want to get this over with. I need to move on with my life.... I made a mistake, because it takes two to tango, because I was involved. I want to accept what I have to accept and get on down the road.\u201d After finding a sufficient factual basis to support Nunes\u2019s plea and that his plea was freely and voluntarily given, the district court accepted it and adjudicated Nunes guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b875-21\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b875-22\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), set Nunes\u2019s offense level at 32 based on a determination that Nunes qualified as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The PSI reduced Nunes\u2019s base offense level by three levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. As a career offender <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b)(G), Nunes\u2019s criminal history category was automatically VI. Even absent his career offender status, however, Nunes\u2019s criminal history category would have been VI based on his 14 criminal history points. With a criminal history category of VI and an offense level of 29, Nunes\u2019s Guidelines range was 151-188 months imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-4\">Nunes objected to the PSI and again at sentencing, arguing that <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), rendered the Guidelines unconstitutional, and that they thus could not be applied to him. The district court overruled Nunes\u2019s objections and sentenced him to 165 months\u2019 imprisonment, the middle of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b876-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AvN\">A. Career Offender Status</p>\n<p id=\"b876-6\">For the first time on appeal, Nunes argues that his October 27,1998 conviction for unlawful restraint was not a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as defined in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a), and thus, that he does not qualify as a career offender. Because Nunes did not raise the issue of his career-offender status in the district court, we review the argument for plain error. <em>United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1186 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-7\">A defendant qualifies as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under the Guidelines if \u201c(1) the defendant was at least eighteen years old at the time the defendant committed the instant offense of conviction; (2) the instant offense of conviction is a felony that is either a <em>crime of violence </em>or a controlled substance offense; and (3) the defendant has at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b876-13\">The Guidelines define \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as: \u201cany offense under federal or state law, punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year, that (1) has as an element, the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (2) ... otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 dBl^a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b876-14\">Thus, \u201cunder U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, there are two approaches for classifying an offense as a crime of violence. The first approach is to determine whether the use, attempted use or threatened use of physical force against another is an element of\u2019 the crime. <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1196 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cAlternatively, under the second approach, we must determine whether [the crime] involves conduct that, by its nature, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b876-15\">In this case, the attempted use or threatened use of physical force is not an element of Nunes\u2019s prior crime of unlawful restraint. In Illinois, the defendant commits the offense of unlawful restraint when he \u201cknowingly without legal authority detains another.\u201d 720 ILCS 5/10-3. The Illinois courts have stated that \u201c[a]etual or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>physical force is not a necessary element of unlawful restraint as long as an individual\u2019s freedom of locomotion is impaired.\u201d <em>People v. Bowen, </em>241 Ill.App.3d 608, 182 Ill.Dec. 43, 609 N.E.2d 346, 361 (Ill.App.Ct.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">However, under the second approach, the crime of unlawful restraint is one that \u201cby its nature, presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d <em>Searcy, </em>418 F.3d at 1196. As the Seventh Circuit recently stated in analyzing whether unlawful restraint was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, \u201c[a] risk of violent confrontation is inherent in a crime ... that involves restraining another person against her will.\u201d <em>United States v. Swanson, 55 </em>Fed.Appx. 761, 762 (7th Cir.2002). Further, other circuits have concluded that the similar crimes of false imprisonment and kidnapping by deception that do not have physical force as an element nonetheless present a serious risk of physical injury, and thus are \u201ccrimes of violence.\u201d <em>See United States v. Zamora, </em>222 F.3d 756, 764-65 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>110 F.3d 50, 52-53 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kaplansky, </em>42 F.3d 320, 324 (6th Cir.1994) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-6\">Thus, the district court did not err, and certainly did not plainly err, in determining that Nunes\u2019s conviction for unlawful restraint constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">B. <em>Booker</em></p>\n<p id=\"b877-8\">Nunes also points out that the district court applied the <em>pre-Booker </em>mandatory Guidelines scheme, and argues that his case should be remanded for resentencing. Because Nunes timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-10\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not violate Nunes\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. First, the district court\u2019s determination that Nunes\u2019s unlawful restraint crime was sufficient to support the \u00a7 4B1.1 career offender enhancement was a question of law. <em>Searcy, </em>418 F.3d at 1195. Second, this Court repeatedly has concluded that an enhancement based on prior convictions does not constitute a Sixth Amendment violation under <em>Booker. See, e.g., United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b877-11\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Nunes under a mandatory Guidelines regime. Thus, we must determine whether the statutory error in Nunes\u2019s sentencing is harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and punctuation omitted). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless and the standard \u201cis not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">We conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden as to Nunes\u2019s sentence. There is no evidence in the record indicating what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">Accordingly, we vacate Nunes\u2019s sentence and remand his ease to the district court for resentencing. We note that the district court correctly calculated Nunes\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Nunes under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b878-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-8\">. The first application note to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2 more specifically defines \"crime of violence\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b876-11\">\"Crime of violence\u201d includes murder, manslaughter, kidnapping, aggravated assault, forcible sex offenses, robbery, arson, extortion, extortionate extension of credit, and burglary of a dwelling. Other offenses are included as \"crimes of violence\u201d if (A) that offense has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another, or (B) the conduct set forth (t.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted ... presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6q\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, cmt. n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b878-6\">. We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
