After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">In this case, there is no dispute that Slater has faded, in fact, to exhaust his state-court remedies. Normally, this failure would automatically prohibit a federal court from granting habeas relief. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). However, an exception to this general rule applies when either \u201cthere is an absence of available State corrective process[ ] or circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7\u00a7 2254(b)(l)(B)(i) \u2014 (ii). Because Slater argues that his case fits the above exception, we must outline his state-court proceedings and examine whether the exception applies.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-10\">In 2001, Slater was convicted in state court for: (1) intent to distribute marijuana; and (2) driving with a suspended/revoked driver\u2019s license. He was sentenced to eight years\u2019 probation. In 2002, Slater was convicted in state court for cocaine trafficking within 1,000 feet of school property. On May 22, 2003, Slater\u2019s probationary sentence was revoked based on his conviction for cocaine trafficking.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-13\">Slater filed both a state direct appeal and a state habeas petition challenging his probation revocation. As of the date of the district court\u2019s dismissal of Slater\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition, Slater\u2019s direct appeal had been pending for 16 months. However, for reasons unexplained in the record, it allegedly took the state 14 months to appoint Slater appellate counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Although we have some question as to why it would take 14 months to appoint counsel, the state courts are now moving forward with Slater\u2019s direct appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Given that the state courts are now moving forward with Slater\u2019s direct appeal, we cannot say that \u201cthere is an absence of available State corrective process[ ] or circumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2254(b)(l)(B)(i)\u2014 (ii). However, we caution against such long delays in the appointment of counsel. <em>See Dixon v. Florida, </em>388 F.2d 424, 425 (5th Cir.1968) (stating that \u201ca state of exhaustion can be reached by the lapse of time and at some point in time exhaustion need not be further exhausted\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">For all of the above reasons, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed without prejudice Slater\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition for failure to exhaust state-court remedies. Once Slater has exhausted his state-court remedies (or an exception ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"961\">*961</page-number>plies), he may timely refile his \u00a7 2254 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b980-11\">. Slater\u2019s state habeas petition has been stayed because, under Georgia state law, a prisoner\u2019s state habeas petition ordinarily must be stayed during the pendency of the direct appeal process. <em>See generally </em>O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-14-42; <em>Collins v. State, </em>277 Ga. 586, 591 S.E.2d 820, 821 (2004). Thus, we focus on Slater\u2019s direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
