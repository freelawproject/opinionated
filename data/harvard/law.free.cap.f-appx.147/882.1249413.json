On appeal, Hernandez argues that the district court: (1) clearly erred in failing to provide a minor role reduction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b); and (2) committed statutory <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) error. We now AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-17\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b903-18\">According to the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d), a U.S. Coast Guard team boarded a fishing vessel, the \u201cEl Almirante,\u201d on 7 March 2004, and seized 133 bales of cocaine, weighing 2,629 kilograms. The El Almirante had a four-man crew and one captain. Hernandez was one of the four crew members aboard the ship. The El Almirante had obtained the cocaine at sea from another fishing vessel, the \u201cSiete Mares.\u201d The Coast Guard later intercepted the Siete Mares, which had six crewmen and a captain, and found traces of cocaine aboard that vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-19\">In a two-count indictment, a grand jury charged Hernandez and other defendants with: (1) possession with the \u2018intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2, and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), (Count 1); and (2) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7 1903(a), (g), (j), and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(l)(B)(ii), (Count 2). The district court accepted Hernandez\u2019s guilty plea as to Counts 1 and 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b903-20\">The probation officer determined that Hernandez\u2019s base offense level was 38, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l), because the offense involved more than 150 kilograms of cocaine, which was then reduced three levels for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), (b). With a total offense level of 35 and a criminal history category of I, Hernandez\u2019s guideline sentence range was 168 to 210 months. Hernandez objected to the officer\u2019s failure to provide a two-level reduction for having a minor role in the offense, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b904-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>Hernandez also moved for an order declaring the Guidelines to be unconstitutional following <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). At the 9 August 2004 sentencing hearing, the district court denied the motion and found the Guidelines to be constitutional based on our precedent at that time. However, the court agreed to continue sentencing for the parties to determine whether Hernandez should be given a safety-valve reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-4\">At the continued sentencing hearing, Hernandez objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to include a minor role reduction because his role in the overall conspiracy was minor compared with others as (1) he was merely a crew member on the fishing vessel, and (2) he had no equity interest in the cocaine. The government contended that there was nothing to distinguish Hernandez from any of the 11 other defendants involved in the case and the drug quantity involved counseled against a minor role. The court overruled the objection and found that the evidence suggested that Hernandez\u2019s role was the same as other crew members\u2019, making him equally culpable. Hernandez renewed his argument that the Guidelines were unconstitutional, which the court denied. The district court then sentenced Hernandez to 135 months of imprisonment and three years of supervised release for Counts 1 and 2 to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b904-6\">A. <em>Minor-Role Reduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b904-7\">Hernandez argues that as a mere crewman, he was entitled to a minor role reduction because (1) he did not own, sell, or distribute drugs, and (2) his role was small in comparison with the drug activity targeted by Operation Panama Express. As an initial matter, we have held that <em>Booker </em>did not alter our review of a district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). Because a district court must consult the Guidelines during sentencing, the court must \u201ccalculate the Guidelines range accurately.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179. We review a district court\u2019s decision regarding a defendant\u2019s role in an offense for clear error. <em>United States v. Rodriguez De Varon, </em>175 F.3d 930, 937 (11th Cir.1999) <em>(en </em>banc). The defendant bears the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he is entitled to a role reduction. <em>See id. </em>at 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-9\">A two-level minor role reduction, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b), is warranted if the defendant is less culpable than most other participants. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2, comment. (n.5). For a sentencing court to determine whether to grant a minor-role reduction, it considers two principles. <em>De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 940. First, the court must measure the defendant\u2019s role against the relevant conduct for which the defendant is being held accountable. <em>Id. </em>Drug quantity is \u201ca material consideration in assessing a defendant\u2019s role\u201d in the relevant conduct, and we have \u201cnot foreclose[d] the possibility that amount of drugs may be dispositive \u2014 in and of itself \u2014 in the extreme case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 943. We have noted that \u201c[o]nly if the defendant can establish that [ ]he played a relatively minor role in the conduct for which [ ]he has already been held accountable\u2014 not a minor role in any larger criminal conspiracy \u2014 should the district court grant\u201d a minor-role reduction. <em>Id. </em>at 944.</p>\n<p id=\"b904-10\">The second prong of the minor-role reduction analysis permits a district court, \u201cwhere the record evidence is sufficient ... [, to] measure the defendant\u2019s conduct against that of other participants in the criminal scheme attributed to the defendant.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 934. \u201cThe district court must determine that the defendant was less culpable than <em>most other participants </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>in her relevant conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 944. However, the court only can consider participants who are (1) \u201cidentifiable or discernable from the evidence,\u201d and (2) \u201cinvolved in the relevant conduct attributed to the defendant,\u201d which precludes \u201c[t]he conduct of participants in any larger criminal conspiracy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In the drug courier context, relevant considerations in granting a minor-role reduction include the quantity of drugs being carried, the fair market value of drugs, the amount of money paid to the courier, the courier\u2019s equity interest in the drugs, and the courier\u2019s role in planning and distributing the drugs. <em>Id. </em>at 945.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-5\">We conclude that the district court did not clearly err in denying Hernandez a minor-role reduction. First, there was a large amount of cocaine involved, and we have not eliminated this as a relevant factor for whether a district court may consider the reduction. <em>See De Varon, </em>175 F.3d at 943. Second, Hernandez\u2019s role was not appreciably different from any other crew member. Thus, the district court\u2019s denial of a minor-role reduction was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">B. <em>Booker Statutory Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b905-7\">Next, Hernandez argues that it was <em>Booker </em>error for the district court to sentence him under a mandatory Guidelines system. Because Hernandez objected to the use of the Guidelines in sentencing him, we review his sentence <em>de novo. See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). We will reverse the district court only if the error was harmful. <em>See United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam). The government has the burden of showing that non-constitutional error was harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1292.</p>\n<p id=\"b905-8\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where \u201cunder a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, - L.Ed.2d- (2005). However, it is not error to \u201cuse [] extra-verdict enhancements in a non-mandatory guidelines system.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1300. Thus, there are two types of errors in sentencing: (1) the constitutional error of using \u201cextra-verdict enhancements to reach a guidelines result that is binding on the sentencing judge\u201d; and (2) the error of applying the Guidelines in a mandatory fashion. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1331 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-12\">\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the [sentence], or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the [sentence] was not substantially swayed by the error, the [sentence] is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). In the context of non-constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, we have found a district court\u2019s sentence under the mandatory Guidelines system to be harmless error when the district court: (1) stated that it would impose the same sentence even if the Guidelines were advisory, <em>Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d at 1292; and (2) sentenced the defendant to the highest sentence in the Guideline range and considered sentencing the defendant to the statutory maximum, <em>see United States v. Gallegos-Aguero, </em>409 F.3d 1274, 1277 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-13\">We conclude that the district court\u2019s mandatory application of the Guidelines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>was not harmless. As the government concedes, the district court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error by applying the Guidelines as mandatory, and there is no evidence that the district court would have imposed the same sentence had it known the Guidelines were advisory. Accordingly, we vacate Hernandez\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">Hernandez appeals his 135-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine and conspiracy to possess and distribute cocaine. As we have explained, the court did not err when it denied Hernandez\u2019s request for a minor-role reduction of his sentence, but the district court did commit reversible error when it applied the Guidelines as mandatory. Accordingly, we AFFIRM in part and VACATE and REMAND in part for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
