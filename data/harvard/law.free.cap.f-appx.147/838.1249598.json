Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We previously dismissed Defendant Gregory Wade Hembree\u2019s appeal. <em>See United States v. Hembree, </em>125 Fed.Appx. 981 (11th Cir.2004). The Supreme Court vacated the judgment and remanded the case to us following its decision in <em>Booker. See United States v. Hembree, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2904, 162 L.Ed.2d 291 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-20\">A jury convicted appellant Gregory Wade Hembree of one count of conspiracy to possess cocaine with the intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(l)(B)(ii). The same jury also convicted Hembree of one count of perjury, and Hembree later pled guilty to a charge of failing to appear. The district court then consolidated Hembree\u2019s cases for sentencing. Hembree made two claims of error with regard to the manner in which the district court determined his final sentence. Hembree argued that the court failed to properly credit him for acceptance of responsibility in the failure to appear case, and that it misapplied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.6, resulting in his obstructive conduct being counted twice. Hembree objected on both grounds at the time of sentencing, and the district court overruled them.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-21\">Hembree\u2019s presentence report combined the sentencing for the conspiracy and perjury conviction along with the sentencing for the failure to appear conviction under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(c) for the purpose of determining the offense level. Because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"840\">*840</page-number>jury held the Defendant responsible for over 500 grams of cocaine, but less than two kilograms, Hembree\u2019s base offense level totaled 26 pursuant to \u00a7 2D1.1. An additional two points were added to the offense level for obstruction of justice when Hembree testified falsely at his own trial. An offense level of 28 and criminal history category of I scored the Defendant\u2019s guideline range between 78 and 97 months. The presentence report also detailed that any sentence for Hembree\u2019s failure to appear was to run consecutively pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">At Hembree\u2019s sentencing hearing, the court sustained the two-point addition for obstruction of justice, but granted a two-level reduction under the safety valve provision, returning the Defendant\u2019s offense level to 26. Thereafter, the court departed upward two levels to account for Hembree\u2019s additional obstructive actions. This departure resulted in a total offense level of 28. Hembree argued for another two-point reduction for his acceptance of responsibility in his failure to appear case, based upon his voluntary surrender to authorities. The court rejected Hembree\u2019s argument, but commented that it would take Hembree\u2019s contrition into account in some other fashion when imposing sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">The district court originally sentenced Hembree to 80 months for the drug conspiracy to run concurrently with 60 months for perjury. The court tacked on another 12-month term for the failure to appear charge. The total sentence amounted to 92 months, which the court explained was within the guideline range while simultaneously acknowledging Hembree\u2019s acceptance of responsibility with respect to the failure to appear case.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">After the court imposed the sentence, the Defendant continued to argue for a further reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court responded by reducing the drug conspiracy sentence to 78 months, as the 12 month sentence was already the minimum in the failure to appear case. Hembree\u2019s final sentence was then 90 months; 78 months for the conspiracy and perjury charges and 12 months for failure to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-11\">We affirmed both Hembree\u2019s conviction and sentence. After we issued our opinion, Hembree sought a writ of certiorari to the United States Supreme Court based upon its recent decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b860-12\">In his initial brief, Hembree did not assert error in his sentence based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or its progeny. Only later, after briefing had ended, did Hembree seek to file a supplemental brief based upon <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), in order to argue that the district court violated his Fifth Amendment rights by increasing his offense level based on facts not charged in the indictment. We denied that request.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-13\">This Court recently addressed a similar case which had been remanded in light of <em>Booker. See United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005). In <em>Dockery, </em>we observed that the appellant in that case did not raise a constitutional challenge or an argument based on <em>Apprendi </em>or <em>Apprendi </em>principles. <em>See Dockery </em>at 1262. We further noted how we handled cases which were remanded with instructions to reconsider in light of <em>Apprendi:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b860-14\">Nothing in the <em>Apprendi </em>opinion requires or suggests that we are obligated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>to consider an issue not raised in any of the briefs that appellant has filed with us. Nor is there anything in the Supreme Court\u2019s remand order, which is cast in the usual language, requiring that we treat the case as though the <em>Apprendi </em>issue had been timely raised in this Court. In the absence of any requirement to the contrary in either <em>Apprendi </em>or in the order remanding this case to us, we apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs are deemed abandoned.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b861-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 1262-63 (quoting <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Because he made no arguments in his initial brief raising <em>Booker /Apprendi </em>issues, Hembree has abandoned those issues. Accordingly, we reinstate our previous opinion in this case and affirm, once again, the Defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>pursuant to the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">OPINION REINSTATED. CONVICTIONS AND SENTENCES AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. Prior to <em>Booker, </em>this Court has held that claims not raised on appeal, including <em>Blakely </em>claims, are deemed waived. <em>United States v. Hembree, </em>381 F.3d 1109, 1110 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Curtis, </em>380 F.3d 1308, 1310-11 (11th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Levy, </em>379 F.3d 1241, 1242-44 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b861-7\">. We note that Hembree did not accept responsibility for each of his crimes. The district court pointed to three instances of obstruction of justice: Hembree\u2019s false testimony at his co-conspirator's trial, his false testimony at his own trial (including at least 22 distinct episodes of testifying falsely), and his failure to appear for sentencing. Hembree only accepted responsibility for failing to appear at sentencing. He made no attempt to accept blame for committing perjury. Although the district court declined to give Hembree the \u00a7 3E1.1 reduction, it did consider Hembree's acceptance when it imposed the ultimate sentence of 90 months. The 90 months reflected a minimal sentence of 12 months for failing to appear, and 78 months, reduced from the original 80 months on the perjury and conspiracy counts. Therefore, Hembree has failed to show that the district court clearly erred in refusing to give him a downward adjustment under \u00a7 3E1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"AV0\">Furthermore, while we agreed that Hembree correctly found error with the district court\u2019s calculation method for the failure to appear conviction, such error was harmless. The district court should have <em>first </em>selected a total punishment within the guideline range of 78 to 97 months, and, <em>second, </em>divided that total punishment to satisfy the consecutive sentence requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146(b)(2). Instead, the district court calculated the offense levels independently for each offense, finding that it could not depart from either a 78-month sentence for conspiracy or a 12-month sentence for failing to appear. The resulting 90-month sentence was well within the guideline range and in accordance with the consecutive sentence requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3146 and the \"total punishment\" requirement of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
