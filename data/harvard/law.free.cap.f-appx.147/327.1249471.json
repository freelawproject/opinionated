Adams was convicted of possession of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). At sentencing, the district court determined by a preponderance of the evidence that Adams possessed the firearm in connection with another felony offense and applied enhancements based on facts not established by the jury\u2019s verdict. Adams was sentenced to the statutory maximum of 120 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">On appeal, Adams does not challenge his conviction but contends the district court committed Sixth Amendment error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), at sentencing \u201cby increasing the guideline range under a mandatory Guidelines system based upon facts not found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt at trial.\u201d Because Adams did not object to his sentence in the district court based on <em>Blakely </em>or <em>Booker, </em>we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540, 547 (4th Cir.2005). While we affirm Adams\u2019s conviction, we vacate his sentence because it was greater than that authorized by the facts established by the jury\u2019s verdict, and we remand the case for resentencing in accordance with Booker.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">Although the sentencing guidelines are no longer mandatory, <em>Booker </em>makes clear that a sentencing court must still \u201cconsult [the] Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\u201d 125 S.Ct. at 767. On remand, the district court should first determine the appropriate sentencing range under the guidelines, making all factual findings appropriate for that determination. <em>See Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. The court should consider this sentencing range along with the other factors described in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000) and then impose a sentence. <em>Id. </em>If that sentence falls outside the guidelines range, the court should explain its reasons for the departure as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(2) (2000). <em>Id. </em>The sentence must be \u201cwithin the statutorily prescribed range and ... reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-12\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-13\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Adams\u2019s sentencing. <em>See generally Johnson </em>v. <em>United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (stating an error is \u201cplain\u201d if \"the law at the time of trial was settled and clearly contrary to the law at the time of appeal\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
