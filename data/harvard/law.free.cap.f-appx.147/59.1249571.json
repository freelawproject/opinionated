Baxley, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment for her employer, Pediatric Services of America, Inc., (\u201cPediatric Services\u201d), in her employment discrimination claim. Baxley alleges that Pediatric Services violated her rights under the Family Medical Leave Act, (\u201cFMLA\u201d), and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, (\u201cERISA\u201d) in terminating her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-22\">A. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b79-23\">Baxley worked at a Pediatric Services\u2019 health-care facility in Marietta, Georgia as a nursing assistant. In January 2003, Baxley was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis and cirrhosis of the liver. Throughout that year, Baxley underwent medical treatment for her condition and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>informed her employer that a liver transplant would eventually be necessary. On August 13, 2003, Baxley broke her hand and requested a light duty assignment. Baxley\u2019s supervisor insisted that she take sick leave and provided her with information on Pediatric Services\u2019 FMLA policy and available paid leave. On August 22, 2003, Pediatric Services terminated Baxley\u2019s employment asserting that she had abandoned her job. Baxley contends that her termination did not result from abandonment, but instead, because Pediatric Services knew that Baxley eventually would need to take medical leave for a serious health condition, the costs of which Pediatric Services did not desire to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">On October 14, 2003, Baxley filed a petition for relief under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Baxley was represented by counsel in her bankruptcy action. Schedule B of Baxley\u2019s bankruptcy petition required her to disclose all contingent and unliquidated claims. However, she disclosed no such claims. On February 4, 2004, the bankruptcy court discharged Baxley of her debts and closed her estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">B. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standards used by the district court. <em>Killinger v. Samford Univ., </em>113 F.3d 196, 198 (11th Cir.1997). Summary judgment is appropriate when \u201cthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact.\u201d <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). In examining the record, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1085 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">C. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">Before we can reach the merits of Baxley\u2019s employment claims, we must determine whether Baxley has standing to bring these claims. We find that Baxley is without standing to pursue the instant claims because her employment claims are property of her Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate. The cause of action underlying Baxley\u2019s employment claims arose on the date of her termination, August 22, 2003. Baxley filed her Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition on October 14, 2003, almost two months later. At this time, Baxley\u2019s employment claims became property of the bankruptcy estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">\u201cGenerally speaking, a pre-petition cause of action is the property of the Chapter 7 bankruptcy estate, and only the trustee in bankruptcy has standing to pursue it.\u201d <em>Parker v. Wendy\u2019s International, Inc., </em>365 F.3d 1268, 1272 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(citing Barger v. City of Cartersville, </em>348 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2003)). \u201cOnce an asset becomes part of the bankruptcy estate, all rights held by the debtor in the asset are extinguished unless the asset is abandoned back to the debtor pursuant to \u00a7 554 of the Bankruptcy code.\u201d <em>Id. (citing </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 554).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-12\">In this case, Baxley\u2019s discrimination claim became an asset of the bankruptcy estate when she filed her bankruptcy petition. Regardless <em>of </em>Baxley\u2019s intentions or reasons for failing to disclose her employment claims on the bankruptcy schedules, Baxley\u2019s non-disclosed employment claims remain property of the estate. Additionally, there is no evidence that the trustee, the real party in interest in Baxley\u2019s discrimination suit, ever abandoned this claim. Thus, Baxley has no standing to bring the instant employment claims. <em>Parker, </em>365 F.3d at 1272.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-13\">We accordingly affirm the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>for Pediatric Services.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ah\">AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b81-16\">. Because Baxley has no standing to bring her employment claims against Pediatric Services, we need not reach the issue of judicial estoppel as raised in the parties\u2019 briefs and addressed by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
