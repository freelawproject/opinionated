Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After consideration, we reinstate our previous opinion and affirm Gray\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"A2u\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b984-26\">After a jury trial, Gray was convicted of two counts of attempting to import cocaine into the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 952(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-27\">On direct appeal to this Court, Gray challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting her criminal convictions. We affirmed Gray\u2019s convictions. <em>United States v. Gray, </em>No. 04-11076, at 3, 123 Fed.Appx. 387 (11th Cir. Oct. 13, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-28\">Gray did not raise any challenge to her sentence in her initial brief on direct appeal, much less any error based on <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), or any other case extending <em>Apprendi. </em>Instead, for the first time in her reply brief, Gray <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>challenged the constitutionality of her sentence under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). The government moved to strike the <em>Blakely </em>argument in the reply brief, and we granted the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Gray filed a petition for <em>certiorari </em>in the United States Supreme Court. On February 28, 2005, the Supreme Court granted <em>certiorari, </em>vacated our October 13, 2004 judgment, and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Booker. Gray v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1429, 161 L.Ed.2d 184 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">As discussed above, Gray did not challenge her sentence or raise any <em>Apprendi/Blakely/Booker </em>issues in her initial brief to this Court. Although she did attempt to raise a <em>Blakely </em>issue in her reply brief on direct appeal, we granted the government\u2019s motion to strike that argument. Under our circuit\u2019s precedent, Gray\u2019s failure to raise the issue in her initial brief on direct appeal bars her from doing so now. <em>See United States v. Levy, </em>416 F.3d 1273, 1279-80 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that <em>\u201cBooker </em>itself recognized that retroactivity is subject to ordinary prudential rules, and thus nothing in <em>Booker </em>undermines or affects our prudential rules; if anything, <em>Booker </em>contemplates that they should be applied in Booker-remand cases\u201d); <em>United States v. Vanorden, </em>414 F.3d 1321, 1323 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cBecause Vanorden did not challenge his sentence on Sixth <em>Amendment-Apprendi-Blakely-Booker </em>grounds in his first trip through this circuit, this argument is \u2018deemed abandoned.\u2019\u201d); <em>United States v. Pipkins, </em>412 F.3d 1251, 1253 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe well-established law in our circuit requires that issues be raised in the parties\u2019 initial brief.\u201d); <em>United States v. Sears, </em>411 F.3d 1240, 1241 (11th Cir.2005) (stating in a Booker-remand case that \u201c[t]he Appellant\u2019s failure to raise the <em>[Booker </em>] issue in his initial brief bars him from doing so now\u201d); <em>United States v. Dockery, </em>401 F.3d 1261, 1262-63 (11th Cir.2005) (declining to consider on remand <em>Booker </em>issue not raised in appellant\u2019s initial brief); <em>United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, 990 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>533 U.S. 962, 121 S.Ct. 2621, 150 L.Ed.2d 774 (2001) (stating after a remand from the Supreme Court that \u201cwe apply our well-established rule that issues and contentions not timely raised in the briefs [prior to Supreme Court remand] are deemed abandoned\u201d and declining to consider any <em>Apprendi </em>error after remand).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">Thus, after our reconsideration in light of <em>Booker, </em>we reinstate our October 13, 2004 opinion and affirm Gray\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-11\">OPINION REINSTATED; SENTENCE AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b985-12\">TJOFLAT, Circuit Judge, specially</author>\n<p id=\"A9P\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b985-13\">The court declines to consider appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits because appellant failed to present the claim in his initial brief on appeal. Binding precedent requires us to disregard the claim for that reason. <em>See United States v. Ardley, </em>242 F.3d 989, <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>273 F.3d 991 (11th Cir.2001), and its progeny. I therefore concur in the court\u2019s judgment. Were we writing on a clean slate, I would, for the reasons I have previously expressed, entertain appellant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim on the merits. <em>See United States v. Higdon, </em>418 F.3d 1136, 1142 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
