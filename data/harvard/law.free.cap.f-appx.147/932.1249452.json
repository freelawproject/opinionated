Bailey alleged that the actions of the City and Budding Demolition Coordinator Michael Kraujalis, in his individual capacity, (codectively, \u201cAppellees\u201d) violated Badey\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment due process rights as secured by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. The district court granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment after denying Badey\u2019s motion to file a third amended complaint. Based on our review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">I. Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">On May 31, 2002, the City issued a Notice of Condemnation and Order to Demolish a detached garage at Badey\u2019s residence. Badey timely requested an appeal hearing, which was conducted by Hearing Officer David J. Sockol on July 10, 2002. The hearing was resumed on January 8, 2003 and continued on February 12, 2003 as a result of the City\u2019s intervening Notice of Condemnation and Order to Demolish Badey\u2019s residence, attached garages and metal fence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">During the hearings, the City presented testimony and evidence from four witnesses: Budding Demolition Coordinator Michael Kraujalis, Registered Professional Engineer Rita Oglesby, City Budding Official Mdton Massanet, and Codes Compliance Assistance Department Director Sally Eichler. Badey, who represented himself during the July 10 hearing but was represented by counsel during subsequent hearings, testified and presented evidence in his own behalf, including the testimony of a licensed engineer.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-15\">Prior to the final hearing, Badey was given the option of entering into a stipulation agreement with the City to rehabilitate his residence to avoid demolition. In conjunction with this offer, Badey received a list of the City\u2019s requirements and conditions for entering into a stipulation agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">On November 20, 2003, Hearing Officer Sockol issued his Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Final Order Conditionally Approving Demolition. Sockol upheld City findings that Badey\u2019s residence was unfit and/or unsafe. He further noted that Badey had faded to provide the City with certain documentation necessary to enter into a valid stipulation agreement. Sockol thus conditionady approved the demolition order, subject to Badey having forty-five days to either enter a valid stipulation agreement with the City or have the residence demolished by a private contractor under proper budding permits. Finady, Sockol\u2019s order advised that \u201c[a]ny party aggrieved by this decision has thirty (30) days from the date of this order in which to seek judicial review in the Circuit Court of the Sixth Judicial Circuit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b953-17\">Bailey\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal with the Sixth Judicial Circuit on December 19, 2003. Because the notice of appeal sought procedurady improper redef, the court dismissed it without prejudice on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"934\">*934</page-number>December 30, 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bailey was given thirty days to file a valid petition for a writ of certiorari. At the time of this appeal, he had yet to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Bailey filed the present action on February 17, 2004. He argued that the City violated his due process rights, and he asked the district court to enjoin demolition of his house and award him attorney\u2019s fees and monetary damages. After filing two amended complaints, Bailey was denied leave to file a third. The district court then granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to Bailey\u2019s second amended complaint. On appeal, Bailey argues that the district court erred in granting Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment and in denying him leave to file a third amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"Ao5K\">This court reviews a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Nolen v. Boca Raton Cmty. Hosp., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1151, 1154 (11th Cir.2004). A district court\u2019s decision to grant or deny leave to amend is generally reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>Burger King Corp. v. C.R. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.1999). However, to the extent the denial of leave to amend is based on futility, we review the trial court\u2019s decision <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">A. <em>Substantive Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Bailey first argues that the City\u2019s condemnation of his residence violated his substantive due process rights. As the district court correctly noted, the substantive component of the Due Process Clause protects only \u201cfundamental\u201d rights. <em>McKinney v. Pate, </em>20 F.3d 1550, 1556 (11th Cir.1994) (citing <em>Palko v. Connecticut, </em>302 U.S. 319, 325, 58 S.Ct. 149, 152, 82 L.Ed. 288 (1937)). Fundamental rights \u201care protected against certain government actions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them.\u201d <em>McKinney, </em>20 F.3d at 1556 (internal quotation omitted). In contrast, \u201careas in which substantive rights are created only by state law ... are not subject to substantive due process protection ... because substantive due process rights are created only by the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation omitted). Such state law-based rights can be rescinded \u201cso long as the elements of procedural \u2014 not substantive \u2014 due process are observed.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b954-12\">Property interests like those that Bailey enjoys in his residence are created and defined by state law rather than the Constitution. <em>Greenbriar Village, L.L.C. v. Mountain Brook City, </em>345 F.3d 1258, 1262 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>Board of Regents v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 2709, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). They are not fundamental rights, and thus they are not entitled to substantive due process protection.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See id. </em>at 1262-63 (\u201c[N]on-legislative deprivations of state-created rights, which would include land-use rights, cannot support a substantive due process claim.); <em>see also Regents of Univ. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"935\">*935</page-number><em>of Mich. v. Ewing, </em>474 U.S. 214, 229, 106 S.Ct. 507, 515, 88 L.Ed.2d 523 (1985) (Powell, J., concurring) (\u201cWhile property interests are protected by procedural due process even though the interest is derived from state law rather than the Constitution ... substantive due process rights are created only by the Constitution\u201d). The district court correctly held that Appellees were entitled to summary judgment on Bailey\u2019s substantive due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">B. <em>Procedural Due Process</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">Bailey next argues that the City\u2019s condemnation of his residence violated his procedural due process rights. \u201cProcedural due process requires notice and an opportunity to be heard before any governmental deprivation of a property interest.\u201d <em>Zipperer v. City of Fort Myers, </em>41 F.3d 619, 623 (11th Cir.1995) (citations omitted). In order to determine whether a procedural due process violation occurred in this case, we must determine (1) whether Bailey had a constitutionally protected property interest; (2) whether he was deprived of that interest; and (3) whether the City failed to use constitutionally sufficient procedures in effecting the deprivation. <em>Id. </em>The first two questions can easily be answered in the affirmative; Bailey\u2019s property interest in his residence is constitutionally protected, and the City seeks to deprive him of that interest. Our analysis thus focuses on the third prong of the procedural due process inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">The Supreme Court has often noted that due process is a flexible concept that varies depending on the facts of a particular case. <em>See, e.g., Zinermon v. Burch, </em>494 U.S. 113, 127, 110 S.Ct. 975, 984, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990). However, it is widely accepted that due process requirements are satisfied in the evietion/condemnation context when the occupant receives adequate notice and a hearing. <em>See, e.g., Grayden v. Rhodes, </em>345 F.3d 1225, 1236 (11th Cir.2003) (\u201cAs a general rule, an eviction must be preceded by notice and an opportunity to be heard.\u201d); <em>Thomas v. Cohen, </em>304 F.3d 563, 576 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201cDue process generally requires notice and a hearing prior to eviction.\u201d). In this case, the City provided Bailey with two notices of condemnation. Bailey received these notices and filed timely appeals, and Hearing Officer Sockol conducted three separate hearings over the course of several months. Bailey was represented by counsel during two of those hearings, and he was allowed to present evidence and testify on his own behalf. Bailey was also notified of his right to appeal Healing Officer\u2019s Sockol\u2019s decision after it was issued, a right which he declined to exercise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Given these facts, we have no difficulty concluding that the City\u2019s procedures were sufficient to constitute due process. The district court correctly granted Appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment on this claim as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">C. <em>Leave to Amend</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">Bailey\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred in denying him leave to file a third amended complaint. While the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>district court\u2019s opinion does not discuss the decision to deny Bailey leave to file a third amended complaint, our review of the transcript indicates that the denial was likely based on the court\u2019s conclusion that further amendments would be futile. We thus review the court\u2019s denial of Bailey\u2019s request <em>de novo, </em>bearing in mind that such requests should be liberally granted when necessary in the interest of justice. <em>Burger King, </em>169 F.3d at 1315, 1319.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">Having reviewed the record, we cannot conclude that the district court erred in denying Bailey\u2019s request to file a third amended complaint. The purposes of Bailey\u2019s requested amendment were to add an additional city official as a party and to make allegations regarding the City\u2019s alleged efforts to prevent Bailey from entering into a stipulation agreement. None of these accusations have any bearing on the question of whether the City violated Bailey\u2019s constitutional due process rights to notice and a hearing. Because Bailey suffered no constitutional deprivation, no amendment to his complaint could have enabled him to avoid summary judgment. Thus, the district court correctly concluded that allowing Bailey to file another amended complaint would be futile.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">Because it correctly concluded that Bailey has not suffered the deprivation of any constitutional right, the district court properly granted the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment and denied Bailey\u2019s request to file a third amended complaint. Its opinion is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b953-12\">. This intervening notice was sent to Bailey via certified and first class mail on August 8, 2002. In response to the notice, Bailey timely requested an additional appeal hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b954-9\">. The court noted that the proper procedure for seeking relief from a final decision rendered by the City was by filing a petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b954-10\">. In an effort to establish his entitlement to substantive due process protection in this case, Bailey argues on appeal that he has a constitutionally created, and thus, fundamental, liberty or privacy interest \u201cin having a homestead to live in.\u201d Bailey cites, and this court's research has produced, no federal appellate cases supporting this argument, which we find to be wholly without merit. <em>Accord Lindsey v. Normet, </em>405 U.S. 56, 73, 92 S.Ct. 862, 874, 31 L.Ed.2d 36 (1972) (holding that there is no constitutional guarantee of housing).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\">. In addition to providing notice, three hearings, and notice of the right to appeal, the City also provided Bailey with the opportunity to enter into a stipulation agreement to rehabilitate the residence and avoid demolition. In fact, most of Bailey\u2019s arguments on appeal focus on the conditions that the City attached to the stipulation agreement. We agree with the district court that Bailey\u2019s displeasure with these conditions, of which he was aware prior to Hearing Officer Sockol\u2019s final judgment, do not indicate a lack of due process. We further agree with the district court that Bailey's proper avenue for raising his concerns with the terms of the stipulation agreement was to appeal within the state court system rather than to file the present federal action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
