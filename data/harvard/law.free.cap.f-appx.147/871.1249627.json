We are convinced that the court got it right; there is nothing to send to a jury in this case. As the district court\u2019s order explains, appellant failed to establish a prima facie case of racial discrimination. What is more, he failed to demonstrate that appellee\u2019s reason for terminating his employment was a pretext for discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
