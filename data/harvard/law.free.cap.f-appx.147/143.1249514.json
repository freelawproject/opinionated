In the district court, Buitr\u00f3n objected, based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), to the drug quantity calculation used in sentencing him. On appeal, Buitr\u00f3n raises issues pursuant to <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. \u2014, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). After <em>de novo </em>review, we vacate Buitron\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AzQ\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b164-19\">Buitr\u00f3n entered into a written plea agreement in which he pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute 32 pounds of marijuana. Attached to the plea agreement was a factual resume in which Buitr\u00f3n admitted that on April 9, 2004, he knowingly possessed with intent to distribute 32 pounds of marijuana during a reverse-sting transaction. Thirty-two pounds of marijuana equals 14.5 kilograms.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-20\">Buitr\u00f3n also admitted that he previously had purchased marijuana from co-defendant Gilberto Ledesma. For the purposes of Buitron\u2019s plea, the government and Bui<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>tron did not reach an agreement regarding the exact amount of marijuana involved in the previous transactions with Ledesma.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">B. PSI and Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">The Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cPSI\u201d) recommended a base offense level of 18, based on a drug quantity of 28.12 kilograms of marijuana, which equals 61.99 pounds. This amount included the 32 pounds (or 14.9 kilograms) admitted to in the plea agreement. The additional 29.99 pounds of marijuana above what Buitr\u00f3n admitted to in his plea agreement was based on the previous transactions where Buitr\u00f3n purchased marijuana from co-defendant Ledesma. The PSI also recommended a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. With a total offense level of 15 and a criminal history category of II, Buitron\u2019s Guidelines range was 21-27 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">Buitr\u00f3n objected to the PSI, arguing that his co-defendant Ledesma had made conflicting statements to investigators regarding the amount of marijuana that Ledesma had sold to Buitr\u00f3n, and that therefore, the information obtained from Ledesma could not be used in determining Buitron\u2019s relevant conduct. Buitr\u00f3n also asserted that the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt the amount of marijuana purchased from Ledesma, pursuant to <em>Blakely.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">During the sentencing hearing, Buitr\u00f3n renewed his objection to the drug-quantity calculation, arguing that, even under \u201cthe <em>pre-Blakely </em>standard,\u201d Ledesma\u2019s statements were not \u201creliable hearsay.\u201d Buitr\u00f3n maintained that, at most, he should be held accountable for 40 pounds of marijuana, based on the 30 pounds he possessed at the time of his arrest and 10 additional pounds that \u201cwould come in through his testimony.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-14\">The government then called Baldwin County Sheriff Deputy Paul Johnson to testify regarding drug quantity. Johnson testified that after Ledesma agreed to cooperate with the government, Ledesma arranged the reverse-sting operation, involving approximately 32 pounds of marijuana, which resulted in Buitron\u2019s arrest. Deputy Johnson also testified that during an interview, Ledesma stated that he had sold 38 pounds of marijuana to Buitr\u00f3n during three prior transactions in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-15\">Buitr\u00f3n testified that he did not purchase any marijuana from Ledesma in 2003. Instead, he claimed that he sold Ledesma a truck in 2003 in exchange for 10 pounds of marijuana, which he never received.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Buitr\u00f3n also admitted that he received 10 pounds of marijuana from Ledesma in 2002. Further, on cross-examination, Buitr\u00f3n admitted that he purchased 10 pounds of marijuana from Ledesma in 2001. Thus, in total, Buitr\u00f3n admitted to purchasing 52 pounds, or 23.5872 kilograms, of marijuana from Ledesma \u2014 that is 32 pounds from the reverse-sting operation, 10 pounds in 2002, and 10 pounds in 2001.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-16\">The district court determined that Buitron\u2019s base offense level was 18, which corresponds to a drug quantity between 20 and 40 kilograms of marijuana. The district court then adopted the PSI\u2019s Guidelines calculations. Buitron\u2019s attorney asked that the district court sentence Buitr\u00f3n to probation. The government asked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>that the defendant be sentenced at the low end of the Guidelines range. The district court adopted the government\u2019s recommendation and sentenced Buitr\u00f3n to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was the low end of the Guidelines range. In doing so, the district court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">Whether <em>Blakely </em>applies in this case or not, we don\u2019t know yet. Perhaps it does. If it does, there may be some later adjustment for those figures. I don\u2019t know. But based on the standards that I have to apply at this time, I find that Mr. Buitr\u00f3n possessed with intent to distribute in excess of 44 pounds, or 20 grams (sic), placing him in a range of \u2014 a Base Offense Level of 18.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">The district court then stated that Buitron\u2019s attorney \u201cha[d] made a strong plea for something less than what [this Court is] obligated under the law to give [Buitr\u00f3n].\u201d The district court further stated that \u201c[f]or the reasons I\u2019ve already set forth, though, that plea is not convincing.\u201d Further, the district court also concluded that based on the findings it had made, \u201cthe punishment in this case [ ] demands that [Buitr\u00f3n] be incarcerated and that the low end of that incarceration is 21 months.\u201d Thus, while the record indicates that the district court clearly rejected probation in favor of incarceration, there is some indication the district court may have considered a different amount of incarceration if <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">On appeal, Buitr\u00f3n argues that the district court violated his Sixth Amendment rights by sentencing him based upon a drug quantity that he did not admit and by sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Because Buitr\u00f3n timely raised a <em>Blakely </em>objection in the district court, we review his <em>Blakely, </em>now <em>Booker, </em>claim <em>de novo. United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). \u201cUnder <em>Booker, </em>there are two kinds of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 688 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1298 (emphasis omitted). The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-13\">In this case, we conclude that the district court did not violate Buitron\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights. In the factual resume attached to his plea agreement, Buitr\u00f3n admitted that he possessed 32 pounds of marijuana in relation to the reverse-sting operation. Further, he admitted during the sentencing hearing that he purchased an additional 10 pounds of marijuana from Ledesma in 2001 and another 10 pounds of marijuana in 2002. Thus, Buitr\u00f3n admitted to a drug quantity of 52 pounds of marijuana, which equals 23.5872 kilograms. The district court set Buitron\u2019s base offense level at 18, which corresponds to a drug quantity of 20 to 40 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-14\">Although there is no Sixth Amendment violation in this case, the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>court committed statutory <em>Booker </em>error in sentencing Buitr\u00f3n under a mandatory Guidelines regime. Thus, we must determine whether the statutory error in Buitron\u2019s sentencing is harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1292 (11th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks, brackets, ellipses, and citation omitted). The burden is on the government to show that the error was harmless and the standard \u201cis not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">We conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden as to Buitron\u2019s sentence. As noted earlier, the district court indicated that if <em>Blakely </em>applied, the district court may later need to adjust the sentencing figures. We do know that the district court would have rejected probation and imposed some incarceration. However, as to the length of incarceration, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1271 (11th Cir.2005). If anything, the record indicates that the district court may have considered a different sentence. We do not mean to suggest by our holding that the district court must impose any particular sentence on remand. Rather, we merely hold that the government did not meet its burden of showing that the <em>Booker </em>statutory error was harmless on the current record before this Court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">Accordingly, we vacate Buitron\u2019s sentence and remand his case to the district court for resentencing. We note that the district court correctly calculated Buitron\u2019s Guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Thus, on remand, the district court is required to sentence Buitr\u00f3n under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 21-27 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b165-9\">. Forty pounds equals 18.144 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\">. Buitr\u00f3n contended that 10 of the 32 pounds of marijuana from the reverse-sting operation were to compensate him for the earlier deal involving the truck.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A8A\">. Fifty-two pounds equals 23.5872 kilograms of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. We also do not attempt to decide now whether a particular sentence might be reasonable in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b167-8\">. We reject Buitron\u2019s claim that notice of relevant conduct in an indictment is required. Nothing in <em>Booker </em>requires that relevant conduct under an advisory Guidelines regime be included in the indictment. In any event, Buitr\u00f3n had notice that his 2001 conduct could be considered. The factual resume attached to the plea agreement stated that for purposes of relevant conduct, the parties did not reach an agreement regarding the amount of marijuana involved in Buitron\u2019s prior transactions with Ledesma. Thus, Buitr\u00f3n did have notice that the government would seek to attribute drug amounts to him beyond the drug amount stipulated to in relation to the reverse-sting operation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
