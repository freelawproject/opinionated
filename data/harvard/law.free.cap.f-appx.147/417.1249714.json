He argues for the first time on appeal that he is entitled to resentencing because he was sentenced under the mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime held unconstitutional in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We review this argument for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Martinez-Lugo, </em>411 F.3d 597, 600 (5th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 464, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005) (No. 05-6242).</p>\n<p id=\"b438-13\">Our review of the record does not reveal that the district court\u2019s error affected the outcome of the sentencing proceedings. <em>See United States v. Valenzuela-Quevedo, </em>407 F.3d 728, 732-33 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 126 S.Ct. 267, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005). Because Santos has failed to establish that the error affected his substantial rights, he cannot meet the plain error standard of review. <em>See id. </em>Given that Santos is not entitled to resentencing, we pretermit discussion of the validity of his appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-20\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b438-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
