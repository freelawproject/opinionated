We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">Hunter pleaded guilty to three counts of trafficking in cocaine, heroin and marijuana. He was assessed a base offense level of thirteen and a criminal history category of IV, resulting in a Guideline range of 33 to 41 months. At sentencing, the district court found that Hunter\u2019s \u201ccriminal history category does not adequately reflect the seriousness of his past criminal conduct of the likelihood that he will commit other crimes.\u201d The court then reviewed Hunter\u2019s numerous past drug-related convictions and prior arrest and concluded that a sentence of 87 months\u2019 imprisonment was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Hunter appealed his sentence on grounds that there was no valid basis for the district court\u2019s upward departure, and that the degree of the departure was excessive. We held that the district court erred in relying on Hunter\u2019s prior arrest record, but found this error to be harmless in light of the court\u2019s further reliance on the similarity of Hunter\u2019s prior convictions to the present offense, his failure to satisfy parole requirements, and the lack of a deterrent effect of prior lesser punishments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Supreme Court vacated and remanded<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for further consideration in light of <em>United States v. </em>Booker,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We requested supplemental letter briefs.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">On remand, Hunter argues that his sentence is illegal under <em>Booker </em>in three ways. First, he claims that the district court calculated his base offense level using marijuana quantities that were neither charged in the indictment nor admitted as part of his guilty plea. Second, he contends that the district court erred by departing upward on the basis of judicial fact-findings regarding the nature of his prior convictions. Third, he urges that the district court erred by treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\"><em>Booker </em>provides that when a judge increases a defendant\u2019s sentencing range under a mandatory Guidelines regime based on facts not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant, the resulting sentence violates the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because Hunter did not object to his sentence on Sixth Amendment grounds before the district court, our review is for plain error only.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u2018We find plain error when: (1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018If all three conditions are met an appellate court may then exercise its discretion to notice a forfeited error but only if (4) the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public rep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>utation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">With respect to Hunter\u2019s first argument, we find that the district court committed plain error when it enhanced his Guidelines range based on facts not admitted by him or found by a jury.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> However, Hunter has failed to show \u201cwith a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, that if the judge had sentenced him under an advisory sentencing regime rather than a mandatory one, he would have received a lesser sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Here, the judge found that even with the enhancement, Hunter\u2019s Guidelines range failed to reflect the seriousness of his prior criminal record and the likelihood that he would recidivate. Further, the court explicitly found that a sentence of 87 months\u2019 imprisonment was \u201cappropriate.\u201d There is nothing in the record to indicate that the court would have arrived at a lesser sentence had it started from a lower \u201cpoint of departure.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">Hunter\u2019s second point of error is likewise unavailing. Although the court sentenced Hunter under a mandatory Guidelines regime, it exercised its discretion in crafting a sentence that it believed would be appropriate in light of the specific nature of Hunter\u2019s past record. There is nothing in the record to suggest that the court would have given a lesser sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Lastly, to the extent that Hunter\u2019s third point of error implies that sentencing under a mandatory Guidelines regime constitutes structural error, or that <em>Booker </em>error should be presumed prejudicial, these arguments have been foreclosed by our precedent.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-16\">Based on the foregoing, we REINSTATE our prior opinion affirming the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
