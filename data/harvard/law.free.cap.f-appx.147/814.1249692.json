More specifically, Plaintiffs contend that the Defendant is hable for the injuries Johnson sustained in a construction accident because Koehring\u2019s crane was designed for use with a non-load-bearing safety latch.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-23\">We agree with the district court that Plaintiffs have not presented any genuine issue of material fact as to whether Defendant\u2019s crane had any defect that rendered it unreasonably dangerous. Having reviewed the record, we agree that no reasonable jury could find any design defect based on the fact that the spring latch was not load-bearing. Plaintiffs strict liability claim against Defendant was therefore properly dismissed. <em>See Norton v. Snapper Power Equip., </em>806 F.2d 1545, 1548 (11th Cir.1987). Because failure to prove any design defect is also fatal to a products liability negligence claim, we further agree with the district court that Plaintiffs\u2019 negligence claim also should be dismissed. <em>See Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am. v. Am. Avia</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"815\">*815</page-number><em>tion, Inc., </em>344 F.3d 1136, 1146 (11th Cir.2003); <em>Marzullo v.
