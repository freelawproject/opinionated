Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). In immigration cases, we review legal conclusions made below de novo, but will uphold the administrative factual findings if they are supported by substantial evidence. <em>Farquharson v. United States Attorney Gen., </em>246 F.3d 1317, 1320 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-18\">The Fifth Amendment protects individuals against compulsory self-incrimination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> U.S. Const. Amend. V. In order to protect these Fifth Amendment rights, the Supreme Court has established a \u201cprophylactic rule\u201d requiring that those subject to custodial interrogation must be informed, <em>inter alia, </em>of their right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 1624\u201426, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). In criminal cases, inculpatory statements obtained during custodial interrogations in which <em>Miranda </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>warnings are not given are subject to suppression. <em>See United States v. Muegge, 225 </em>F.3d 1267, 1269\u201470 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">However, in <em>INS v. Lopez-Mendoza, </em>468 U.S. 1032, 104 S.Ct. 3479, 3489, 82 L.Ed.2d 778 (1984), the Supreme Court held the evidence resulting from an illegal but peaceful arrest may be introduced in deportation cases. While <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>dealt with government conduct that violated the Fourth Amendment, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion suggested its rationale applies to any evidence that would be subject to the exclusionary rule in a criminal case. <em>See id. </em>at 3489 (stating \u201cthe ... balance between costs and benefits comes out against applying the exclusionary rule in civil deportation hearings held by the INS\u201d). In addition, <em>Lopez-Mendoza </em>suggested, but did not expressly hold, that \u201cegregious violations of Fourth Amendment or other liberties that might transgress notions of fundamental fairness and undermine the probative value of the evidence obtained\u201d might warrant the use of the exclusionary rule in immigration proceedings. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The BIA has indicated the exclusionary rule may apply in immigration cases in some circumstances. <em>Matter of Barcenas, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 609, 611 (1988). However, \u201c[o]ne who raises the claim questioning the legality of the evidence must come forward with proof establishing a prima facie case before the Service will be called on to assume the burden of justifying the manner in which it obtained the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under BIA precedent, evidence is admissible if it is probative and its admission would be fundamentally fair. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that Rampasard\u2019s proffer should be credited, it did not assert facts constituting an \u201cegregious\u201d violation of the Fifth Amendment. At most, Rampasard\u2019s proffer would establish he was locked in a room with five government employees and interrogated. Rampasard has not claimed he was physically threatened, interrogated for an unusually long time, or denied any ordinary comfort during his interrogation. In fact, Rampasard\u2019s proffer did not even expressly claim that the interrogating officers failed to read him his <em>Miranda </em>warnings. Thus, even assuming <em>arguendo </em>an \u201cegregious\u201d violation of the Fifth Amendment would warrant suppression in an immigration case, there was no evidence in the record such a violation occurred. Accordingly, the IJ did not err by denying Rampasard\u2019s suppression motion, concluding he had represented himself as a U.S. citizen in order to obtain a passport, and ordering his removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-12\">. Rampasard has not claimed either to this Court or the BIA that, if his confession was admissible, there was insufficient evidence to remove him. Accordingly, Rampasard has waived any challenge to his removal other than the suppression issue. <em>See Mohammed v. Ashcroft, </em>261 F.3d 1244, 1248 n. 3 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-20\">. Contrary to the representations of the parties and the IJ, the right against compulsory self-incrimination is secured by the Fifth Amendment, not the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
