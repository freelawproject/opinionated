Kales v. United States, 115 F.2d 497 (6th Cir. 1940); Lucas v. Fidelity &amp; Columbia <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>Trust Co., 89 F.2d 945 (6th Cir. 1937); Belknap v. United States, 55 F.Supp. 90 (D.C.W.D.Ky.1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The Commissioner raised no question about the form of the refund claim when it was filed with him and considered it on its merits. It is too late for him now to raise technical objections as to its form. 10 Merten\u2019s Law of Federal Income Taxation \u00a7 58.19, at page 51.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
