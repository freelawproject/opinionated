G. Smith, doing business as Ta\u2019Ron, Inc., advertised a fragrance called \u201cSecond Chance\u201d as a duplicate of appellees\u2019 \u201cChanel No. 5,\u201d at a fraction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>of the latter\u2019s price.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellees were granted a preliminary injunction prohibiting any reference to Chanel No. 5 in the promotion or sale of appellants\u2019 product.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The action rests upon a single advertisement published in \u201cSpecialty Salesmen,\u201d a trade journal directed to wholesale purchasers. The advertisement offered \u201cThe Ta\u2019Ron Line of Perfumes\u201d for sale. It gave the seller\u2019s address as \u201cTa\u2019Ron Inc., 26 Harbor Cove, Mill Valley, Calif.\u201d It stated that the Ta\u2019Ron perfumes \u201cduplicate 100% perfect the exact scent of the world's finest and most expensive perfumes and colognes at prices that will zoom sales to volumes you have never before experienced!\u201d It repeated the claim of exact duplication in a variety of forms.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The advertisement suggested that a \u201cBlindfold Test\u201d be used \u201con skeptical prospects,\u201d challenging them to detect any difference between a well known fragrance and the Ta\u2019Ron \u201cduplicate.\u201d One suggested challenge was, \u201cWe dare you to try to detect any difference between Chanel #5 (25.00) and Ta\u2019Ron\u2019s 2nd Chance. $7.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">In an order blank printed as part of the advertisement each Ta\u2019Ron fragrance was listed with the name of the well known fragrance which it purportedly duplicated immediately beneath. Below \u201cSecond Chance\u201d appeared \u201c* (Chanel #5).\u201d The asterisk referred to a statement at the bottom of the form reading \u201cRegistered Trade Name of Original Fragrance House.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">Appellees conceded below and concede here that appellants \u201chave the right to copy, if they can, the unpatented formula of appellees\u2019 products.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Moreover, for the purposes of these proceedings, appellees assume that \u201cthe products manufactured and advertised by [appellants] are <em>in fact </em>equivalents of those products manufaqtured by appellees.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Finally, appellees disclaim any contention that the packaging or labeling of appellants\u2019 \u201cSecond Chance\u201d is misleading or confusing.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The principal question presented on this record is whether one who has copied an unpatented product sold under a trademark may use the trademark in his advertising to identify the product he has copied. We hold that he may, and that such advertising may not be enjoined under either the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1125(a) (1964), or the common law of unfair competition, so long as it does not contain misrepresentations or create a reasonable likelihood that purchasers will be confused as to the source, identity, or sponsorship of the advertiser\u2019s product.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">This conclusion is supported by direct holdings in Saxlehner v. Wagner, 216 U.S. 375, 30 S.Ct. 298, 54 L.Ed. 525 (1910); Viavi Co. v. Vimedia Co., 245 F. 289 (8th Cir. 1917), and Societe Comptoir de L'Industrie Cotonniere Etablissements Boussac v. Alexander\u2019s Dept. Stores, Inc., 299 F.2d 33, 1 A.L.R.3d 752 (2d Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">In <em>Saxlehner </em>the copied product was a \u201cbitter water\u201d drawn from certain privately owned natural springs. The plaintiff sold the natural water under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>the name \u201cHunyadi Janos,\u201d a valid trademark.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The defendant was enjoined from using plaintiff\u2019s trademark to designate defendant\u2019s \u201cartificial\u201d water, but was permitted to use it to identify plaintiff\u2019s natural water as the product which defendant was copying.</p>\n<p id=\"AT0P\">Justice Holmes wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AJC\">We see no reason for disturbing the finding of the courts below that there was no unfair competition and no fraud. The real intent of the plaintiff\u2019s bill, it seems to us, is to extend the monopoly of such trademark or tradename as she may have to a monopoly of her type of bitter water, by preventing manufacturers from telling the public in a way that will be understood, what they are copying and trying to sell. But the plaintiff has no patent for the water, and the defendants have a right to reproduce it as nearly as they can. <em>They have a right to tell the public what they are doing, and to get whatever share they can in the popularity of the water by advertising that they are trying to make the same article, and think that they succeed. If they do not convey, but, on the contrary, exclude, the notion that they are selling the plaintiff\u2019s goods, it is a strong proposition that when the article has a well-known name they have not the right to explain by that name what they imitate. </em>By doing so, they are not trying to get the good will of the name, but the good will of the goods. 216 U.S. at 380-381, 30 S.Ct. at 298, 299 (citations omitted) (emphasis added.)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-10\">In Viavi Co. v. Vimedia Co., plaintiff sold unpatented proprietary medicinal preparations under the registered trademark \u201cViavi,\u201d and local sellers of defendant's medicinal preparations represented to prospective purchasers that Vimedia products \u201cwere the same or as good as Viavi\u201d preparations. The court held, \u201c[i]n the absence of such a monopoly as a patent confers, any persons may reproduce the articles, if they can, and may sell them under the representation that they are the same article, if they exclude the notion that they are the plaintiff\u2019s goods.\u201d 245 F. at 292.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-11\">* In Societe Comptoir de L\u2019Industrie Cotonniere Etablissements Boussac v. Alexander\u2019s Dept. Stores, Inc., the defendant used plaintiff\u2019s registered trademarks \u201cDior\u201d and \u201cChristian Dior\u201d in defendant\u2019s advertising in identifying plaintiff's dresses as the original creations from which defendant\u2019s dresses were copied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The district court refused to grant a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-12\">The appellate court considered plaintiff\u2019s rights under both the Lanham Act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>and common law.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Noting that the representation that defendant\u2019s dresses were copies of \u201cDior\u201d originals was apparently truthful and that there was no evidence of deception or confusion as to the origin or sponsorship of defendant\u2019s garments (299 F.2d at 35), the court disposed of the claim of right under the Lanham Act as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-4\">In any proceeding under the Lanham Act the gist of the proceeding is a \u201cfalse description or representation,\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1125(a), or a use of the mark which \u201cis likely to cause confusion or mistake or to deceive purchasers as to the source of origin of such goods or services,\u201d 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1114 (1). * * * Registration bestows upon the owner of the mark the limited right to protect his good will from possible harm by those uses of another as may engender a belief in the mind of the public that the product identified by the infringing mark is made or sponsored by the owner of the mark. * * * <em>The Lanham, Act does not prohibit a commercial rival\u2019s truthfully denominating his goods a copy of a design in the public domain, though he uses the name of the designer to do so. Indeed it is difficult to see any other means that might be employed to inform the consuming public of the true origin of the design. </em>299 F.2d at 36 (citations omitted) (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">The court also rejected the claim of right under common law principles of unfair competition, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Common law unfair competition must be grounded in either deception or appropriation of the exclusive property of the plaintiff. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-10\">In the case at bar it is conceded that the \u201cpirating\u201d of the design is lawful and proper. * * * The only property \u25a0 right alleged to have been invaded is the good will embodied in the trademark. But the right of the complainant in his mark is limited to dilution which is brought about by confusion as to source or affiliation. 299 F.2d at 36 (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-11\">The court weighed the underlying interests in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">Involved in the instant case is a conflict of values which necessarily arises in an economy characterized by competition and private property. The courts have come to recognize the true nature of the considerations often involved in efforts to extend protection of common law trade names so as to create a shield against competition. * * * The interest of the consumer here in competitive prices of garments using Dior designs without deception as to origin, is at least as great as the interest of plaintiffs in monopolizing the same. 299 F.2d at 37 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-13\">We have found no holdings by federal or California appellate courts contrary to the rule of these three cases. Moreover, the principle for which they stand \u2014that use of another\u2019s trademark to identify the trademark owner\u2019s product in comparative advertising is not prohibited by either statutory or common law, absent misrepresentation regarding the products or confusion as to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>source or sponsorship \u2014 is also generally approved by secondary authorities.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">The rule rests upon the traditionally accepted premise that the only legally relevant function of a trademark is to impart information as to the source or sponsorship of the product.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Appellees argue that protection should also be extended to the trademark\u2019s commercially more important function of embodying consumer good will created through extensive, skillful, and costly advertising. The courts, however, have generally confined legal protection to the trademark\u2019s source identification function for reasons grounded in the public policy favoring a free, competitive economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">Preservation of the trademark as a means of identifying the trademark owner\u2019s products, implemented both by the Lanham Act and the common law, serves an important public purpose.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> It makes effective competition possible in a complex, impersonal marketplace by providing a means through which the consumer can identify products which please him and reward the producer with continued patronage. Without some such method of product identification, informed consumer choice, and hence meaningful competition in quality, could not exist.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b620-12\">On the other hand, it has been suggested that protection of trademark values other than source identification would create serious anti-competitive consequences with little compensating public benefit. This is said to be true for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-13\">The object of much modern advertising is \u201cto impregnate the atmosphere of the market with the drawing power of a congenial symbol.\u201d Mishawaka Rubber &amp; Woolen Mfg. Co. v. S. S. Kresge Co., 316 U.S. 203, 205, 62 S.Ct. 1022, 1024, 86 L.Ed. 1381 (1942),<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> rather than to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>communicate information as to quality or price. The primary value of the modern trademark lies in the \u201cconditioned reflex developed in the buyer by imaginative or often purely monotonous selling of the mark itself.\u201d Derring, Trademarks on Noncompetitive Products, 36 Or.L.Rev. 1, 2 (1956). To the extent that advertising of this type succeeds, it is suggested, the trademark is endowed with sales appeal independent of the quality or price of the product to which it is attached; economically irrational elements are introduced into consumer choices; and the trademark owner is insulated from the normal pressures of price and quality competition. In consequence the competitive system fails to perform its function of allocating available resources efficiently.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">Moreover, the economically irrelevant appeal of highly publicized trademarks is thought to constitute a barrier to the entry of new competition into the market. \u201c[T]he presence of irrational consumer allegiances may constitute an effective barrier to entry. Consumer allegiances built over the years with intensive advertising, trademarks, trade names, copyrights and so forth extend substantial protection to firms already in the market. In some markets this barrier to entry may be insuperable.\u201d Papandreou, The Economic Effects of Trademarks, 44 Calif.L.Rev. 503, 508-09 (1956).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> High barriers to entry tend, in turn, to produce \u201chigh excess profits and monopolistic output restriction\u201d and \u201cprobably * * * high and possibly excessive costs of sales promotion.\u201d J. Bain, Barriers to New Competition 203 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">A related consideration is also pertinent to the present case. Since appellees\u2019 perfume was unpatented, appellants had a right to copy it, as appellees concede.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There was a strong public interest in their doing so, \u201c[f]or imitation is the life blood of competition. It is the unimpeded availability of substantially equivalent units that permits the normal operation of supply and demand to yield the fair price society must pay for a given commodity.\u201d American Safety Table Co. v. Schreiber, 269 F.2d 255, 272 (2d Cir. 1959).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> But this public benefit might be lost if appellants could not tell potential purchasers that appellants\u2019 product was the equivalent of appellees\u2019 product. \u201cA competitor\u2019s chief weapon is his ability to represent his product as being equivalent and cheaper * *.\" Alexander, Honesty and Competition, 39 So.Cal.L.Rev. 1, 4 (1966). The most effective way (and, where complex chemical compositions sold under trade names are involved, often the only practical way) in which this can be done is to identify the copied article by its trademark or trade name. To prohibit use of a competitor\u2019s trademark for the sole purpose of identifying the competitor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>product would bar effective communication of claims of equivalence.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Assuming the equivalence of \u201cSecond Chance\u201d and \u201cChanel No. 5,\u201d the public interest would not be served by a rule of law which would preclude sellers of \u201cSecond Chance\u201d from advising consumers of the equivalence and thus effectively deprive consumers of knowledge that an identical product was being offered at one third the price.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">As Justice Holmes wrote in Saxlehner v. Wagner, the practical effect of such a rule would be to extend the monopoly of the trademark to a monopoly of the product. The monopoly conferred by judicial protection of complete trademark exclusivity would not be preceded by examination and approval by a governmental body, as is the case with most other government-granted monopolies. Moreover, it would not be limited in time, but would be perpetual.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Against these considerations, two principal arguments are made for protection of trademark values other than source identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">The first of these, as stated in the findings of the district court, is that the creation of the other values inherent in the trademark require \u201cthe expenditure of great effort, skill and ability,\u201d and that the competitor should not be permitted \u201cto take a free ride\u201d on the trademark owner\u2019s \u201cwidespread goodwill and reputation.\u201d <footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A_c\">A large expenditure of money does not in itself create legally protect-able rights.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Appellees are not entitled to monopolize the public\u2019s desire for the unpatented product, even though they themselves created that desire at great effort and expense.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> As we have noted, the most effective way (and in some cases the only practical way) in which others may compete in satisfying the demand for the product is to produce it and tell the public they have done so, and if they could be barred from this effort appellees would have found a way to acquire a practical monopoly in the unpatented product to which they are not legally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-13\">Disapproval of the copyist\u2019s opportunism may be an understandable first reaction, \u201c[b]ut this initial response to the problem has been curbed in deference to the greater public good.\u201d American Safety Table Co. v. Schreiber, 269 F.2d at 272. By taking his \u201cfree ride,\u201d the copyist, albeit unintentionally, serves an important public interest by offering comparable goods at lower prices. On the other hand, the trademark owner, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>perhaps equally without design, sacrifices public to personal interests by seeking immunity from the rigors of competition.</p>\n<p id=\"Ay7I\">Moreover, appellees\u2019 reputation is not directly at stake. Appellants\u2019 advertisement makes it clear that the product they offer is their own. If it proves to be inferior, they, not appellees, will bear the burden of consumer disapproval. Cf. Prestonettes, Inc. v. Coty, 264 U.S. 359, 369, 44 S.Ct. 350, 68 L.Ed. 731 (1924) <footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">The second major argument for extended trademark protection is that even in the absence of confusion as to source, use of the trademark of another \u201ccreates a serious threat to the uniqueness and distinctiveness\u201d of the trademark, and \u201cif continued would create a risk of making a generic or descriptive term of the words\u201d of which the trademark is composed.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">The contention has little weight in the context of this case. Appellants do not use appellees\u2019 trademark as a generic term. They employ it only to describe appellees\u2019 product, not to identify their own. They do not label their product \u201cTa\u2019Ron\u2019s Chanel No. 5,\u201d as they might if appellees\u2019 trademark had come to be the common name for the product to which it is applied. Appellants' use does not challenge the distinctiveness of appellees\u2019 trademark, or appellees\u2019 exclusive right to employ that trademark to indicate source or sponsorship. For reasons already discussed, we think appellees are entitled to no more. The slight tendency to carry the mark into the common language which even this use may have is outweighed by the substantial value of such use in the maintenance of effective competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-13\">We are satisfied, therefore, that both authority and reason require a holding that in the absence of misrepresentation or confusion as to source or sponsorship a seller in promoting his own goods may use the trademark of another to identify the latter\u2019s goods. The district court\u2019s contrary conclusion cannot support the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">The district court also rested the injunction upon an alternate ground, stated in the following finding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b624-5\">Defendant's method of competition colorably, but fictitiously, invites comparison of the toilet preparations he sells with those of plaintiffs. In fact, it negates the opportunity for comparison by soliciting volume mail order purchases, at discount rates, without the dealer actually having the benefit of personal comparison. This method of marketing a competing product may place Ta\u2019Ron\u2019s \u201cduplicates\u201d in the hands of unscrupulous dealers and occasion further unfair practices and deception which creates a likelihood of confusion on the part of prospective customers as to whether such products are in fact \u201cidentical\u201d or \u201cduplicates\u201d and are derived from the same source and produced by the same methods.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AQWa\">The opening sentence of this finding misreads the advertisement. The persons to whom the advertisement is directed were purchasers for resale. The advertisement suggests use of the comparison test in reselling to \u201cskeptical\u201d consumers, and nothing prevents the consumers from comparing before purchasing if they wish to do so. The wholesale purchasers themselves are protected from deception by a promise of \u201cSatisfaction Guaranteed,\u201d entitling them to return the merchandise if the goods prove disappointing.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The second sentence of the finding apparently invokes the principle that \u201c[o]ne fraudulently markets his goods as those of another if, though making no misrepresentation himself, he intentionally induces his purchasers so to market them.\u201d Restatement of Torts \u00a7 713 (1938).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> As we have noted, appellees concede that neither the packaging nor labeling of appellants\u2019 product is misleading or confusing.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Conceivably, dealers may nonetheless tell their customers that the labels are false and that the contents are in fact appellees\u2019 product. But where, as here, the appellants have done all that could reasonably be expected to avoid confusion, the speculative possibility of deliberate fraud by third persons is not a sufficient basis for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-10\">There is a suggestion in this portion of the finding, and in appellees\u2019 brief, that appellants really claim only to have duplicated the scent of appellees\u2019 product as distinguished from its other characteristics, and that appellants\u2019 proposed method of distribution invites false representations that both the product and \u201cmethods\u201d of production have been precisely duplicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">The relevance of the reference to \u201cmethods\u201d of production in the court\u2019s finding is not clear. If all of the original product\u2019s characteristics are found in the copy, the method by which that result was achieved is of no significance to the purchaser. See Livermore, supra note 11, at 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">We would agree that if appellants really claim less than exact duplication of the qualities inherent in the product itself, it would have been appropriate to require some clarification of the language of their advertisement. But this narrow issue was not presented below, and the order entered could not be sustained if it had, for the injunction broadly prohibits any reference at all to appellees\u2019 trademark in the promotion or sale of appellants\u2019 product.
