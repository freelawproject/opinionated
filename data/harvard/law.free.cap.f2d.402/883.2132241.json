In the Matter of Ira Haupt &amp; Co., a Limited Partnership, Bankrupt, 234 F.Supp. 167 (S.D. N.Y.1964). Immediately before going into bankruptcy, Ira Haupt &amp; Co. (hereinafter \u201ccompany\u201d), with its main office in New York City, had 16 general partners, 13 limited partners, approximately 700 employees and branches throughout the country. 234 F.Supp. at 168. On November 20, 1963, as a result of financial shortages occasioned by its dealings with Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Refining Co., the company was suspended from further operation by the New York Stock Exchange. Five days later, after a determination that company\u2019s capital deficiency was approximately 20 million dollars, company\u2019s creditor banks and the Exchange advanced a proposal for the \u201corderly liquidation\u201d of company, which was accepted. Id. The district court which conducted proceedings on company\u2019s involuntary petition for bankruptcy found that, \u201cHaupt was hopelessly insolvent when it was suspended by the Exchange on November 20, 1963 and it has not engaged in the business for which it was organized since that time.\u201d Id. at 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Appellee, a member of the California bar, became counsel for the Beverly Hills, California, branch of \u201ccompany\u201d in the spring of 1963. On December 2 of that year, appellee terminated his relationship with company, and at the request of company\u2019s local manager, sent his bill in duplicate to company and to a man in New York identified as a \u201cliquidator.\u201d On December 11, 1963, appellee sent company\u2019s managing partner a time sheet for his work. On December 18, 1963, this officer, who had arranged for appellee to be hired by company, wrote appellee a note stating that his bill had been approved and that his check was being processed. Enclosed with this note was a letter to this official from New York counsel stating that \u201cthe amount should be paid to (appellee) by the Liquidator out of so-called \u2018Haupt Cash\u2019.\u201d (R.T. 83.) Appellee received full payment for his services, $7,503.95, on December 23, 1963.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">Contending that appellee had knowledge or reasonably should have known of company\u2019s insolvency at the time he received his fee, appellant filed a plenary suit in the United States District Court for the Central District of California to recover the payment as a preference made within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy enabling appellant to receive a greater percentage of his debt than some other creditors in the same class.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">After a separation of the issues, the matter went to trial on the question of appellant\u2019s knowledge of the insolvency of company and its general partners as of December 23, 1963, the parties stipulating for purposes of that suit only that company and all its general partners<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were insolvent on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">As its only findings of fact, the district court stated that defendant was without reasonable cause to believe company and all its general partners were insolvent on December 23, 1963, and held, as a resulting conclusion of law, that the $7,503.95 in attorney fees was not a preference that could be avoided by the trustee in bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-13\">Our jurisdiction over this appeal is established by 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-14\">It is appellant\u2019s position that the district court erred both because it refused to find that appellant had reasonable cause to believe that company was insolvent when he accepted his fee and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>cause it refused to make findings upon \"the specific facts which it found to be true.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">We conclude that appellant\u2019s contentions are not well taken; we affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">In order for a payment within four months of the filing of the petition in bankruptcy to be avoided as a preference, the trustee in bankruptcy must demonstrate that when it was accepted, the creditor had \u201creasonable cause to believe\u201d his debtor was insolvent. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Trial court consideration of whether or not a creditor had \u201creasonable cause\u201d to believe the payor to be insolvent has two parts. The court first examines what the payor knew about the payee\u2019s financial position then it applies the law to its conclusions. The first phase of this process is a finding of fact, and, \u201cunder General Order 47 this court must accept the finding thereon \u2018unless clearly erroneous'.\u201d Cedar-Comp Materials Co. v. Bumb, 344 F.2d 256, 258-259 (9th Cir. 1956). See Fed.R.Civ.P. 52; Hoppe v. Rittenhouse, 279 F.2d 3, 9 (9th Cir. 1960); Security-First Nat. Bank of Los Angeles v. Quittner, 176 F.2d 997, 999 (9th Cir. 1949). The standard which must be met by an appellant attempting to prove a lower court\u2019s finding of fact was \u201cclearly erroneous\u201d is a stringent one; to be convinced, this court must be \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d United States v. United States Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 542, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">An examination of the record does not leave us with that conclusion. Although appellee was local counsel for company, he did no work touching upon its financial stability. (R.T. 15-16.) Appellee testified that he had no knowledge of the incident which precipitated company\u2019s bankruptcy, the Allied Crude Vegetable Oil Company scandal, (R.T. 21-22, 29, 36), that he never saw a financial statement of the company and that he had no knowledge of the assets of most of company\u2019s 16 general partners. (R.T. 36, 37.) Appellee stated that his reaction to company\u2019s request that the bill be sent to a liquidator was that company was being liquidated to prove its solvency. (R.T. 40, 41.) A letter from company\u2019s managing partner to appellee dated November 20, 1963, was produced. It stated that company was \u201csolvent and is in an excellent financial position.\u201d (R.T. 23.) A second letter, dated December 5, 1963, was sent by company\u2019s New York counsel to a member of appellee\u2019s firm <footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in response to an inquiry on company\u2019s legal status made on behalf of another of the firm\u2019s clients, City National Bank of Beverly Hills, the bank where company conducted its local banking business. The letter stated, in part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-11\">\u201cThe firm of Ira Haupt is in the process of orderly liquidation; it is <em>not </em>conducting business as a broker-dealer in the usual sense, but it remains a business entity while it is closing out its affairs. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-12\">\u201cWe know of no restraining orders or injunctions relating to any of Ira Haupt\u2019s offices. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-13\">\u201cHaupt is closing out its checking accounts and is shortly writing to the City National Bank of Beverly Hills in that regard. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">After scrutinizing these facts, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s resolution of this evidence in appellee\u2019s favor was so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>incorrect as to be \u201cclearly erroneous,\u201d especially since a determination of the credibility of the appellee is so significant to the decision. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">We also find that the trial court\u2019s application of the law to its finding of fact was correct. Appellant contends that the lower court should 'have employed an alternative proposition, the principle that a creditor is charged with not only that knowledge he has actually acquired but also with all the facts a prudent businessman should have learned through a diligent inquiry If this were done, appellant argues that appellee would be found to have had \u201creasonable cause to believe.\u201d Appellant\u2019s statement of the principle is correct. Marks v. Goodyear Rubber Sundries, 238 F.2d 533, 534-535, 62 A.L.R.2d 770 (2d Cir. 1956); H. D. Lee Co. v. Bostian, 187 F.2d 942, 946-947 (8th Cir. 1951); Coder v. McPherson, 152 F. 951, 953 (8th Cir. 1907). We decline to apply it here since we cannot say as a matter of law that a man of \u201cordinary prudence\u201d with appellee\u2019s knowledge would have made further inquiry. While a debtor\u2019s assurance of solvency, such as the letter appellee received from the prestigious company officer who had arranged for him to be \u25a0hired, is not necessarily controlling, Employers Mutual Casualty Co. v. Hinshaw, 309 F.2d 806, 808-809 (8th Cir. 1962), it is sufficient to negate further inquiry when the creditor is without reason to suspect either the integrity, or the accuracy of the information of the informant. Id.-</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">Appellant\u2019s second assignment of error is that the trial court made no finding of fact relating to appellee\u2019s knowledge of company\u2019s insolvency on which to base its conclusion of law that the payment was not an avoidable preference. Appellant contends that the court must do more than announce as a \u201cfinding of fact\u201d that appellee had no reason to believe company insolvent; the court must list the reasons which led it to conclude that appellee had no reason to believe. For this proposition, appellant cites In re Hygrade Envelope Corp., 366 F.2d 584 (2d Cir. 1966). We read this case for the more limited proposition that a misstatement of the record by the trier of fact constitutes a clearly erroneous finding of fact. 366 F.2d at 589.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">We recognize the function of Rule 52(a) (Fed.R.Civ.P.) in requiring that a court sitting without a jury \u201cfind the facts specially\u201d as being \u201cto aid the appellate court by affording it a clear understanding of the ground or basis of the decision of the trial court.\u201d 2B Barron &amp; Holtzoff, Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1121 at 481 (Wright ed. 1961); see 5 Moore, Federal Practice \u00a7 52.01(1) at 2653 (1964). While a listing of the reasons prompting its finding would have aided in our evaluation of whether or not the trial court\u2019s holding was clearly erroneous, it is not necessary in order for us to understand \u201cthe ground or basis of the decision.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-9\">In addition, this court has stated that, \u201cthe ultimate test as to the adequacy of findings will always be whether they are sufficiently comprehensive and pertinent to the issues to provide a basis for decision and whether they are supported by the evidence.\u201d Carr v. Yokohama Specie Bank, Ltd., 200 F.2d 251, 255 (9th Cir. 1952). Accord, Zimmerman v. Montour R. R., 296 F.2d 97 (3d Cir. 1961), cert. denied, 369 U.S. 828, 82 S.Ct. 845, 7 L.Ed.2d 793 (1962). The district court\u2019s finding of fact is not insufficient by this standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">In any event, even if the findings were inadequate,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-11\">\u201cthe failure of the District Court to comply, with Rule 52(a) in respect of finding of fact does not demand reversal of the correct judgment of the District Court, if a full understanding of the issues could be reached without the aid of findings, even though such findings would have been helpful.\u201d Huard-Steinheiser, Inc. v. Henry, 280 F.2d 79, 84 (6th Cir. 1960).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">The issues of this case are not so complex as to preclude our understanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>them, absent specific factual findings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">The decision of the district court that the payment is not a voidable preference is</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">. It is well established that the assets of the general partners, as well as those of the partnership itself, must be insufficient to meet the partnership\u2019s obligations before the partnership can be considered insolvent. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 23. Tom v. Sampsell, 131 F.2d 779, 780 (9th Cir. 1942).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-8\">. Section. 60(b) of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 96(b) makes reference to knowledge of the creditor, \u201cor his agent acting with reference\u201d to the transaction resulting in an allegedly voidable preference, of the debtor\u2019s insolvency at the time of the payment. Knowledge of the debtor\u2019s insolvency obtained by the creditor\u2019s agent is attributed to the creditor regardless of whether or not he actually acquired it. Appellee is thus held to have known of any communication to a member of his firm regarding company\u2019s financial position. Mizell v. Phillips, 240 F.2d 738 (5th Cir. 1957). See 4 Remington on Bankruptcy \u00a7\u00a7 1711-1711.4 (6th ed. 1957).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
