Minimum sentences required by statute were imposed as to each defendant-appellant which are not under attack on this appeal. Additional sentences, in neither case of greater duration than the required minimum just referred to, were imposed under other counts, and it is the convictions under those counts which defendants-appellants here seek to have reviewed. Where a sentence under a count not challenged on appeal is not in excess of sentences imposed under other counts and provided to run concurrently with the former it -is unnecessary to consider the validity of such additional convictions on appeal.
