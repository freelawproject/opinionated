LEWIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"Ao\">This appeal is taken from a final order of the District Court for the Western <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>District of Oklahoma dismissing the plaintiffs-appellants\u2019 complaint and action for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">Plaintiffs are members of the Comanche Tribe of Indians residing in Oklahoma. According to their complaint, a tribal election was held on November 19, 1966, to determine whether the Comanche Tribe should have a constitution separate and apart from the Kiowa and Apache Tribes in Oklahoma. The election was conducted by the Area Director for the Bureau of Indian Affairs pursuant to 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and resulted in 493 Comanche Indians voting for a separate constitution and 483 voting against. Thereafter, plaintiffs filed a contest of the election with the Area Director alleging that a number of Comanche Indians were wrongfully deprived of their right to vote and that if such Indians had been allowed to vote that the outcome would have been affected. The Area Director denied plaintiffs\u2019 claim and appeals therefrom were in turn denied by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs and the Secretary of the Interior. Plaintiffs then sought an evidentiary hearing in the district court alleging jurisdiction to exist by \u201cvirtue of the provisions of the Constitution of the United States and laws and treaties enacted thereunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The district court properly dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction of both person and subject matter. The action stems from an internal controversy among Indians over tribal gov-</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">ernment, a subject not within the jurisdiction of the court as a federal question.

Nor is there any express statutory authority to exercise judicial control over the United States in a case of this nature. The principle that \u201cthe United States, as sovereign is immune from suit save as it consents to be sued,\u201d United States v.

Seaborg, 10 Cir., 370 F.2d 686, 691-692, is not affected by the fact that the government has voluntarily undertaken a trustee relationship with respect to the Indians, Harkins v. United States, 10 Cir., 375 F.2d 239. The required consent is not provided for by the terms of 25 U.S.C. \u00a7 476, supra, nor under the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 701 et seq.
