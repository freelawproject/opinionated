There was direct testimony that this money order was forged and was presented to the manager of the Greyhound Bus Station, on government property at Fort Eustis, Virginia, in payment for a requested bus ticket; that the defendant signed the money order in the presence of the manager ; that when asked for identification Bullock tendered a Virginia motor vehicle driver\u2019s license issued to one Sherman McDonald and it was shown by McDonald\u2019s testimony that the driver\u2019s license had been theretofore lost; that on the day immediately prior to the day in question an identical money order had been presented which had been returned to the bus company marked \u201cStolen\u201d; that the Military Police had been secretly called when the money order was presented and that Bullock, having been asked to stand aside from the ticket window, obviously became suspicious and undertook to hurriedly leave the premises without receiving his bus ticket, the driver\u2019s license, or the money order. He was then and there taken into custody by the Military Police. This evidence alone was sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">Bullock chose to testify in his own behalf and he explained that he had won the money order while participating in a game of chance and that the loser, McDonald, had supplied him with the driver\u2019s license for identification purposes. McDonald denied that he was the owner of the money order, denied knowing Bullock, denied that he participated with Bullock in a game of chance or that he had supplied Bullock with his driver\u2019s license. Obviously the jury disbelieved the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-10\">Counsel for the Government moved at the bar of the court for affirmance of the judgment below. Perceiving no error, the motion is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-11\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
