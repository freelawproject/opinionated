Because the principal questions involved on these appeals have been under consideration by the active judges of this Court sitting <em>in banc </em>we have deferred decision until after the filing of the opinions in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., Docket No. 30882, 401 F.2d 833, on August 13, 1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-15\">There are three separate actions before us now, Heit v. Weitzen, et al., and Volk v. Weitzen, et al., originally consolidated by the District Court, and Howard v. Grant, et al., consolidated on appeal by this Court with <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk. </em>The various complaints involve essentially the same operative facts as they all am based on the fact that Belock Instrument Corporation allegedly failed to disclose thnfr'a' S'ubstantiai amount of its income for the fiscal year 1964 was derived from various overcharges on government con_trac.ts.. - Thus, the consolidated amended complaint in <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk </em>alleges that Heit on June 18, 1965 purchased $5,000 principal face amount of Belock\u2019s 6% convertible subordinated debentures at a price of 90% of face amount in reliance on various \u201cmaterially false, misleading and untrue statements of Belock\u2019s net assets and past and prospective income,\u201d contained in Belock\u2019s Annual Report, and press releases, as well as documents filed' by the individual defendants with the: SEC and the American Stock Exchange, i Volk allegedly purchased 100 shares of Belock common stock on April 22, 1965 and another 100 shares on April 27, 1965 in reliance on these same false statements. Heit and Volk seek to represent both themselves and the entirejclass of persons who purchased either common stock or debentures between April 30, 1964 and June 21, 1965, and who have either sold or continue to hold these investments at a loss. It is further alleged that the dissemination by defendants of these false statements had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>effect of artificially inflating the market price of Belock\u2019s common stock and debentures and that defendants had knowledge or notice of the falsity of the statements. In addition to Belock Corporation, the individual defendants served in <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk </em>include Weitzen, Tyminski, Fischer, and Grant, all directors of Belock Corporation, and Levy who was a vice president of the corporation. &gt; In the <em>Howard </em>complaint it is alleged that plaintiff Helen Howard purchased a 6% convertible subordinated Belock Corporation debenture on June 16, 1965 at an artificially inflated price. The price inflation was allegedly caused by the circulation and dissemination by the defendants \u201cthrough press statements to the investment community * * * of statements as to the purported earnings and income of Belock Instrument and forecasts with respect thereto which in fact were gross overstatements.\u201d Howard seeks to represent the entire class composed of persons who purchased Belock stock or debentures in the open market and who were either misled by the published false material or by the artificially inflated market price. The defendants in <em>Howard </em>who were served include, in addition to Belock Corporation, Tyminski and Grant, Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades &amp; Co., who is Belock\u2019s controlling shareholder, and Lybrand, Ross Bros. &amp; Montgomery, Beloek\u2019s auditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">In <em>Howard, </em>Judge Cooper granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, primarily because the alleged fraud did not occur \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d as required by Rule 10b-5. Howard v. Levine, 262 F.Supp. 643 (S.D.N.Y.1965). Judge Sugarman, relying in part on Judge Cooper\u2019s opinion, similarly dismissed the Section 10(b) claims in <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk </em>for failure to satisfy the \u201cin connection with\u201d clause. Heit v. Weitzen, 260 F.Supp. 598 (S.D.N.Y.1966). Judge Sugarman also found that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim for relief under Section 18 of the 1934 Act since none of the reports upon which the claims were predicated were \u201cfiled\u201d with the SEC as required by that Section. The motions to dismiss were granted without leave to replead. We also note that defendants in all the actions moved for summary judgment based on the fact that plaintiffs have suffered no damage since after the institution of these actions the price of both Belock\u2019s common stock and debentures has risen above the prices originally paid by plaintiffs. Neither of the judges below reached this question, nor do we.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-10\">Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. Section 240.10 b-5, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b966-11\">It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the\" use ofany means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange,</p>\n<p id=\"b966-12\">(a) To employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud,</p>\n<p id=\"b966-13\">(b) To make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or</p>\n<p id=\"b966-14\">(c) To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person,</p>\n<p id=\"b966-15\">in connection with the purchase or sale of any security.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>Each of the judges below referred to the fact that the basic fraudulent scheme' alleged in the complaints was primarily-directed toward the government \u201cnotwithstanding its possible incidental market impact.\u201d Thus, it was held that the concealment of the overcharges when the financial statements were released was for \u201cthe purpose of further defrauding the Government by not disclosing the original malfeasance and not for the purpose of perpetrating a \u2018misrepresentation or fraudulent practice usually associated with the sale or purchase of securities.\u2019 \u201d Heit v. Weitzen, 260 F.Supp. 598, 602 (S.D.N.Y.1966). Furthermore, as stated by Judge Cooper, since neither the corporate nor the individual defendants in the instant action were engaged in purchasing or selling Belock securities, he could see no basis for a finding that the alleged fraud occurred \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b967-7\"> However, we must now reassess the holdings below in light of the principles enunciated in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., Docket No. 30882, 401 F.2d 833, at 839 (2d Circuit in banc 1968). Judge Waterman writing for the Court in <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur </em>construed the \u201cin connection with\u201d requirement broadly and held that the clause was satisfied whenever a device was employed \u201cof a sort that would cause reasonable investors to rely thereon, and, in connection therewith, so relying, cause them to purchase or sell a corporation\u2019s securities,\u201d SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., at 860. There is no necessity for contemporaneous trading in securities by insiders or by the corporation itelf. \u201cRule 10b-5 is violated whenever assertions are made * * * in a manner reasonably calculated to influence the investing public, e. g., by means of the financial media * * *, if such assertions are false or misleading or are so incomplete as to mislead irrespective of whether the issuance of the release was motivated by corporate officials for ulterior purposes.\u201d SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., at 861.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-6\">Applying this rule, and accepting at face value plaintiffs\u2019 well pleaded allegations, as we must on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, we conclude that plaintiffs have met the requirements of the \u201cin connection with\u201d clause. It is reasonable to assume that investors may very well rely on the material contained in false corporate financial statements which have been disseminated in the market place, and in so relying may subsequently purchase securities of the corporation. The \u201culterior motive\u201d present in the instant case\u2014-the concealment of the fraud from the government\u2014is irrelevant, since the false information was circulated to a large segment of the investing public. It is impossible to isolate the particular \u201cfraudulent\u201d acts and consider them as directed toward the government alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">As the \u201cin connection with\u201d clause has been satisfied, we must now deal with .the question of the standard by which the conduct of the defendants is to bo judged. Judge Waterman in the <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur </em>opinion held that proof of negligence was sufficient to sustain an action for injunctive relief under Rule 10b-5(2), but at the same time found it not necessary to decide whether negligence absent a showing of bad faith would suffice in a private suit for damages. SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., at 863. However, no question of liability for damages was before the Court in <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur </em>and Judge Friendly, in a concurring opinion joined in part by other judges, intimated that the appropriate standard in a private damage action should embody a scienter requirement. SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., supra, at 864-869. The question is troublesome. Compare Weber v. C. M. P. Corp., 242 F.Supp. 321 (S.D.N.Y.1965) with Royal Air Properties, Inc. v. Smith, 312 F.2d 210 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>1962). See also III Loss, Securities Regulation at 1785.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-4\">There is no occasion for us to enter this thicket now as we pass only upon the legal sufficiency of the complaints to allege a claim for relief. This each of the complaints fairly does. The charge that defendants \u201cknew or should have known\u201d adequately alleges actual knowledge of the falsity of the statements, and, alternatively, negligence or lack of diligence in failing to ascertain the true facts. If some form of scienter test is to be applied, as Judge Friendly seems to suggest in his concurring opinion in <em>Texas Gulf Sulphur, </em>we think the alternative allegation of actual knowledge of falsity is amply sufficient as a matter of pleading. And this would seem to be so whether the scienter test ultimately applied be strict or liberal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> See Fed.R.Civ. P. 8(e) (2); Pettit v. American Stock Exchange, 217 F.Supp. 21, 28-29 (S.D.N.Y.1963); Michael v. Clark Equipment Co. et al, 380 F.2d 351, 352 (2d Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">Therefore, as far as the claims under Rule 10b-5 are concerned we reverse the judgments appealed from and hold that each of the complaints is sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-7\">Section 18(a) of the 1934 Act, 15 U.S.C. Section 78r(a) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b968-8\">Any person who shall make or cause to be made any statement in any application, report, or document filed pursuant to this title or any rule or regulation thereunder or any undertaking contained in a registration statement as provided in subsection (d) of section 15 of this title, which statement was at the time and in the light of the circumstances under which it was made false or misleading with respect to any material fact, shall be liable to any person (not knowing that such statement was false or misleading) who, in reliance upon such statement, shall have purchased or sold a security at a price which was affected by such statement, for damages caused by such reliance, unless the person sued shall prove that he acted in good faith and had no knowledge that such statement was false or misleading. A person seeking to enforce such liability may sue at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction. In any such suit the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, and assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, against either party litigant.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-16\">Plaintiffs in <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk </em>have contended that they relied on various documents which were \u201cfiled\u201d within the meaning of Section 18. The documents in question are the \u201c10K report\u201d for the fiscal year ended October 31, 1964<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Belock\u2019s annual report for the same year, which was filed with the American Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">Judge Sugarman correctly ruled that the copies of the annual report submitted to the SEC were not \u201cfiled\u201d documents within the meaning of Section 18. Rule 14a-3(c), 17 C.F.R. Section 240.14a-3 (c), of the Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as it read when the 1964 financial statements were issued on or about February 4, 1965 provided :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-rg\">Four copies of each annual report sent to security holders pursuant to this section shall be mailed to the Commission * * *. The annual report is not deemed to be \u201csoliciting material\u201d or to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the Commission or subject to this regulation otherwise than as provided in this section, or to the liabilities of section 18 of the Act, except to the extent that the issuer specifically requests that it be treated as a part of the proxy soliciting material or incorporates it in the proxy statement by reference.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b969-7\">The above exemption provision, in addition to exempting the annual report filed with the SEC from the status of a \u201cfiled\u201d document, also exempts the annual report filed with the American Stock Exchange from the coverage of Section 18. This result is required by the specific language of the second sentence of the above provision which contains several independent exemption clauses. Thus, the annual report is neither considered to be \u201cfiled with the Commission\u201d nor subject to \u201cthe liabilities of section 18 of the Act.\u201d The latter phrase covers the alleged filing with the American Stock Exchange.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-13\">Although Fischman v. Raytheon, 188 F.2d 783 (2d Cir. 1951) held that Section 18(a) applied to \u201cdocuments\u201d filed with a national securities exchange, the effect of the above regulation is to withdraw annual reports from the category of \u201cfiled\u201d documents. The SEC has the power to prescribe rules that \u201cmay be necessary for the execution of the functions vested in\u201d it by the Securities Exchange Act, Section 23(a) Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Section 78w(a), and in the performance of this duty the Commission may properly determine which filings are to be deemed \u201cfilings\u201d for the purposes of Section 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b969-14\">Therefore, the only possible \u201cfiled\u201d document remaining is the \u201c10K report\u201d which is submitted to the SEC.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think it clear that the 10K report is a \u201cfiled\u201d document within the meaning of Section 18.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See Fischer v. Kletz, 266 F.Supp. 180 (S.D.N.Y.1967). The exemption provision contained in the SEC regulations relating to filing of the 10K report applies only to the copies of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>annual report which accompany the 10K report and not the 10K report itself. Regulation 249.310 as it read when the Belock 10K report was allegedly filed provided:</p>\n<p id=\"b970-4\">(i) Every registrant which files an annual report on this form [10K] shall furnish to the Commission for its information four copies of the following * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b970-6\">(a) any annual report to stockholders covering the registrant\u2019s last fiscal year;</p>\n<p id=\"b970-7\">******</p>\n<p id=\"b970-8\">(ii) The foregoing material shall not be deemed to be \u201cfiled\u201d with the Commission or otherwise subject to the liabilities of Section 18 of the Act, except to the extent that the registrant specifically requests that it be treated as a part of its annual report on this form [10K] or incorporates it therein by reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-9\">The opinion of the District Court is unclear and we are unable to determine whether Judge Sugarman intended to hold that the 10K report was not a \u201cfiled\u201d document. Appellees contend that Judge Sugarman ignored plaintiffs\u2019 claims based on form 10K simply because on oral argument appellants conceded that they could not allege or prove actual knowledge of and reliance upon any Belock 10K report. Appellants have denied making this concession. Reliance on the actual 10K report is an essential prerequisite for a Section 18 action and constructive reliance is not sufficient.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Therefore, although under the liberal pleading provisions of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the <em>Heit </em>and <em>Volk </em>complaints might well be considered broad enough to cover the allegation that they relied on misrepresentations contained in 10K reports,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we believe it advisable to remand these cases to the District Court for a reconsideration of the question of leave to amend. Judge Sugarman may have relied on plaintiffs\u2019 alleged concession or he may have thought that the complaint was not broad enough to cover an allegation of reliance on a 10K report. On the other hand, he may have incorrectly assumed that a 10K report could not form the basis for a Section 18 action. Thus the interests of justice would seem to require a clear appraisal of the pros and cons.</p>\n<p id=\"b970-14\">Finally, although the complaint in <em>Howard </em>contains no Section 18 claim for relief, it is stated in appellants\u2019 brief that such allegations will be added to the <em>Howard </em>complaint \u201cif leave to amend is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>granted.\u201d We leave this for the consideration of the District Court if, as and when such an application for leave to amend is addressed to that Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-6\">The District Court did not rule on defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment. We believe it would be inappro-priate at this early stage in the proceedings to deal with the issue of damages raised by these motions. We agree with the SEC that questions relating to damages should be postponed until after the' facts have been fully developed at the trial.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b971-7\">We wish to express our thanks to the SEC for submitting an <em>amicus curiae </em>brief at our request in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b971-8\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b966-6\">. The SEC in enacting Rule 10b-5 acted pursuant to the authority given it by virtue of Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. Section 78j(b). That section provides:</p>\n<p id=\"Aa5r\">It shall be unlawful for any person,directly or indirectly, by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, or of any facility of any national securities exchange\u2014 * * <em>* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"AJu\">(b) To use or employ, in connection with the purchase or sale of any security registered on a national securities exchange or any security not so registered, any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contra-</p>\n<p id=\"A8I\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>vention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b968-9\">.

We believe the Court will then be in a better position to examine and resolve questions with respect to the appropriate remedy, giving consideration to how a damage award against the issuer would affect the issuer and all of its stockholders, including those who neither bought nor sold. In so doing the Court will be able to utilize its traditional flexibility with respect to remedies, avoiding, on the one hand, Draconian relief and, on the other hand, an opportunity for violators to profit from their wrongdoing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b971-9\">MOORE, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"A6c\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b971-10\">For the reasons set forth in my dissenting opinion in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co. et al., 401 F.2d 833, pp. 870-889, I would hold that the \u201cin connection with the purchase or sale of any security\u201d requirement of Rule 10b-5 has not been met in the complaints dismissed below. Therefore, I would affirm the decisions of Judges Sugarman and Cooper. Apparently, the propriety of these suits as appropriate class actions has not been presently challenged and is not before us. In any event, even if proper, resolution of any and all issues relating thereto would be for the trial. The Heit and Volk consolidated amended complaint alleges that plaintiff Heit \u201cbrings this action on his own behalf and on behalf of all other persons who purchased Belock\u2019s debentures between April 30, 1964 and June 21, 1965, and who have either sold or continue to hold such debentures at a loss.\u201d The allegation as to Yolk is identical except that it relates to common stock. Obviously, such a class, which plaintiffs claim to champion, would be wholly unrelated to any of the facts as pleaded. Belock was engaged principally in engineering and manufacturing military electronic equipment. The price range of Belock\u2019s 6% convertible debentures in 1964 was 178 high and 97% low and in the first six months of 1965, 149 high and 75 low; for the common stock the range was 1964 high, 5%, low 3%, and for the first six months of 1965, 5% high, 2% low. The causes for the wide fluctuations of the thousands of listed securities would be legion even if ascertainable and cover events from the national and international to ever-changing local situations in specific companies. A class for purposes of a lawsuit could scarcely consist of all persons who bought stock on one of the national exchanges and subsequently sold it at a loss. To be sure, plaintiffs qualify this claim by alleging that \u201cThe other members of the stock class and the debenture class purchased and retained Belock\u2019s securities in reliance on the truth of the statements and representations herein alleged.\u201d Cons. Am\u2019d Compl. \u00b6 11(b). Thus, limited to \u201creliance,\u201d possibly a \u201cclass\u201d is stated. As previously stated, this determination, together with damages, if any, must await a trial. The same infirmities as to \u201cclass\u201d exist in my opinion in the Howard complaint to an even greater extent because the limitation is less specific.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
