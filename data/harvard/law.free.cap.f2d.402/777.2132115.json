The district judge rejected the claims of the appellant in detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law and ordered dismissal of the suit. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-26\">The district court erred, asserts appellant, in not finding the ship unseaworthy because, first, \u201cthe plan of operation for stowing cargo was unsafe\u201d ;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and second, \u201cmen were substituted for equipment.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Construing these contentions with what liberality we may, they just are not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>There can, of course, be no dispute that, given the appropriate facts, an improper method of handling cargo would render a vessel unseaworthy. But, where as here, the injury occurred when experienced plaintiff failed to use suitable equipment then available, it cannot be held that there was a \u201cmethod\u201d or \u201cplan\u201d of loading which was improper. Appellant\u2019s reliance on <em>Waldron, </em>supra, is misplaced. There, the assignment of insufficient manual assistance constituted the unseaworthy condition. But here, the record is utterly barren of even a suggestion that too few longshoremen were assigned to stow the bags. The case begins and remains a simple one. Appellant and his co-worker took it upon themselves not to make use of available pallet boards as a platform from which to stow the cargo, and not to utilize the manual assistance of other longshoremen then available.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-3\">Upon consideration of the record, briefs and argument, it is ordered that the judgment of the district court be and hereby is affirmed on the basis of the findings and conclusions set forth in that court\u2019s opinion. 268 F.Supp. 932.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b831-14\">.
