Jones is now before this Court on a reluctantly granted<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> certificate of probable cause, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 2253, and leave to appeal in forma pauperis, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1915(a). The district court had previously denied Jones\u2019 writ of habeas corpus, reasoning that \u201cthe fact of petitioner\u2019s guilt of issuing worthless checks is virtually unchallenged. The checks were not acquired by the exploitation of any illegality. They were made known by an independent source (were not tainted) and were admissible in evidence.\u201d See Ray v. United States, 5 Cir. 1967, 374 F.2d 638. Cf. Wong Sun v. United States, 1963, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed. 2d 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b830-23\"> While we do not believe that a prisoner is entitled to a certificate of probable cause as a matter of right, Jones v. Attorney General of the United States, 8 Cir. 1960, 278 F.2d 699, 701, the district court correctly resolved its doubts in favor of the petitioner since issuance is ordinarily a jurisdictional prerequisite for appeal, Gay v. Graham, 10 Cir. 1959, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"777\">*777</page-number>269 F.2d 482, 487, unless the appellate court itself, or a judge thereof, issues a certificate notwithstanding denial below. Dixon v. State of Florida, 5 Cir. 1968, 388 F.2d 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">On the other hand, after full review of the appellant\u2019s contentions, we agree with the district court that his claim that he was convicted through the use of illegally seized evidence lacks foundation in fact and is without merit. Habeas corpus was properly denied. Rowan v. State of Louisiana, 5 Cir. 1966, 356 F.2d 936; Norris v. Sanford, 5 Cir. 1945, 147 F.2d 943.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b830-16\">. In its order of February 1,1968, the District Court for the Western District of Louisiana, Hunter, J., presiding, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A7QJ\">\u2018\u2018[T]he issue on the instant application is \u2018whether there exists probable cause\u2019 for an appeal. Section 2253 of Title 28 does not define what is meant by \u2018probable cause.\u2019 As generally used, it requires something more than a frivolous assertion, (Ferrell v. O\u2019Brien, 342 U.S. 839, 72 S.Ct. 64, 96 L.Ed. 634), but something less than the imperatives of 28 U.S.C.A. 1292. Some courts have</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AmM\">said that it requires a \u2018substantial question worthy of consideration.\u2019 Whichever standard of probable cause may be proffered, we have grave doubt that there is any basis for the granting of the certificate. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqP\">\u201cThe application for a certificate of probable cause will be granted because my interpretation of recent Supreme Court decisions is to the general effect that appeal from a district court is a constitutional right.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
