He alleged that since 1963, defendant has sold coffee cans having an \u201ceasy open\u201d seal. He asserts that the seal used by the defendant makes use of the plaintiff\u2019s original submitted idea. He claimed a right of recovery on theories not too clear but in general the claim is that this was a misappropriation of something which belonged to plaintiff and for which the defendant owed the duty to compensate him.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-25\">After trial the court found that \u201c[t]here is no evidence and no basis for an inference that * * * defendant made any resort to or derived anything from the communications from plaintiff.\u201d Therefore \u201c[d]efendant has not appropriated any idea disclosed to it by plaintiff.\u201d The court found that there was no relationship of trust or confidence between the parties. Accordingly the court entered judgment for the defendant and this appeal resulted.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-27\">Upon examination of the record here we find that the findings of the court below are amply supported by the evidence and that such findings are not clearly erroneous. Accordingly the j'udgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
