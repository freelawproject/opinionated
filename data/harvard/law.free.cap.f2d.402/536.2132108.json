He appeared at the designated place of employment but refused all work offered. Prosecution and conviction for violation of the Universal Military Training and Service Act followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-14\">Appellant is employed as an animal keeper by the Los Angeles County Zoo. Defense witnesses testified without contradiction to his skill in this employment and the public importance of the work. Throughout the preliminary proceedings required by the regulations which culminated in the order to report for civilian work, Appellant offered his present employment as animal keeper as the type of civilian work he was willing to do and obdurately refused to consider or accept any other types of employment offered by the local board or state director. These acceptable employments are set forth in a list approved by the state director.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-15\">Appellant contends that the local board abdicated its statutory responsibility to consider and approve or disapprove work which the registrant offered to perform in lieu of induction into the military service. The record does not support this contention. On August 2, 1966, the registrant and a representative of the state director met with the local board, as required by the regulations, 32 C.F.R. 1660.20(c), in an effort to reach an agreement. Appellant\u2019s offer to work as an animal keeper for Los Angeles County was discussed and considered. The minutes of the meeting and the cover sheet show the following action by the local board: \u201cThe foregoing information together with the registrant\u2019s complete file was reviewed. The local board then determined that work as an Institutional Helper at the Los Angeles County Department of Charities, 1200 North State Street, Los Angeles, California is appropriate to be performed by the registrant and that such work is available.\u201d This designation of civilian work was approved by the Director of Selective Serv<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>ice, as required by the regulations [32 C.F.R. 1660.20(d)].<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">In this case we are not required to rely on Mang v. United States, 9th Cir. 1964, 339 F.2d 369, although it is sound authority for the proposition that there is no failure of due process or abdication of authority if a local board is guided by an approved list of acceptable civilian employments. We append as a footnote the full minutes of Appellant\u2019s meeting with the local board on August 3, 1966.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>We think it demonstrates that the board did consider the employment offered by Appellant. The minutes as a whole persuade us that the local board concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>that caring for people in a hospital is in the national interest while caring for animals in a zoo is not. The board stated: \u201cWe don\u2019t recognize all jobs working for the government as fulfilling your service obligation.\u201d The law and regulations do not require offered employment to be accepted by the board simply because the employer is the government. 32 C.F.R. 1660.1(a) (1) provides that such work <em>\u201cmay </em>be considered\u201d to be civilian work \u201ccontributing to the maintenance of the national <em>health, safety, </em>or <em>interest and </em>appropriate to be performed in lieu of induction.\u201d The record shows that the board assumed and exercised its responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b592-5\">. \u201c(d) If, after the meeting referred to in paragraph (c) of this section, the local board and the registrant are still unable to agree upon a type of civilian work which should be performed by the registrant in lieu of induction, the local board, with the approval of the Director of Selective Service, shall order the registrant to report for civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest as defined in \u00a7 1660.1 which it deems appropriate, but such order shall not be issued prior to the time that the registrant would have been ordered to report for induction if he had not been classified in class I-O, unless he has volunteered for such work.\u201d 32 C.F.R. 1660.20(d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b592-6\">. \u201cIn re: BURTON, Richard Walter</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-7\">August 3, 1966</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-8\">SS No. 4 117 46 1953</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-9\">\u201cRegistrant met with local board members and Major Miller, State Director\u2019s representative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-10\">\u201cPRESENT: HOWARD STICKNEY JAMES ANDERSON MAJOR MILLER</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b592-11\">\u201cBoard \u2014 Will you raise your right hand please?

Armand</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b593-44\">\u201cThe foregoing information together with the registrant\u2019s complete file, was reviewed. The local board then determined that work as an Institutional Helper at the Los Angeles County Department <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>of Charities, 1200 North State Street, Los Angeles, California is appropriate to be performed by tlie registrant and that such work is available.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b594-5\">ELY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AZQr\">(dissenting):</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">I respectfully dissent. Our courts are all too often presented with appeals by Selective Service registrants who have failed to cooperate with the Selective Service boards in their difficult task and who have, in many cases, refused to pursue their administrative remedies. Here, in direct contrast, we have a registrant who has cooperated with his local board and who has attempted in every available manner to obtain consideration of his request, made pursuant to the Selective Service Regulations. His local board has consistently refused to undertake the simple consideration of his request, and, as I see it, that constitutes an abdication of the duty imposed by the controlling Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">On February 3, 1966, Burton was classified I-A (available for military service) by the local board. He then requested a personal appearance before the board in order to reassert his previously claimed status as a conscientious objector. This personal appearance, which occurred on April 7, 1966, resulted in Burton\u2019s reclassification to class 1-0 (conscientious objector available for civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest). During the personal appearance, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-11\">\u201cBoard \u2014 Would you take a civilian job in lieu of induction into the armed forces?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-12\">\u201cBurton \u2014 Absolutely.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-13\">\u201cBoard \u2014 Well the Government has provided other jobs that have nothing to do with the armed forces that you can do in lieu of induction. You would have to do this particular type of job for a particular time in lieu of going into the service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-14\">\u201cBurton \u2014 What kind of work is that? I have a friend driving a truck for Goodwill.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-15\">\u201cBoard \u2014 Yes it is work in an approved charitable organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-16\">\u201cBurton \u2014 Right now I work for civil service.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-17\">\u201cBoard \u2014 Well that is not one of the jobs approved. Have you anything else to add ? \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-18\">Subsequent to his reclassification, notice of which was mailed on April 7, 1966, Burton took the armed forces physical examination on May 5, 1966. On that same day, he wrote the local board and requested that he be allowed to fulfill his civilian work obligation through work as an animal keeper for the City of Los Angeles, this being the civil service job to which he had referred at the time of his personal appearance. It should be noted, in passing, that the animals being attended by Burton were the subjects of important medical study. The Government has not contested Burton\u2019s showing at the trial that this employment met the requirements for \u201cappropriate\u201d civilian work, as defined in the Regulations. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.1. Indeed, the evidence indicates that such employment appears on the State Director\u2019s list of approved employment in several states.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-19\">Burton\u2019s request to fulfill his obligation through employment as an animal keeper was received by the local board on May 6, 1966. Subsequently, a Statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>of Acceptability regarding his physical examination was mailed to Burton on May 12, 1966. On May 19, 1966, the local board then mailed to Burton a special report form for conscientious objectors. This form requested that the registrant submit three types of work, types appearing on the State Director\u2019s \u201capproved\u201d list, which he would perform. In this report, received by the board on May 31, 1966, Burton reiterated his desire to continue in his work as an animal keeper in satisfaction of his civilian work obligation. He also noted that he had been unable to examine an \u201capproved\u201d list because of conflict between the hours when the board was open and the hours when he was required to be present at his job.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Following the board\u2019s receipt of this report from Burton, an employee of the board requested the State Director to select three types of \u201capproved\u201d jobs to be submitted to the registrant. Such a list was submitted to Burton on June 13, 1966, and Burton, in reply, again requested that he be allowed to perform his job as an animal keeper in satisfaction of his obligation. At this point, on August 3, 1966, Burton met with the local board and a representative of the State Director. The transcript of this meeting is set out in footnote two of the majority opinion. In my opinion, the conversation makes it apparent beyond dispute that the board was continuing to insist that Burton was limited to a choice from the State Director\u2019s list of approved employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The applicable Selective Service Regulations provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-7\">\u201cWhen a registrant in Class 1-0 has been found qualified for service in the Armed Forces after his armed forces physical examination or when such a registrant has failed to report for or to submit to armed forces physical examination, he shall, within ten days after a Statement of Acceptability (DD Form No. 62) has been mailed to him by the local board or within ten days after he has failed to report for or submit to armed forces physical examination, submit to the local board three types of civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest as defined in section 1660.1, which he is qualified to do and which he offers to perform in lieu of induction into the Armed Forces. If the local board deems any one of these types of work to be appropriate, it will order the registrant to perform such work, but such order shall not be issued prior to the time that the registrant would have been ordered to report for induction if he had not been classified in Class I-O, unless he has volunteered for such work.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(a).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b595-10\">\u201cIf the registrant fails to submit to the local board types of work which he offers to perform, or if the local board finds that none of the types of work submitted by the registrant is appropriate, the local board shall submit to the registrant by letter three types of civilian work contributing to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest as defined in \u00a7 1660.1 which it deems appropriate for the registrant to perform in lieu of induction. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b595-11\">32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-12\">The majority holds that the local board evaluated Burton\u2019s request with regard to whether work as an animal keeper qualified as \u201cappropriate\u201d civilian employment, as defined in the Regulations, 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.1, and determined that it was not appropriate. Regardless of whether this specific job was an appropriate one \u2014 an issue which I do not here reach \u2014 I am absolutely unable to find any support for the majority\u2019s holding. In fact, it appears to me that the Government has conceded the contrary. In its statement of facts at the beginning of its brief, the Government admits: \u201cThe Board explained [at the meeting with Burton and the representative of the State Director] that it was refusing to accept appellant\u2019s request to perform his civilian work assignment at the Los Angeles City Zoo <em>for the reason that </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number><em>it was not on the approved list provided by the State Director </em>* * (Emphasis added.) Later, in its written argument, the Government states that the issue in the <em>Mang </em>case, discussed infra, \u201cwas identical to the issue now before this Court; i. e., the Local Board relied on the State Director\u2019s list of approved organizations, and appellant charges this constitutes an abdication of the Local Board\u2019s duties; an illegal usurpation of authority by the State Director; and a denial of due process.\u201d Finally, a third example of the many statements in the Government\u2019s brief which support my belief as to the basis for the board\u2019s action may be found in the Government\u2019s assertion that \u201c [i] t was immaterial that the work chosen was in the public interest, <em>the crucial factor was that it was not on the State Director\u2019s list of approved places of employment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">The local boards must comply with, and should respect, the Selective Service Regulations. The relevant provision of those Regulations unambiguously states that before the board is to submit its own choice of work to the registrant, the <em>local board </em>is to <em>find </em>that none of the types of work properly requested by the registrant is appropriate. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(b). For an example of such a finding, see Jessen v. United States, 242 F.2d 213 (10th Cir. 1957). No finding was ever made by the local board in Burton\u2019s case. Indeed, it was not even the local board that formulated the \u201capproved\u201d list upon which the board placed its total reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">Two court of appeals decisions may be cited in support of the proposition, advanced by the Government, that the board may rely totally upon the \u201capproved\u201d list to the exclusion of any finding made on its own behalf. The most recent of the two cases is from our own court. Mang v. United States, 339 F.2d 369 (9th Cir. 1964). There a registrant requested work at one of the three \u201capproved\u201d jobs submitted by the board, but he soon quit. The board then submitted three more jobs to him, in response to which the registrant requested that he be ordered to work at another job which was not on the \u201capproved\u201d list. The local board refused this request because the job did not appear on the State Director\u2019s list. Our court affirmed. Apart from direct reliance on, and extended quotation from, the second of the above-mentioned two cases, discussed <em>infra, </em>the <em>Mang </em>opinion in this connection relied only upon the assertion that \u201cthe problem of what type of civilian work is to be undertaken by a \u20181-0\u2019 registrant is <em>finally </em>to be determined by the National Director of Selective Service.\u201d 339 F.2d at 370 (emphasis in original). I have become convinced that the statement was incorrect as a generalization and is incorrect as applied to the case before us. As the Regulations make abundantly clear, the Director of Selective Service has no connection with the selection of civilian work for a registrant until <em>after </em>the <em>local board </em>has made a <em>finding </em>with regard to the registrant\u2019s requested employment and <em>after </em>the registrant has refused to perform any of the appropriate employment opportunities submitted to him by the local board. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-10\">In United States v. Lawson, 337 F.2d 800 (3d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 380 U.S. 919, 85 S.Ct. 913, 13 L.Ed.2d 804 (1965), the registrant requested that he be allowed to fulfill his civilian work obligation through employment with Goodwill Industries. Despite the fact that Goodwill Industries at that time appeared on the \u201capproved\u201d lists in many states and had, several years previously, appeared on the list in the state involved, the local board rejected the request because the job was not on its current \u201capproved\u201d list. The Third Circuit upheld the board\u2019s action in an opinion which, as I read it, does not clearly define the basis of the court\u2019s reasoning.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In any event, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>court did not discuss the relevant provisions of the Selective Service Regulations which I have set forth above.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-4\">The majority here states that <em>Mang </em>\u201cis sound authority for the proposition that there is no failure of due process or abdication of authority if a local board <em>is guided </em>by an approved list of acceptable civilian employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) I have no quarrel with this proposition. Certainly, it is desirable that the local board be aided in its difficult task by whatever sound <em>guides </em>may be made available .to it by the state and national Selective Service authorities. See 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1621.14; cf. Tyrrell v. United States, 200 F.2d 8, 13 (9th Cir. 1952), cert denied, 345 U.S. 910, 73 S.Ct. 646, 97 L.Ed. 1346 (1953) (list of recognized theological or divinity schools to be used as a classification guide, rather than as an inflexible standard). My only objection is that, when the Regulations have otherwise been observed, the local board <em>is not bound </em>by such guides and must itself assume the final responsibility where, as here, the Regulations specifically direct that the ultimate finding be made by the local board. This is as it should be, for I cannot reasonably assume that each State Director\u2019s list will necessarily include every type of employment which may be available within the particular state and which is \u201cappropriate\" under the definition of the Regulations. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Finally, I respectfully submit that <em>Mang </em>and <em>Lawson </em>are not controlling in our case. This is because of a factor which, while not considered by the parties in their briefs, is one to which I attach the utmost significance. In <em>Lawson </em>the registrant was ordered to take his physical examination on August 2, 1961. On August 1, 1961, he notified the local board that he would not appear for that examination, and, in fact, he did not take the examination. Subsequently, on October 17, 1961, the board submitted to the registrant three appropriate jobs. This was done pursuant to the Regulations. 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1660.20(b). Still later, after a number of further contacts with the registrant in connection with appropriate employment, the local board, on August 7, 1962, directed that the registrant report to a New Jersey state-operated hospital to fulfill his two-year obligation. Finally, on the same date, August 7th, the registrant wrote to the board and <em>for the first time </em>requested that he be allowed to fulfill his obligation through employment with Goodwill Industries. Thus more than a year had passed between the date when the registrant was to have submitted to the physical examination and the date of his request for approval of employment at Goodwill Industries in satisfaction of his obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">In <em>Mang </em>the civilian-employment procedure had been carried by the board and the registrant to the point where the reg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>istrant had actually begun performance of appropriate employment pursuant to a valid order of the board. Shortly after entering into this performance, however, the registrant quit the employment, allegedly due to illness. Five months thereafter, the board submitted to the registrant three new choices of appropriate employment, since the registrant had yet to fulfill his two-year civilian-employment obligation. Following this action of the local board, the registrant, <em>for the first time, </em>requested that he be allowed to fulfill his work obligation in employment specified by him. As indicated previously, the board refused this request on the ground that the job did not appear on the \u201capproved\u201d list.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">Section 1660.20(a) of the Regulations, quoted supra, specifically requires that the registrant submit his request for appropriate employment which he offers to perform <em>within ten days </em>after the mailing of a Statement of Acceptability to him <em>or within ten days </em>after he fails to take his armed forces physical examination. It is upon this request, which must be made before the ten-day period expires, that the local board is required by the Regulations to make a finding. In both <em>Many </em>and <em>Lawson, </em>the registrant\u2019s first request came long after the ten-day limit had expired. Thus in neither of those cases was the request properly made pursuant to the Regulations, and, therefore, in neither case was the board required by the Regulations to consider the registrant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The situation in Burton\u2019s case is far different. As related previously, Burton took the armed forces physical examination on May 5, 1966. His request to fulfill his obligation through employment as an animal keeper was written on that same day, presumably after he learned that he had passed the examination, and the request was received by the local board on May 6, 1966, one day later. A Statement of Acceptability, dated May 5, 1966, was mailed to Burton on May 12, 1966. Thus, without question, Burton complied with the requirements of the Regulations, and the local board was therefore under a corresponding duty also to abide by the Regulations by independently making the required finding as to the appropriateness of the specific employment which Burton had properly requested. The local board failed to perform its duty, and its failure resulted from its erroneous belief that the State Director\u2019s list operated to restrict, and even confine, the free exercise of its lawfully vested discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">I would reverse.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b596-7\">. The crucial portion of the Third Circuit\u2019s opinion reads as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-8\">\u201c[The registrant] asserts that the Board utilized lists of employers transmitted to it by the National and State Selective Service authorities and made its order pursuant to the suggestion by them. In this, appellant contends the</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANA\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>Board abandoned its duty to exercise its own discretion which, he submits, excuses him from compliance with the directive of the Board that he take employment with the New Jersey State Hospital at Greystone Park. Indeed, he goes so far as to doubt the constitutionality of the regulation limiting the employers to public or non-profit agencies asserting that those engaged in private enterprises are fully as contributive toward the public welfare as nonprofit agencies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjY\">\u201cBut the appellant makes -no suggestion that the proposed employers [submitted to tbe registrant by the board prior to his request] were unfit. Were this the case and it was shown that the Board permitted its discretion to be dominated by suggestion of employers, illegally contrived, there might have been some ground to his contention. However, when the dust cloud of these objections settles, it becomes apparent that the Board, by permitting itself to be guided in the selection of the proposed employer of this conscientious objector, abandoned none of its autonomy with which the Selective Service Act vested it. Indeed, it is difficult to understand how uniformity of treatment of all conscientious objectors with regard to engagement in public welfare work could otherwise be practiced.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">United States v.
