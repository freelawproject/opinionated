Appellant contends that the merchandise was properly classified by the collector as \u201cartificial fruit,\u201d dutiable at 42.5% ad valorem under Item 748.21, TSUS.</p>\n<p id=\"AAjT\">Seventeen samples of the imported articles, invoiced as \u201ccarved wooden fruit,\u201d are in evidence. All are stipulated to be in chief value of wood and each resembles in shape a fruit of common or exotic variety.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Each carving is identified on the invoices by the name of the fruit it resembles, viz., \u201capple,\u201d \u201cpear,\u201d \u201clemon,\u201d \u201cmango,\u201d \u201cpapaya,\u201d \u201catis,\u201d \u201cbalimbing,\u201d \u201cbanana,\u201d \u201cBlack Calamassi,\u201d \u201cgrapes,\u201d \u201cblack grapes,\u201d \u201csinkamas,\u201d \u201ctamarind,\u201d \u201csantol,\u201d \u201ccashew nut,\u201d \u201cmakupa,\u201d and \u201cstrawberry.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>The carved articles vary considerably in color, from very light to very dark, but all appear .to have the natural texture grain, and color of the wood from which they are made.</p>\n<p id=\"AnJV\">The \u201cgrapes,\u201d \u201cblack grapes,\u201d and \u201cmakupa\u201d are made from a number of wood pieces connected with leather \u201cstems.\u201d Some of the carvings have small leather or twine \u201cstems\u201d and/or \u201cleaves\u201d attached while others are made of wood of one.pieCe construction.</p>\n<p id=\"AGO\">The Tariff Schedules involved, insofar as pertinent, read as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A02\">TSUS Schedule 7, Part 7, Subpart B:</p>\n<p id=\"Alue\">********</p>\n<p id=\"AVJ\">Artificial flowers, trees, foliage, fruits, vegetables, grasses, or grains, parts of the foregoing, and articles made of the foregoing * * *:</p>\n<p id=\"AyI\">********</p>\n<p id=\"A_q\">748.21 Other...................................42.5% ad val.</p>\n<p id=\"Al0\">* * * * ' * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AF0\">TSUS Schedule 2, Part 1, Subpart F:</p>\n<p id=\"AK5\">********</p>\n<p id=\"Auq\">207.00 Articles not specially provided for, of wood .. 16%% ad val.</p>\n<p id=\"A_Q\">Thus, the sole issue is whether the imports are \u201cartificial fruits\u201d within the common understanding of that term.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AYR\">The Customs Court summarized the testimony m part as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"Ad-\">Plaintiffs\u2019 witness [Moore] testified that he has been familiar with the merchandise at bar for 4 years or more, having first become familiar with this line of merchandise when his firm was surveying the market of monkeypod wood in the Philippines \u2014 \u201cfruit carvings\u201d \u2014 and that he decided that his company should have something to supplement its monkeypod wood line, something that would \u201ceffect an entirely wood motif\u201d * * *. Mr. Moore stated that he had become familiar with the uses his customers make of the various articles in question by visiting retail shops and seeing how they are displayed, and also by seeing them displayed m homes. He then testified that, in almost all cases, they are used on monkeypod wood trays or other types of wood trays * * *. The witness stated that he had never seen them displayed in china or porcelain bowls and, further, that he has never seen real fruit displayed in' monkeypod bowls * * *. Plaintiffs\u2019 witness further stated that the color of the various articles is not that of the natural fruit of which they are carved to resemble * * *.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>On cross-examination, Mr. Moore agreed that the exhibits in question represent the natural fruit in shape or form and stated that, other than the fact that they are of wood and of wood color and texture, the items in question resemble the original fruit * * *. He then stated that in the stores where he had seen these items displayed and sold, the storekeeper in almost all cases described the merchandise as \u201cwood carvings\u201d and that he had never heard the items described as artificial fruits * *</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">[Defendant\u2019s witness, Short] * * * does a general importing business and operates the Bamboo Window, * * * [a store] in Honolulu, Hawaii. He stated * * * that he was familiar with and sells [eleven of] the items represented by plaintiffs\u2019 exhibits * * * and that he describes such items to his customers as \u201cartificial fruits\u201d and classifies them as such * * *. [Defendant\u2019s] * * * witness testified that all of the items that he sells are in the natural wood coloring. He was not sure whether * * * \u201cBlack Grapes\u201d * * * was all natural wood or stained but stated, however, that the wood grain could be seen on it. [He] * * * further testified that, in selling such items in his store, they are normally kept with the wood items on display there, so usually but \u201cnot necessarily\u201d they would be on a wood tray, but in any case a \u201cwood motif\u201d * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b538-14\">Prefatory to its own discussion of the merchandise at bar, the court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-15\">In determining whether or not an article is an artificial flower or fruit, it is the per <em>se </em>nature of the article and not the use to which it is put which controls its classification. (Morimura Bros. v. United States, 8 Ct.Cust.Appls. 111, T.D. 37223, and Hensel, Bruckmann &amp; Lorbacher, Inc. v. United States, supra [47 Cust.Ct. 112, C.D. 2289].)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-16\">Appellant contends that it is clear from this statement that the court below, in its approach to the classification of the imported carvings, \u201cignored or * * * gave insufficient weight\u201d to their suitability for the ornamental uses to which both the merchandise at bar and natural fruits are sometimes put. We cannot agree. Considered in the light of the cited Morimura Bros, and Hensel cases, we think this statement was included merely to evidence a recognition that an article suited to the ornamental uses to which natural fruit is sometimes put is not necessarily an \u201cartificial fruit\u201d; and, conversely, that an article may still be an \u201cartificial fruit\u201d in the tariff sense even though it is suited to non-fruit-like, as well as fruit-like, ornamental uses. Moreover, the court\u2019s summary of the testimony and its observation that \u201cNeither \u2018closeness of simulation\u2019 by shape nor the use to which an item is put is alone determinative of the classification of articles\u201d show that the court viewed the situation as a whole and gave consideration to all relevant factors, including the uses to which the involved carvings are suited.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-18\">Appellant\u2019s second main contention is that the <em>only </em>reason for questioning the original classification as \u201cartificial fruit\u201d is that the carvings are not the same <em>color </em>as the items of real fruit which they resemble in shape. Suffice it to say that we consider the situation here to be entirely analogous to that being considered in Marshall Field v. United States, 45 CCPA 72, at p. 81, C.A.D. 676 (1958), when we said (p. 81):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-19\">We believe that the common understanding of the term \u201cartificial fruit\u201d does not encompass such iron objects, particularly when their over-all color is that of oxidized iron so as to give the observer the distinct and immediate impression that it is a work of wrought iron, to be used where it is desired to add a touch of wrought iron to the interior decor, not where one would normally use real fruit or close imitations thereof in form and color. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>As noted by the court below, \u201cthe samples are * * * potent witnesses.\u201d They give the observer the distinct and immediate impression that they are nothing other than nicely finished, natural grain wood carvings, albeit they have fruit-like contours or shapes. They are used where it is desired to decorate with a wood motif. It is our opinion that in the common understanding of the expression, they are not \u201cartificial fruit,\u201d notwithstanding that the kinds of fruit they simulate <em>only </em>in shape might be used for decoration and that the principal use of the imports is for decoration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-3\">The judgment below is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b536-13\">. Protests 65/2566, 64/23136 and 64/23137 were consolidated for trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b536-14\">. We will assume, as the parties appear to have done, that beans, garlic, and cashew nuts are \u201cfruit.\u201d The question is not important here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b536-26\">. From the testimony it appears that an atis is a popular Philippine fruit called a hand grenade in this country, a balimbing is called a star fruit in Hawaii, a sinkamas is called a garlic in this country, a tamarind is called a bean in this country, and a santol is something like a lemon.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AhQ\">. At the very close of his oral argument before this court appellees\u2019 counsel referred to Headnote 1 of Schedule 7, Part 7, Subpart B, TSUS, as being applicable to exclude at least several of the involved carvings from Item 748.21. The portion of this headnote to which counsel referred reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"ACQT\">1. The provisions of items * * * 748.21 <em>do not </em>include\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"AYC\">*****</p>\n<p id=\"AQyq\">(ii) articles <em>(other than </em>individual parts, such as pistils, stamens, ovaries, petals, calyxes, leaves, and flower heads, <em>fruits, </em>or vegetables <em>without stems and foMage) which have been obtained in one piece from </em>stone, metal, <em>wood, </em>or other material <em>by </em>molding, stamping, <em>carving, </em>forging, or other process; * * *. [Our emphasis.]</p>\n<p id=\"AN6\">Since the applicability of this headnote was not urged below or in the briefs here, it is an issue not properly before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
