Champion Spark Plug Co., 364 F.2d 957 (5 Cir., 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">The original action was brought by Miami Parts and Spring, Inc., against Champion Spark Plug Company and Patten Sales Company, as defendant co-conspirators. Thereafter, on stipulation of dismissal Patten was released as a co-joint tort-feasor on October 12, 1964.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">After hearing and remand of this case by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals on an issue not involved here, pre-trial activities were begun. At the pre-trial on May 29, 1967, attorneys for Miami stated that Miami could not prevail in this action without evidence of the co-conspiracy between Champion and Patten, and this admission <em>in judicio </em>was considered by the trial court. As Patten had previously been dismissed as a joint tort-feasor, the trial court granted a motion for summary judgment. The granting of this motion was not error as the release of Patten Sales Company, a joint tort-feasor, was a release of defendant Champion Spark Plug Company, the other joint -tortfeasor. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Winchester Drive-In Theatre, 351 F.2d 925 (9 Cir., 1965); Canillas v. Joseph H. Carter, Inc., 280 F.Supp. 48 (S.D.N.Y., 1968); Ayers v. Pastime Amusement Company, 259 F.Supp. 358 (D.C. 1966). The cases on the question establish the rule that federal law governs the effect of a release of joint tortfeasors in anti-trust cases. Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. Winchester Drive-In Theatre, 351 F.2d 925 (9 Cir., 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
