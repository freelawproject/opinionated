We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">Appellant enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard and received a I-D seleetive service classification.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Upon rejection by military authorities of his application for discharge as a conscientious objector, he applied to his local board for reclassification. Four days later he was certified for priority induction under 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.8<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and without a hearing on his conscientious objector claim was ordered to report for induction. He was thereafter found guilty of refusing to submit to induction, the jury being allowed to consider only whether he refused to take the symbolic step forward at the induction center.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-24\">This case was tried prior to the decision, on virtually identical facts, of Quaid v. United States, 10 Cir. 1967, 386 F.2d 25, which held that the mandatory nature of 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.8 priority induction is impermissible under 50 App. U.S.C.A. \u00a7 456(j).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>conflict between 32 C.F.R. \u00a7 1631.8 and the Congressional statutes arises from a discrepancy of language. Section 1631.8 provides that delinquent National Guardsmen <em>\u201cshall </em>be ordered to report for induction.\u201d See note 3 supra. However, 50 App. U.S.C.A. \u00a7 456(c) (2) (D), the statute which the regulation implements, provides that delinquent Guardsmen <em>\u201cmay </em>be selected for training and service and inducted into the armed force of which such reserve component is a part, prior to the selection and induction of other persons liable therefor.\u201d [Emphasis added.]</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">The substitution of the imperative \u201cshall\u201d for the permissive \u201cmay\u201d becomes important in view of the emphatic limitations of section 456(j), supra note 4. To give effect to the regulation would be to bypass the local board hearing required by section 456(j), resulting in two diametrically opposed statutes. The regulation therefore is invalid insofar as it \u201crequires priority induction of a delinquent reservist, regardless of another provision of the statute which directs the local board to investigate a conscientious objector claim before ordering induction. * * \u201d Quaid v. United States, 386 F.2d at 29. Appellant as a militiaman<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was entitled to a local selective service board hearing on his claim of conscientious objection prior to the perfunctory induction order. Therefore his conviction for refusing to submit to induction cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b352-10\">.
