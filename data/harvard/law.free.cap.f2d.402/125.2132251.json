Isbell. For facility of discussion we refer to the patent itself as the \u201cIsbell Patent.\u201d Suit was brought against the defendant Winegard Company for alleged infringement. Trial was held before the Honorable Roy L. Stephenson, Chief Judge of the Southern District of Iowa. Judge Stephenson held that the subject matter of the patent did not rise to the level of patentability and dismissed plaintiff\u2019s suit. See University of Illinois Foundation v. Winegard Co., 271 F.Supp. 412 (S.D.Iowa 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-28\">The Isbell Patent claims a high quality television antenna for color reception, with unidirectional performance over a wide bandwidth of frequencies. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>trial court denied validity to the patent in that \u201cit would have been obvious to one ordinarily skilled in the art and wishing to design a frequency independent unidirectional antenna to combine * * * prior art references * * Id. at 419.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">There is no necessity to set forth the full discussion of the facts relating to the prior art. These appear in the excellent analysis made by the Chief Judge below. We have examined the record and find that all claims must be denied, lacking nonobviousness as a matter of law for essentially the same reasons set forth by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">Plaintiff urges that the trial court erred in denying patent validity and calls our attention to a subsequent decision in a federal district court in Illinois which upholds the validity of the same patent against another defendant, University of Illinois Foundation v. Blonder-Tongue Laboratories, Inc., N.D.Ill., Civ. No. 66 C 567. However, as recognized by the district court in Illinois, we must determine this case on its own record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">The plaintiff basically urges on appeal that the district court in the present case erred in finding that \u201cthose skilled in the art at the time of the Isbell application knew * * * the log periodic method of designing frequency independent antennas.\u201d On the face of the record we must agree that this finding is erroneous. The record discloses that the log-periodic formula <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for antenna design was a recognized theory within the calling. This formula is discussed in the authoritative article by Drs. Hamel and Ore entitled Logarithmically Periodic Antenna Designs, published in March of 1958. However, as pointed out by plaintiff, this same article discloses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-12\">\u201cUnfortunately, no theory has been established which even predicts the types of structures which will give frequency independent operation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">Jasik\u2019s Antenna Engineering Handbook, a recognized authority in the field, verifies on page 18: \u201c <em>* * * </em>it is not possible to determine <em>a priori </em>the frequency independent type of log-periodic antennas.\u201d The record is clear that both plaintiff and defendant experts agreed with this fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-14\">Thus, we feel the evidence only discloses the adaptation by plaintiff of the log-periodic formula to obtain geometric proportional spacing across its bandwidth. It did not teach that said spacing will in itself achieve frequency independent operation. As we view the record it is the achievement of frequency independent operation through the use of the dipole array which is the principal claim of the Isbell Patent. Both parties\u2019 experts agree that with frequency independent operation \u201csevere end-effects\u201d and unstable performance is avoided. A frequency independent antenna is one in which the basic electrical characteristics remain substantially constant over a given frequency range. These characteristics generally relate to uniform gain, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>bandwidth, directivity and a good impedance match. Unless an antenna achieves frequency independent operation it will not offer the high quality performance over a wide band of frequencies needed for commercial operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">However, we do not view the acknowledged fact of the unpredictability of the frequency independent operation of the Isbell Patent as requiring us to reach a result different than held below. Nor was the trial court\u2019s finding in this regard essential to its overall reasoning that the patent itself was made obvious by the prior art. The statutory standard of patentability under \u00a7 103 is not \u201cpredictability.\u201d This terminology helps to obscure the true issue of \u201cnonobviousness.\u201d The valid test relates the subject patent to whether its development would be obvious to one skilled in the art. As stated by Mr. Justice Clark, the test of nonobviousness \u201cis one of inquiry, not quality * * Graham v. John Deere Co., 383 U.S. 1, 17, 86 S.Ct. 684, 15 L.Ed. 2d 545 (1966). As we have often repeated such inquiry relates to: (1) scope and content of the prior art, (2) differences between the subject patent and the prior art, (3) the level of the skill in the art at the time involved and (4) secondary considerations relating to commercial success, long-felt need, et al. And of course, the latter factors cannot alone determine patentability. National Connector Corp. v. Malco Mfg. Co., 392 F.2d 766 (8 Cir. 1968).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Therefore, we deem the sole legal issue in the instant case to be whether a person skilled in the calling could improve with the skill of the calling the prior art by obvious means.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-11\">The mere fact that the \u201cinvention\u201d was not previously known or developed is not the test. Where logical exploration within known principles of the science achieves an unpredictable result, even though a commercially desirable one, the burden of nonobviousness is not necessarily overcome. In other words, the necessity of logical experimentation does not in and of itself negate obviousness.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Cf. General Mills, Inc. v. Pillsbury Co., 378 F.2d 666 (8 Cir. 1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-12\">As early asserted by Mr. Justice Bradley in Atlantic Works v. Brady, 107 U.S. 192, 199-200, 2 S.Ct. 225, 231, 27 L.Ed. 438 (1882):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-13\">\u201cThe process of development in manufactures creates a constant demand for new appliances, which the skill of ordinary head-workmen and engineers is generally adequate to devise, and which, indeed, are the natural and proper outgrowth of such development. Each step forward prepares the way for the next, and each is usually taken by spontaneous trials and attempts in a hundred different places. To grant to a single party a monopoly of every slight advance made, except where the exercise of invention, somewhat above ordinary mechanical or engineering skill, is distinctly shown, is unjust in principle and injurious in its consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-14\">Plaintiff urges Isbell had to overcome two serious handicaps which hid the de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>velopmental obviousness: (1) the use of linear dipoles to achieve a broad-band result, and (2) the mismatch of impedance. The simple answer to this argument is that the \u201cproblems\u201d presented were never recognized beyond experimental correction by those skilled in the calling. Although linear dipoles may have been used with \u201cnarrow-band\u201d antennas, such configuration had been shown to be used with antennas having broad-band characteristics. Defendant\u2019s tests demonstrated they had substantially the same characteristics (except impedance) as the \u201cfolded dipole.\u201d They had been utilized interchangeably by experimental engineers. These equivalent characteristics were known long before the Isbell Patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\">The problem of matching impedance was one of adjustment. However, matching impedance is an elementary problem to those skilled in radio electronics. Impedance is recognized as the resistance to the flow of current. It is fundamental that efficient performance of any antenna occurs only through a maximum power transfer of the transmission line to the antenna itself. This requires matching impedance as much as possible. No claim of \u201cinvention\u201d is asserted to overcome the mismatch, only that the antenna itself was, therefore, not obvious. The ability to match impedance with the linear dipole array was not new to the development and exploration which led to the Isbell antenna. There was not involved the same deterrent as experienced in United States v. Adams, 383 U.S. 39, 86 S.Ct. 708, 15 L.Ed.2d 572 (1966), where chemicals were interchanged, admittedly non equivalents, to achieve the \u201cwater battery.\u201d The problem here was one of trial and error with a combination of commonly used elements operating within known principles of electronics and mechanics to achieve a desired result. Cf. Marconi Wireless Tel. Co. of America v. United States, 320 U.S. 1, 63 S.Ct. 1393, 87 L.Ed. 1731 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">In Jasik\u2019s Antenna Engineering Handbook it is stated on page 1813:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-9\">\u201cSince log-periodic antennas are too complex to analyze by present-day theoretical methods, they must be investigated by <em>logical experimental meth</em>ods,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However their repetitive nature greatly simplifies the initial experimental investigation because the characteristics need only be measured over one or two periods of frequency.\u201d (Emphasis ours.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">Plaintiff claims that the frequency independent operation of the Isbell antenna was accomplished by \u201cspecified scaling factors to determine dipole length, design cell dimensions, and spacing between dipoles.\u201d Here again, the evidence reflects that plaintiff did nothing more than logical and mechanical experimentation within suggested principles and design from the existing art. As the trial court found, there exists a direct relationship between the length and cell dimension of the Isbell claims and those of the prior art found within the K. 0. antenna. And plaintiff\u2019s own expert discounted the significance of the dipole spacing as a design factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">Problems of impedance, patterns, resonance, gain, directivity and bandwidth, may all vary upon experimentation within recognized principles of elements having known interrelated electrical characteristics. And naturally, only high <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>quality performance will be the optimum design array desirable. Such experimental combination of common elements and principles, e. g., dipole array, transposed feed, end fed and log-periodic formula, by selected spacing to obtain an improvement of both antenna design and performance, does not obviate, the test of nonobviousness. If this were not true, at least in the instant case, nonobviousness would depend simply upon achieving a new result. The standard of patent-ability under \u00a7 103 requires more.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b179-29\">.

Compare this court\u2019s holding in Imperial Stone Cutters, Inc. v. Schwartz, 370 F.2d 425 (8 Cir. 1966), invalidating the letters patent previously upheld in 1958 by another panel of our court on a different record in Ezee Stone Cutter Mfg. Co. v. Southwest Indus. Prods., Inc., 262 F.2d 183 (8 Cir. 1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\">. As summarized by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah17\">\u201cGenerally stated, log periodic antennas are designed according to the theory that an antenna \u2018design cell' having high performance characteristics for reception of a limited band or period of radio frequency signals, if altered in all dimensions by a constant scale factor will have high performance characteristics for reception of a band of signals having wavelengths which vary from the wavelengths of the first band of frequencies by the same constant scale factor. Thus, according to the theory, if an antenna design cell has certain characteristics for reception of particular frequency wavelengths, an antenna geometrically similar but reduced in all dimensions by a scale factor of .5 will have similar characteristics for reception of frequencies of wave lengths half those of the first.\u201d University of Illinois Foundation v.
