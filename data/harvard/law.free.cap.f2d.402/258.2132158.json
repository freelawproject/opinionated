He failed to return the company uniform. On January 20, 1967, an unidentified person, wearing a uniform of the Armored Express Service, entered the Airport National Bank of Miami, pushing a hand truck similar to those used by employees of Armored Express Service for picking up money. This individual obtained from the bank teller $24,000, which was in two bags intended for delivery to a local pharmacy and three bags intended for delivery to an airline company. Receipts were given by the unidentified individual to the teller. Williams was identified as being in the bank during this transaction. Shortly after the money was turned over to the imposter by the bank teller, the true armored ear operator arrived at the bank, at which time the crime was discovered. Investigation reflected that the hand truck had been purchased by Williams on the same day that the money was obtained from the bank and that Williams\u2019 right thumbprint appeared on one of the receipts given to the bank teller.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">In Thaggard v. United States, 354 F. 2d 735 (5 Cir. 1965), a case where the defendant fraudulently took advantage of a bank\u2019s bookkeeping error and withdrew $43,000 from the bank, which conduct constituted the basis for a conviction under Section 2113(b), this Court, in response to a contention that, in order to be guilty of a violation of the federal bank robbery statute, the Government must prove a case of common law larceny, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b313-6\">\u201cAt the outset it will be noted that the Federal statute makes no mention of \u2018larceny;\u2019 it is couched in terms of \u2018steal and purloin,\u2019 and this is what was charged in the indictment. Nevertheless appellant confidently bases his contention on the dictum in United States v. Rogers (4 Cir.) 1961, 289 F. 2d 433, where the Court said at page 437, \u2018We accept the defendant\u2019s premise that paragraph (b) of the bank robbery act reaches only the offense of larceny as that crime has been defined by the common law.\u2019 With great deference to the views of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, we cannot agree with this conclusion. We believe that as to this matter the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in United States v. Turley, 352 U.S. 407, 77 S.Ct. 397, 1 L.Ed.2d 430, leads to a contrary result.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">We are of the opinion that the <em>Thaggard </em>decision is correct and is here controlling. The judgment of conviction is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"ALq\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-13\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(b): \u201cWhoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value exceeding $100 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, management, or possession of any bank, or any savings and loan association, shall be fined not more than $5,000 or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; or</p>\n<p id=\"AF\">\u201cWhoever takes and carries away, with intent to steal or purloin, any property or money or any other thing of value not exceeding $100 belonging to, or in the care, custody, control, \u2022 management, or possession of any bank, or any savings and loan association, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not more than one year, or both.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
