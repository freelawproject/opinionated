Appellants Tessel, Paturick <em>&amp; </em>Ostrau, Inc. (TPO) and Weiser, its vice-president, who asserted they were only intermediaries, moved to dismiss the complaint or, in the event that motion was denied, for an order pursuant to \u00a7 11(e) of the 1933 Act requiring plaintiff to provide an undertaking for defendants\u2019 costs, including rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>sonable attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Treating the first branch of the motion as one for summary judgment and recognizing \u201cthat some of the documents attached to the moving parties\u2019 papers strongly suggest that when the facts are all established, the trier of the facts may find that plaintiff has no meritorious claim against Weiser and TPO,\u201d Judge Tyler declined to dismiss the complaint. Stating that at this early stage he could not find that plaintiff\u2019s contentions respecting TPO and Weiser were without merit nor determine with certainty that plaintiff had sued them in bad faith, he denied the alternative motion for an undertaking. The appeal is from that denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">Although appellee had not challenged our jurisdiction, we raised this question at the argument as required. Appellants\u2019 counsel responded with citations of the relevant authorities, including, with appropriate candor, the unfavorable one of Bancroft Nav. Co. v. Chadade S.S. Co., 349 F.2d 527 (2 Cir. 1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-10\">It is familiar law that, despite the \u201cfinal decisions\u201d requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, orders denying applications for security are appealable when the court had considered itself without power to give the requested relief, Cohen v. Beneficial Industrial Loan Corp., 337 U.S. 541, 545-547, 69 S.Ct. 1221, 93 L.Ed. 1528 (1949), as are orders granting such applications when the appeal challenges the court\u2019s power. Fielding v. Allen, 181 F.2d 163 (2 Cir.), cert. denied, 340 U.S. 817, 71 S.Ct. 46, 95 L.Ed. 600 (1950); Chabot v. Nat\u2019l Securities and Research Corp., 290 F.2d 657 (2 Cir. 1961); Phelps v. Burnham, 327 F.2d 812 (2 Cir. 1964). On the other hand, in <em>Bancroft, </em>supra, drawing on a <em>caveat </em>in Mr. Justice Jackson\u2019s opinion in <em>Cohen, </em>337 U.S. at 547, 69 S.Ct. at 1226, we held that \u201can exercise of discretion as to the amount of security\u201d was not appealable. This case presents another variation\u2014a district judge\u2019s exercise of discretion so as to deny any security.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Is such a case attracted by <em>Bancroft, </em>whose language is broad enough to cover it,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or by <em>Cohen?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b991-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>There are good arguments either way. It can be said, in support of appealability, that when the only question concerns the amount of security, the chance of serious error is too small to warrant appellate scrutiny, especially in light of the possibility of reconsideration to which Mr. Justice Jackson adverted in <em>Cohen; </em>in contrast a complete refusal of security may reflect a wholly erroneous approach which the judge is unlikely to alter on a further application and the error will thus go uncorrected until too late. Against this it can be argued that the power-discretion dichotomy is the more meaningful one in this area. Whether a court has power to require an undertaking is an issue of law, and an appellate decision will settle the matter not simply for the case in hand but for many others \u2014 as was notably true with the important issue in <em>Cohen. </em>In contrast, where the question is the propriety of an exercise of discretion in denying security, the factual variations are so numerous that a judgment on appeal can do little to establish meaningful standards. Furthermore, since review would be limited to \u201cabuse\u201d of discretion, the likelihood of reversal is too negligible to justify the delay and expense incident to an appeal and the consequent burden on hardpressed appellate courts. Despite some current inroads on the final judgment rule, as to which see D. Currie, Federal Courts 228-31 (1968), or perhaps because of them, we think that, in these days of sharply mounting appellate dockets, see The Federal Judicial System, 90th Cong.2d Sess., Sen. Rep.No.1175, p. 21 and Table 2, the considerations against appealability have the greater weight, and that the \u201ccollateral order\u201d rule of <em>Cohen </em>should not be given an expansive reading, at least with respect to applications for security. Holding our <em>Bancroft </em>decision to be fairly applicable when a judge has exercised discretion to deny security, we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">Appellants\u2019 counsel requested at argument that if we should so decide, we should consider the appeal as a request for mandamus and issue the writ. While the request is appropriate enough, see Int\u2019l Prods. Corp. v. Koons, 325 F.2d 403, 407 (2 Cir. 1963), we do not \u2014 indeed may not \u2014 issue mandamus with respect to orders resting in the district court\u2019s discretion, save in most extraordinary circumstances not remotely presented here. See Will v. United States, 389 U.S. 90, 88 S.Ct. 269, 19 L.Ed.2d 305 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b990-5\">. The pertinent provision of \u00a7 11(e) is: \u201c * * * In any suit under this or any other section of this title the court may, in its discretion, require an undertaking for the payment of the costs of such suit, including reasonable attorney\u2019s fees, and if judgment shall be rendered against a party litigant, upon the motion of the other party litigant, such costs may be assessed in favor of such party litigant (whether or not such undertaking has been required) if the court believes the suit or the defense to have been without merit, in an amount sufficient to reimburse him for the reasonable expenses incurred by him, in connection with such suit, such costs to be taxed in the manner usually provided for taxing of costs in the court in which the suit was heard.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b990-8\">. Plaintiff did not dispute the judge\u2019s power to order security under \u00a7 11(e) of the 1933 Act, and the court assumed it had this. As the issue is likely to arise in other cases, we register some dubieties on that score. Since it is plain that the words \u201cof this title\u201d include only Title I of the 1933 Act, see 48 Stat. 74, \u00a7 11(e) has no application to an action solely under Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Exchange Act, McClure v. Borne Chemical Co., 292 F.2d 824, 836-837 (3 Cir.), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 939, 82 S.Ct. 382, 7 L.Ed.2d 339 (1961); see also Fischman v. Raytheon Mfg. Co., 188 F.2d 783 (2 Cir. 1951). Any power of the court to order an undertaking in this case must therefore derive from the reference in the complaint to \u00a7 17 (a) of the 1933 Act. For reasons developed in the writer\u2019s concurring opinion in SEC v. Texas Gulf Sulphur Co., 401 F.2d 833, 869 (2 Cir. 1968), there is serious doubt whether \u00a7 17 was intended to authorize the award of damages. What seems entirely clear is that, in an action alleging violations of both the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act, the requirement of an undertaking must be limited to claims under the former. Where, as here, only \u00a7 17(a) of the 1933 Act is invoked, the plaintiff would doubtless elect to proceed solely under Rule 10b-5. See 3 Loss, Securities Regulation 1837 &amp; n. 506 (1961), criticizing Dabney v. Alleghany Corp., 164 F.Supp. 28 (S.D.N.Y.1958).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b990-12\">. \u201cThe security cases considered on appeal by the Supreme Court before final decision on the merits have revolved about issues concerning the <em>power </em>of the district court to render its decision,</p>\n<p id=\"Atx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>as distinct from the propriety of its exercise of discretion.\u201d 349 IT.2d at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"AYOr\">* * * * *</p>\n<p id=\"AHg\">\u201cOn the other hand, this appeal is concerned solely with the proper exercise of the broad discretionary powers granted to the district court under Admiralty Rule 50.\u201d 349 F.2d at 529-530.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
