In 1966, after Mirra had exhausted all of his appellate remedies, the Supreme Court decided in Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 16 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966), that federal courts could not impose criminal contempt sentences of more than six months unless the defendant had been afforded a jury trial. We have applied this rule in two cases which were on direct appeal at the time <em>Cheff </em>was decided. United States v. Harris, 367 F.2d 826 (2d Cir. 1966); United States v. Ferrara, 377 F.2d 16 (2d Cir. 1967). Judge MacMahon denied on May 1, 1968, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>appellant\u2019s motion that his criminal contempt sentence be vacated. This appeal raises the question of whether the rule of <em>Cheff </em>should be applied retroactively to cases which had become final before it was rendered.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">We hold that <em>Cheff </em>should be applied retroactively since to do so will not unduly disrupt the administration of justice. Accordingly, we modify the order of June 26, 1962, to reduce appellant\u2019s criminal contempt sentence to a period of six months; appellant is granted a credit of six months against the term which he is now serving.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">The Supreme Court has established three criteria to be applied in determining whether a decision declaring new doctrines in the area of criminal law should be applied only prospectively:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-7\">\u201c(a) the purpose to be served by the new standards, (b) the extent of the reliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards, and (e) the effect on the administration of justice of a retroactive application of the new standards.\u201d Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 297, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 1970, 18 L.Ed.2d 1199 (1967).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Since this court in the <em>Harris </em>and <em>Ferrara </em>cases, supra, has already decided that <em>Cheff </em>should be applied retroactively to cases which were on direct appeal at the time it was decided, the real question before us is whether the criteria outlined in Stovall v. Denno should cause us to hold differently with respect to cases which had become final before <em>Cheff. </em>We note at the outset that the Supreme Court, in a case involving the application of a decision analogous to <em>Cheff, </em>saw \u201cno basis for a distinction between convictions that have become final and cases at various stages of trial and appeal.\u201d DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 635 n. 2, 88 S.Ct. 2093, 2096, 20 L.Ed.2d 1308 (1968). See generally United States v. Tarrago, 398 F.2d 621 (2d Cir. July 3, 1968) (Lumbard, C. J., concurring). We see no basis for such a distinction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">The rule in <em>Cheff </em>is not so essential to \u201cthe very integrity of the fact-finding process\u201d that its retroactive application is compelled. See generally Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 638, 85 S.Ct. 1731, 14 L.Ed.2d 601 (1965); cf. DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 634-635, 88 S.Ct. 2093 (1968). Thus we must consider the other two criteria established by the Court, those relating to reliance upon the old rule and to the possible disruptive effect of the retroactive application of the new rule. Certainly there can be no distinction between this case and <em>Harris </em>and <em>Ferrara </em>on grounds of reliance. The sentences in both of those cases were imposed before the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Cheff, </em>as is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We come to the criteria which has proven decisive in all Supreme Court decisions giving only prospective effect to a new criminal law standard: Will the retroactive application of <em>Cheff </em>\u201cseriously disrupt the administration of our criminal laws\u201d ? Johnson v. State of New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 731, 86 S.Ct. 1772, 1780, 16 L.Ed.2d 882 (1966). The answer to this question inheres largely in the types of remedies available to a court to effectuate retroactive application. In cases such as Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618, 85 S.Ct. 1731 (1965), Johnson v. New Jersey, 384 U.S. 719, 86 S.Ct. 1772 (1966), and Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967 (1967), the Supreme Court could have applied a rule retroactively only at the cost of invalidating large numbers of criminal convictions. In each of these instances it would have been necessary to retry hundreds of prisoners despite the possible loss of witnesses and evidence decisive in the original trials; failing the necessary evidence they would have been released. Prospective application was virtually compelled by these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">The same was true with respect to DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631, 88 S.Ct. 2093 (1968). In that case the court refused to apply retroactively Bloom v. State of Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"890\">*890</page-number>88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 1522 (1968), which held that the constitutional right to a jury trial extends to both federal <em>and </em>state trials for serious criminal contempts. Retroactive application of <em>Bloom, </em>the court noted, would involve \u201cinvalidating all serious contempt convictions,\u201d thus causing substantial \u201cadverse effects on the administration of justice * * * \u201d 392 U.S. at 635, 88 S.Ct. at 2096.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">The situation of those who received federal contempt sentences, without a jury trial, prior to Cheff v. Schnackenberg stands upon a very different footing. The court\u2019s rule in <em>Cheff </em>was decided \u201cin the exercise of the Court\u2019s supervisory power and under the peculiar power of the federal courts to revise sentences in contempt cases * * * \u201d 384 U.S. at 380, 86 S.Ct. at 1526. The court carefully concluded its opinion with this passage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-5\">\u201cNothing we have said, however, restricts the power of a reviewing court, in appropriate circumstances, to revise sentences in contempt cases tried with or without juries.\u201d 384 U.S. at 380, 86 S.Ct. at 1526.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">Thus we can apply <em>Cheff </em>retroactively in a manner which will not unduly disrupt the administration of justice. Mirra\u2019s sentence can be reduced by a period of six months to bring it into conformity with the holding of <em>Cheff. </em>This resolution does not invalidate appellant\u2019s conviction, and therefore does not require that a trial be held.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">An argument can be made that this appeal is moot because technically appellant already has served his contempt sentence and is now in prison pursuant to a consecutive 20 year sentence for conspiracy. But it is apparent that the last six months appellant serves in prison will be the result of the excessive contempt sentence imposed upon him. We offend no notions of mootness by relieving appellant from the continuing \u201cdisabilities and burdens\u201d which \u201cflow\u201d from the imposition of this unlawful sentence. Fiswick v. United States, 329 U.S. 211, 220, 67 S.Ct. 224, 91 L.Ed. 196 (1946); see Carafas v. LaVallee, 391 U.S. 234, 88 S.Ct. 1556, 20 L.Ed.2d 554 (May 20, 1968); United States v. Morgan, 346 U.S. 502, 512-513, 74 S.Ct. 247, 98 L.Ed. 248 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">The order of the district court is modified to reduce the term of appellant\u2019s criminal contempt sentence from one year to six months. The United States Attorney is directed to notify the appropriate officials in the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Prisons that Anthony Mirra is to be credited with a period of six months against the sentence for conspiracy which he is presently serving.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
