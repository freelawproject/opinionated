LEWIS, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AHH\">After a full evidentiary hearing appellant Williams was convicted on January 27, 1967, of criminal contempt by the District Court for the District of Colorado for wilful disobedience of a permanent injunction issued by that court on a final judgment entered by default in 1963. Williams appeals, contending that his acts premising the contempt conviction were not a violation of the injunction, that the evidence is insufficient to support a finding that he wilfully violated the terms of the injunction, and that the sentence imposed by the trial court was too harsh. We find no merit to any of these contentions and affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">During February 1963, the Securities and Exchange Commission commenced a civil action against Williams in Colorado seeking to enjoin violations of the registration requirements, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77e(a) and (c) and the anti-fraud provisions, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a), of the Securities Act of 1933. Premised on the allegations of the complaint that Williams was engaged by means of interstate commerce in the selling and offering for sale of unregistered investment contracts of Black Angus Steak Houses, Inc., a Colorado corporation, further allegations that Williams had made and was making specific and untrue representations of material facts pertaining to such contracts, and additional and supplemental representations to the Colorado court that Williams was engaged in a similar operation in Missouri, that court entered a permanent injunction couched in the terms of the Commission\u2019s complaint and set out in full in Appendix A.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In June 1966, Williams formed a Texas corporation called Black Angus Steak Houses, Inc. and sold unregistered investment contracts in that company through solicitations placed in newspapers. Through funds so received, Williams established a pilot restaurant in Dallas, Texas (as he had done earlier in his Colorado operations at Aurora, Colorado) and then proceeded with promotions of additional steak houses in Texas, New Mexico, Louisiana, Minnesota, Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri. The simple essence of Williams\u2019 operations consisted of establishing and operating a single restaurant, paying to contract investors a royalty return regardless of the profit or loss incurred by the restaurant, and then using the investors as references for further promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">Appellant concedes that the Colorado injunction is not subject to a geographical limitation and that the Texas operation was \u201calmost identical in its plan and operation\u201d and would be equally violative of this Securities Act. In this posture it is difficult to term appellant\u2019s argument that the injunction is inoperative from lack of specificity<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as more than self-denying. It is, of course, well accepted that an injunction must be worded in such specific terms and with such detail as to put the party enjoined on notice of precisely what he is called upon to do or refrain from doing. It cannot be so general as to leave the party open to the hazard of conducting business in the mistaken belief that it is not prohibited by the injunction and thus make him vulnerable to prosecution for contempt. B &amp; C <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>Truck Leasing, Inc. v. I. C. C., 10 Cir., 283 F.2d 163. But here appellant, using the same corporate name, the same unlawful method of raising money, and reciting the same untruths to investors, was not trapped by an injunctive generality. It was as though the Colorado fraud had been a dress rehearsal for the Texas fraud which gave rise to the contempt conviction. Under these circumstances we cannot say that the phrase \u201cany other securities\u201d as used in the injunction is vague when projected against appellant\u2019s particularized conduct or that the appellant was not fairly put on notice that his acts were in violation of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">Nor do we see\u2019 any reason to upset the trial court\u2019s finding that there was sufficient evidence to support a finding of wilful disobedience. The appellant necessarily knew he was selling securities without registration in contravention of the-securities laws as well as the injunction, He also necessarily knew that the untruths he was promulgating concerning the success of the Colorado venture and the so-called matching funds were in direct violation of the injunction. There is evidence in the record that sales of investments were made after appellant was warned by a member of the staff of the Commission that continued sale of securities was violative of the injunction. The trial court found a lack of innocence or mistake noting the overall fraudulent nature of the scheme. The appellant had referred to the investors as \u201csuckers\u201d and to the whole operation as a way to \u201csteal\u201d and do it \u201clegally.\u201d The evidence is ample to support the finding of wilfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">Finally we find that the imposition of concurrent six-month sentences was not unreasonable under the circumstances. Discretion is properly placed in the trial judge and absent abuse will not be disturbed here. The Supreme Court has limited the opportunity for abuse and given a large measure of protection to defendants in this type of case by holding that \u201csentences exceeding six months for criminal contempt may not be imposed by federal courts absent a jury trial or waiver thereof.\u201d Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373, 380, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 1526, 16 L.Ed.2d 629. In light of the trial court\u2019s findings, which we affirm, on the question of wilfulness we find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO</p>\n<p id=\"AyK\">CIVIL ACTION File No. 7878</p>\n<p id=\"b103-12\">SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COM-' MISSION, Plaintiff, v.
