See NLRB v. Exchange Parts Co. (5 Cir. 1965) 339 F.2d 829. Such failure warranted the Board\u2019s finding a violation of Section 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (5) of the National Labor Relations Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">There is no merit in the respondent\u2019s contention that the duty to bargain ceased when a subsequent decertification petition was filed. The Board concluded that the unfair labor practice had taken place long before the filing of such petition. We conclude that the record fully supports this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-16\">Finally, we do not believe the order entered by the Board was too broad in requiring respondent to cease and desist from \u201cin any like or related manner interfering with, restraining or coercing its employees in the exercise of their right to self-organization.\u201d This order does not have the defects contained in the order in NLRB v. Express Publishing Company, 312 U.S. 426, 61 S.Ct. 693, 85 L.Ed. 930. Rather it falls within the language of the Court\u2019s conclusion that it was appropriate to restrain the practice and \u201cother like or related unlawful acts.\u201d See 312 U.S. 426, 436, 61 S.Ct. 693, 700.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-17\">The Order will be enforced.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
