Mason appeals from a judgment of conviction entered in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri on a jury verdict of guilty of attempting by intimidation to take funds in the possession of a bank, the deposits of which were insured by the FDIC, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a). Mason was sentenced to five years imprisonment under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208(a) (2). A timely appeal was taken. Mason does not deny the act charged but claims the government failed to prove him mentally competent to be answerable for the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-21\">On October 14, 1966, at about 4:10 p. m., Mason entered the Tower Banking Center of the Commerce Trust Company, Kansas City, Missouri, went to a writing counter and composed a note on a deposit slip.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He then approached a teller window and handed the note to teller Ann Hudson, who was speaking on the telephone. Mrs. Hudson read the note and continued to speak on the telephone while making a hand signal beneath the level of the tellers\u2019 counter to guard Thomas Pierce, whom she observed approaching from the vicinity of the vault to her rear. Mason, his right hand tucked in his shirt, said to Mrs. Hudson, \u201cGet off that \u2019phone or I will kill you.\u201d Meanwhile, the teller next to Mrs. Hudson leaned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>over and glanced at the note, just as the guard came up. The teller handed the note to the guard who immediately proceeded around the tellers\u2019 counter and grabbed Mason\u2019s arms from behind. Mason\u2019s attention had been directed to Mrs. Hudson and he was surprised by the guard\u2019s action in apprehending him from the rear.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The guard pulled Mason away from the tellers\u2019 counter and took him a short distance to a room where officers of the Bank conduct public business. For the first and only time Mason put up a show of resistance by twisting his upper body. The guard quickly subdued Mason, seated him in a chair, and searched him. Mason was not armed. Pierce then spoke to Mason for the first time asking him, \u201cWhat in the world made you do a thing like this?\u201d Mason replied, \u201cI must be crazy.\u201d Police officers then appeared and Officer Jaco took charge of Mason by handcuffing him and escorting him to a police car. Two FBI Agents, Harmon and Curran, joined Officer Jaco in the police car, advised Mason of his constitutional rights, and the four made the three-minute ride to the police station.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">Only one issue is raised by Mason on appeal. He contends that the District Court erred in overruling his motion for a directed judgment of acquittal at the close of all the evidence, as his criminal responsibility at the time of the crime was not proved beyond a reasonable doubt. In an attempt to establish a lack of criminal responsibility in the trial court, the defense called four witnesses who testified as to Mason\u2019s mental condition on October 14, 1966: the defendant Mason; Thomas Pierce, the Bank guard; Dr. August Kinzel of the United States Medical Center for Federal Prisoners at Springfield, Missouri; and Dr. Richard Childs, a psychiatrist in private practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Mason testified that after his discharge from the armed forces in 1945 he began drinking heavily and in time became addicted to alcohol, resulting in frequent unemployment and hospitalization in psychiatric wards some 25 to 30 times. For the past seven years he has been taking Desbutal and he has also used Doriden. Prescriptions for these barbiturates, which were refillable at several drug stores, were introduced. Mason recalled three suicide attempts in the past several years, one about a week before the robbery attempt. Four or five days before the robbery attempt, he fell down the stairs at his hotel; he was drinking and taking drugs at the time. On October 11, 1966, three days before the robbery attempt, he procured 180 Librium capsules at the Psychiatric Receiving Center where he was being treated as an out-patient. The morning of October 14, 1966, he thought he had taken all of the drugs in his possession, taking the last of his supply one or two days before; his last drink prior to the robbery attempt was the evening of October 13. Sometime between 10:00 a. m. and 12:00 noon on October 14, Mason telephoned his place of employment and learned of his discharge. He had about 25 or 30 cents in his possession. Mason claimed his memory of the robbery attempt was fragmented \u2014 he did not remember entering the Bank, but remembered writing a note and handing it to a woman. He felt that what he was doing was wrong, but he could not stop. He remembered that he had denied taking barbiturates when he was asked if he took them by FBI Agent Curran; he explained that a sense of shame had motivated his denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">Dr. Kinzel first saw Mason on November 23, 1966, some five weeks after the <em>robbery </em>attempt, and examined Mason on four occasions from that date to March 2, 1967; total time spent with Mason was about three and one-half hours. Dr. Kinzel\u2019s diagnosis of Mason was that he suffered a \u201cpsychotic depressive reaction\u201d and \u201cacute brain syndrome,\u201d and that Mason had been psychotic for the past six or seven years, his condition being most severe in the year immediately preceding the attempted robbery. Dr. Kinzel was of the opin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>ion that Mason was largely unaware of what he was doing, was not capable of knowing what he was doing, and was unable to control his actions at the time of the robbery attempt. Dr. Kinzel\u2019s diagnosis and opinion were based primarily upon information provided by Mason himself as to his alcohol and drug problems and his lack of memory of the events of October 14, 1966; also considered were the robbery note and facts obtained from a pre-.sentence report and a report from a V. A. hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Dr. Childs saw Mason for about 90 minutes on May 5, 1967, seven months after the robbery attempt and three days before the trial commenced. Dr. Childs\u2019 diagnosis and opinion concurred in that rendered by Dr. Kinzel. Dr. Childs relied solely on what was related to him by Mason in reaching his conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">The Bank guard, Pierce, told of his taking Mason by surprise, Mason\u2019s lack of resistance, and the brief conversation he had with Mason. On cross-examination, Pierce said Mason appeared to be alert, walked steadily, spoke without slurring, the appearance of his eyes was not red, watery or glazed, and no odor of alcohol was detected. Pierce stated that he had considerable experience in the Bank during the past seven years with persons under the influence of drugs or alcohol and, in his opinion, Mason did not appear to be under the influence of either.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">The government introduced the testimony of 11 lay witnesses and two psychiatrists to show that Mason was legally sane at the time of the commission of the offense. The lay witnesses all had occasion to observe and talk with Mason for a period of time on the day of the attempted robbery, or on the morning following.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">James Wilson, Mason\u2019s immediate supervisor at his place of employment, was called by Mason between 10:00 a. m. and 12:00 noon on October 14, and upon inquiry told Mason that he no longer had a job. Mason told Wilson, \u201cI don\u2019t know what I am going to do. I need the job bad.\u201d Wilson stated that Mason\u2019s voice sounded normal, as compared with other telephone conversations with Mason, and as contrasted with a telephone conversation when Wilson suspected Mason had been drinking.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">Teller Ann Hudson testified that Mason did not appear to be confused or sleepy, his eyes were not blood shot, or dilated and he had no difficulty focusing, his walk was normal, and he did not smell of alcohol.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Jim Fitzgerald, an assistant cashier at the Bank, observed Mason for 10 to 15 minutes following the robbery attempt and stated that Mason did not appear to be confused or sleepy, sat erectly in a chair and did not stagger when he walked.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">Officers Jaco, Klein, and Hockett of the Kansas City, Missouri Police Department, and Special Agents Harmon and Curran of the FBI all saw and talked with Mason immediately following the robbery attempt. To them, Mason\u2019s answers to questions were responsive, he did not appear to be sleepy or confused, and he gave no indication of having trouble remembering. His speech was deliberate but not slurred. He walked erectly without hesitation, and he had no trouble keeping his balance and did not require assistance when he got out of the police car at the station, even though his hands were handcuffed behind him. Officer Klein was in the courtroom during Mason\u2019s testimony and observed that Mason\u2019s appearance and actions, his demeanor and manner of speech were the same as when Mason was being interviewed immediately after the attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-15\">United States Deputy Marshal Guthridge, United States Commissioner Cisel and Assistant United States Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Wiggins testified as to their observations of Mason on the morning of October 15, 1966, at the hearing before the Commissioner. Their testimony was the same as the other lay witnesses with regard to Mason\u2019s appearance, speech and demeanor. Guthridge remembered Mason as crying at times; Wiggins and Cisel did not. Guthridge later returned Mason from the Federal Medical Center and observed that Mason seemed more extroverted and \u201crational\u201d than at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-4\">Dr. Edward Rinck is Clinical Director of the State Hospital at Nevada, Missouri, where Mason was admitted on February 22, 1962 for treatment of alcoholism. Dr. Rinck saw and treated Mason on numerous occasions at his initial admission and subsequent admissions in intervening years until Mason transferred to the V. A. Hospital at Wadsworth in January 1966. Dr. Rinck\u2019s diagnosis of Mason was \u201csociopathic personality, alcholism addiction.\u201d In Dr. Rinck\u2019s opinion, Mason was never found to be psychotic \u2014 that is, not in contact with reality \u2014 except on one occasion when he had delirium tremens.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Dr. Rinck believed that in order to give a valid diagnosis of a person\u2019s mental condition at the time of an offense a psychiatrist would need to see him immediately before and after the commission of the offense \u2014 otherwise any opinion would be only an educated guess.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">Dr. Robert Jones, a resident psychiatrist at the Psychiatric Receiving Center since July 1, 1966, first saw Mason on July 21, 1966, when he was admitted with delirium tremens and continued to see and treat Mason on a daily basis through August 17, 1966. Dr. Jones\u2019 diagnosis of Mason was \u201cdepressive reaction and alcoholism.\u201d Dr. Jones saw Mason on an outpatient basis on August 23, September 27 and October 11, 1966, the last date just three days before the robbery attempt. Dr. Jones was of the opinion that as of October 11, Mason could control his actions (except for his disposition toward alcohol) and would know if an act he committed was wrong, as Mason was in contact with reality and gave no sign of delusional thinking. As was Dr. Rinck, Dr. Jones was of the opinion that an attempt to diagnose Mason\u2019s mental condition on October 14, 1966, would be speculative without an opportunity to observe him on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-13\">The crux of Mason\u2019s argument is that the testimony of the two psychiatrists for the defense, that Mason was incapable of understanding the nature of his criminal act at the time of its commission, stood uncontradicted and commanded a directed judgment of acquittal. Mason points to the testimony of the two psychiatrists for the government and the fact that neither expressly stated an opinion that Mason was capable of understanding the nature of his act at the time of its commission. Mason contends that lay witnesses for the government did not, and could not, express a conclusion as to his mental condition at the time of the event and that except for Wilson, Mason\u2019s superior at his place of work, none of the lay witnesses had ever seen him before the day of the crime; hence, their testimony is without value in determining Mason\u2019s criminal responsibility. McKenzie v. United States, 266 F.2d 524 (10 Cir. 1959).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-14\">The government acknowledges it had the obligation to prove Mason\u2019s criminal responsibility at the time of the commission of the offense once the issue of insanity had been placed before the trial court. Kaufman v. United States, 350 F.2d 408, 409-410 (8 Cir. 1965), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>cert. denied 383 U.S. 951, 86 S.Ct. 1211, 16 L.Ed.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-4\">We believe that the government offered substantial evidence from which the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mason had the requisite criminal responsibility at the time of the attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">An excellent analysis of controlling principles is found in Mims v. United States, 375 F.2d 135, 143-144 (5 Cir. 1967):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">\u201cThe sound rule is that the issue of insanity, when raised as a defense in a criminal case, should be determined by the jury from all the evidence, rather than from the opinions of experts alone, subject to the control that the court may always set aside an unreasonable verdict. The real value of expert testimony in these cases is \u2018in the explanation of the disease and its dynamics, that is, how it occurred, developed, and affected the mental and emotional processes of the defendant; it does not lie in [the] mere expression of conclusion.\u2019 However, even though expert opinion evidence is generally advisory in nature, it cannot be arbitrarily ignored.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-7\">\u201c* * * [I] n cases involving opinions of medical experts, the probative force of that character of testimony is lessened where it is predicated on subjective symptoms, or where it is based on narrative statements to the expert as to past events not in evidence at the trial. In some cases, the cross-examination of the expert may be such as to justify the trier of facts in not being convinced by him. * * * [D]epending on the particular facts of each case, [these factors may] make a jury issue as to the credibility and weight to be given to the expert testimony; and in determining whether such issue is raised, due consideration must be given to the fact that the trier of facts has the opportunity to observe the witness if he testifies in person.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b791-13\">In light of these fundamental principles, Mason\u2019s argument that the testimony offered in his behalf was conclusive is not well taken. While Mason\u2019s experts were certainly entitled to express opinions as to his criminal responsibility, their opinions were not binding on the jury. Their diagnoses that Mason was psychotic (after a cumulative five interviews totaling 300 minutes) were largely based on subjective factors supplied by Mason and were contradicted by both Dr. Rinck, who had seen Mason over a six-to-seven year period and was the most experienced psychiatrist who testified, and Dr. Jones,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> who saw Mason frequently in the weeks immediately prior to the robbery attempt and expressed the opinion that Mason was not psychotic only three days before the robbery attempt. While both Dr. Rinck and Dr. Jones candidly disclaimed the ability to render a diagnosis of an individual\u2019s mental condition on a particular day without the opportunity of observing and interviewing that individual on that day, such a disclaimer did not render their opinion evidence \u201cwithout value\u201d as contended by Mason. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>Indeed, the real value of expert opinion does not lie in the mere expression of a conclusion, but in the explanation of a mental condition \u2014 its onset, development and manifestations. <em>Mims, </em>supra. Further, the acknowledgment of Dr. Rinck and Dr. Jones of the limitations of their profession could have been considered by the jury in weighing the opinions of Mason\u2019s experts, who formed their opinions some five weeks (Dr. Kinzel) and seven months (Dr. Childs) after the robbery attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-4\">In addition, the opinions of the government\u2019s experts were based on interviews and examinations of Mason conducted before the robbery attempt; the opinions of defendant\u2019s experts were based primarily on narrative statements given by Mason after he was charged with the attempted robbery. The jury could properly consider the interest that Mason had in relating, at a time when a motive to mislead might be present, the subjective symptoms that formed a large part of the factual assumptions on which the defendant\u2019s experts\u2019 opinions were based.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">The testimony of the lay witnesses for the government was properly limited to observations gleaned in their contact with Mason. No lay witness stated a conclusion or an opinion as to whether Mason was sane or insane. Their testimony was of probative value in helping the jury determine Mason\u2019s criminal responsibility on October 14, 1966. The collective thrust of their testimony indicated that Mason looked and behaved as a person deserving of pity, but possessing the ability to control his actions and to distinguish right from wrong. While the opportunity of lay witnesses to observe Mason was relatively brief, this factor goes to the weight of the evidence, not to its admissibility. See, <em>Kmifman, </em>supra, at 415 of 350 F.2d. Lack of an opportunity for prolonged observation can be brought out on cross-examination and argued before the jury. As summarized in 1 Conrad, Modem Trial Evidence \u00a7 123, pp. 124-125 (1956):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-9\">\u201cOn a plea of insanity in a criminal case, relevant evidence may be interposed to sustain such plea, where intent is an issue. Much latitude is allowed in the admission of such evidence, both on behalf of the state and defendant. * * * The court will</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-10\">allow all evidence relating to mental condition if it has a tendency to throw light on the mental condition of the defendant at the time of the crime for which he is charged.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"pAu1\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-12\">\u201cThe general rule, sustained by most of the cases, seems to hold that any and all acts, conduct, declarations, spoken words, appearance, and manner of speech on the part of the person involved are relevant * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-13\">Mason misreads McKenzie, supra, for the rule that the observations of lay witnesses are without value unless they have \u201chad a prolonged and frequent opportunity to observe the subject.\u201d The Court in McKenzie is not talking about lay witnesses testifying to factual observations of conduct, actions, or behavior of a person, but is concerned with lay witnesses testifying to the conclusions of sanity or mental competency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, McKenzie is consistent with the recognized general principles that may be succinctly stated as follows: A lay witness can and should relate specific ob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>jective observations of a person\u2019s conduct, condition or behavior<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> though such a witness may express an opinion on the sanity issue where he has been qualified by sufficient association with and opportunity to observe the subject.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The factual evidence adduced from the lay witnesses in this case was properly received.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-4\">Mason deems himself in a more advantageous position before the law than the defendants in <em>McKenzie, </em>supra, and United States v. Westerhausen, 283 F.2d 844 (7 Cir. 1960). The evidence in those cases as we noted in <em>Dusky, </em>supra, at 757 of 295 F.2d, \u201c* * * seems so overwhelming in favor of the defense position that we regard as almost inevitable the courts\u2019 conclusions that the insanity issue there was not submissible.\u201d Accord, <em>Kaufman, </em>supra, at 414 of 350 F.2d. The evidence in this case is far from \u201coverwhelming\u201d for the defense. As Judge Blackmun recognized in <em>Dusky, </em>supra, at 754 of 295 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">\u201c * * * the nature and quantum of the evidence which the government must produce to meet its burden so as to justify the submission of the insanity issue * * * varies with the nature and quantum of the evidence indicating mental illness.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">The evidence is conflicting at best and the government produced substantial-evidence showing Mason mentally competent so as to be answerable for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-19\">Mason does not question the court\u2019s finding him mentally competent to stand trial. He has never been adjudicated mentally incompetent, though he has been in a number of hospitals because of his alcoholic addiction. He is not a person of limited intelligence and had an indicated I. Q. of 120. The evidence is persuasive that he was oriented as to time and place, and he knowingly and willfully conceived and endeavored to carry out his desperate attempt to secure funds. His trouble with alcohol addiction and drugs would cause him to be depressed, but this would not necessarily make him a psychotic personality, disoriented in time and place and unaware of his actions and the consequences flowing from his anti-social behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-11\">On the evidence adduced at the trial of this case, the trial court properly submitted the issue of Mason\u2019s insanity to the jury, and the jury could properly find that the government had proved Mason\u2019s criminal responsibility at the time of the attempted robbery beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b787-13\">.

Agent Rose of the FBI testified that he interrogated Mrs. Hudson shortly after the robbery attempt, and Mrs. Hudson said, \u201cI thought the man was disturbed in some way.\u201d and \u201cThe man said he was desperate.\u201d On cross-examination, Mrs. Hudson denied telling Rose that she thought Mason to be mentally sick and denied that Mason said, \u201cI am desperate.\u201d to her.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b790-6\">. Mason stipulated that he was not suffering from delirium tremens at the time of the attempted robbery.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b790-8\">. In <em>McKenzie </em>it is stated at 527 of 266 F.2d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-10\">\u201cThe substance of the evidence adduced by these [non-expert] witnesses was that they observed nothing unusual or abnormal about the defendant immediately before and after the alleged crime.
