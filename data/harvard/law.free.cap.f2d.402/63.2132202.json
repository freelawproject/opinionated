We reverse for a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-13\">Appellant is serving two consecutive ten-year sentences in a Florida penitentiary for escape and for possession of a weapon. He alleges coercion of a plea of guilty and ineffective assistance of counsel, contending that court-appointed counsel, whom he saw only for a few minutes four days before trial and a few minutes prior to trial, coerced him into pleading guilty, assuring him that a deal had been made for shorter sentences. As proof of the deal petitioner offers a certified copy of a portion of a letter written by the attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-14\">The appellant\u2019s allegations are sufficient on their face to raise a serious issue, the determination of which requires a hearing. Machibroda v. United States, 368 U.S. 487, 82 S.Ct. 510, 7 L.Ed.2d 473 (1962); Carpenter v. Wainwright, 5 Cir. 1967, 372 F.2d 940; Bell v. State of Alabama, 5 Cir. 1966, 367 F.2d 243.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-15\">If appellant\u2019s allegations as to what occurred at his arraignment and sentence are found to be true, he is entitled to have the writ granted and his conviction set aside. Holloway v. Dutton, 5 Cir., 1968, 396 F.2d 127; Roberts v. Dutton, 5 Cir. 1966, 368 F.2d 465; Carpenter v.
