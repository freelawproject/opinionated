On the basis of conflicting testimony, the Board found some relatively minimal violations by the employer of \u00a7 8(a) (1) of the Act preceding the election, but they were not so pervasive as to be beyond the effective corrective process of a cease and desist order so as to assure a completely reliable reflection of the employees\u2019 wishes in a second election.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">In a number of recent cases, altogether comparable, we have declined enforcement of bargaining orders where there was nothing in the circumstances to overcome an employer\u2019s assertion of good faith doubt of the union\u2019s majority claim, when the union\u2019s claim was based entirely upon a card count.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b554-17\">We decline enforcement of the bargaining order. Since in the disputed evidence, there is support for the Board\u2019s findings of violations of \u00a7 8(a) (1), its order, insofar as it proscribes such violations, will be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-18\">Enforced in part; enforcement denied in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> General Steel Prods., Inc. v.
