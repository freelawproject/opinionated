They are represented by the same attorney and the several appeals present a common question: whether citizens of the Philippines, admitted as non-immigrants <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for further training in medical professions, are entitled, because the Philippine government has released them from any obligation to return to that country, to a change of status to permanent residents without returning to the Philippines \u201cfor an aggregate of at least two years\u201d as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b842-22\">Petitioners agree that the basic issue has been decided against them by this court in Carriaga v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 368 F.2d 337 (7th Cir. 1966), but they ask us to \u201ctake another look\u201d at the issue, in the light of the legislative history of the Exchange Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-23\">We are not persuaded that we should not follow Carriaga. In Tuazon v. Immigration and Naturalization Service, 389 F.2d 363 (7th Cir., January 30, 1968), this court applied <em>Carriaga </em>to reject the precise contention made here based on the Philippine government release and upon legislative history. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>court there reasoned that the language of the requirement in Sec. 1182(e) was so clear that it \u201c[was] not susceptible of interpretation by resort to legislative history or otherwise.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b843-4\">We hold, on authority of <em>Carriaga </em>and <em>Tuazon, </em>that the Special Inquiry Officer and Board of Appeals did not err in denying petitioners\u2019 applications for adjustment of status on the ground that they had not complied with 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">The petitions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-14\">.
