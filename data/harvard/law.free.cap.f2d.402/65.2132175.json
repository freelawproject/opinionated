Lee applied for, and was issued an automobile liability policy. In the application Lee was asked if he had any physical defects, and he answered \u201cno.\u201d He has suffered from birth with epilepsy. On February 22, 1963, he was involved in an automobile accident with the appellants, Brook Jones and her husband Fred Jones. State Farm, plaintiff-appellee, filed suit for a declaration that its policy issued to Lee had been properly rescinded and that it owed no obligation to Lee or any of his judgment creditors. Lee defaulted, and appellants moved for judgment on the pleadings, which was granted by the district court. On appeal, this Court reversed and remanded for trial. 343 F.2d <em>55. </em>On remand the district court entered judgment on a jury finding for appellee. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">In the first appeal, this Court held that State Farm would be entitled to rescind the insurance policy if Lee fraudulently misrepresented or fraudulently concealed a material fact in his application for the insurance policy. The appellants argued that the \u201cdeclarations\u201d provision of the policy was an integration of the parties\u2019 agreement, and since the application was not made part of the policy, there could be no fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment as a matter of law. This Court, however, reasoned that inasmuch as the alleged fraud induced the contract of insurance, the integration clause did not preclude appellee from asserting claims of fraudulent misrepresentations and fraudulent concealment by the insured in the application. Thus this Court remanded the case to the district court to determine whether Lee\u2019s answer of \u201cno\u201d to the question of physical defects constituted fraudulent misrepresentation or fraudulent concealment.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-8\">At the second trial, the court permitted testimony by one of State Farm\u2019s underwriters as to the meaning of \u201cphysical defects\u201d. He testified that in the insurance industry epilepsy is considered a physical defect. Appellants argue that the court committed prejudicial error by permitting the testimony of the insurance underwriter since there was no evidence in the record to indicate that the agent explained the industry meaning of \u201cphysical defects\u201d to Lee at the time he filled out the application. Appellants\u2019 argument is that the relevant inquiry is the meaning Lee attached to \u201cphysical defects\u201d, making the underwriter\u2019s interpretation irrelevant. Although the relevant inquiry is the interpretation that Lee gave the term \u201cphysical defects\u201d, the admission of this testimony did not constitute prejudicial error under the controlling substantive law. In Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Cunningham, S.D. Fla.1932, 54 F.2d 927, rev\u2019d on other grounds, 5th Cir. 1933, 65 F.2d 909, the court stated the applicable Florida law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">[T]he word \u201cillness\u201d must be considered in the light of the ordinary conception and understanding of that term as used in applications for life insurance, as well as in the light of legal principles defining the term, and not in the light of abstract, scientific technical definitions. Nor is the matter to be determined solely upon the opinions of medical experts, such as were given in evidence here, though the latter will be accorded their appropriate weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-10\">54 F.2d at 930. Moreover, the court instructed the jury that the words used on an application for insurance have their usual and ordinary meaning, thereby assuring that the underwriter\u2019s testimony was not given undue weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Appellants argue secondly that the district court erred in failing to grant their motion for a directed verdict on the ground that as a matter of law Lee\u2019s answer to the question was truthful because no reasonable man would have interpreted \u201cphysical defects\u201d to include epilepsy. We believe, however, that fair-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>minded men could reasonably differ as to whether the ordinary concept of \u201cphysical defect\u201d includes epilepsy. Where reasonable men could differ on the conclusion to be reached from the evidence presented, resolution is properly left to the jury. Cater v. Gordon Transport, Inc., 5th Cir. 1968, 390 F.2d 44; Helene Curtis Industries, Inc. v. Pruitt, 5th Cir. 1967, 385 F.2d 841, cert. denied, 1968, 391 U.S. 913, 88 S.Ct. 1806, 20 L.Ed.2d 652; cf. Jones v. Chaney &amp; James Construction Co., 5th Cir. 1968, 399 F.2d 84.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Appellants insist, however, that the Sixth Circuit decision in Harris v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., 6th Cir. 1956, 232 F.2d 532, is decisive in this case on the question of whether or not epilepsy is a physical defect. In <em>Harris </em>the district court, sitting without a jury, had found that the insured had fraudulently answered \u201cno\u201d when asked whether he had any physical defects because he had epilepsy- The court of appeals reversed on the ground that the uneontradicted medical testimony showed that epilepsy is not a physical defect but rather a disease. Appellants maintain that the medical testimony in this case is likewise undisputed that epilepsy is not a physical defect but rather a disease and therefore that the verdict should have been directed in their favor. But medical testimony, like that of the underwriters, even if undisputed, could not be conclusive in this case because the jury\u2019s task was to determine the <em>ordinary meaning </em>of \u201cphysical defects.\u201d If reasonable men could differ, and we think they could, on the question whether the ordinary concept of \u201cphysical defect\u201d includes epilepsy, they could differ regardless of the interpretation placed on the term by doctors or underwriters. We therefore decline to follow <em>Harris </em>and, accordingly, reject appellants\u2019 contention that they were entitled to a directed verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">Finally, appellants complain that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant their requested instruction number seven, which would have charged the jury that if the insured answered all of the questions <em>truthfully, </em>he would be under no further duty of disclosure. The court instructed that \u201ca false representation, material to the risk, made with a conscious intent to deceive, voids the policy.\u201d The court then charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ\">the burden of proof is on the Plaintiff to prove not only that the statement in the application by Homer H. Lee that he had no physical defect was false, <em>or that he concealed from the Plaintiff\u2019s agent that he had epilepsy </em>at the time of the taking of said written application, but the burden is also upon the Plaintiff to prove by the preponderance of the evidence that Homer H. Lee\u2019s intention was to defraud the insurance company. (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">Under these instructions, the jury found for the insurance company and against appellants. These instructions are sufficient to support a finding that the insurance company is entitled to rescind its contract of insurance under applicable Florida law. Section 627.01081 of the Florida Statutes, F.S.A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> provides that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>an insurance company is entitled to rescind the contract of insurance if misrepresentations, concealment of facts, or omissions are made fraudulently. Moreover, the instructions given by the district judge are in accordance with the opinion in the first appeal of this case. See State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Lee, 5th Cir. 1965, 343 F.2d 55, 59-60. Therefore, we find no prejudicial error in the refusal of the district judge to instruct the jury as requested by the appellants\u2019 instruction number seven.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b121-8\">. We note that Florida courts leave the question of misrepresentations in insurance policies to the jury where more than one reasonable inference is possible. In Lamm v. Prudential Ins. Co., 179 So. 2d 238, 239 (Fla.App.3d 1965) the court cited with approval 18 Fla.Jur. Insurance \u00a7 455:</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">In general, in suits on insurance contracts, if the evidence is susceptible of different inferences, the question of whether there has been misrepresentation, concealment, or a breach of warranty or condition, is one of fact, for resolution by the jury. Accordingly, where it is contended that the insured has misrepresented the condition of his health in applying for insurance * * and the evidence is not conclusive on the point, it is for the jury to resolve the question; and in so doing it is within their province to reject expert testimony and rely on lay evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ACi\">. 627.01081 Representations in applications</p>\n<p id=\"b121-18\">All statements and descriptions in any application for an insurance pol'cy or annuity contract, or in negotiations, therefor, by or in behalf of the insured or annuitant, shall be deemed to be representations and not warranties.
