Parks v. United States, 368 F.2d 781 (5th Cir. 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b890-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"836\">*836</page-number>The admission of appellant\u2019s signature without Miranda-type warnings was not error. Gilbert v. State of California, 388 U.S. 263, 87 S.Ct. 1951, 18 L.Ed.2d 1178 (1967); Schoenbrun v. United States [5th Cir., Oct. 1968], 403 F.2d 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-4\">The signatures of appellant, used for comparison purposes by the government\u2019s handwriting expert, were taken from fingerprint cards obtained in connection with unrelated offenses. However, there was no testimony in the presence of the jury of the nature of or existence of unrelated offenses, only of the fact that appellant\u2019s fingerprints had been taken by the Sheriff\u2019s Department of Dade County, Florida, and were on an identified fingerprint card. Identification of the second fingerprint card was made outside the presence of the jury. The signatures then were excised from both cards and these alone displayed to the jury. We find no reversible error in this procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
