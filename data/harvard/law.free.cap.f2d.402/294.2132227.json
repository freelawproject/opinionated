The district court, after a comprehensive evidentiary hearing, concluded that petitioner\u2019s proof fell short of the mark and denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-19\">The burden was on petitioner to establish his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence. Walker v. Johnston, 1941, 312 U.S. 275, 286, 61 S.Ct. 574, 85 L.Ed. 830; Williams v. Beto, 5 Cir., 1965, 354 F.2d 698, 704. Based on an examination of the evidence, we are of the firm view that the district court was correct. The relief was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
