In view thereof, and considering the differences between the marks when considered in the entireties, it is our opinion that their contemporaneous use is not likely to cause confusion or mistake or deceive. With due respect to the board\u2019s position we are unable to agree with either the reasoning or result it reaches.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1067-20\">First, we do not think the average fertilizer purchaser would necessarily think that \u201cPro\u201d is a recognized abbreviation of the word \u201cprofessional,\u201d any more than he would think \u201cPro\u201d is a recognized synonym of the word \u201cfor.\u201d Even so, we fail to see how it possesses \u201can obvious laudatory connotation as applied to fertilizers\u201d any more than the word \u201camateur\u201d would necessarily suggest an opposite meaning. On the contrary, we think that the average purchaser, on viewing the competing marks applied to identical goods in the market place, would not be inclined to dissect them in the manner suggested by the board, but would view them in their entireties and assume the goods emanate from a common source.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-21\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-22\">Reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-23\">Judge SMITH participated in the hearing of this case but died before a decision was reached.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1067-13\">.
