JOSEPH SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b647-28\">Harold Hartshorne died on February 15, 1961, leaving a will providing that one-third of his residuary estate (after certain exclusions and less $100,000) be placed in trust, the income to be paid to his former wife Mary during her lifetime and the principal to be paid to their three adult children upon her death. The provisions for Mary and the adult children were made pursuant to a settlement agreement ratified and adopted as part of a Nevada divorce decree in 1942.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-29\">In the federal estate tax return, the decedent\u2019s executors claimed that the entire amount of the testamentary trust was deductible from the gross estate as a debt of the estate. The Commissioner of Internal Revenue allowed the deduction of the value of Mary\u2019s life estate, but disallowed the value of the adult children\u2019s remainder interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-30\">The Tax Court, C. Rogers Arundell, J., held that the value of the remainder interest was not deductible under section 2053(a) (3) of the Internal Revenue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>Code of 1954,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and determined a deficiency of $176,088.90 against the estate. The Tax Court held that \u201cpetitioners have failed to prove that there was adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth for the remainder interest of the testamentary trust.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-4\">The executors petition for review of the Tax Court decision pursuant to section 7482 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. We find no error and deny .the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-5\">The only question raised by this case is whether the value of the remainder interest is deductible from decedent\u2019s gross estate as a claim against the estate within the provisions of section 2053 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. Section 2053(c) (1) (A) allows a deduction for claims \u201cfounded on a promise or agreement\u201d to the extent \u201cthey were contracted bona fide for adequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b648-6\"> If the disputed agreement provided simply for the settlement of marital property rights and/or the maintenance of <em>minor </em>children, it is clear that any indebtedness arising out of such an agreement would be deductible from the gross estate. Harris v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 340 U.S. 106, 71 S.Ct. 181, 95 L.Ed. 111 (1950); Rev. Rul. 60-160 (1960-1 Cum.Bull. 734). However, it is firmly established that the <em>Harris </em>rationale (i. e., that a claim arising out of a court-approved divorce settlement will be deemed to be supported by \u201cadequate and full consideration\u201d) does not apply to transfers to <em>adult children. </em>Rosenthal v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 205 F.2d 505 (2d Cir. 1953); Chemical Bank New York Trust Co. v. United States, 249 F.Supp. 450 (S.D.N.Y.1966); Estate of Keller v. Commissioner, 44 T.C. 851 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Since petitioners do not challenge the holding of Rosenthal v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, supra, and those decisions which follow it, the only question we have to decide is whether \u201cadequate and full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d was given in exchange for the promise by decedent to create a testamentary trust.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">We assume for purposes of this appeal that an agreement to make a bequest may sometimes be a \u201cclaim\u201d within the meaning of section 2053.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>the Tax Court, Judge Arundell suggested that the value of Mary\u2019s life estate was roughly equivalent to the commuted value of the alimony payments she would have received under a 1938 separation decree, and therefore that the \u201cclaim\u201d of the adult children was founded on a promise unsupported by consideration. Under Rev.Rul. 60-160, Mary\u2019s life estate is deductible from decedent\u2019s gross estate without regard either to its value in dollars or the adequacy of the consideration, and therefore it was unnecessary for Judge Arundell to assign a dollar value to the rights surrendered by Mary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">The petitioners, however, do not challenge this finding by Judge Arundell, and they apparently concede that Mary gave no consideration for the remainder interest. Indeed, their whole argument is based on the fact that Mary gave \u201czero\u201d consideration for the children\u2019s remainder interest. They argue that \u201czero\u201d consideration is \u201cadequate and full consideration\u201d for purposes of section 2053 if the remainder interest which decedent was promising had \u201czero\u201d value <em>at the time of the bargain. </em>This they proceed to demonstrate by showing that the value of the remainder interest was <em>minus </em>$8,383.90, which they generously round off to zero. Thus, they claim they satisfy the requirements for deduction under section 2053(c). The bizarre contention we reject.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-10\">Even if, as the petitioners insist, the relevant time for determining the adequacy of the consideration is \u201cat the time of the exchange\u201d and not, as the Commissioner argues, at the time of decedent\u2019s death, petitioners are mistaken in their view that the promise was worth nothing in 1942.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Assuming that the relevant time is the time of exchange, and conceding that petitioners\u2019 arithmetic is correct, petitioners still are not entitled to deduct the value of the remainder interest from the gross estate. Despite the novelty of their argument, all that they have succeeded in showing is that the remainder interest (and indeed, the whole testamentary trust) had no value at the time the settlement agreement was negotiated. Since the trust was not to be set up until decedent died, the trust may have had no ascertainable value in 1942. This does not mean, however, that the <em>promise </em>to establish the trust had no value. Indeed, the fact that the promise was incorporated into a court-approved divorce decree would seem to indicate that the promise was not altogether without value.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\"> While the trust to be set up in the future may not have had any ascertainable present value in 1942, and while it may not have been possible to ascertain the precise value of Mary\u2019s life estate in 1942, it is enough for us to be able to say that the promise was not wholly worthless.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">The promise had large potential worth. Even in 1942 the decedent\u2019s estate was worth over $340,000 and could be expected to increase. If petitioners\u2019 argument were to prevail in such a situation a convenient loophole would be opened in the estate tax provisions whereby a testator could avoid the tax simply by promising to give the natural objects of his bounty something with a then zero value but with an enormous potential for increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-10\">Since the Tax Court found (and petitioners concede) that Mary gave no consideration for the children\u2019s rights, and since plainly decedent\u2019s promise was valuable to some extent at the time of the exchange, there was no \u201cadequate and full consideration\u201d for the promise. It follows, then, that the remainder interest is not deductible from the gross estate under section 2053(c), and the petition for review is denied.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-7\">.

Sec. 2053)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b648-13\">. The Commissioner takes the position that an agreement to make a bequest to one\u2019s own children can never be a \u201cclaim against the estate\u201d within the meaning of section 2053 because the decedent has simply agreed to make a testamentary disposition to persons who are \u201cnatural objects of his bounty\u201d and who would inherit anyway. According to the Commissioner, these persons have \u201can interest in the estate rather than a claim against it for federal estate tax purposes.\u201d See 4 Mertens, Law of Federal Gift and Estate Taxation \u00b6 26.40, at 167 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"A2j\">We agree that inheritance rights alone are not deductible claims under section 2053. To hold the other way would be to open a large loophole in the estate tax by encouraging taxpayers to contract with their wives and children for whatever inheritance rights they would otherwise have in the estate and thereby convert nondeductible claims into deductible contractual claims against the estate. Cf. C. I. R. v. Estate of Watson, 216 F.2d 941 (2d Cir. 1954). Under exceptional circumstances, however, it may be that a</p>\n<p id=\"A-pW\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>claim by someone who might otherwise inherit from the decedent should be deductible under section 2053. If the claim is not simply a subterfuge for a nondeductible legacy, if the claim is supported by \u201cadequate and full consideration,\u201d and if the consideration is a non-zero sum which augmented the decedent\u2019s estate, then it would seem that the deduction should be allowed. Whether or not a particular claim is deductible, then, will depend on the facts in each case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b649-7\">. What Mary surrendered were support and alimony payments to which she was entitled under a New York separation decree. By its terms, Mary was to receive monthly payments of $800 for the rest of her life. Unlike the agreement ratified in the Nevada divorce decree, these payments were not to be terminated by remarriage nor decreased when any of the children reached majority. In addition, the payments were subject to modification on application of either of the parties, and in 1941 Mary\u2019s alimony payments were increased to $1,000 a month.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b649-8\">. That the relevant time for valuing the consideration should be at the time of exchange is suggested by United States v. Past, 347 F.2d 7 (9th Cir. 1965), where the decedent and her husband both transferred property to a trust pursuant to a property settlement agreement. In concluding that decedent\u2019s contribution to the trust was greater than the consideration received in return, and therefore that the excess should be included in decedent\u2019s estate for purposes of computing the estate tax owed, the Ninth Circuit looked at the value of the property transferred <em>at the time of transfer </em>to determine whether the life estate which decedent retained was greater than her contribution to the trust. In a footnote, the court said that the consideration received by decedent \u201cis to be valued at the time of the transfer,\u201d 347 F.2d at 14, n. 6, citing Vardell\u2019s Estate v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 307 F.2d 688 (5th Cir. 1962).</p>\n<p id=\"ACq\">Admittedly, both <em>Past </em>and <em>Vardell\u2019s Estate </em>involved <em>inter vivos </em>transfers which failed for inadequate consideration, and were therefore decided under section 2043 of the Internal Revenue Code. Nonetheless, sections 2043 and 2053 are sufficiently similar in purpose and language so that we may at least assume for the purpose of this case, that the relevant time for determining the value of consideration is at the time of exchange. Both sections are aimed at preventing the depletion of the estate for estate tax purposes. Both sections operate by imposing estate tax liability for transfers unsupported by \u201cadequate and full consideration.\u201d One disallows claims for inadequate <em>inter vivos </em>transfers, while the other disregards certain post-death transfers for estate tax computation. Under section 2043, the amount includable in the gross estate for tax computation is the difference between the</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>value of the property at death, valued as of the date of death, and the value of the consideration received by decedent, <em>valued as of the date of transfer. </em>Logically, it may well be that the result should be the same under section 2053.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b650-7\">. The value of property at a given time depends upon the relative intensity of the social desire for it at that time, ex-jmessed in the money that it would bring in the market. * * * [I]t depends largely on more or less certain prophecies of the future; and the value is no less real at that time if later the prophecy turns out false than when it comes out true. * * * Ithaca Trust Co. v. United States, 279 U.S. 151, 155, 49 S.Ct. 291, 73 L.Ed. 647 (1929), Holmes, J.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b650-20\">. Moreover, we doubt whether the disputed transaction was in fact an exchange of equals, since the children received a promise with a large potential worth, while the decedent received nothing that could ever increase beyond its then zero worth. In any case, we should have difficulty in concluding that zero value is \u201cadequate and full consideration <em>in money or money\u2019s worth.\u201d</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
