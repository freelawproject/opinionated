Stueck vs. Murphy Co., 107 Conn. 656. That aside, it may be perceived from the facts stated that the plaintiff having instituted an action praying for relief from a tax computed upon an assessment claimed to be manifestly exces-' sive in accordance with section 375c of the Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes (1935), and having, during the pendency of the cause \u201cpaid said taxes under protest in order to avoid the various penalties and consequences imposed by law for the nonpayment of taxes\u201d, claims that it is entitled to a rebate or refund equivalent to the difference between a tax laid on a valuation of $175,000 and $130,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The difficulty is, that the situation delineated by the stipulation, when read in the light of the pleadings, does not permit the court to make a decision such as the parties desire, or, in fact, any on what may be sensed to be the merits of the real controversy.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">For, the complaint alleges, in effect, that the plaintiff made return of all the taxable property owned by it on July 1, 1935. It then proceeds to state that: \u201cSaid assessors valued said merchandise at $175,000,\u201d and that \u201cThe amount of said assessment wais manifestly excessive, etc.\u201d Apparently, the \u201csaid assessment\u201d was that made on \u201csaid merchandise\u201d. There is nothing revealed in the complaint as to whether such mer.chandise constituted the whole of plaintiff\u2019s taxable property as it appeared in its return, or if it did not, what the total of plaintiff\u2019s list was.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">The situation is further complicated by the circumstance that the stipulation of facts is silent as concerns any excessive assessment on plaintiff\u2019s \u201cmerchandise\u201d. It says: \u201cThe assessors valued said premises at One Hundred, Seventy-five Thous- and ($175,000) Dollars.\u201d There is nowhere in the pleadings any claim of an excessive assessment of realty owned by plaintiff. Accordingly, it would appear that while plaintiff contends that it was subjected to a manifestly excessive assessment because its \u201cmerchandise\u201d was overvalued, the parties have by common consent chosen to ignore this, but agree that the \u201cpremises\u201d owned by plaintiff were, nevertheless, excessively assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">The question whether the plaintiff is entitled to repayment in whole or in part of the taxes paid by it becomes academic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>only, since it appears neither from the pleadings nor the stipulated facts that the plaintiff has any cause of action, at all. This is so because the most that can be gleaned from the record is that the complaint is predicated upon an excessive assessment of one item, only, of plaintiff\u2019s tax list, whether that be \u201cmerchandise\u201d or \u201cpremises\u201d. It is nowhere alleged that the total assessment of all of plaintiff\u2019s taxable properties is \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d, or even excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">The statute under which, apparently, this action is brought (Cum. Supp. {1935} \u00a7375c) provides a remedy against the payment of a tax in contradistinction to that provided by section 374c of the Cumulative Supplement to the General Statutes (1935), which aims at rectifying a grievance based upon an excessive or disproportionate assessment, by appeal from a board of relief. Conn. Light <em>&amp; </em>Power Co. vs. Oxford, 101 Conn. 383, 389; and see Rocky Hill Incorporated District vs. Hartford Rayon Corporation, 122 Conn. 392, 405; see, also, Slosberg vs. Norwich, 115 Conn. 578. Under its provisions, (aside from instances where property is not taxable in the town where it is assessed), relief may be given where the contested tax is the result of an assessment, manifestly excessive. The \u201cassessment\u201d to which the statute refers, can only be the total of all the taxable items in a person\u2019s list, since it is upon that only that a tax may be laid. While such a total may be made \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d because one item only is valued at a figure palpably higher than it should be, yet it does not follow that because a single item is so treated, that the \u201cassessment\u201d (i.e. the total of taxable items in the list) is, on that account, \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d. For such a situation is still compatible with such \u201cassessment\u2019s\u201d being fair and proportionate; a result readily comprehensible when it is considered that the injustice produced by an excessive valuation of one species of property may be balanced by an undervaluation of another or others with the result that the total might be anything but \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">Insofar as the record here discloses, plaintiff\u2019s claim is that a single item on its assessment list (whether that be \u201cmerchandise\u201d or \u201cpremises\u201d) is claimed to be clearly overvalued. But, as noted supra, nothing appears to show that, notwithstanding, the assessment in its total may yet be one conforming to the statutory standard and hence, not \u201cmanifestly excessive\u201d within the concept of the statute under which this action is brought. See Greenwoods Company vs. New Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>ford, 65 Conn. 461, 465. If the omissions mentioned supra are supplied on or before December 17, 1937, so that the question which the parties desire to have decided is then presented on the record, it may be re-submitted on or before that date; if not, the matter must needs await the attention of the next term of court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
