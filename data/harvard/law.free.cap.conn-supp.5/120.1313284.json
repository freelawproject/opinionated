A. Howard, Trustee, has filed a plea to the jurisdiction, alleging that the corporation petitioned the Federal Court for the appointment of a trustee of its estate under 77-B, which the court granted, and that he is now the duly qualified temporary trustee; that the corporation <em>is </em>under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Court and that the plaintiff did not receive permission from the Federal Court to bring this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-18\">The plaintiff has demurred \u201cbecause the allegations set forth by the said defendant are not sufficient to deprive this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>\u25a0court of jurisdiction\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">Demurrers must be special, not general. This sounds like a general one. It does not \u201cdistinctly specify the reason why the pleading demurred to is insufficient\u201d. The purpose of a demurrer is not to admit or deny any matter of fact; \u201cit merely in effect advances a legal proposition, namely, that the pleading demurred to is insufficient in law to maintain the case of the adverse party; and under our practice all demurrers must distinctly specify the reason why the pleading demurred to is insufficient.\u201d Miller vs. Cross, 73 Conn. 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">The demurrer is therefore overruled, with permission to file a proper one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
