By the terms of this instrument the defendant agreed to sell certain real estate to \u201ca corporation to be formed by Hiram S. Gans\u201d. The plaintiff in this action is not Hiram S. Gans. The plaintiff is a corporation formed on June 1, 1933 \u2014 not after the date of Exhibit A, August 20, 1936. There is no allegation in the complaint that Gans ever assigned his interest in Exhibit A to the plaintiff corporation. It is alleged in the amended complaint that Gans never formed any corporation after August 20, 1936. It does not appear in the complaint as amended that Gans ever designated the plaintiff as grantee under Exhibit A.

Santoro vs. Mack, 108 Conn. 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Here the purchaser is not otherwise described than as \u201ca corporation to be formed by Hiram S. Gans\u201d. Hiram S. Gans might have formed numerous corporations after August 20, 1936. Which of such corporations would be entitled under the terms of this contract to be a party to the contract does, not appear in the contract. It does not even appear that Gans was a party to the contract. ' So far as appears in the contract, A.B. might have agreed with the defendant that the proposed corporation would be formed by a third party named!
