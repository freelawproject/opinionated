Hollander <em>&amp; </em>Son vs. Jos. Hollander, Inc., et al., 117 N. J. Eq. 578.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Since the availability to the plaintiff of injunction as a remedy is extremely doubtful, the question is obviously one which should not be passed upon on an application for a ternporary injunction, but should be left for determination by the court upon a full hearing, at which time plaintiff\u2019s right not only to injunction, but also to recover damages for the alleged libel and slander may be adjudicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">The application is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
