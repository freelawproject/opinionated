About one o\u2019clock in the morning of the 4th, plaintiff wanted to go home. She \u201cdidn\u2019t think (she) had finished her third drink\u201d, she testified. From the evidence in the case I am convinced she was more drunk than sober.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">She was observed outside of the road house by the defendant\u2019s son (who with some companions were using the defendant\u2019s automobile) in a heated argument with some man. She seemed to want to go home. Defendant\u2019s son went to her and the one she was arguing with and, addressing him, asked if she wanted to be taken home. Pie made no objection and as she wanted to go defendant\u2019s son assisted her into the automobile he was driving. This assistance was required since she was so unsteady on her feet, as she also was in her voice, as a result of her intoxicated ^nnHirinn.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>On the way home an accident occurred in which she was injured. She testified that the driver of the car drove at a terrific rate of speed, despite her repeated warnings from the time they left until the accident, to which he paid no attention - \u2014 which testimony sounds so familiar in some of these actions where, in order to recover, it becomes necessary to get some testimony before the jury that becomes evidence of recklessness upon which a jury may base a verdict. Upon the witness stand she displayed some evidence of \u201csmartness\u201d and satisfaction in her personal appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">Recklessness, heedlessness and negligence were defined to the jury and the distinction between negligence and recklessness and heedlessness was pointed out. While the testimony of the plaintiff I could not believe, the jury had the right to find it credible and base its verdict upon it, and to set it aside, with the record disclosing the testimony, untrue as I believe it to be, would avail the defendant nothing upon the appeal which in all probability would follow. Therefore the motion is, reluctantly, denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
