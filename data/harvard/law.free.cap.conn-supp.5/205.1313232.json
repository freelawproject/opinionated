It further is alleged that neither the defendant nor Silverman ever paid interest or principal on the note and that the plaintiff\u2019s right of action did not accrue within six years next before the commencement of this action. To this the plaintiff demurs on the grounds that the obligation was assumed by an instrument under seal and that the \u201cnote which the defendant assumed and agreed to pay is non-negotiable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">As to the first claim on demurrer it was early decided in this state in Foster vs. Atwater, 42 Conn, at 250, citing Pike vs. Brown, 7 Cushing, 133, that the grantee in a deed not having sealed the instrument is not bound by such a promise \u201cas a deed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">As to the second claim the action is not on the note but upon the defendant\u2019s contract with his grantor to pay the indebtedness.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">Jacobs vs. Kupperstein, 112 Conn., 607, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The statute (G. S., Sec. 5489) upon which the plaintiff sues could not enlarge the original contract. It gives the plaintiff the right to maintain such an action as might the defendant\u2019s grantor. \u201cIf this action is not brought upon the note set forth in the pleadings, but upon an undertaking which is in no legal sense a promissory note, nor a contract under seal, the inquiry whether the note in question is negotiable or nonnegotiable becomes an immaterial one.\u201d Carpenter vs. Thompson, 66 Conn. 457, 462.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-8\">While the \u201cassumption agreement .... was an absolute obligation to pay the full amount of the note according to its terms\u201d, Roth vs. Ravich, 111 Conn. 649, the agreement itself was a simple contract and as such subject to the limitation of General Statutes, Section 6005. The right to sue accrued at the date of the delivery and acceptance of the deed and expired six years thereafter unless kept alive, which the allegations of the Special Defense negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-9\">The demurrer is overruled on all grounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
