Persons already having building permits for construction or alteration of building in preparation for such business shall not be barred merely by inability to finish such work before said date. Such preparatory work shall, however, be completed within a reasonable time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">\u201cNothing in this regulation shall prevent.the moving of such a business to a new location, within five hundred (500) feet of original location, prior to January 1, 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">\u201cDrug stores are excepted from this regulation and also grocery stores selling canned and bottled beer.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The plaintiff on May 15, 1937, presented to the City Clerk of Bridgeport an application for a package store permit to sell all alcoholic liquor for certification that the zoning regulations did not prohibit such sales at the location, and was refused certification because of the above recited regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">The plaintiff asks a declaratory judgment adjudging the regulation invalid and unconstitutional and an injunction against its enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">The defendants allege the regulation was duly enacted, constituted a proper exercise of the power of the Zoning Commission and a proper exercise of the <em>city's </em>police power and ask a declaratory judgment that it is valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-10\">The parties are agreed on the facts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-11\">\u201cThe ultimate purpose of zoning ordinances is to confine certain classes of buildings and uses to certain localities.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">Thayer vs. Board of Appeals, 114 Conn., 15.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-13\">\u201cZoning legislation has been upheld with substantial uniformity as a legitimate subject for the exercise of the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>power when it has a rational relation to the public health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the community and is not in plain violation of constitutional provisions, or is not such an unreasonable exercise of this power as to become arbitrary, destructive or confiscatory.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">State vs. Hillman, 110 Conn., 92-100.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">As the plaintiff argues as far as the control of the sale of alcoholic beverages is concerned this is in the hands of the Liquor Control Commission under statutory regulations. But the Zoning Commission is concerned with the character of business upon the city streets and the effect of this upon the \u201cwelfare and prosperity\u201d of the community and this, the legislature has recognized in Section 1049c, Cum. Supp. con' fining the sale of alcoholic liquor to parts of the city or town prescribed by zoning ordinances.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">As to this statute the plaintiff\u2019s contention is that it refers to conforming uses in established zones. If this were so it would seem a certification from the city\u2019s clerk were super' fluous. When the legislature singled out this particular bush ness and made it subject to the provisions of local zoning ordinances it recognized the fact that the presence of such uses might be deleterious to the prosperity of a town or city in certain parts thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">The regulation in dispute is indeed zoning in spirit as much as the laying out of blocks or sections of the city for special purposes. It provides in effect that no such business shall be conducted in zones 1500 feet long, presumably on the ground that zones of this length will be of benefit to the street and community.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">To fix arbitrary sections for this purpose would be doubtless to injure established businesses. As the defendant well argues \u201cWithout such a regulation a community .... might well be overrun by establishments selling intoxicating liquors to such an extent as to wholly nullify the beneficent consequences of Zoning programs,\u201d and it may be added, affect the entire character of the street and the value of property on it.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">That the regulations exempt drug and grocery stores strengthens rather than weakens the defendant\u2019s case for it indicates that it was the character of the store rather than the-article sold that prompted the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-10\">The plaintiff raises three questions of law in opposition to\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>the regulation. He claims it violates the provisions of the State Liquor Control Act; it violates the state constitution and it violates the federal constitution. If it is a valid exercise of police power all three questions are answered in favor of the defendants. That it is, seems sufficiently answered in State vs. Hillman, supra, citing Euclid vs. Ambler Realty Co., 272 U. S. 365 that \u201ccourts will not hold laws, ordinances or regulations adopted under sanction of law to be unconstitutional unless they are clearly unreasonable, destructive or confiscatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">Judgment is directed for the defendant and it is declared that said zoning regulation is in all respects valid.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
