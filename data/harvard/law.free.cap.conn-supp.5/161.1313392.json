Stat. Cum. Supp., 1935, \u00a71659c; Practice Book, \u00a7\u00a772-78, since these relate only to the \u201cinspections of papers, books or documents . . . within the knowledge, possession or power of the adverse party\u201d. To be well grounded, therefore, it must in' voke some inherent power of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">Counsel cites no authority in support of his contention that the court possesses the power to order the defendant to permit the plaintiff to examine the trolley car 'in question for the purpose stated in the motion. The court\u2019s own research has revealed none in this country.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In any event, in the instant case the motion should be re' fused since it appears that since the accident the trolley car has been repaired and so is no longer in the condition it was at the time the fire occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">Quaere, whether such inspection is necessary on any theory. See Ryan vs. Lilley Company, 121 Conn. 26, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">Motion denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
