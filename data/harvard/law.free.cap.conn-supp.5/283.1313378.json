Dilulio.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-14\">On the day of the trial of this action, but previous thereto, two of the defendants, to wit, George Millano and Vincent A. Dilulio, settled with the plaintiff for $37.50, with a covenant from the plaintiff not to sue these two defendants and a written withdrawal was entered, thus leaving the White Line Bus. Corporation and William Buckley as the remaining defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>The White Line Bus Corporation, as is well known, is a public utilities corporation engaged in the operation of buses in Bridgeport for the purpose of carrying passengers for hire.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-4\">On September 19, 1936, the plaintiff was a passenger on a bus owned and operated by the defendant corporation which was proceeding southerly on Madison Avenue and which said bus stopped at Cleveland Avenue to take on passengers. The said William Buckley was the operator of the bus.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">A car owned by George Millano and operated by Vincent A. Dilulio was proceeding in the same direction in the rear of the bus and collided with the rear of the bus at this intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">The plaintiff was seated on the extreme rear cross seat and in the left hand corner next to the emergency door upon which is a cross handle bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">According to the plaintiff\u2019s pleadings she was injured either by the sudden stopping of the bus or by the impact of collision of the car in the rear or. by both occurrences at the said intersection.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">In spite of the plaintiff\u2019s complaint and numerous amendments thereto, there actually remain the sole questions as to whether or not the plaintiff was injured by the sudden stopping of the bus and whether or not such stopping constituted negligence on the part of the bus driver and the extent of her injuries, and the amount of recovery, if any.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">In the opinion of the Court, the preponderance of the evidence demonstrates there was a sudden stopping of the bus .such as to constitute negligence on the part of the operator and thereby causing physical injury to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">The plaintiff claims, for one thing, that her right jaw was dislocated by coming into forcible contact with a friend who was seated on her immediate right, from which, however, she suffered no pain or ill effects for a period of two weeks. This claimed injury, nevertheless, can be much better attributed to .a wisdom tooth and its extraction two weeks after the accident; \u2022yet her back was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-11\">The following items are allowed for recovery:</p>\n<p id=\"b288-12\">(a) The doctor\u2019s bill for $53.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-13\">\u2022(b) For loss of wages, 10 weeks at $15.00 per week or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>$150.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\">(c) For pain and suffering the sum of $50.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">(d) A total of $253.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">The issues on the complaint are found in favor of the plaintiff. Judgment is entered for plaintiff to recover from the defendants the sum of $253.00 with interest on $150.00 from January 1, 1937 to date, and with interest on the sum of $53.00 from March 11, 1937 to date, making a total of $260.91 damages, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
