Such facts then as are within the exclusive power of the defendants to supply and which are material to the support of the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action are proper subjects for a motion for disclosure. Some of the facts sought appear to meet the above test, but some do not. Those which in the opinion of the Court are proper consist of the interrogatories numbered respectively 9, 13, 14, 1?, 16, 17, 18 and 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>The defendant, Morris Diamond, is therefore ordered to answer all of the aforesaid interrogatories, and the defendant, The Frank Wilcox Company, is hereby ordered to answer the last seven thereof only.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
