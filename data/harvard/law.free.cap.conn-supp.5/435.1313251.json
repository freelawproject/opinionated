On March 2?th, 1937, he was suspended for the period of one year from April l?th, 1937, and he has since this suspension became effective faithfully complied with the judgment of the court by with' drawing from all activities as a member of the Bar and of the firm of which he was a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-14\">I have examined the complete record and note that this suspension was based upon no dishonest practice, conduct or charge, nor any betrayal of any interest of any client. It resulted from a breach of the rules concerning the ethical con' duct of members of the profession, viz., that they should not, by themselves, or by agents, or others, solicit clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-15\">From the evidence presented upon this application, Mr. Poussner has, from the outset of the investigation, experienced, to all intents and purposes in so far as the practice of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>profession is concerned, a suspension from such practice for a period of two and one-half years. The result of all of this has been the loss of a substantial practice and a nervous breakdown requiring medical attention over a long period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\">The evidence presented further leads me to the conclusion that because of the fact that he was not charged with dishonesty or any betrayal of any interest of any client, the results of the investigation, trial and suspension, have been sufficient to meet all requirements of justice and that the suspension should now be terminated and that he be reinstated as an attorney at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">No opposition was presented to the granting of this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">He may, therefore, be so reinstated as an attorney at law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
