The wife has filed three motions, \u2014 one for alimony pendente lite, one for an allowance to defend, and one for support of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-17\">\u201cAlimony is the creature of statute\u201d Cary vs. Cary, 112 Conn. at 258. Our statutes allow it, both pendente lite and upon final judgment, in divorce actions (Sec. 5182); but in annulment proceedings grant it only upon filial judgment (Sec. 5188). The first motion is therefore denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-18\">As to an allowance to defend. \u201cThe expense necessary for the wife to carry on her own action for divorce or separation, or to defend' the action against her for a divorce or annulment of the marriage, is usually allowed the wife; this is a recognised part of our procedure.\u201d Valuzzo vs. Valuzzo, 104 Conn. at 155. This case, not cited by either party in its brief, is decisive, and the matter being within the sound discretion of the Court, the motion <em>is </em>granted, and the sum of $75. ordered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>paid within two weeks of this date.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">The motion for support of minor child is defective in that it does not allege it is a child of this plaintiff (husband). Our statutes, in granting support, always speak of \u201ca child of the marriage\u201d. The issue was not raised here and therefore cannot be decided. The wife has a complete remedy under, Sec. 6265, provided she proves it was \u201chis child\u201d. This motion is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
