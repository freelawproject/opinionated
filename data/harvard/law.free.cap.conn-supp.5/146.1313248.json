The same matter is now alleged by way of set off. Set off is applicable to actions ex contractu and a physician\u2019s engagement is a matter of contract. The complaint sets forth an action of malpractice. Malpractice arises from contract but sounds in tort.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">There appears to be a difference of opinion in different jurisdictions as to the affect of an action pursued to judgment for physician\u2019s services in a subsequent action for malpractice, but that a doctor\u2019s bill may be alleged, even by way of counter-claim does not appear to have been even questioned in these jurisdictions. Can it be said that such a claim \u201cis not a subject matter so connected with the allegations of malpractice in the complaint as to be necessary for a full determination of the rights of the plaintiff and the defendant?\u201d Certainly had the doctor sued for his services malpractice could be interposed either as a complete defense, or as affecting the value of the services depending upon the rule which our Court might see fit to adopt. I think the reverse of the proposition is sensible and reasonable, in a pleading alleging set off, but not in an action against defendants jointly.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">It is not necessary to decide the question in this fashion, however, because we have two statutes which provide a remedy for the defendants. Sections 5555 and 5556 G. S. Rev. 1930 provide for set off of joint or several debts, by filing a complaint in the court in which judgment shall have been rendered, within twenty-four hours after final judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The motion to strike out is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
