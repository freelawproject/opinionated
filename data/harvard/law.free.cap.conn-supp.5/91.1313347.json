But it is, nevertheless, when used, a complaint under the Practice Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The principal effect of the rule (permitting the use of the common counts) is to suspend the penalties attaching to every defective statement of claim, by giving the plaintiff special time within which he may file a proper complaint by way of amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">Dunnett vs. Thornton, 73 Conn. 1, Pages 7, 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">A Substituted Complaint setting out an endorsement of a note and implying liability for that reason \u201c. . . . could furnish no basis for a future judgment . . . .\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">Goodrich vs. Stanton, 71 Conn. 418 at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">The Motion to Strike from the Files the Bill of Particulars and Supplemental Bill of Particulars is granted for the reason that neither of them is based upon any count which is a general statement of the cause of action upon which the plaintiff relies.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">The Motion to Strike the Complaint, so-called, from the files is denied. The plaintiff is entitled to have it remain as a basis for the filing of any amendment which may properly be filed. If, subsequently, it develops that none of the common counts is a general statement of the plaintiff\u2019s real cause of action then the defendant may duly bring that situation to the attention of the Court and have his remedy.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
