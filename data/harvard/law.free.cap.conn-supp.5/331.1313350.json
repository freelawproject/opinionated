The plaintiff did not claim that the defendant had actual notice of the presence of said spot of grease, nor was there any evidence offered upon this subject. Neither was any evidence offered as to the length of time said spot of grease existed. The Jury were fully charged upon the subject of notice express and implied. Its conclusion, however, as expressed by its verdict that the spot of grease had existed for such a length of time that the defendant could fairly be said to have had an opportunity to remove or safeguard it and that it had not done so was, in the opinion of the Court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>so against the evidence and the law as charged as to indicate that the Jury made some mistake in law or were influenced by lack of knowledge or understanding or by corruption, prejudice or partiality.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">In view of the circumstances the motion to set the verdict aside is granted for the reasons stated therein.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
