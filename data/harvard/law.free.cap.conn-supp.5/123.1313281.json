His death was caused by the negligence of the defendants, because they maintained a nuisance on their premises and because they failed to safeguard an inherently dangerous condition. The land was open for use by the public in general for a parking space for automobiles. These allegations of the complaint, admitted by the demurrer, make a trial necessary to determine the precise circumstances surrounding the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-17\">Norwich vs. Breed, 30 Conn. 535.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-18\">Ruoccio vs. United Advertising Company, 98 Conn. 241.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-19\">Sedita vs. Steinberg, 105 Conn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-20\">While the general rule is well settled that an owner owes-no duty to a trespasser to keep his premises in safe condition (Wilmot vs. McPadden, 79 Conn. 367, 16 Y.L.J. 356; Pastorello vs. Stone, 89 Conn. 286) it does not appear from the complaint that the plaintiff was a trespasser.
