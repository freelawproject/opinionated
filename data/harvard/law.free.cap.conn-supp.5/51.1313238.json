The finding of facts on appeal, also based on the record, was made, necessarily, without the benefit of regular examination and cross examination, and personal observation of witnesses\u2014 important aids in determining weight and veracity. For these reasons we forbear to terminate the case upon the record before us, but remand it for a new trial in the light of this opinion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cTo determine whether the County Commissioners have acted fairly, the Superior Court on appeal may hear the facts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">Farrell\u2019s Appeal, 85 Conn., 701 at page 703.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Moynihan\u2019s Appeal, 75 Conn., 358, 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Along the same line our Supreme Court said in another case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-11\">\u201cThe errors claimed as to the conduct of the Court, in the admission of testimony, and in reaching its conclusions as to suitability of place cannot be considered.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">Malmo\u2019s Appeal, 73 Conn., 232 at page 238.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-13\">\u201cThe word \u2018appeal\u2019 as thus used, has been construed as providing for an original application to the Superior Court to exercise its appropriate judicial power in respect to acts done by the county commissioners in excess of their power, or in the unlawful abuse of that power. Such appeal is a process by which the Superior Court is enabled to determine the legality of certain specified actions of the County Commissioners.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-14\">Moynihan\u2019s Appeal, 75 Conn., 358 at 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-15\">In the same opinion, at page 365, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-16\">\u201cIt was not the duty of the Court, nor was it practicable for it, to judicially determine what its own opinion might be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>if it stood in the place of the Commissioners, endowed with the same powers and means of information and charged with the same administrative duty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">It seems fair to imply that the meaning of the word \u201ctrial\u201d as applied to the proceedings in the Superior Court connotes a presentation of witnesses and their examination and an op' portunity for orderly cross examination which would seem to be an essential element in any trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">It appeared in the evidence offered in this court that, in the proceedings before the Liquor Commission, the rules of evidence as applied in the Superior Court were not adhered to.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">It would seem reasonable to hold that the parties are em titled to be heard in the Superior Court in accordance with the recognized rules of evidence and procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">This is not intended as any criticism of the procedure before The Liquor Commission as it is a matter of common knowledge that it would not be feasible to conduct hearings held there, under present circumstances, in accordance with the same rules of procedure which are observed in the Supe' rior Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">By reason of the failure of the appellee in the proceedings before this court to present any witnesses it was not possible for this court to substantially place itself in the position in which The Liquor Control Commission was at the time of the proceedings before it.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">\u201cIt is the duty of this court to determine whether or not the Commission acted arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Gwiszda vs. Bergin, 121 Conn., 705, 707.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">It would not seem feasible for this court to arrive at that conclusion unless there were placed before it the same wit' nesses and the same opportunity for the court to consider the proceedings as these matters were presented to the Commis' sion.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">The only witnesses presented upon the trial of this action in this court were those who were offered by the appellant and all of these witnesses testified that there was no sale in the place of the appellant permittee, after one o\u2019clock daylight saving time on the date in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>The claim of the Commission was that because a sale was had in the place of the permittee after one o\u2019clock that the permit should be revoked.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">In the present state of the record there is no evidence be' fore this court that such evidence of violation was presented to the Commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The so'called transcript of evidence, apparently offered for that purpose, does.not stand as a substitute for witnesses pre' sented in the orderly way.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Upon the trial had in this court the issues are found for the appellant and judgment may enter accordingly. \u25a0</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
