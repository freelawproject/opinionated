That Court found for the plaintiff \u201cgranting to him possession of the premises, together with costs\u201d. The defendant sought to procure a revision of the proceedings in said action, bringing the action to this Court on a Writ of Error; consequently the defendant is now the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">The present situation presents many technical questions. There are times, of course, when methods and rules can be overlooked or harmonised with the prevailing issues, which nevertheless cannot be done in the case at hand. Every Court desires to reach the heart of any case, but to do so it must have fundamental facts or issues under consideration before the Court can render any justifiable decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">The Town Court of Westport certified all the exhibits in the following language:\u2019\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b309-10\">\u201cThis is to certify that the enclosed exhibits are the complete exhibits offered in evidence and received as such\u201d, etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">It is manifest from the records of the Town Court that some of these exhibits, and probably all of them, were introduced over the objections of the plaintiff in error (Originally the defendant). Now the plaintiff in error claims the Town Court erred and mistook the law \u201cin denying the motion of the plaintiff in error to strike out the evidence offered by the defendant in error for the reason that such testimony was irrelevant to an issue based upon a tenancy at sufferance or at will\u201d. It must be noted, however, that \u2019here is not anything' in the entire record as presented to this Court for review,, which demonstrates or even indicates with any degree of clearness why such exhibits were admitted or upon what basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>they were inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">The Judge of the Town Court wrote and rendered a splendid memorandum of decision. Yet it is not a Finding of Facts and to consider it as such would require this Court to exercise a function beyond any proper interpretation of its powers.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">In the brief of the plaintiff in error is found in part a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d. With all due regard to the honesty, integrity and ability of counsel, it must be suggested that such a\u2019 statement cannot be accepted as a substitute for a Finding of Facts. If this is true the brief of law, founded on such a \u201cstatement of facts\u201d, must necessarily be inadequate since it is predicated upon assumptions, not facts found.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The motion for \u201cJudgment on the Record\u201d is therefore granted. The Writ of Error is dismissed and the judgment of the Town Court of Westport granting to the defendant in error \u201cpossession of the premises, together with costs\u201d is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
