He now moves that the judgment be opened in order that he may withdraw the prayer for damages and that the awarding of nominal damages be eliminated from the judgment in order that he may bring an action against this defendant and others for damages resulting from a conspiracy between such defendants to violate the restrictive provisions of the contract and thus avoid the possibility of being met with the defense of res judicata by this defendant as to the element of damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">The motion should not be granted. Further, it does not appear to be necessary for the purpose indicated. The action plaintiff desires to bring rests on an entirely different cause of action and involves different parties.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b490-8\">\u201cA right of action on a contract and for fraud in inducing plaintiff to enter into such contract may exist at the same time, and a recovery on one of the causes will not bar a subsequent action on the other.\u201d 34 C. J., 848, \u00a71258.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">The motion to open the judgment is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
