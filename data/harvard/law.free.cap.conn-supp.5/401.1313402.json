This allegation sets up ah agreement between the parties and raises issues which are in no way connected with the issues in the cause of action for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Accordingly, the demurrer is sustained, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">The demurrer is also sustained, for the reasons set forth in paragraphs 4, 5, <em>6 </em>and 7 thereof.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
