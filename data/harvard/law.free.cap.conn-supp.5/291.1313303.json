Supp. 1935, Sec. 1659c, Practice Book, Secs. 72-78, inclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-17\">It would be of material assistance to the court, if such a motion as the instant one contain written specifications of the particulars in which failure to comply with the court\u2019s order is alleged to have occurred. In the instant case, only a short \u25a0calendar claim is filed, giving notice to the adverse party that the oral motion which has been presented would be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-18\">The answers to the interrogatories contained in the motion \u25a0are categorical with the exception of those which appear to questions 6 and 8. The conditions named in the second paragraph of Practice Book, No. 75 as justification for the entry of \u25a0a default can, however, hardly be found to be present.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>Hence an order may be entered to be complied with within 10 days next following the filing of this memorandum with the clerk, requiring that the plaintiff answer categorically the questions propounded in paragraphs 6 and 8 of the motion.
