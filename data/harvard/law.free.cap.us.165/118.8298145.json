Construing the decree as applying to all portions of the boundary line in question, the commissioners decided to advertise in newspapers published in counties in Missouri and Iowa adjacent to the .boundary for information regarding such parts of said,line as were in dispute or had become obliterated. This was.done and considerable information elicited, but as the officials of one of the States interested declined to authorize the work necessary in retracing the line, excepting where directed in the decr\u00e9e, nothing was done beyond the finding and re-marking \u2018 with proper and durable monuments \u2019 such portions of the line as was necessary for its proper relocation betw\u00e9en the 40th and \u201960th mile points, as shown hereinafter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-7\">\u201cAfter careful consideration it was decided to apply to Gen\u2019l <em>W. W. </em>Duffield, superintendent U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, forp, detail from.his corps of assistants to perform all field-work necessary in carrying out the instructions of the court. It was decided that the employment of expert officers of the Geodetic Survey corps for the services required would result more satisfactorily to the States concerned than would the selection of any private parties, .as .the high professional attainments of these officers and their freedom from any possible .bias regarding the boundary line to .be established were ample guarantees for the \"entire reliability and impartiality of any work done by them..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-8\">\u201c Correspondence was accordingly had with Gen\u2019l Duffield, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>who consented to detail two of hi's assistants, and, also to supply;them/&gt;;with a complete-outfit of! all instruments and appli-. ances'^cessa,rj;'.in the prosecution of the proposed work.-. Thi's%^er,-was&gt;at'! once accepted-! 1 A meeting was afterwards \u2022- had inSfc Louis March 11th, ult., when it was decided to meet \u00e1t Lineville, Iowa, a' point-immediately upon the boundary line between Missouri and Iowa, for the purpose of personal investigation as to the. proper point or points at which to, com-menee operations. Two of the commissioners accordingly met at Lineville on March 18th, ult., and- spent three days in -the = examination of the boundary line and of points on said line claimed to have been established by Hendershott and Minor in 1850. The first step taken was to decide regarding the proper points -between which our work of relocation of that part of the -line' designated in the decree of yoiir honorable court, namely, from the.50th to the' 55th mile points on the Hendershott and Minor line, should be: commenced. It appeared'to us that the-cast-iron monuments, placed by Hender-shott and Minor at intervals of ten. miles would naturally be \u2022 more reliable than any traditional points, and the- first investigations were made as regarding the 40-th, 50th and 60th mile points, these being originally marked by .Hendershott and Minor with iron monuments,. as stated. , After careful examination and much, inquiry the- commissioners were satisfied that the monuments marking thie 40th; and 60th mile points were in their original positions. L As. regarded the monument at the 50th mile point, whilst no positive - evidence could be had as to its removal from its. original position, the rumors and- statements were such as to render -its reliability a matter of doubt, and it was,/ therefore, determined to use the monuments at the 40th and 60th mile points as fixed points between which to relocate the boundary line. . '</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-9\">\u201cIt was subsequently arranged for. the.commissioners to meet at-Davis City, IOway.a point on.the,Chicago, Burlington. &amp; Quincy railroad adjacent' to the 40th mile point, where it was proposea to commence work. Gen\u2019l Duffield was accordingly notified, and on Wednesday* April 8th, ult.,-the commissioners reached Davis City and met Messrs. W. C. Hodgkins <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>(in.charge of work) and A. L. Baldwin, of the TT. S. Geodetic Survey corps, detailed as per arrangements made with Gen\u2019l Duffield. These gentlemen brought with them a .very complete outfit-of instruments of the best description 'used in geodetic work, including all necessary equipment for astronomical observations as well as field-work. We proceeded, to the 40th .mile point on the afternoon of April 8th, ult., and arranged for the commencement of work the following day. On April 9th, ult., a party for field-work having been organized and the necessary teams and wagons hired, the. entire party proceeded to Pleasanton, Iowa, a point situated immediately on the boundary line just east of\u2019the 45th mile point. Pleasanton and Lineville subsequently became the bases of operation, our parties changing from one of these^ points to the other as the necessities of the work required..</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">\u201cWork was commenced at the 40th mile point, \u00e1s arranged. It. soon became quite evident that the-a\u00f3tual boundary line as indicated by points shown.and satisfactorily identified differed from the line as would be established by the field-notes of the-Hendershott and Minor survey. In order that the relative positions of the actual mile points between th\u00e9 -40th and 60th mile points could be properly determined, \u00e1nd.also their true relation'to the theoretical\" points as found in accordance with the courses and distances shown in Hendershott\u2019s report,' it was deemed necessary to establish a chord or base line twenty miles in length between the 40th- and' 60th iron monuments to which all points actually found and' definitely located or shown and claimed as being upon the boundary line could be referred and from which-all-points'finally determined could be accurately located. For the details of the actual field-work and its results we respectfully refer to the accompanying report of Mr. W. 0. Hodgkins, in charge of party (Appendix A). It is proper here to state that the field-work, done as it was in accordance with the precise methods of the IT. S. Geodetic Surveys, was necessarily very slow and tedious, but its accuracy, in our opinion, cannot be questioned. The meas: urement of the twenty-mile base, line involved a very great amount of labor, whilst the computations necessary in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>exact reductioil of the measurements were also very laborious. Complete'topographical notes were also taken for the entire work, but the commissioners have deemed it unnecessary to have maps prepared, as their preparation would involve a considerable expense without any corresponding benefit. The very unfavorable weather during a great portion of May and a part\u2019of June interfered seriously with the prosecution of the field-work, causing a delay of from two to three weeks.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-4\"><em>\u201c </em>Careful examination was made in every instance for the precise location of the original Ilendershott and Minor- mile points, but out of twenty-one of these points included in the survey only nine, including three iron monuments, could be satisfactorily identified.- The 42d, 43d, 44th, 49th, 54th and 58th mile points were identified and located by evidence entirely satisfactory to the commissioners. As regards the 50tb mile point (iron monument), concerning the reliability of which doubt had existed, the commissioners are satisfied that it is very little, if at all, out of its original position \u2014 its relation to the 49th mile point (which was clearly identified- as Hendershott\u2019s original point) as determined by the base line confirming our judgment. After the work of relocation had commenced and preliminary work on the twenty-mile base well advanced, statements were made to the commissioners to the effect that'the iron monument at the 60th mile point had at one time been moved from its original position. This being a matter of importance \u2014 the monument in question being considered as a fixed point in establishing the base line \u2014 an inquiry was had regarding it and a considerable amount of testimony heard. This testimony was very conflicting, but after its careful consideration and the prolongation of the base line some four miles eastward of the 60th mile point the commissioners were satisfied that the .monument was occupying its original position.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-5\">\u201c The location of the 52d mile point was more difficult and involved a much more, extended investigation than for any point established by the commissioners. It was claimed and strongly urged that the original 52d. mile point as established W Ilendershott and Minor was at a point witnessed by two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>trees \u2014 an elm and an oak \u2014 which, trees, as well as a point established from them in accordance with Hendershott and Minor field-notes, were shown. The field-notes regarding this, point and also the 53d mile point are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-4\">(Chains.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\">\u201c \u2018 80.00 Set 52d mile post. -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">Bearings, elm 18 inches-diameter, N. 87i\u00b0 E. 10\u00a3 links; burr oak 12 inches diameter, S. 22\u00b0 W.. \u25a0 28 links.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-8\">(Continuing:)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-9\">\u201c \u2018 N. 88\u00b0 47 E.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-10\">(Chains.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-11\">\u201c \u2018 0.30 A pond 250 links wide ;\u2022 direction of its length, N. &amp;-S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">5.00 Prairie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-13\">15.00 Timber.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-14\">30.00 Field (Stokes\u2019) fence, nearly N. &amp; S.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-15\">57.50 Left field.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-16\">80.00 Set 53d mile post.

The distances and bearings of these trees from the point shown and claimed as the original Hendershott mile point also agree Avith the field-notes closely. Beyond these coincidences, however, there is, in our judgment, nothing whatsoever to warrant a conclusion that they were eAer marked as Avitness trees by Hendershott and Minor. In their report (10th Howard, pages 15 and 16) they state: \u2018 In timber the number of the mile is marked on the witness trees Avith the letter- appropriate \u2022 to each State, there being one tree marked on each side of the line whenever possible. The foot of each witness tree is marked with the letters \u201cB L.\u201d \u2019 The oak tree shown and claimed to be a witness tree for the 52d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>mile point bad a large \u2018blaze\u2019 on its trunk about five feet from the ground. Nothing whatever could be ascertained by the commissioners to in any manner indicate what, if any, marking had been inscribed on the blaze, nor could any information be had concerning such marking. \u25a0 At the foot of this tree, facing N. 45\u00b0 E., is to be seen a blaze on which is plainly discernible the letters \u2018 B X.\u2019 The blaze on the trunk of the tree faced directly east, whilst the point to which it is claimed to refer is but\" 22\u00b0 east of north from the tree. It is the' universal -custom of surveyors in marking witness trees, so far as th\u00e9 experience of the commissioners goes, to make such marks so as to face as nearly as possible the point witnessed. The \u2018 B X \u2019 mark faces certainly 25\u00b0 east, and the blaze on trunk of tree 68\u00b0 east of the point claimed to be witnessed. Measurements of the \u2018 X \u2019 mark at base of tree are as follows, in tenths of one foot:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-5\">[[Image here]]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-6\">\u201c The mark inclining to the left extends above the letter \u2018 B\u2019 and is quite close to the upper curved line. The mark inclining to the right runs closely to the lower part of the \u2018 B.\u2019 It would have been quite as practicable to have cut a letter \u2018 L \u2019 as an \u2018 X \u2019 on the blaze found at foot of this tree, and the commissioners were not\u2019\u2019prepared to accept this letter \u2018 X \u2019 as an \u2018 L \u2019 without stronger corroborative evidence than they could obtain. This tree, if marked by Hendershott and Minoi\u2019, must have been so marked forty-six years ago. \u25a0 A- section of the tree at a point eight feet above the -ground, the tree being very uniform in size, from 'thre\u00e9 feet above the ground for eight to nine feet above, was cut and sent to Prof. McBride, botanical'expert at the. University .of Iowa, for his opinion (as expert) as to its age, Ac.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b150-7\">\u201cIn a letter from him to Commissioner Dey, May 19th, 1896, he states;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Apd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u201c \u2018I judge that the tree when felled was 70 years old. Its history runs about as follows: 59 years ago it received an injury (blaze ?) of which a scar persists. The tree at the time was about 11 years (11-16) old, and not to exceed, bark included, inches thick. I say about 11 years, for it takes some years not recorded on the section for a tree to attain six feet in height. 25 years later the tree had added about 2J inches to its radius. The next 17 years a little more than one inch to the .radius, making the diameter of the wood (bark not counted) about 8^ to inches. Since this another inch of wood has been added to the radius. Calling this 17 years,-(it is more rather than less, as the annual increment is constantly smaller,) we have the .total since the scar, 59 years.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACTD\">\u201c This oak tree, as shown by Prof. McBride, at a point where section examined by him was cut, was 8J to 8-J inches in diameter when 53 to 58 years old. Being 70 to 75 years old, it would have been 24 to 29 years old in 1850, and its diameter where blaze was found could not have exceeded 5 inches. As the blaze shows a face of fully eight inches, it is evident it .could not have been cut on a tree with a diameter of only five inches.- The diameter of this tree at base, where B X\u2019 mark was found, is now 15-inches: Applying the proportionate growth of tree as shown by Prof. McBride, and its diameter at base could not have exceeded 8.5 inches 46 years ago, and its size was not sufficient to have received the blaze now shown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b151-6\">\u201c Regarding the elm tree, also claimed to be a witness tree for the original Hendershott 52d mile point. This tree also has a large blaze about four feet from the ground. Nothing whatever was shown to prove that it ever had any mark upon it (prior to the time of a private survey made in 1893) other than the characters \u2018 S 28.\u2019- The letter \u2018 S,\u2019. if it ever existed, is now totally obliterated. The figure \u2018 2\u2019 is still plainly discernible, and a.part of the upper portion of a figure \u2018 8\u2019 to the right of the \u20182\u2019 can also be traced.. Nothing was shown to prove-..that it was ever marked at its base with the letters \u2018 B L/ ?.s it-should have been were it a Hendershott witness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>tree. Diligent search had evidently been made at some time .for this mark, as is plainly evidenced by the chopping at its base, and had the proper marks ever been found it is quite \u25a0certain the fact would have been in evidence before the commissioners.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b152-4\">\u201c The Hendershott notes show that at 30 links eastward of the 52d mile point the bank of a pond was reached, and that the pond itself was 250 links in width, making a distance of 280 links from the 52d mile point to the east bank of pond. The bank of. this pond directly east of the 52d mile point, -claimed to be witnessed by the \u2018 elm and oak,\u2019 has evidently moved eastward to some extent since 1850, as shown by present conditions. Measurements made by the commissioners show that 280 links eastward from the point claimed as the Hendershott 52d mile point reach a point 59 links east of the present bank of the pond. Thirty chains east of their 52d mile- point, as seen by their notes, the Hendershott line crossed the \u2018 Stokes \u2019 field fence. The line of this fence is still plainly visible. A line straight from the 52d mile point, claimed to be witnessed by the'Xelm and oak,\u2019 to 'the 54th mile point will pass at least 70 feetNsouth of the <em>\u2018 </em>Stokes\u2019 fence line, as noted by Hendershott. For . more than thirty years, and ;after the establishing of the boundary line by Hendershott -and Minor, it is claimed a road was maintained and worked as a Missouri road between'the 52d and 54th mile points, and that until within the past five years this fact was never questioned. It is claimed that the line recognized by parties living on both, sides of the boundary as being the Hendershott line since his survey and until within the past few years is now plainly shown for a very considerable distance between the 52d and 53d mile, points by the line of what is known as the Fugate fence line. It is claimed this fence was put up by one Fugate, the owner of land in and a resident of Iowa (and who was also a'surveyor), and who, living' as he did close to the line and present when the Hendershott survey was made, probably knew where the true line was and placed his fence on that line. This line very closely agrees with a line running -directly from Sullivan\u2019s 52d mile-point to the 54tb mile point, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>the last named having been satisfactorily identified and located by the commissioners-. It is claimed to be improbable that Fugate placed his fence north of the proper line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMv\">\u201c The commissioners, most carefully considered all the conditions relating to the point claimed to be the Hendershott 52d mile point and witnessed by the \u2018elm and oak,\u2019 but the more the matter was weighed the stronger became their conclusion that the trees mentioned could not have been the witness trees as claimed. Coincidences' of position constitute their claim. It is proper here to state that within a short distance to the north of the 52d mile point as established by the commissioners. are the stumps of an elm and burr oak which agree as well as do the other elm arid oak as to distance from the 51st mile point, better as to topographical conditions, and are very similar as to the relative position required by the field-notes for the witnesses to the 52d mile point. The commissioners have no idea that these stumps referred to were those of Hendershott\u2019s witness trees, but inake this state-' ment to show that .coincidences such as shown by the \u2018elm and oak\u2019 are not impossible. To have crossed the \u2018Stokes\u2019 fence, in a distance of 30 chains, starting from the suppositi-tious '52d mile point claimed to be witnessed by the elm and oak, an angle of at least 2\u00b0 to the left would have been necessary, and also another angle to the\u2019right equally great in order to run directly to the 54th mile point. Hendershott\u2019s notes make no mention of any such angles. The angle recorded as having been made at the '52d mile .point was 29' to the north, the. course having been changed, according to the Hendershott notes, from N-89\u00b0 6' E. to N. 88\u00b0 47* E. \"We are satisfied, from personal investigation and from points found and referred to our base line, that the -original Sullivan line can be readily traced from his 51st mile point to. Ms 52d mile point, and we believe it very probable that the Hender-shott line between, the 52d and 54th mile points is nearly identical with the Sullivan line. Whilst we did not adopt the Sullivan line between the points named, very good reasons could have been giv\u00e9ri for doihg so, The. Hendershott notes make no mention of Sullivan\u2019s line after leaving his 49th mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>point until bis 54th mile point was reached. They make no mention of finding Sullivan\u2019s 52d mile point or of any trees on his line; but they say in their report (page 4,10th Howard Report) that they discovered abundant blazes and many witness tre\u00e9s which enabled us to find and re-mark the said (Sullivan) line.as directed by the court.\u2019 Also on page <em>7, </em>same report, it .is stated:- \u2018 <em>But in heavy bodies of timber no difficulty was experienced in discovering evidences of the precise location of the </em>(Sullivan) line, <em>not only by </em>blazes, <em>but by line and witness trees.\u2019 </em>(Italics are ours.) And on the same page, The genera! topography of the country, and especially the crossing of the streams, greatly facilitated us in following the line, and in some instances, when confirmed by the old blazes, enabled us to establish it. with sufficient certainty.\u2019 Commencing some ten chains east of the 51st mile point, the country through which the boundary' line passes was and is heavily timbered, and, as before stated, the Sullivan line in the timber is at this time readily to be found. The inference that the Hendershott line eastward from the 51st mile was nearly identical with the Sullivan line' is quite as strong as the contrary, notwithstanding .no mention is made by Hendershott of the Sullivan line after leaving a point 6.20 chains east of the 49th mile point until reaching the 54th mile point.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b154-4\">\u201c The. Sullivan line, between the 51st and 52d mile points, as shown by his field-notes, crossed the east .fork of Grand River (now called Weldon) three times. This, line now, by reason of changes in the bed of the stream, will cross the Weldon five times. With the exception of the .\u2018elm and oak,\u2019 there were no traditional or apparent evidences claimed as indicating the original location of the Hendershott and Minor 52d mile point. A line run eastward with the bearings given by the Hendershott notes from their 51st mile point would pass at least 40 feet south .of the point indicated by the elm and oak.\u2019 A line run eastward, as per the Hendershott notes, from the point claimed as the Hendershott and Minor,52d mile point would pass at least 90 feet south of their 54th mile point. The commissioners carefully considered all the comparatively authentic traces of the Hendershott'line, together <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>with the topographical conditions given in the notes of the survey. Between the 53d and 54th mile points were found evidences of the Hendershott line, which were satisfactory, and the line established by us was run from the 54th mile-, point, which,' as before stated, was identified, directly to <em>th\u00e9 </em>52d mile point and passing through the points found between the 53d and 54th mile points.

' The decree of your honorable court made January 3, 1851, declared that the line should- be direct between each Hendershott mile point, and it is evident that the actual courses between the points referred to above are not in. accordance with the recorded courses. It was found by reference to our base.line in all cases where the field-notes show a straight line between such points that when the distance recorded as a straight line -was two or more \"miles the line is actually a curve. The. ordinates measured from the base line - do not show any regular rate of curvature, and the curves themselves swing to the south and then to the north, the base line crossing the boundary line three times in twenty miles. The greatest distance of base line from boundary line is at the 55th mile point, which is about 247 feet north of base. The 46 th mile point is 160 feet south and the 60th mile point 153 feet south of base.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-7\">\u201c It is difficult to account for the discrepancies found between the recorded line as shown in Hendershott\u2019s notes and. the line actually found.

Of twenty-one mile points from the 40th to the 60tli, inclusive, Sullivan had witness trees for fifteen. Some of these witness trees can .now be found, and also well defined line trees mentioned by'him. On Hendershott\u2019s line only eight mile points out of the twenty-one- referred to were witnessed by trees. Had the care shown by Sullivan in marking his line been exercised--by Hendershott and Minor the line of the latter would have been much more fully <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>and satisfactorily defined. The hurried manner in which the work of the Hendershott survey 'was performed (151 miles of relocation, in addition to random lines, having been accomplished in 30 days) may in some measure account for the great lack of witness trees and other evidences necessary for an actual location of the boundary' line of 1850. We are inclined to the opinion that, so far as regards the twenty miles mentioned, the Sullivan line can be as readily relocated as can the Hendershott line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b157-4\">\u201cThe decree of your honorable court requires that the line relocated by us shall be marked with durable monuments.' Twenty-one mile points included in the line relocated, being from the 40th. to the 00th mile, inclusive, are now marked .as required. The 40th, 50th and 60 th m'iles are marked with the cast-iron monuments originally placed by Hendershott and Minor, in 1850. Mile points intermediate are marked with stone monuments. .

X.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWF\">\u201c Not only do the bearings differ from those recorded in that report^ but portions of the line which are there called straight were found to be curved or.composed of broken lines.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-8\">\u201cUnder these.conditions it seemed inexpedient to attempt to reproduce upon the ground the courses and distances of the former survey.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-9\">\u201c Such an attempt would undoubtedly have led to serious confusion, and would have furnished little information, of real value, while the labor of making the necessary corrections would have been excessive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aps\">\u201c In place of that undesirable plan I adopted, with your approval, the method of measuring a base line straight across the country for the twenty miles to be surveyed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-12\">\u201c All of the old points which were recovered and all new points which it became necessary to locate upon the ground were directly referred to the base line, which, from a mathematical point of view, is the axis of abscissae in a system of rectangular coordinates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUBS\"><em>\u201c </em>It seems scarcely necessary to mention the advantages which this method affords in point of simplicity and accuracy of work, but it m\u00e1y do no harm to allude very briefly to a few of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARh\">\u201c Thus the relative positions and bearings of different portions of the boundary can be readily found with far greater precision than would otherwise be easily practicable.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b159-15\">\u201c Moreover, in this system of work each .point of the boun-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>clary is fixed independently of every other point,- all being directly referred to the base line. This characteristic permits any desired local correction to be made at any point without necessarily affecting points on either side, a feature which I consider very essential in work of this character. The base line was so selected as to lie,along the general direction of the boundary, which in fact crosses it three times, eleven of the twenty-one monuments being north of the. base and the other ten south of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-4\">This statement well illustrates both the irregularity of the \u25a0boundary and the fact that the base line is \"very close\u2019to the general direction of the line.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-5\">\u201cAnother important consideration in the selection of the base line was to make it pass through the towns of Pleasanton and Lineville without meeting obstructions and without, damaging private prop\u00e9rty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">\u201c This was successfully accomplished, and in the whole course of the line remarkably little tree-cutting was needful. The base line was ranged out with an eight-inch theodolite, the standards of which were, high enough to permit the telescope to transit. The telescope was of excellent quality and was provided with an eye-piece micrometer, by means of which slight deviations from the straight line could be me\u00e1sured and corrected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-7\">\u201cAs-the work-of locating the base line advanced eastward the party was moved to Lineville, Iowa, which town is situated just north of the boundary line and \u25a0 between the fifty-sixth and fifty-seventh mile posts, and thenceforward operations were conducted from either Lineville or Pleasanton, as was found more convenient .'from time to time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-8\">\u201c As soon as the line was opened, and even before the final adjustment of its -eastern terminus, the linear measurement was .begun by Mr. Baldwin, with the .assistance of the commissioners, working westward from the east end of the base, near-the sixty-mile monument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-9\">\u201c\u201cWhen about five and one-half miles had been so measured I was ready to take personal charge of the measurement, and began at the west end of the base, near the forty-mile monument, working thence eastward to a junction with, the line above mentioned.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>\u201c Th'e.system of measurement employed was that ordinarily used in the Coast and Geodetic Survey for direct'measures not requiring the base'apparatus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">.\u201cA narrow steel tape, twenty-five metres in length between end marks, was stretched under a tension of ten kilogrammes, as indicated by a spring balance attached to one end of the tape. \u2022 The \"successive tape-lengths. were marked on stakes driven into the ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">\u201c As the tape necessarily follows very closely the inclination of the-ground, the horizontal distance will be' less than the measured distance, and the correction for slope must be computed for each tape-length, the difference of height' between the ends being determined by spirit-level. The very irregular profile of this line made these differences of' height \"unusually great, and correspondingly increased the amount of correction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">\u201c A small correction for catenary is also necessary when the tape swings clear of the ground, the \u2018 sag \u2019 of the tape slightly decreasing the distance between it's- ends. Further, as all metallic measures vary in length with changes of temperature, it is necessary to apply a correction for such variations, the length of the tape being known at the temperature of zero, Centigrade.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-8\">\u201c Temperatures were accordingly .noted at frequent intervals, usually at every fourth tape.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-9\">\u201cThe direct measurement was\" completed on May 8th, although the eastern part of the lirie had still to be levelled. . \u25a0 <em>\u201c </em>The computations were at. once taken'in hand and the resulting distances were furnished you as rapidly as possible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-10\">\u201c These results, for present purposes and as compared with ordinary measures, may be considered- practically'\u00e9xact, and they show that the chain used by the surveyors of 1850 was too long, probably from the combined effects of abrasion and of high temperature. -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-11\">\u201c The' distances between such of the old-points as were recovered are nearly always too great.

The eastern end of this mile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>'was not' recovered, but was found with reasonable certainty from various considerations, while the reputed point at the western end was recovered. The mile so determined is noticeably less than a statute mile. The western part of this mile traverses a very steep, rough, and wooded country, while its \u25a0eastern part crossed the Weldon River three times in 1850.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-4\">\u201cTh\u00e9se natural difficulties in the way of accurate measure-' ment probably caused the shortage in this particular mile.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-5\">\u201cIn my own work I found it desirable to avoid the direct measurement of this mile, which is even more unfavorable \u2018now than in 1850, the Weldon having changed its course sufficiently to cross the base line five times at present.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-6\">\u201c For this purpose a branch base about seven-eighths-'of a mile in length was measured on the flat ground- east of the Weldon, and the distance across the broken section was then obtained with great precision by triangulation. The distances across the,Grand River and Little River were also obtained by triangulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5g\">\u201c Whenever in the course of the measurement we passed a point which 'it was desirable to refer to the base line, the point at which its rectangular ordinate met the base line was noted and the length of the ordinate itself was measured. The relative positions of these various points thus became known, including not only such, of the mile points as could be identified, but also numerous objects commonly reputed to mark the.boundary, \u00e1s fences, trees, stones, etc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-8\">\u201cAs far as possible in- connection with the measurement, notes were made to provide material for a topographic sketch of the strip of country traversed by the boundary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-9\">. \u201cAs stated above, the measurement was completed on May 8th. As rapidly as the reductions were computed the places' for the mile stones were marked on the ground from the fortieth to the forty-ninth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b162-10\">\u201c The weather, which up to that time had been generally favorable, now became very. wet. The frequent and heavy rains seriously interfered with the work, and rendered progress across the country very slow, the roads being nearly impassable and the fords quite so. On May 18th the exigencies of the regular work of the Coast and Geodetic Survey com; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>pelled the detachment of Mr. A. L.
