In .December, 1888, the bank became insolvent, and the Comptroller of the Currency on January 14, 1889, appointed one S. P. Young receiver thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-6\">July 19, 1890, petitioner began his- suit in equity in the Superior Court of- the'' city and county of San Francisco against the bank, Richard P. Thomas, Robert R. Thompson, Richard A. Wilson, and S. P. Young as receiver, \u201cand therein and thereby, on behalf of said bank and himself, as a representative stockholder therein, specially set up and claimed the right to hold said defendants Thomas, .Thompson and Wilson, as officers and trustees and directors of said bank, accountable to it in equity, under and in pursuance of the statutes and laws of the United States, for sundry breaches of their trust as such officers, directors and trustees,\u201d eto. s</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b470-7\">Thomas was the president, and with-Thompson and Wilson formed the executive committee of the board of directors of the bank.

The referee reported to . the court a total loss of $166,919 suffered by the bank by reason of the acts and omissions of tlie defendants, but not the amount for which each was severally responsible. Thereafterwards Thompson and Wilson paid into. court $27,500, whereupon the court made an order dismissing them from the suit, and on November 20, 1894, rendered judgment for the plaintiff for the use and' benefit of the bank against Thomas for $139,419', with interest at seven per cent per annum from December 15,18S8, being for the sum of $166,919, reported by the referee, less the $27,500 paid by Thompson and Wilson. Thomas appealed from this judgment to the Supreme Court of California, and that court held that the dismissal of Thompson .and Wilson was a retraxit and operated in law as a full satisfaction of the cause of action, and upon that ground reversed the judgment against Thomas and entered a per-' sonal judgment against Chetwood for costs, etc. <em>Chetwood, </em>v. <em>California National </em>Bank, 113 California, 414; 45 Pac.

This writ of error was allowed by Mr. Justice Field, who .approved a bond and signed a citation running in the name of the California National Bank of San Francisco as plaintiff in . error to Richard P. Thomas as defendant in error, service of which on Thomas, Stateler, S. P. Young and R.A. Wilson was accepted. Chetwood also accepted service, but asked that he be entered as a plaintiff in error, and that for that purpose the writ of error be amended.. The case was docketed by the clerk of this court as No. 673, under the title of <em>California National Bank of San Francisco </em>v. <em>Bichard P. Thomas.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-5\">The receiver of the bank never authorized or aided in the prosecution of the \"suit, nor claimed nor attempted to take control or possession thereof, nor of the judgment entered therein, nor of any part of the $27,500 paid into the stat\u00e9 court by Thompson and Wilson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-6\">The Comptroller of the Currency in July, 1894, had paid all the creditors of the bank whose claims had been proven or allowed, except shareholders who might have been creditors of the bank, together with'all the expenses of the receivership, and' the redemption of the bank\u2019s notes having been provided for by deposit of lawful money therefor with the United States Treasurer, a meeting of the stockholders of the bank was called pursuant to the act of August 3, 1892, c. 360, 27 Stat. 345, at which Thomas, holding nine hundred and sixty shares of the stock and controlling sixty shares more, threw, as is alleged, one thousand and twenty votes, being a majority, in favor of discontinuing the receiver, and of the selection of T. K. Stateler as agent of the bank to succeed the receiver, Young, in the settlement of its affairs. Stateler was thereupon d\u00e9clared elected, Chetwood protesting, and on February 26, 1895, the Comptroller, and the receiver executed an assignment of all assets of said bank then in their hands or subject to their order or control to said Stateler.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b472-7\">On March ,19, 1895, and pending the appeal\u2019of Thomas in the Supreme Court of the State, Stateler voluntarily appeared in the Superior Court of S\u00e1n Francisco and moved for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>order directing that so much of the $27,500 as then'remained in that court be paid over to him, which motion was resisted by petitioner and denied by the Superior Court. ' From this order Stateler appealed to the Supreme Court of the State,' which reversed it and directed that the .money\" be paid over to- him. 113 California, 649. Petitioner thereupon'sued out a writ of error from this court, which was allowed by the Chief Justice of California, citation duly issued and served, bond approved and, as the money was in custody of \"the Superior Court and drawing interest, the writ was made a supersedeas:. The record was filed in this court and the cause docketed as No. 674.

Such receiver shall pay over all moneys so made to the Treasurer of the United States, subject to the order of the Comptroller, and also make report to the Comptroller of all his acts and proceedings.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-4\">By the act of June 30,1ST6, <em>c. </em>156,19 Stat. 63, the authority-of the Comptroller to appoint a receiver was given, under the circumstances enumerated, and, among them, whenever the Comptroller became satisfied on examination of its affairs that the bank was insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b481-5\">The substitution of an agent for the receiver is provided for by the act of June 30, 1876, as amended by the act of August 3, 1892, c. 360, 27 Stat. .345. When .the Comptroller has paid the debts of the particular bank, not including shareholders who are creditors-of such association, and all expenses,- and the redemption of the bank\u2019s circulating notes shall have been provided for as prescribed, the Comptroller calls a meeting of the shareholders, at which they determine by-a majority vote whether the receiver shall be continued to wind up the affairs of .the bank, or an agent shall be appointed for that purpose. \u201c In case the. said meeting shall by a vote of a majority of the stock in value .and number of shares determine that an agent shall be- elected, the said meeting shall thereupon proceed to elect an agent,', voting by .ballot, in person or by .proxy, each share of, stock entitling the holder to one vote, and the person who\u2019shall receive votes representing at least a majority of stock in value and number shall be declared the agent for the purposes, hereinafter provided, and whenever any of the shareholders of- the association shall, after the election of such, agent, have executed and filed a bond to the satisfaction of the Comptroller of the Currency, conditioned \u25a0for the payment and discharge in full of each and every claim \u2019that may thereafter be proved and allowed by and before a competent court, and for \u25a0 the faithful performance of all and singular the duties of such trust, the Comptroller and the receiver shall thereupon transfer and deliver to such agent all the undivided or uncollected' or .other assets of such association then remaining in the hands or subject to the order and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>control of said Comptroller and said receiver, or either of them ; and for this purpose said Comptroller and said receiver are hereby severally empowered and directed to execute any deed, assignment, transfer or other instrument in writing that may b.e necessary and proper, and upon the execution and delivery of such instrument to the said agent the said Comptroller and the said receiver shall by virtue of - this act be discharged from any-and all liabilities to-such association,' and to .each and all the creditors and shareholders thereof. Upon receiving such deed, assignment,. transfer or other instrument, the person elected such agent shall hold, control and dispose of the assets and property of smell association which he may receive under the terms hereof, for the benefit of the shareholders of such association, and he may in his own name, or in the name of such association, sue and be sued, and do all other lawful acts and things necessary to finally settle and distribute \u2022the assets and property in his hands, and. may sell, compromise or compound the debts due to such association, with the consent and approval of the Circuit or District Court of the United States. for the district where the business of such association was carried on, and shall at the conclusion of his trust render to such District \u25a0 or Circuit Court a full account of all his proceedings, receipts and expenditures as such agent, which court shall, upon due notice,' settle and adjust such accounts and discharge said agent and the sureties upon said bond.\u201d .</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b482-4\"><em>Mr. A.

S. 164, 181, that \u201c no rule is better settled than that when a court has appointed a receiver, his possession is the possession of the court, for the benefit of the parties to .the suit and all concerned, and cannot be disturbed without the leave of the court; and that if any person, without leave, intentionally interferes with such possession, he necessarily commits a contempt of court, and is liable to punishment therefor.\u201d But we do not regard these proceedings as falling within that rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">As neither the bank\u2019s officers or directors, nor the receiver, nor the Comptroller, would, on demand, bring suit, Chetwood\u2019s suit on behalf of himself and other stockholders of the California National Bank of San Francisco to recover judgment in the bank\u2019s favor for the alleged wrongful acts of the managing agents of the corporation, must be assumed, on this record, to have been' properly, instituted, and it is not contended that this was ever challenged.by the receiver or by Stateler claiming as his successor. The receiver was made a party defendant thereto, but took no steps to remove the cause to the Federal court, and, as is averred, assumed a.n attitude of hostility to the prosecution of the suit, and did nothing to aid in securing judgment against the officers of the bank, whose alleged breach of trust and liability therefor was the sole foundation for the action. Nor is it questioned that the suit was rightly brought in the state court. <em>Whittemore </em>v. <em>Amoskeag National Bank, </em>134 U. S. 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The receiver was appointed by the Comptroller of the Currency, January 14, 1889,'and Chetwood commenced his suit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>July 19, 1890. The receiver was not the officer of any court but the agent and officer of the United States, as ruled by Mr. Justice Gray, on circuit, in <em>Price </em>v. Abbott, 17 Fed. Rep. 506, and by Mr. Justice Jackson, then Circuit Judge, in <em>Armstrong </em>v. Trautman, 36 Fed. Rep. 275. And see <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Sabin, </em>149 U. S. 473, 479; <em>Platt </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>2 Ren. 303 ; <em>Frelinghuysen </em>v. Baldwin, 12 Fed. Rep. 395; <em>Armstrong </em>v. <em>Ettlesohn, </em>36 Fed. Rep. 209.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-4\">It has been so often decided that the authority vested in the Comptroller to appoint a receiver of- a defaulting dr insolvent national bank, or to call for a ratable assessment upon its stockholders, is. not open to objection because vesting that officer with judicial power- in violation of the Constitution, that we have recently declined to reexamine that question. <em>Bushnell </em>v. <em>Leland, </em>164 U. S. 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">, The' receiver acts under the control of the Comptroller of the Currency and the\"moneys collected by him are paid over-to the Comptroller, who disburses them to the creditors of the insolvent bank. Under section 5234 of the Revised Statutes, when the receiver deems it desirable to sell or compound bad or doubtful debts, or to sell the real and personal property of the bank, it devolves upon him to procure \u201c the order of a court of record of competent jurisdiction,\u201d but the funds. arising therefrom are disbursed by the Comptroller, as in the instance of other collections.</p>\n<p id=\"ABO\">The Circuit Court did not have the assets or property of this bank in its possession on July 19, 1890, nor was the leave of that court necessary in order that the receiver might- be. made a party defendant to the action instituted by Ohetwood on that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In the bill filed by Stateler in the Circuit Court, January 4, 1896, to enjoin Ohetwood and the bank, the averm\u00e9iit is. made .that on February 21, 1889, the receiver filed an application in the. Circuit Court entitled <em>In re </em>application of receiver of the California National Bank'for the sale of personal property,\u201d- and the bill -asserts as a conclusion of' law that .thereby \u201c the-said receiver submitted', himself, and the; affairs of said banking association to the . jurisdiction of this honorable court.\u201d' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>The application . thus referred to is not made part of the return to the rule, but from the ayerments of the bill in regard to it,, and from the terms of the national banking law itself, we think it plain that no such result followed its presentation. Our attention has been called to no case in which it has been held that the filing of such .petitions by national bank receivers in the Federal courts operates to make the receiver an officer of the court or to place the assets- of .the bank within the control of the court in the sense in which control is acquired where a receiver is appointed by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-4\">As we. have said, Ohetwood\u2019s right to bring the suit in the state court against .the officers of the bank must be held as not open to dispute on this record, and the bank was properly made a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">Whether the bank\u2019s name was necessarily or rightly used in the prosecution of the writs of error, we are not now called, on-to decide.</p>\n<p id=\"AKyN\">The suit was properly brought in the. state court, proceeded to judgment, and was carried-to the Supreme Court of California on appeal. These courts undeniably had jurisdiction over the suit and the parties. About four .years after -the suit was commenced, Stateler was ele-'ted agent to succeed the receiver, and the usual assignment by the Comptroller and receiver, to him as such, was executed. The legality of State-. ler\u2019s election, though controverted, must be conceded for the, purposes of this application. But did th\u00e9 substitution of an agent for the receiver oust the jurisdiction of the state court? Certainly not. He was no more an officer of the Circuit Court in the. first instance than the receiver was. -The agent proceeds in the settlement with, like authority- to that conferred upon the receiver, although at the conclusion of his duty he' is required to render to the Circuit- or District Court of the United-States, for the district wh\u00e9re the- business of the bank is carried on \u201ca full account of alb his proceedings,-receipts- and expenditures as such agent, which court shall, upon due notice, settle and adjust such. accounts and discharge . said agent and the sureties upon said bond\u201d ; and thus he and his-bondsmen are protected by the final order of the Federal. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>\u2022court upon the performance of. the conditions imposed. But there is nothing in the language of the statute from which it can be inferred that it was the intention that the jurisdiction of state courts of competent and concurrent' jurisdiction, first obtained, should be interfered with by restraining. orders issued by Federal courts on the application of such an agent. The agent may indeed intervene in a case in the state court and receive the fruits of the litigation to be administered subject to the final approval of the Federal court, and, accordingly, Stateler as agent submitted himself to the jurisdiction of the state courts and applied for an order turning over to him the fund so far as realized. Nevertheless the agent must abide the result and cannot control it through the interposition of another independent and concurrent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">The doctrine is firmly established that where the jurisdiction of a court, and the right of a plaintiff to prosecute his suit in it, have once attached, that right cannot be arrested or taken away by. proceedings in another court, and that where property is actually in the possession of one court of competent jurisdiction such possession cannot be disturbed by process out'of another court of concurrent jurisdiction. <em>Moran </em>v. Sturges, 154 U, S. 256, and cases cited. And by section 720 of the Revised Statutes the granting of injunctions to stay proceedings, in any court of a State is prohibited in express terms. It is unnecessary here to point out such exceptions or limitations as may exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Obviously the Circuit Court could not restrain the prosecution of this suit in the state courts, and we are equally clear that if Federal questions arose, th\u00e9 Circuit Court could not prevent this court, or a justice thereof, or the presiding judge -of the, state court, from granting writs of error, by restrain-' ing the parties from applying therefor; nor could it properly direct- their dismissal,..having been granted. Cases transferred to this court must be dealt with by this court. Of course it-Ts~quite possible that the litigation had gone far enough after the-state Supreme Court had passed upon it, but parties cannot be deprived of the right to prolong it, if the right exists, in this manner and under such circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Considered apart from the construction placed upon it by the Circuit Court, we should say that the injunction order of February 24, 1896, was not intended to restrain either Chet-wood or the bank, or both, from prosecuting the writs of error from this court. The concluding words of the order are <em>\u201c </em>but the defendants are not hereby enjoined from prosecuting or defending to final determination any actions in this matter now pending in the Supreme Court of the State of California or in this court.\u201d According to the practice in this court a writ of error has been treated rather as a continuation of the original litigation than the commencement of a new action, <em>Nations </em>v. Johnson, 24 How. 195, 205 ; <em>Cohens </em>v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 410; but in any view we should not have thought that writs of error were included within the scope of the order, or that the Circuit Court designed to interfere in such a way with the prosecution of the principal controversy as to arbitrarily stop the case on the judgment of the Supreme Court of the State if it proved adverse to the bank and its interested stockholders, and leave them, if such order were lawful, wholly without further remedy, if such they had ; or to preclude one of the parties from attempting to obtain a review.of the judgment in the matter of the rights of Stateler, however that might be determined in the Supreme Court of the State, whose decisions on both appeals were rendered after .the entry of the restraining order..</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The Circuit Court, however, has otherwise construed the order, and has adjudged petitioner and his counsel guilty of contempt in its violation as thus construed. And it has .directed petitioner to dismiss one of the writs of error and to desist from using the name of the bank in the' other, in advance of what we may determine as to either of these' matters when coming on to be disposed of. .</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">As in our opinion the Circuit Court exceeded its jurisdic: tion in thus proceeding, we are constrained to make the rule absolute.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">By section 14 of the Judiciary Act of September 24, 1189 (1 Stat. 81, c. 20), carried forward as section 716 of the Revised Statutes, this court and the Circuit and District Courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>of the United States were empowered by Congress \u201cto issue all writs, not specifically provided for by statute, which may be agreeable to the usages and principles of law \u201d; and, unddr this provision, we can undoubtedly issue- writs of certiorari in all proper cases. <em>Amer. Construction Co. </em>v<em>. Jacksonville </em>Railway, 148 U. S. 372, 380. And although, as observed in that case,' this writ has not been issued as freely by this court as by the Court of Queen\u2019s Bench in England, and, prior to the act of March 3, 1891, c. 517, :26 Stat. 826, had been ordinarily used as an auxiliary process merely, yet, whenever the circumstances imperatively demand \"that form of interposition the writ may be allowed, as at common law, to correct excesses of jurisdiction and in furtherance of justice. Tidd\u2019s Prac. *398; Bac. Ab., Certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"AnMk\">Judgments in proceedings in contempt, are not re viewable here on appeal or error, <em>Hayes </em>v. Fischer, 102 U. S. 121; <em>In re </em>Debs, 158 U. S. 564, 573 ; 159 U. S. 251; but they may be reached by certiorari in the absence of any other adequate remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">The writ. of certiorari will be allowed to bring up the record so that the order adjudging Chet wood and his counsel \u25a0in contempt for being concerned in suing out the writs of error, and directing them, or either of them, to refrain from prosecuting the one writ in the name of the bank and to \u2022dismiss the other, may be revised and annulled. We presume, after what we have said, it will not be necessary for \u2022 the writ to issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\"><em>Rule absolute </em>/ <em>Certiorari allowed.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
