(Mother) appeals the judgment terminating her parental rights over Amber, Samuel, and Destiny M. She contends the court abused its discretion by denying her modification petition (Welf. &amp; Inst. Code, \u00a7 388)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and by terminating her parental rights without receiving information about Amber\u2019s and Samuel\u2019s wishes (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (h)), deprived her of her constitutional right to call Amber as a witness, and erred by failing to find the children would benefit from a continued relationship with her (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A)). We agree with the last contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-10\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b604-11\">In August 1999, when Amber, Samuel, and Destiny were almost five years old, two and one-half years old, and seven months old, the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency (the Agency) filed dependency petitions because Mother left Destiny alone in a bathtub full of water, where she was found submerged and almost drowned. Amber and Samuel were detained in Polinsky Children\u2019s Center, and then with their maternal grandmother (Grandmother), and Destiny was detained in a foster home. Amber and Samuel were then placed with Grandmother and Destiny was placed in a foster home. By November 5, Destiny had also been placed with Grandmother.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-12\">Near the end of October 1999, Samuel started a 60-day trial visit with Mother. Around Thanksgiving weekend, Mother relapsed into drug use. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>moved into a residential treatment facility with Samuel where she had contact with Brett S., Amber\u2019s and Samuel\u2019s father, in violation of the terms of the 60-day visit. In January 2000, she left the facility, took Samuel to the home of her father (Grandfather), and left him there. Samuel was then placed with Grandfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">Around October 2000, Mother relapsed again: she had one positive drug test. She reentered residential treatment, left after two months, then returned to the treatment program in January 2001. In August, she filed her section 388 petition, requesting the court vacate its April 12, 18-month review hearing order setting a section 366.26 hearing and place the children with her or, alternatively, that it provide her additional services under section 366.3. As changes of circumstances or new evidence, she alleged that she had obtained suitable housing, maintained 338 days of sobriety, graduated from domestic violence and drug treatment programs, completed a program for parents of sexually abused children,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and participated in therapy with Amber and Samuel.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The hearing on Mother\u2019s section 388 petition and the section 366.26 hearing took place from September through November 2001. Amber and Destiny remain with Grandmother, who wishes to adopt them, and Samuel remains with Grandfather, who wishes to adopt him.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">Section 388 Petition</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">The juvenile court may modify an order if a parent shows, by a preponderance of the evidence, changed circumstance or new evidence and that modification would promote the child\u2019s best interests. (\u00a7 388; <em>In re Michael B. </em>(1992) 8 Cal.App.4th 1698, 1703 [11 Cal.Rptr.2d 290].) This is determined by the seriousness of the problem leading to the dependency and the reason for its continuation; the strength of the parent-child and child-caretaker bonds and the time the child has been in the system; and the nature of the change of circumstance, the ease by which it could be achieved, and the reason it did not occur sooner. <em>(In re Kimberly F. </em>(1997) 56 Cal.App.4th 519, 530-532 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 495].) After termination of services, the focus shifts from the parent\u2019s custodial interest to the child\u2019s need for permanency and stability. <em>(In re Stephanie M. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 295, 317 [27 Cal.Rptr.2d 595, 867 P.2d 706].) \u201cWhether a previously made order should be modified rests within the dependency court\u2019s discretion, and its determination will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is clearly established.\u201d <em>(In re Michael B., supra, </em>8 Cal.App.4th at p. 1704.) The denial of a section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>388 motion rarely merits reversal as an abuse of discretion. <em>(In re Kimberly F., supra, </em>56 Cal.App.4th at p. 522.)</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">Here, in addition to nearly drowning Destiny, Mother abused drugs, engaged in a violent relationship with Brett S., and neglected the children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Despite a one-year voluntary services contract beginning in September 1996, a second voluntary contract beginning just before the inception of this case, and a reunification period extending over more than 18 months, Mother\u2019s serious parenting deficiencies had not been fully remedied by the time of the section 388 hearing. For example, her lack of empathy for the children was evident in her testimony that while Amber and Destiny had lived with Grandmother for two years and were bonded with her, removing them suddenly from Grandmother\u2019s home would not be detrimental or cause any emotional harm.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, although Mother had sought information and advice from Samuel\u2019s therapist, Mother did not understand Samuel\u2019s psychological difficulties and during a conjoint session had resisted Samuel\u2019s attempts to interact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-5\">While by the time of the section 388 hearing Mother had completed domestic violence and sexual abuse treatment and the residential portion of her substance abuse program, for most of the dependency her visitation with the children remained supervised. Her substance abuse had begun more than 17 years earlier and while she had been clean for 372 days, she had previously relapsed twice during the course of this case, once after more than 300 days of sobriety. Furthermore, the coordinator of Mother\u2019s drug treatment program testified that Mother was in the early stages of recovery and Mother\u2019s sponsor testified that Mother was only on step three of her 12-step program.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-6\">The children had been out of Mother\u2019s care for more than two years, with the exception of Samuel\u2019s approximately two-month trial visit. Although the children enjoyed visits and Amber and Samuel loved and missed Mother and called her \u201cmom,\u201d the children were attached to Grandmother and Grandfather. The social worker believed that returning the children to Mother would \u201cgreatly jeopardize their safety, stability, progress, and consistency\u201d and that while Mother loved the children and had progressed, she would not be able to maintain her recovery activities and be the primary caretaker for her three active children. The court appointed special advocate (CASA) also recommended against the children\u2019s return to Mother, noting that she was not ready to handle them on her own. Finally, at the time of the hearing, Mother <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>was living in a sober living housing unit that would not accommodate the children, and the waiting time for a unit that would accommodate them was up to 90 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">The above facts lead us to conclude that the juvenile court did not abuse its discretion by determining that while Mother was progressing in treatment, return to her custody would not be in the children\u2019s best interests. Nor did the court err by concluding that section 366.3\u2019s provision regarding services applies only after the selection of a permanent plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">Amber\u2019s and Samuel\u2019s Wishes</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">Section 366.26, subdivision (h) provides that at the section 366.26 hearing, \u201cthe court shall consider the wishes of the child.\u201d Additionally, section 366.21, subdivision (i)(5) states: \u201cWhenever a court orders that a hearing pursuant to Section 366.26 shall be held, it shall direct the [Agency] to prepare an assessment that shall include: [i] ... [i] ... a statement from the child concerning placement and the adoption or guardianship, unless the child\u2019s age or physical, emotional, or other condition precludes his. or her meaningful response, and if so, a description of the condition.\u201d  While there is some disagreement whether evidence of the child\u2019s wishes must reflect his or her awareness that termination of parental rights is at issue (compare <em>In re Diana G. </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1468, 1480 [13 Cal.Rptr.2d 645] with <em>In re Leo M. </em>(1993) 19 Cal.App.4th 1583, 1592-1593 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 253]), it is clear that a direct statement from the child is not required where this is contrary to the child\u2019s best interest <em>(Leo M., </em>at p. 1592).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">Here, both Amber and Samuel expressed conflicting wishes about staying with Grandmother and Grandfather or living with Mother. The social worker testified that she did not ask Amber or Samuel what permanent plan they would like because of Samuel\u2019s age and both children\u2019s intense therapeutic needs, and that such a discussion should take place in therapy sessions and should be postponed so as to avoid more trauma and confusion. The social worker believed that Amber and Samuel would be emotionally unable to understand the permanency issue. Both children\u2019s therapists had told the social worker that before discussing a permanent plan with the children, they needed a decision from the court on that matter. Samuel\u2019s therapist testified that he had told her that he was \u201cnot done living with [Grandfather],\u201d which meant that he was not ready to move. Amber\u2019s therapist testified that Amber did not have the capacity to express an opinion about adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The court did not abuse its discretion with regard to receiving information about Amber\u2019s and Samuel\u2019s wishes.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>Amber\u2019s Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">On September 21, 2001, the second day of the eight-day section 388 hearing, Mother\u2019s counsel asked that Amber be made available to testify, asserting that she had just received information that she was \u201cstill developing\u201d and might result in an offer of proof. Counsel for the Agency objected, noting that Amber was not on the witness list and had not attended the Kids in Court program. Amber\u2019s counsel also objected, stating that if the court granted the request she would need time to investigate the possibility of making Amber unavailable as a witness. The court denied Mother\u2019s request, citing its untimeliness. The section 388 hearing concluded on October 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">On November 7, 2001, at the end of the first day of the two-day section 366.26 hearing, Mother asked that Amber be made available to testify. The Agency\u2019s counsel again noted that Amber was not on the witness list and said that a statement from her therapist regarding detriment would be in order. Mother\u2019s counsel made an offer of proof that Amber would testify that she did not want Mother\u2019s parental rights terminated and that they had a strong relationship. Amber\u2019s counsel cited the testimony of Amber\u2019s therapist that Amber lacked the capacity to express an opinion about adoption and stated that counsel would have to speak with the therapist and that Amber would have to attend Kids in Court. The court denied Mother\u2019s request as untimely and possibly detrimental to Amber\u2019s mental health. The section 366.26 hearing concluded on November 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-8\">There was a time span of approximately four weeks between Mother\u2019s request at the section 388 hearing and the conclusion of that hearing, and a time span of approximately three weeks between her request at the section 366.26 hearing and the conclusion of that hearing. Thus, arguably there would have been sufficient time for any necessary investigation and for Amber to attend Kids in Court before she would have testified. Mother is incorrect, however, in asserting that there was no evidence that it would be detrimental for Amber to testify. According to the social worker, Amber\u2019s therapist stated that it would be detrimental to discuss permanency with Amber until the court had ordered a permanent plan. Moreover, there was ample testimony about Amber\u2019s relationship with Mother; Amber expressed conflicting wishes about staying with Grandmother and living with Mother; and Amber\u2019s therapist testified that Amber did not have the capacity to express an opinion about adoption.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-10\">The court did not deprive Mother of her constitutional right by denying her request to call Amber as a witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>Beneficial Relationship</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">Section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1) allows termination of parental rights upon clear and convincing evidence of adoptability. An exception exists if \u201c[t]he parents . . . have maintained regular visitation and contact with the child and the child would benefit from continuing the relationship.\u201d (\u00a7 366.26, subd. (c)(1)(A).) A beneficial relationship is one that \u201cpromotes the well-being of the child to such a degree as to outweigh the well-being the child would gain in a permanent home with new, adoptive parents.\u201d <em>(In re Autumn H. </em>(1994) 27 Cal.App.4th 567, 575 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 535].) The existence of this relationship is determined by \u201c[t]he age of the child, the portion of the child\u2019s life spent in the parent\u2019s custody, the \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019 effect of interaction between parent and child, and the child\u2019s particular needs.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 576.)</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">Examining the evidence in the light most favorable to the judgment, we conclude that not only did Mother maintain regular visitation and contact, but she also met her burden of showing a beneficial relationship. <em>(In re Autumn H., supra, </em>27 Cal.App.4th at pp. 576-577; <em>In re Cristella C. </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 1363, 1373 [8 Cal.Rptr.2d 342].) At the time the section 366.26 hearing ended, Amber, Samuel, and Destiny were seven, nearly five, and nearly three years old and had been out of Mother\u2019s custody for slightly more than two years. Amber had been in Mother\u2019s care for most of her life, Samuel had been in her care for more than half of his life, and Destiny had been in her care for the first seven months of her life.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">A psychologist who conducted a two-hour bonding study of Mother and Amber concluded that they shared \u201ca primary attachment\u201d and a \u201cprimary maternal relationship\u201d and that \u201c[i]t could be detrimental\u201d to sever that relationship. The psychologist admitted that the detriment could be mitigated if Amber were in a caring situation, such as with extended family; that Amber looked to Grandmother to fulfill her emotional and physical needs; the existence of an attachment did not mean that it was good for a child to be with a parent; and he had not reviewed Mother\u2019s psychological evaluation or spoken with Amber\u2019s or Mother\u2019s therapists or met Grandmother. Amber\u2019s therapist believed that Amber and Mother had a strong bond and it was important that their relationship continue. The therapist acknowledged that she lacked specific information about Mother\u2019s psychological diagnosis (information that would be important in assessing the mother-daughter relationship) and that Grandmother had provided Amber with a positive environment that had allowed Amber to make a lot of progress.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">The CASA testified that Samuel loved and missed Mother and had difficulty separating from her. The CASA disagreed with the Agency\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>recommendation of adoption due to the bond and love between Mother and the children but believed that the children should remain with Grandmother and Grandfather and that Mother was not ready to care for all three children on her own. The CASA noted that Samuel\u2019s behavior had improved when Mother\u2019s visits decreased. Samuel\u2019s therapist testified Samuel\u2019s relationship with Mother was positive and very important to him but that he was very attached to Grandfather and their relationship was very strong and positive. The therapist did not recommend that Samuel be removed from Grandfather\u2019s home.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-4\">Although the children were attached to Grandmother and Grandfather, the children enjoyed visits and Amber and Samuel loved and missed Mother and called her \u201cmom.\u201d According to the social worker, while Mother loved the children and had progressed, she would not be able to maintain her recovery activities and be the primary caretaker of these three active children and returning the children to Mother would \u201cgreatly jeopardize their safety, stability, progress, and consistency.\u201d The social worker, who had observed about 15 visits, noted that at times caring for the children during visitation brought Mother to the point of exhaustion. The social worker concluded that while Mother had \u201cmade choices in her life that created barriers to the development of a beneficial parent/child relationship[,] the children have become dependent on the daily, on-going bond and attachment that they have with their grandparents.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">The common theme running through the evidence from the bonding study psychologist, the therapists, and the CASA is a beneficial parental relationship that clearly outweighs the benefit of adoption. There is no challenge to the fact that Amber and Samuel love and miss Mother and have a strong primary bond with her. Even Destiny, while seemingly too young to have developed much of a relationship with Mother, nevertheless was very strongly attached to her. Mother visited as often as she was allowed and acted in a loving, parental role with the children when permitted visitation. She was devoted to them and did virtually all that was asked of her to regain custody. The social worker, the only dissenting voice among the experts, provided no more than a perfunctory evaluation of Mother\u2019s relationship to the children, instead focusing on her current inability to provide a home for them and on the suitability of the current placements, perhaps swayed by both grandparents\u2019 qualifications and willingness to adopt and their refusal to consider guardianship or any other permanent plan. Admittedly, at the time of the section 366.26 hearing, Mother was not ready for the children\u2019s return to her custody. Neither that fact, however, nor the suitability of the grandparents\u2019 homes can justify the termination of parental rights. If the proposed adoptions proceed, the three children will be adopted in two <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>separate groups, and the maintenance of mother-child and sibling relationships will depend solely on both grandparents\u2019 continued goodwill.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">Unfortunately, this case was heard in 10 different sessions over a period of months. The juvenile court heard the section 388 matter first, but allowed some overlap in the evidence. On the final hearing date, the court addressed the section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) exception in no more than a cursory manner and did not look at the long-term effect on the children of terminating Mother\u2019s parental rights. Perhaps after the fragmented hearing process the court lacked a clear concept whether or not the exception had been proved. If it had such a concept, this is not evident from the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">The juvenile court erred by declining to apply the section 366.26, subdivision (c)(1)(A) exception. We therefore reverse the judgment terminating parental rights and remand for a new section 366.26 hearing that shall include a finding whether the exception has been demonstrated. Notwithstanding the juvenile court\u2019s busy calendar, that hearing should be conducted in a timely and efficacious fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">The judgment terminating parental rights is reversed and the matter is remanded for a new section 366.26 hearing. In all other respects, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">Huffman, Acting P.
