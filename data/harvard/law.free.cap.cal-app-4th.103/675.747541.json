We hold that evidence of a hallucination\u2014a perception with no objective reality\u2014is inadmissible to negate malice so as to mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter but is admissible to negate deliberation and premeditation so as to reduce first degree murder to second degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Factual and Procedural History<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Shortly after an early morning prisoner count, correctional officers at Wasco State Prison who saw blood on inmate Raymond T. Padilla\u2019s face, hands, and jumpsuit found his cellmate Raymond Loya dead. Loya had deep penetrating stab wounds to each of his eyes. One wound was forceful enough to fracture the supraorbital plate at the top of his eye socket and to induce a subarachnoid hemorrhage by tearing the membranes around the brain. Loya was still alive when he suffered those wounds. The towel around his neck not only fractured the bones in his voice box and strangled him to death but also was so tightly wrapped that coroner\u2019s office personnel had trouble removing the towel to perform the autopsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">At the guilt phase of his first degree murder trial, Padilla sought to admit the testimony of two psychologists that he committed a retaliatory homicide after hallucinating that Loya had killed Padilla\u2019s father and brothers. The court allowed him to admit that evidence at the sanity phase but not at the guilt phase. A jury found him guilty of first degree murder (Pen. Code,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u00a7 187, subd. (a)), found a strike prior true (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (c)-(j), 1170.12, subds. (a)-(e)), and found him sane (\u00a7\u00a7 25, subd. (b), 1016, subd. 6, 1017, subd. 5, 1026).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b597-11\">The sole issue on appeal arises out of the court\u2019s denial of Padilla\u2019s motion in limine to present at the guilt phase the testimony of two psychologists who later testified at the sanity phase. Padilla argues that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>denial of the motion constitutes a prejudicial state law evidentiary error <em>(People v. Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243]; Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13) and a prejudicial denial of his federal constitutional rights to due process and trial by jury <em>(Chapman v. California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18, 24 [87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065]; U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.). The Attorney General argues that the \u201ccourt\u2019s reason for excluding the evidence was less than clear\u201d but that nonetheless the \u201ccourt correctly excluded the evidence\u201d and that even if the court erred, the error was harmless.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\">The foundation of Padilla\u2019s argument was his proffer of the testimony of two psychologists who later testified at the sanity phase. One could have testified at the guilt phase that Padilla hallucinated that Loya had killed his father and brothers. The other could have testified at the guilt phase about the concept of hallucination as provocation. That evidence, he argues, could have led to a second degree murder verdict or to a voluntary manslaughter verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">The test of whether provocation or heat of passion can negate malice so as to mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter is objective. <em>(People v. Steele </em>(2002) 27 Cal.4th 1230, 1254 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 432, 47 P.3d 225]; <em>People v. Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 326 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311], disapproved on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Barton </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 186, 201 [47 Cal.Rptr.2d 569, 906 P.2d 531].) \u201c[N]o defendant may set up his own standard of conduct and justify or excuse himself because in fact his passions were aroused, unless . . . the facts and circumstances were sufficient to arouse the passions of the ordinarily reasonable [person].\u201d <em>(People v. Logan </em>(1917) 175 Cal. 45, 49 [164 P. 1121].) The test of whether provocation or heat of passion can negate deliberation and premeditation so as to reduce first degree murder to second degree murder, on the other hand, is subjective. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fitzpatrick </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 1285, 1295 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 808]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valentine </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 121, 131-135 [169 P.2d 1].) \u201cIf this were not so, the provocation would be a <em>defense </em>to murder and would be sufficient to reduce the crime to manslaughter.\u201d <em>(Fitzpatrick, </em>at p. 1295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">A hallucination is a perception with no objective reality. (American Heritage Diet. (4th ed. 2000) p. 792 [\u201c[perception of visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, or gustatory experiences <em>without an external </em>stimulus\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>(italics added)]; Oxford English Dict. (2d ed. 1989) p. 1047 [\u201capparent perception (usually by sight or hearing) of an external object <em>when no such object is actually </em>present\u2019 (italics added)]; Webster\u2019s 3d New Internat. Dict. (1986) p. 1023 [\u201cperception of objects <em>with no </em>reality\u201d (italics added)].) A perception with no objective reality cannot arouse the passions of the ordinarily reasonable person. (See <em>People v. Gregory </em>(2002) 101 Cal.App.4th 1149, 1170-1178 [124 Cal.Rptr.2d 776] [a delusion cannot mitigate murder to nonstatutory voluntary manslaughter on a theory of imperfect self-defense since the belief in the need to use deadly force does not arise from objective reality].) Failing the objective test, Padilla\u2019s hallucination cannot as a matter of law negate malice so as to mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter\u2014 whether on a \u201csudden quarrel or heat of passion\u201d theory of statutory voluntary manslaughter (\u00a7 192, subd. (a);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>People v. Saille </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1103, 1114 [2 Cal.Rptr.2d 364, 820 P.2d 588]) or on a \u201cdiminished actuality\u201d theory of nonstatutory voluntary manslaughter (see \u00a7 28, subd. (a);<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>People v. Hernandez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 512, 520 [93 Cal.Rptr.2d 509, 994 P.2d 354]). (See <em>People v. Steele, supra, </em>27 Cal.4th at p. 1254; <em>People v. Wickersham, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 326.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">On the other hand, nothing in the law necessarily precludes Padilla\u2019s hallucination from negating deliberation and premeditation so as to reduce first degree murder to second degree murder, as that test is subjective. (See <em>People v. Fitzpatrick, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 1295; <em>People </em>v. <em>Valentine, supra, </em>28 Cal.2d at pp. 131-135.) On that ground, we hold that the court\u2019s order rejecting his proffer of evidence was error. The jury had no other evidence about his hallucination at the guilt phase. As the evidence he proffered could well have persuaded the jury to find that his hallucination provoked a heat of passion in which he committed not a first degree murder but a second degree murder, a more favorable result was reasonably probable in the absence of the error, which we cannot declare harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Chapman v. California, supra, </em>386 U.S. at p. 24 [87 S.Ct. at p. 828]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d at p. 836; U.S. Const., 6th &amp; 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. VI, \u00a7 13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Necessarily implicit in Padilla\u2019s argument is the premise that with evidence about his hallucination in the record of the guilt phase, the jury could have found him guilty of second degree murder. On that record, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>find the prejudice of the evidentiary error addressable by a retrial on the charge of first degree murder to enable Padilla to attempt with that evidence to negate deliberation and premeditation so as to reduce first degree murder to second degree murder. (See <em>People v. Rojas </em>(1961) 55 Cal.2d 252, 254 [10 Cal.Rptr. 465, 358 P.2d 921, 85 A.L.R.2d 252]; <em>People v. Bender </em>(1945) 27 Cal.2d 164, 186-187 [163 P.2d 8], overruled on another ground in <em>People v. Lasko </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 101, 110 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 441, 999 P.2d 666].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We vacate the judgment of conviction of first degree murder and remand the matter to the trial court with directions. If the prosecutor files a written election to try Padilla on a charge of first degree murder within 60 days after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court and if Padilla is \u201cbrought to trial within 60 days . . . after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court,\u201d the trial court shall proceed accordingly. (\u00a7 1382, subd. (a)(2).) Otherwise the trial court shall enter a judgment of conviction of second degree murder and sentence him accordingly. (See <em>In re Bower </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 865, 880 [215 Cal.Rptr. 267, 700 P.2d 1269].)</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Ardaiz, P.
