T. burned cardboard inside of a trash can located at her school. She argues that her rights were violated when the trial court sustained an arson allegation against her because the trash was not property of another for the purposes of the crime of arson (Pen. Code, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>\u00a7 451, subd. (d)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We hold that trash constitutes property under section 451 and that the crime of arson only required proof that the property L. T. burned did not belong to her. Therefore, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">A petition was filed under Welfare and Institutions Code section 602 alleging that L. T., a minor, committed the crime of arson in violation of section 451, subdivision (d). Walter J., a student who attended Charles Drew Middle School with L. T., testified that he saw L. T., who was holding a lighter, put her hand inside a trash can that was located on school premises. He said that his friend \u201csaw the whole trash can bum,\u201d but Walter J. said that . he only saw cardboard inside of the trash can on fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">L. T.\u2019s counsel moved under Welfare and Institutions Code section 701.1 to dismiss the petition on the ground that there was no violation of the arson statute because L. T. burned only the cardboard^inside the trash can, and the cardboard was not the property of another. The prosecutor said that the cardboard \u201cwas property that belonged to Drew Middle School and that neither the minor nor anyone else had the right to bum that property.\u201d Stating that the \u201ctrash belonged to the school\u201d and that \u201ctrash can be property,\u201d the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-8\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b226-9\">L. T. argues that she did not commit arson because she did not bum the property of another. She contends that she merely burned trash, and that trash is not \u201cproperty\u201d that belongs to anyone. The People contend that the trash L. T. burned was \u201cproperty\u201d that did not belong to her; hence, she committed arson when she burned it. We agree with the People.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">Section 451 provides in pertinent part: \u201cA person is guilty of arson when he or she willfully and maliciously sets fire to or bums or causes to be burned or who aids, counsels, or procures the burning of, any structure, forest land, or property, [f ] . . . [If] (d) . . . For purposes of this paragraph, arson of property does not include one burning or causing to be burned his or her own personal property unless there is an intent to defraud or there is injury to another person or another person\u2019s structure, forest land, or property.\u201d Thus, arson is committed when the \u201cproperty\u201d burned does not belong to the person causing the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-11\">The trash burned does constitute \u201cproperty\u201d referred to in the arson statute (\u00a7 451). The Penal Code defines \u201cproperty\u201d to include \u201cpersonal property,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>which, in turn, includes \u201cmoney, goods, chattels, things in action, and evidences of debt.\u201d (\u00a7 7, subds. 10, 12; accord, Civ. Code, \u00a7 14, subd. 3.) Trash fits within this definition. \u201cGoods\u201d and \u201cchattels\u201d are things that are \u201cvisible, tangible, movable\u201d and are \u201cobjects of the senses.\u201d <em>(Italiani v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Corp. </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 464, 467 [114 P.2d 370] [citing Ballantine\u2019s Law Dict.]; see <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Robie </em>(2d Cir. 1999) 166 F.3d 444, 454-456 [defendant who took stamps the post office intended to destroy as trash was liable for stealing property].)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Whatever might be the definition of \u201cproperty\u201d in other contexts, the Penal Code definition is applicable to the arson statute. Other definitions of \u201cproperty,\u201d however, are consistent with the Penal Code provision. \u201c \u2018The word \u201cproperty\u201d has been subjected to innumerable and various definitions. Courts have said that the word \u201cproperty\u201d is \u201call-embracing so as to include every intangible benefit and prerogative susceptible of possession or disposition.\u201d [Citations.] [\u00b6] . . . [\u00b6] [T]he construction of the word \u201cproperty\u201d depends on the context with which it is used and signifies \u201cany valuable right or interest protected by law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Downing v. Municipal Court </em>(1948) 88 Cal.App.2d 345, 350 [198 P.2d 923]; <em>People v. Kwok </em>(1998) 63 Cal.App.4th 1236, 1250-1251 [75 Cal.Rptr.2d 40].) Property thus has been broadly defined to include anything subject to ownership. (Civ. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 654, 655; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Kozlowski </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 853, 866 [117 Cal.Rptr.2d 504] [\u201cThe term [property] is all-embracing, including every intangible benefit and prerogative susceptible of possession or disposition\u201d].) Trash is a \u201cthing of which there may be ownership.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">In addition, \u201cit is appropriate to note that the word \u2018property\u2019 is commonly used in two different senses. First, it is applied to those external things which are the objects of rights or estates, to those things which, in the language of Blackstone, are objects of dominion or property. [Citation.] It is also applied to the rights or estates which a man may acquire in and to things.\u201d <em>(Callahan v. Martin </em>(1935) 3 Cal.2d 110, 118 [43 P.2d 788, 101 A.L.R. 871]; see also <em>United States v. General Motor Corp. </em>(1945) 323 U.S. 373, 377-378 [65 S.Ct. 357, 359-360, 89 L.Ed. 311, 156 A.L.R. 390].)  Here, we use the term \u201cproperty\u201d as referring to an object rather than to rights. In contrast, in theft-based offenses, the term \u201cproperty\u201d includes the \u201cright to use or possess a thing or the exclusive ownership of a thing\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Kozlowski, supra, </em>96 Cal.App.4th at p. 866), because theft is the taking or stealing of \u201cpersonal property of another.\u201d (\u00a7 484.) Thus, rights utilized for such offenses are not applicable to the definition of property in the arson statute. The Penal Code definition of property that is applicable to the arson statute contains no requirement that the object belong to anyone. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Accordingly, the \u201ctrash\u201d L. T. burned is \u201cproperty\u201d covered by the arson statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">L. T. argues, based on <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 421 [170 Cal.Rptr. 597], that even if trash can be viewed as property, the arson statute should be construed so that a violation occurs only when the trash belongs to someone other than the defendant. <em>People </em>v. <em>Foster </em>involved former Penal Code section 449a, which provision stated that arson occurred when \u201cproperty of another person\u201d was burned. The repeal of that section and its recodification as section 451 without the phrase \u201cthe property of another person\u201d suggests that the Legislature intended to eliminate that condition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Preston </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 450, 459 [50 Cal.Rptr.2d 778 ] [\u201cThe general rule is that the Legislature, in deleting a provision, intended a substantial change in the law\u201d]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olmsted </em>(2000) 84 Cal.App.4th 270, 276 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 755] [language contained in former version of statute will not be read into current version of statute]; see also Code Civ. Prop., \u00a7 1858 [a court must not \u201cinsert what has been omitted\u201d from a statute].)</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">L. T. also cites to <em>California v. Greenwood </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 35 [108 S.Ct. 1625, 100 L.Ed.2d 30] and <em>Ananda Church of Self-Realization v. Massachusetts Bay Ins. Co. </em>(2002) 95 Cal.App.4th 1273 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 370] to support her theory that the trash had to belong to someone for her to be guilty of arson. In <em>Greenwood, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution does not prohibit a warrantless search and seizure of trash left for collection outside of a home because people have no \u201csubjective expectation of privacy in their garbage that society accepts as objectively reasonable.\u201d (Greenwood, <em>supra, </em>486 U.S. at p. 39 [108 S.Ct. at p. 1628].) In <em>Ananda, </em>an insurance policy provision insuring against property damage, defined as injury to or loss of tangible property, did not cover the taking of documents placed in an outdoor trash barrel. The court said that \u201c[documents which have been placed in an outdoor trash barrel no longer retain their character as the <em>personal property </em>of the one who has discarded it. By placing them into the garbage, the owner renounces the key incidents of ownership\u2014title, possession, and the right to control.\u201d <em>(Ananda, supra, </em>95 Cal.App.4th at p. 1282.) The court concluded that a claim for conversion or other interference with personal property rights may not be based on the taking of personalty discarded as waste, because waste is considered to be abandoned property. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1281-1282.) The ownership or lack of ownership of trash for purposes of insurance coverage and the Fourth Amendment, however, are issues not applicable to the definition of arson in the Penal Code. The arson statute only requires that the property burned not belong to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The trash did not belong to L. T. The trash was in a container on school property. There is no evidence that L. T. did any act causing the trash to become her property before she set fire to it. L. T.\u2019s theory that by burning the trash, it became her property, is meritless. Whether the trash L. T. burned belonged to the school, the city, or the city trash collectors or was abandoned property does not alter the fact that the trash did not belong to L. T.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">By burning property not belonging to her, L. T. committed arson as defined in section 451.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Turner, P. J., and Grignon, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was denied January 15, 2003.
