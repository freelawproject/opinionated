Shannon contends the blood-alcohol test results should not have been admitted into evidence because the requisite foundation had not been established. For the reasons stated below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">On October 26, 2000, around 12:30 p.m., California Highway Patrol Officer Sparso was dispatched to investigate an accident. At the scene, Sparso observed a Mazda MX3 partially underneath a Volkswagen\u2019s rear bumper. Shannon, sitting in the Mazda\u2019s driver\u2019s seat, admitted she was the driver and handed Sparso her identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">Shannon had difficulty standing upon leaving the Mazda, and balanced herself by leaning on Sparso\u2019s patrol car. Her speech was slurred and she appeared confused. Sparso smelled alcohol and noticed Shannon had bloodshot and watery eyes. Shannon admitted she had consumed one ounce of vodka and was unable to complete the field sobriety tests because of her poor balance.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">Sparso gave Shannon three separate preliminary alcohol screening (PAS) breath tests, using an Aleo-Sensor IV machine. The first sample showed her blood-alcohol level was .36 percent. The second sample registered .4 percent or greater, and the final test was .39 percent. Shannon was arrested for driving under the influence and submitted a blood test to determine her blood-alcohol concentration (BAC). The test was analyzed by the crime lab of the Orange County Sheriff. The first analysis was completed by forensic alcohol analyst trainee Robert Patron and the second was done by analyst Amy Goelzer. Shannon\u2019s BAC was .41 percent, based on an average of the two blood tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">Shannon requested an administrative hearing to contest the DMV\u2019s suspension of her license. At the hearing, senior forensic scientist Martin Breen testified three senior analysts supervised Patron when he tested Shannon\u2019s blood. To Breen, \u201csupervision\u201d did not mean the supervisor had to review every one of the 80 daily tests done by the trainee; rather, it meant senior analysts were available to answer any inquiries from the trainee or handle any problems that surfaced. Breen also described numerous accuracy checks performed by the lab, including equipment calibration before each test \u201crun\u201d and a summary report of each analysis designed to uncover anything \u201cthat might be atypical or would suggest something\u2019s wrong with the run.\u201d Finally, senior analysts review the trainee\u2019s report for accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">Shannon objected to the admission of the blood-alcohol test results, claiming trainee Patron was unsupervised. The hearing officer overruled the objection and upheld the suspension of Shannon\u2019s driving privileges. Her petition for writ of mandate challenging the DMV\u2019s order was denied, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">A. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Exercising its independent judgment, the trial court was required to determine whether the weight of the evidence supported the DMV\u2019s decision. <em>(Baker v. Gourley </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 1167, 1172 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 451].) As noted above, the trial court denied the writ. On appeal, our function is to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. <em>(Lake v. Reed </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 448, 457 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 P.2d 311].) \u201c \u2018 \u201cWe must resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all legitimate and reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision. [Citations.] Where the evidence supports more than one inference, we may not substitute our deductions for the trial court\u2019s. [Citation.] We may overturn the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence before the trial court is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain those findings. [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">B. <em>Foundational Requirements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Shannon contends the DMV did not establish the requisite foundation for admission of the BAC evidence. Specifically, she argues the crime lab did not comply with California Code of Regulations, title 17 (title 17) because forensic trainee Patron was \u201cunsupervised.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Generally, the foundational showing necessary for the admission of blood-alcohol test results consists of evidence demonstrating the testing device was working properly and a qualified operator correctly administered the test. <em>(Davenport v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 6 Cal.App.4th 133, 140 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 818] <em>(Davenport)) </em>One way to meet these requirements is to show the test results were obtained by following the standards prescribed for forensic alcohol analysis in title 17. \u201cCompliance with the regulations establishes both a foundation for admission of test results into evidence in any proceeding and a basis for finding such results to be legally sufficient evidence to support the requisite findings in such proceeding.\u201d <em>(Davenport, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 142.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Procedurally, it is a fairly simple matter for the DMV to introduce the necessary foundational evidence. Evidence Code section 664 creates a rebut-table presumption that blood-alcohol test results recorded on official forms were obtained by following the regulations and guidelines of title 17. <em>(Davenport, supra, 6 </em>Cal.App.4th at p. 143; <em>McKinney v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 519, 525 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 18].) Test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>results from authorized laboratories, performed by public employees within the scope of their duties, are admissible under the public employee records exception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1280; <em>Imachi v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 2 Cal.App.4th 809, 816 [3 Cal.Rptr.2d 478].) The recorded test results are presumptively valid and the DMV is not required to present additional foundational evidence. <em>(Burge </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1992) 5 Cal.App.4th 384, 389 [7 Cal.Rptr.2d 5].) At this point, \u201cfaced with a report of chemical test results, the burden would be on the licensee to demonstrate that the test was not properly performed.\u201d <em>(Imachi, supra, </em>2 Cal.App.4th at p. 817.)</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">Title 17 permits trainees to analyze blood-alcohol tests, but \u201conly under the supervision of a forensic alcohol supervisor or forensic alcohol analyst.\u201d (Tit. 17, \u00a7 1216, subd. (a)(1)(A).) Shannon correctly notes the public employee hearsay exception does not apply to unsupervised forensic trainees. If unsupervised, \u201ca trainee cannot be acting \u2018by and within the scope of duty of a public employee\u2019 when he or she is not being supervised. Accordingly, a forensic alcohol report prepared by an unsupervised trainee could not fall within the public employee exception to the hearsay rule.\u201d <em>(Shea v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1998) 62 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1059 [72 Cal.Rptr.2d 896] <em>(Shea); Manning v. Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 273, 276 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 647] <em>(Manning).) </em>Because title 17 requires <em>two </em>analyses of a single sample (tit. 17, \u00a7\u00a7 1215.1, subd. (b), 1220.2, subd. (a)(3)), Shannon contends the test performed by forensic analyst Goelzer was also inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">We turn to the issue of what constitutes \u201cadequate\u201d supervision. <em>Shea </em>and <em>Manning, </em>the only published decisions on this subject, touch on the issue but do not confront it directly. In each case, we considered the DMV\u2019s evidentiary showing and found it wanting. This case is different\u2014the DMV did produce evidence detailing its efforts to supervise its forensic analyst trainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Thus, the issue is whether substantial evidence supports the trial court\u2019s finding that trainee Patron did, in fact, receive adequate supervision. Senior forensic scientist Breen testified he and two other analysts worked in the same lab room as Patron and were available to answer questions or provide direction. Patron was instructed to follow specific guidelines in performing the analysis, and alert the supervisor if any deviations from the guidelines were detected. Breen also explained how the lab\u2019s quality control procedures required a comparison of Patron\u2019s results with Goelzer\u2019s. The results are averaged only if they are within .01 percent of each other. Both analysts compare the final result to their report information before signing off, and a later administrative review checks the final report for accuracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>Shannon did not offer any evidence to rebut Breen\u2019s testimony, arguing instead that title 17 required more direct oversight of the trainee. As the Attorney General points out, title 17 does not define supervision or provide guidelines describing the level of oversight required. But the legislative history of title 17 demonstrates the intensive scrutiny advocated by Shannon is not required. As originally adopted, section 1216, subdivision (a) of title 17 provided, \u201cA trainee may perform forensic alcohol analysis only under the <em>direct and immediate </em>supervision of a Forensic Alcohol Supervisor.\u201d (Former Cal. Admin. Code, tit. 17, \u00a7 1216, subd. (a), Register 70, No. 33 (Aug. 15, 1970) p. 88.4.2, italics added.) A few years later, however, section 1216 was amended to delete the \u201cdirect and immediate\u201d language and the statute now specifies the trainee may perform the analysis \u201conly under the supervision of a forensic alcohol supervisor or forensic alcohol analyst.\u201d This amendment confirms authorized labs may render effective supervision without requiring supervisors to hover over the shoulders of their trainees.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">In sum, there was ample evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion that Patron received adequate supervision. We will not reweigh it.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">C. <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Rylaarsdam, Acting P.
