We conclude the WCAB decision was erroneous inasmuch as petitioner\u2019s disability retirement pension was based solely upon his work-related orthopedic injuries and was unrelated to the workers\u2019 compensation award for a preexisting hypertension and gastrointestinal condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">This petition brought by former Los Angeles County Deputy Sheriff Raymond Ybarra involves two claims for workers\u2019 compensation benefits. The first claim was for hypertension and for cumulative trauma to petitioner\u2019s gastrointestinal system that occurred from 1983 to 1994. The second claim was for a work-related injury to his shoulder and knees occurring in 1997. Petitioner was awarded benefits for each of his injuries. His preexisting condition was assigned a 41 percent disability, while his subsequent orthopedic injury was deemed a 61 percent disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">Following the award, petitioner applied for a disability pension from the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association (LACERA). He asserted he was permanently disabled from resuming his position at the sheriffs department due to his shoulder and knee injuries and to his hypertension and gastrointestinal condition. An orthopedic surgeon selected by LACERA, Stanley G. Robboy, M.D., examined petitioner and concluded he was permanently disabled from resuming his employment with the county. Petitioner thereafter was granted a work-related disability pension based on Dr. Robboy\u2019s orthopedic evaluation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-8\">After he was granted a disability pension, petitioner filed an application with the Subsequent Injuries Fund (SIF) for additional benefits. Under Labor Code section 4751, SIF is authorized to pay for the amount of an employee\u2019s disability over the workers\u2019 compensation insurance payment when an employee has a preexisting nonindustrial or industrial disability and a subsequent industrial disability of at least 35 percent, which combine to make the employee 70 percent or more disabled. Petitioner contended his work-related orthopedic injury, combined with his preexisting condition, qualified him for SIF benefits with an overall disability of 81 percent.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b845-9\">Although SIF determined petitioner was entitled to receive the additional benefits, SIF asserted his award was subject to reduction by operation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>Labor Code section 4753. That section provides for reduction of SIF benefits to the extent the employee receives payments from another source due to a preexisting disability. SIF claimed it was entitled to a credit for the portion of petitioner\u2019s LACERA disability pension attributable to his preexisting condition resulting from hypertension and gastrointestinal system trauma. Petitioner disputes SIF\u2019s entitlement to a credit against petitioner\u2019s disability retirement payments, contending SIF presented no evidence that petitioner\u2019s disability retirement was based on the preexisting disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">The matter was heard by a workers\u2019 compensation administrative law judge. In a report submitted to the WCAB, the judge recommended a finding that petitioner was eligible for SIF benefits, but that SIF was entitled to assert a credit against petitioner\u2019s disability retirement benefits. The WCAB adopted the judge\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Petitioner filed a timely petition for review of the WCAB\u2019s decision. This court granted a writ of review.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The WCAB is required to determine factual questions in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence standard. (Lab. Code, \u00a7 3202.5.) Its factual determinations, if supported by substantial evidence, are binding on the parties upon appellate review. <em>(LeVesque v. Workmen\u2019s Comp. App. Bd. </em>(1970) 1 Cal.3d 627, 637 [83 Cal.Rptr. 208, 463 P.2d 432].) While the WCAB may draw reasonable inferences from the evidence, this court may only determine whether the evidence is susceptible to the inferences drawn. <em>(Phoenix Indemn. Co. v. Ind. Acc. Com. </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 856, 859 [193 P.2d 745]; <em>Coborn </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com. </em>(1948) 31 Cal.2d 713, 716 [192 P.2d 959].)</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">The parties dispute the basis upon which LACERA granted petitioner\u2019s disability retirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-9\">SIF contends LACERA\u2019s disability retirement determination was not based exclusively on petitioner\u2019s orthopedic disability. SIF argues LACERA considered petitioner\u2019s medical history in which he complains about his hypertension and gastrointestinal condition and that the latter problem prevented his return to work. SIF also points out LACERA reviewed the report of petitioner\u2019s internist before making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">LACERA\u2019s disability determination is contained in its \u201cDisability Retirement Evaluation Report.\u201d Under \u201cCurrent Symptoms/Complaints,\u201d the report notes petitioner stated in his application that he would not be able to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>return to work due to both his orthopedic injuries and his internal conditions. Following the summary, the report stated, under \u201cStaff Recommendation,\u201d \u201cBased on the panel physicians report and findings, staff recommends that the applicant be granted a service-connected disability retirement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">Although petitioner submitted medical evaluations prepared by his own internists and orthopedists, LACERA relied upon the evaluation of its panel orthopedic surgeon, Dr. Stanley G. Robboy, in making its determination. Under the \u201cPermanent Incapacity\u201d section of the report, Dr. Robboy concluded: \u201cA person having Mr. Ybarra\u2019s right knee and right shoulder condition would normally be precluded from engaging in occupations requiring prolonged or repetitive abduction or forward flexion of the right upper extremity above shoulder level, very heavy lifting with the right upper extremity, and repetitive kneeling, stooping, squatting, repetitive ascending of ladders, ramps or stairs, and prolonged walking or standing. It is felt that Mr. Ybarra would experience an increase in his right knee and right shoulder symptoms and a worsening of the underlying condition in performing certain of the work duties of the position of a deputy sheriff. . . . It is also noted that the position of a deputy sheriff is classified as Physical Class \u20184\u2019\u2014 arduous work. This, in turn, is defined as involving frequent heavy lifting. It is on these bases that Mr. Ybarra is felt to be permanently incapacitated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">Dr. Robboy found that petitioner\u2019s disability was due solely to his orthopedic injuries. Petitioner\u2019s retirement application was granted by LACERA based on Dr. Robboy\u2019s report alone. No ambiguity appears in LACERA\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">SIF further argues that the staff recommendation contained in the LACERA report was based not only on petitioner\u2019s orthopedic disability, but also on the history taken from petitioner in which he complained about the disabling nature of his hypertension and gastrointestinal conditions, and his inability to return to work owing to the latter condition. Moreover, SIF argues, LACERA reviewed petitioner\u2019s internist\u2019s medical evaluation in preparing its report. Further, at oral argument, SIF contended the LACERA report and recommendation failed to reflect the staff deliberations regarding petitioner\u2019s preexisting internal conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">While LACERA may have considered petitioner\u2019s preexisting conditions in addition to his orthopedic disability, it does not appear that it based its decision on the other conditions. The only disability specified in the report is the orthopedic disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-9\">SIF finally argues that, in petitioner\u2019s disability retirement application, he described his disability as due to both his orthopedic injuries and internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"992\">*992</page-number>conditions. Under item 1 of his application, petitioner stated the injuries or conditions that caused his disability were \u201cBoth Knees, Right Shoulder[,] . . . High Blood Pressure\u2014Gastrointestinal. . . .\u201d However, under item 7, where he was asked to state the duties he was unable to perform due to his disability, petitioner described only his orthopedic restrictions: \u201cI am unable to perform my job duties. I am unable to stand or walk for prolonged periods. I am unable to perform heavy work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b848-4\">In sum, LACERA granted petitioner\u2019s disability retirement, not predicated on petitioner\u2019s description of his disabilities, but on Dr. Robboy\u2019s medical evaluation. Neither the petitioner\u2019s application nor other conditions discussed in the disability retirement evaluation report constitute substantial evidence to support the WCAB conclusions when compared with LACERA staff recommendation and the basis for that recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The decision of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Appeal Board is annulled, and the matter is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-7\">Cooper, P. L, and Rubin, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b848-8\">A petition for a rehearing was denied November 19, 2002.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-10\">LACERA did not have petitioner\u2019s preexisting injuries medically evaluated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The 81 percent overall disability percentage was achieved by utilizing the schedule for rating permanent disability, under the provisions of the State of California and the multiple disabilities table. There is no dispute between the parties that the petitioner\u2019s orthopedic disability of 61 percent and preexisting disability of 41 percent produce 81 percent under the table.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
