J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQ\">The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) authorizes the Secretary of the California Resources Agency (Resources Agency) to adopt \u201cGuidelines\u201d to implement CEQA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Guidelines are published in title 14 of the California Code of Regulations.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">In 1998, the Resources Agency adopted significant revisions to the Guidelines.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Several of these revised Guidelines, as characterized by one treatise, \u201cdealt with many of the stickiest, and most controversial, issues in CEQA jurisprudence.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">The present matter encompasses both an appeal and a cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-13\">In the appeal, we uphold the trial court\u2019s invalidation of the following Guidelines: section 15064, subdivision (h) (hereafter Guidelines section 15064(h)) (regulatory standards to determine significant environmental effect); sections 15064, subdivision (i)(4) (hereafter Guidelines section 15064(i)(4)) and 15130, subdivision (a)(4) (hereafter Guidelines section 15130(a)(4)) (how \u201cde minimis\u201d effects in a cumulatively impacted environment affect environmental impact report (EIR) preparation and discussion); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Guidelines section 15130, subdivision (b)(l)(B)2 (hereafter Guidelines section 15130(b)(l)(B)2) (the definition of \u201cprobable future projects\u201d for EIR discussion of cumulative impacts); Guidelines section 15152, subdivision (f)(3)(C) (hereafter Guidelines section 15152(f)(3)(C)) (whether significant environmental effects have been adequately addressed in a prior EIR, and their relationship to a statement of overriding considerations); and section 15378, subdivision (b)(5) (hereafter Guidelines section 15378(b)(5)) (organizational activities which are political or which are not physical changes are not \u201cprojects\u201d for EIR purposes). We part company, though, with the trial court\u2019s invalidation of Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (i)(3) (hereafter Guidelines section 15064(i)(3)), so long as that section incorporates the fair argument trigger for EIR preparation (lead agency may determine no incremental cumulative effect if project meets cumulative mitigation plan\u2019s specific requirements).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">In the cross-appeal, we uphold the trial court\u2019s validation of Guidelines section 15332 (categorical exemption for certain urban in-fill development projects). Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">At issue in this case is whether the subject Guidelines, which public agencies must follow to implement CEQA, facially violate CEQA statutes and case law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As such, the matter presents a concrete legal dispute ripe for our consideration. This matter stands in contrast to <em>Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Commission, </em>where the issues were not sufficiently concrete to allow judicial resolution in the absence of a specific factual context; there, the plaintiffs claimed essentially that administrative guidelines governing development dedications for beach access might in the future be applied contrary to statutory or constitutional law.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">The purpose of CEQA is to protect and maintain California\u2019s environmental quality.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> With certain exceptions, CEQA requires public agencies to prepare an EIR for any project they intend to carry out or approve whenever it can be fairly argued on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have a significant environmental effect; under this \u201cfair argument\u201d standard, an EIR must be prepared even if other substantial evidence shows <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>no significant environmental effect.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Significant effect on the environment\u2019 means a substantial, or potentially substantial, adverse change in the environment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The EIR has been repeatedly recognized as the \u201c \u2018heart of CEQA.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">CEQA requires that, before approving a project, the lead public agency find either that the project\u2019s significant environmental effects identified in the EIR have been avoided or mitigated, or that mitigations and alternatives identified in the EIR are infeasible and the unmitigated effects are outweighed by the project\u2019s benefits; if the public agency makes the latter finding, it must explain its reasoning in a statement of overriding considerations.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The EIR\u2019s purpose, then, \u201c \u2018is to inform the public and its responsible officials of the environmental consequences of their decisions before they are made. Thus, the EIR \u201cprotects not only the environment but also informed self-government.\u201d [Citation.]\u201d\u2019<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Pursuant to a petition for writ of mandate and complaint for declaratory relief, three environmental organizations\u2014Communities For A Better Environment, Environmental Protection Information Center, and Desert Citizens Against Pollution (hereafter collectively referred to as CBE)\u2014sued the Resources Agency, challenging several 1998-revised Guidelines. The California Building Industry Association (BIA), a homebuilding trade association, was allowed to intervene in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">The trial court invalidated the following Guidelines sections: 15064(h), 15064(i)(4), 15130(a)(4), 15130(b)(l)(B)2, 15152(f)(3)(C), 15378(b)(5), 15064(i)(3), and 15152, subdivision (f)(2) (hereafter section 15152(f)(2)) to the extent it incorporates Guideline sections 15064(i)(3) and 15064(i)(4). The Resources Agency did not appeal this judgment, but the BIA did. Nevertheless, the Resources Agency attempted to file a respondent\u2019s brief requesting that Guidelines sections 15064(h), 15064(i)(3) and 15152(f)(2) (to the extent it incorporates 15064(i)(3)) be validated. We struck this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>brief as an improper attempt to appeal based on a respondent\u2019s brief. In a follow-up brief, the Resources Agency stated it has not taken any position on the validity of Guidelines sections 15064(i)(4), 15130(a)(4), 15130(b)(l)(B)2, 15152(f)(3)(C) and 15378(b)(5), because the Secretary of the Resources Agency is considering possible amendments to these sections.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">The trial court upheld the validity of the following Guidelines sections: 15064.7, 15041, 15330, and 15332. CBE filed a cross-appeal, challenging only the trial court\u2019s judgment as to the validity of section 15332.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">1. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Government Code section 11342.2 provides the general standard of review for determining the validity of administrative regulations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> That section states that \u201c[wjhenever by the express or implied terms of any statute a state agency has authority to adopt regulations to implement, interpret, make specific or otherwise carry out the provisions of the statute, no regulation adopted is valid or effective unless [1] consistent and not in conflict with the statute and [2] reasonably necessary to effectuate the purpose of the statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Under the first prong of this standard, the judiciary independently reviews the administrative regulation for consistency with controlling law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The question is whether the regulation alters or amends the governing statute or case law, or enlarges or impairs its scope. In short, the question is whether the regulation is within the scope of the authority conferred; if it is not, it is void.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> This is a question particularly suited for the judiciary as the final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>arbiter of the law, and does not invade the technical expertise of the agency.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">By contrast, the second prong of this standard, reasonable necessity, generally does implicate the agency\u2019s expertise; therefore, it receives a much more deferential standard of review.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The question is whether the agency\u2019s action was arbitrary, capricious, or without reasonable or rational basis.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">There is one wrinkle in the standard of review\u2019s first prong, and the BIA seeks to wrap itself within the crease. An administrative agency\u2019s view of its governing legal authority is entitled to great weight and will be followed unless it is clearly erroneous or unauthorized.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Our state Supreme Court has applied this principle to the Guidelines. The high court has stated that, regardless of whether the Guidelines are considered to be quasi-legislative regulatory mandates or merely interpretive aids, \u201c[a]t a minimum, . . . courts should afford great weight to the Guidelines except when a provision is clearly unauthorized or erroneous under CEQA.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> From this, the BIA argues that the revised Guidelines are valid unless they are clearly unauthorized or erroneous, and therefore the standard of review is a deferential one. The BIA is mistaken. The \u201cfly in this particular ointment,\u201d as one court has noted, rests with the word \u201c\u2018unauthorized.\u2019\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201c[E]ven quasi-legislative rules are reviewed independently for consistency with controlling law\u201d; if they are inconsistent, they are considered unauthorized <footnotemark>22</footnotemark> This is because \u201c \u2018 \u201c \u2018 [wjhatever the force of administrative construction . . . final responsibility for the interpretation of the law rests with the courts.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> An agency <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>has no authority to promulgate a regulation that is inconsistent with controlling law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In the end, \u201c[t]he court, not the agency, has \u2018final responsibility for the interpretation of the law\u2019 under which the regulation was issued.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Finally, the \u201cforemost principle\u201d in interpreting CEQA is that the Legislature intended the act to be read so as to afford the fullest possible protection to the environment within the reasonable scope of the statutory language.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">2. <em>Guidelines Section 15064(h)\u2014Thresholds of Significance: Use of Regulatory Standards to Determine Significant Environmental Effect</em></p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\">As noted, several CEQA statutes specify that a lead public agency must prepare an EIR for any project the agency intends to carry out or approve which \u201cmay have a significant effect on the environment.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> Thus, \u201c[determining whether a project may have a significant effect plays a critical role in the CEQA process.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Because of this \u201cmay have a significant effect\u201d language and the EIR\u2019s place at the heart of the CEQA scheme, an EIR is required \u201c \u2018whenever it can be <em>fairly argued </em>on the basis of substantial evidence that the project may have significant environmental impact,\u2019 \u201d regardless of whether other substantial evidence supports the opposite conclusion.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Guidelines section 15064 guides lead agencies in determining the significance of a project\u2019s environmental effects. Guidelines section 15064(h) provides for thresholds of significance to be based on regulatory standards that meet certain criteria. A \u201cthreshold of significance\u201d for a given environmental effect is simply that level at which the lead agency finds the effects of the project to be significant; the term may be defined as a quantitative or qualitative standard, or set of criteria, pursuant to which the significance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>a given environmental effect may be determined.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Adopting thresholds of significance promotes consistency, efficiency, and predictability in deciding whether to prepare an EIR.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> According to the former general counsel of the Resources Agency who played a central role in preparing the 1998 revisions to the Guidelines, a vast body of regulatory standards has been adopted over the past few decades establishing levels at which impacts to a particular resource align with the definition of a significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The trial court upheld the validity of Guidelines section 15064.7 on the use of thresholds of significance, and this ruling has not been challenged on appeal. Guidelines section 15064.7 specifies as relevant: \u201c(a) Each public agency is encouraged to develop and publish thresholds of significance that the agency uses in the determination of the significance of environmental effects. A threshold of significance is an identifiable quantitative, qualitative or performance level of a particular environmental effect, non-compliance with which means the effect will normally be determined to be significant by the agency and compliance with which means the effect normally will be determined to be less than significant.\u201d The trial court upheld this Guideline, observing that \u201ca lead agency\u2019s use of existing environmental standards in determining the significance of a project\u2019s environmental impacts is an effective means of promoting consistency in significance determinations and integrating CEQA environmental review activities with other environmental program planning and regulation.\u201d We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">But the trial court invalidated Guidelines section 15064(h) as contrary to the fair argument approach established in CEQA statutory and case law. We agree with the trial court here as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Guidelines section 15064(h) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b119-9\">\u201c(1) (A) Except as otherwise required by [sjection 15065 [mandatory findings of significance], a change in the environment is not a significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>effect if the change complies with a standard that meets the definition in [subdivision] (h)(3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-5\">\u201c(B) If there is a conflict between standards, the lead agency shall determine which standard is appropriate for purposes of this [subdivision] based upon substantial evidence in light of the whole record.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-6\">\u201c(C) Notwithstanding [subdivision] (h)(1)(A), if the lead agency determines on the basis of substantial evidence in light of the whole record that a standard is inappropriate to determine the significance of an effect for a particular project, the lead agency shall determine whether the effect may be significant as otherwise required by this section, [s]ection 15065, and the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-7\">\u201c(2) In the absence of a standard that satisfies [subdivision] (h)(1)(A), the lead agency shall determine whether the effect may be significant as otherwise required by this section, [s]ection 15065, and the Guidelines.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">\u201c(3) For the purposes of this [subdivision] a \u2018standard\u2019 means a standard of general application that is all of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-9\">\u201c(A) a quantitative, qualitative or performance requirement found in a statute, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation, order, or other standard of general application;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-10\">\u201c(B) adopted for the purpose of environmental protection;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-11\">\u201c(C) adopted by a public agency through a public review process to implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered by the public agency;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u201c(D) one that governs the same environmental effect which the change in the environment is impacting; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-13\">\u201c(E) one that governs within the jurisdiction where the project is located.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-14\">\u201c(4) This definition includes thresholds of significance adopted by lead agencies which meet the requirements of this [subdivision].\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">The trial court recognized the fair argument problem with Guidelines section 15064(h). If a proposed project has an environmental effect that complies with a subdivision (h)(3) regulatory standard, the lead agency is <em>directed </em>under subdivision (h)(1)(A) (and implicitly under subd. (h)(2)) to determine that the effect is not significant, regardless of whether other substantial evidence would support a fair argument that the effect may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>environmentally significant. This direction relieves the agency of a duty it would have under the fair argument approach to look at evidence beyond the regulatory standard, or in contravention of the standard, in deciding whether an EIR must be prepared. Under the fair argument approach, <em>any </em>substantial evidence supporting a fair argument that a project may have a significant environmental effect would trigger the preparation of an EIR. A well-known CEQA treatise recognized this dilemma as well, stating: \u201c[Subdivision (h) . . . appears to dispense with the traditional \u2018fair argument\u2019 standard otherwise applicable to the decision whether to prepare a[n] . . . EIR. . . . Notably, where existing regulatory standards, as defined, address a particular category of impact, the lead agency need not treat the impact as potentially significant whenever <em>any </em>substantial evidence in the record supports such a conclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">Admittedly, Guidelines section 15064(h) contains some wiggle room regarding the regulatory standard approach. Subdivision (h)(1)(B) states that if there is a conflict between standards, the lead agency shall determine which standard is appropriate. More importantly for our purposes, under subdivision (h)(1)(C), a lead agency may determine on the basis of substantial evidence in light of the whole record that a standard is inappropriate to determine the significance of an effect for a particular project; if this happens, the lead agency is to determine whether the effect may be significant as otherwise required. However, as one CEQA treatise observes with respect to these two subdivisions: \u201c[A] lead agency . . . decide[s] for itself whether or not to use a particular standard; it cannot be forced into such a decision simply because project opponents or skeptics can point to substantial evidence indicating that reliance on the standard is inappropriate or ineffective.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In other words, the fair argument approach is repudiated once again. In fact, subdivision (h)(1)(C) and (h)(2) unwittingly sow the seeds of Guidelines section 15064(h)\u2019s demise by recognizing that if the lead agency determines the regulatory standard is inappropriate to determine significant effect, or if there is no applicable regulatory standard, the agency is to determine whether the effect may be significant \u201cas otherwise required\u201d (i.e., by using the fair argument approach).<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">The BIA argues that the fair argument test is limited to one aspect of the CEQA review process (the decision whether to prepare an EIR), with all other aspects of the process being governed by the substantial evidence test. The BIA maintains that since the fair argument test does not apply to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>establishment of significance standards or thresholds, Guidelines section 15064(h) properly employs the substantial evidence test when addressing the local agency\u2019s decision to rely on a regulatory standard as a CEQA significance threshold. The problem with this argument is that it focuses on the <em>establishment </em>of a regulatory standard as a threshold of significance; it ignores the real issue here\u2014the <em>application </em>of an established regulatory standard in a way that forecloses the consideration of any other substantial evidence showing there may be a significant effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">We conclude that Guidelines section 15064(h) is inconsistent with controlling CEQA law governing the fair argument approach, and therefore is invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">3. <em>Guidelines Section 15064(i)(3)\u2014Cumulative Impacts: Incremental Cumulative Effect and Cumulative Mitigation Plan</em></p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">In addition to evaluating a project\u2019s direct and indirect environmental effects, a lead agency must also assess whether a cumulative effect requires an EIR.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This requirement flows from CEQA section 21083. That section requires a finding that a project may have a significant effect on the environment if \u201c[t]he possible effects of a project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable. . . . \u2018 [Cjumulatively considerable\u2019 means that the incremental effects of an individual project are considerable when viewed in connection with the effects of past projects, the effects of other current projects, and the effects of probable future projects.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">Cumulative impact analysis is necessary because the full environmental impact of a proposed project cannot be gauged in a vacuum.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> One of the most important environmental lessons that has been learned is that environmental damage often occurs incrementally from a variety of small sources. These sources appear insignificant when considered individually, but assume threatening dimensions when considered collectively with other sources with which they interact.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although the assessment of cumulative effects plays an important part in the CEQA review process, this requirement has proven to be a source of considerable confusion.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">In assessing whether a cumulative effect requires an EIR, Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) states that \u201cA lead agency may determine that a project\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>incremental contribution to a cumulative effect is not cumulatively considerable if the project will comply with the requirements in a previously approved plan or mitigation program which provides specific requirements that will avoid or substantially lessen the cumulative problem (e.g., water quality control plan, air quality plan, integrated waste management plan) within the geographic area in which the project is located. Such plans or programs must be specified in law or adopted by the public agency with jurisdiction over the affected resources through a public review process to implement, interpret, or make specific the law enforced or administered by the public agency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">We conclude this Guideline is consistent with controlling CEQA law, so long as it is read to incorporate the fair argument standard for EIR preparation.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">This section stands in contrast to Guidelines section 15064(h), which we just repudiated. Guidelines section 15064(h) <em>directed </em>the lead agency to determine that a project\u2019s environmental effect was not significant if the effect complied with a standard meeting certain criteria, regardless of whether it could be fairly argued on the basis of other substantial evidence that the project could still have a significant environmental effect. Guidelines section 15064(i)(3), in contrast, states that a lead agency <em>may determine </em>that a project\u2019s incremental contribution to a cumulative effect is not cumulatively considerable if it complies with a standard meeting certain criteria. Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) does not direct the lead agency to focus only on the standard to the exclusion of other substantial evidence from which it can be fairly argued that an EIR is still required. In this way, Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) is more akin to the validated Guidelines section 15064.7 (encouraging the use of thresholds of significance) than it is to the invalidated Guidelines section 15064(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">The argument against Guidelines section 15064(i)(3)\u2019s validity is that the section impermissibly allows an agency to find a cumulative effect insignificant based on a project\u2019s compliance with some generalized plan rather than on the project\u2019s actual environmental impacts. That is, even if substantial evidence shows that a project\u2019s cumulative impact may be cumulatively considerable and therefore significant, the lead agency may nevertheless deem the impact insignificant, and forego an EIR, simply because the impact complies with a plan or mitigation program. By incorporating the fair argument approach into Guidelines section 15064(i)(3)\u2019s receptive \u201cmay determine\u201d language, however, this argument loses its punch. If there is substantial evidence that the possible effects of a particular project are still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>cumulatively considerable notwithstanding that the project complies with the specified plan or mitigation program addressing the cumulative problem, an EIR must be prepared for the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">The trial court found that Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) contravenes CEQA case law which holds that a project can have significant cumulative impacts even though the project complies with thresholds of significance in an approved plan or mitigation program.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> There is no contravention, however, if Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) incorporates the fair argument standard; rather, the principle enunciated in these cases provides the legal basis for a fair argument that a project has significant cumulative impacts notwithstanding that it complies with an approved plan or mitigation program.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">We conclude that Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) is consistent with controlling CEQA law so long as the section is deemed to incorporate the fair argument standard in triggering EIR preparation. Guidelines section 15152(f)(2), which involves EIR tiering, incorporates Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (i).

It states: \u201cA lead agency may determine that the incremental impacts of a project are not cumulatively considerable when they are so small that they make only a de minimis contribution to a significant cumulative impact caused by other projects that would exist in the absence of the proposed project.

It states: \u201c(a) An EIR shall discuss cumulative impacts of a project when the project\u2019s incremental effect is cumulatively considerable ....

Their application would turn cumulative impact analysis on its head by diminishing the need to do a cumulative impact analysis as the cumulative impact problem worsens. The reason for this incongruity is that the de minimis approach of Guidelines sections 15064(i)(4) and 15130(a)(4) compares the incremental effect of the proposed project against the collective cumulative impact of all relevant projects. This comparative approach is contrary to CEQA section 21083 and to the Guidelines section 15355 definition of cumulative impacts, set forth above; this approach also contravenes CEQA case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>The seminal decision is <em>Kings County.</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There the court concluded that an EIR inadequately considered an air pollution (ozone) cumulative impact. The court said: \u201cThe []EIR concludes the project\u2019s contributions to ozone levels in the area would be immeasurable and, therefore, insignificant because the [cogeneration] plant would emit relatively minor amounts of [ozone] precursors compared to the total volume of [ozone] precursors emitted in Kings County.

County of Stanislaus, </em>in which the court quoted from a CEQA treatise.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> This language distinguished between the \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d analysis required in an EIR and the question of whether a project\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>impacts are \u201ccumulatively considerable\u201d for purposes of determining whether an EIR must be prepared at all. If the two are treated as equivalent, said the language in <em>San Joaquin Raptor, </em>\u201c \u2018any contribution by a project, however small, to environmental conditions that are cumulatively adverse requires a finding that the project may have a significant cumulative impact. The problem with this view is that it would make the need for an EIR turn on the impacts of other projects, not on the impacts of the project under review. [ID \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [f] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [An] agency [must] consider[] the effects of other projects, but only as a context for considering whether the incremental effects of the project at issue are considerable. In other words, the agency determines whether the incremental impacts of the project are \u201ccumulatively considerable\u201d by evaluating them against the backdrop of the environmental effects of other projects. <em>The question is not whether there is a \u201csignificant cumulative </em>impact\u2019 <em>but whether the effects of the \u201cindividual project are consider</em>able\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">In our view, this passage from <em>San Joaquin Raptor </em>takes a step down the road of the \u201cratio theory/comparative approach\u201d that was repudiated in <em>Kings County </em>and <em>Los Angeles Unified. </em>The passage\u2019s premise\u2014a premise relied on by the Resources Agency regarding Guidelines sections 15064(i)(4) and 15130(a)(4)\u2014is that the need for an EIR turns on the impacts of the project under review, not on the impacts of other past, present, or future projects.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">However, under CEQA section 21083, under the Guidelines section 15355 definition of cumulative impacts, and under the <em>Kings County/Los Angeles Unified </em>approach, the need for an EIR turns on the impacts of <em>both </em>the project under review and the relevant past, present and future projects. Under CEQA section 21083, an EIR is required if the \u201cpossible effects of a project are individually limited but cumulatively considerable\u201d; the incremental effects of an individual project are to be \u201cviewed <em>in connection with </em>the effects of\u2019 past, current and probable future projects.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Guidelines section 15355 defines \u201ccumulative impacts\u201d as referring \u201cto two or more individual effects which, <em>when considered together, </em>are considerable or which compound or increase other environmental impacts\u201d (italics added); and states that the \u201ccumulative impact from several projects is the change in the environment which results from the incremental impact of the project <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number><em>when added to </em>other closely related past, present, and reasonably foreseeable probable future projects. Cumulative impacts can result from <em>individually minor but collectively significant projects </em>taking place over a period of time\u201d (italics added). And \u201cthe relevant question\u201d under the <em>Kings County/Los Angeles Unified </em>approach is not how the effect of the project at issue compares to the preexisting cumulative effect, but whether \u201cany additional amount\u201d of effect should be considered significant in the context of the existing cumulative effect.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, that <em>any </em>additional effect in a nonattainment area for that effect <em>necessarily </em>creates a significant cumulative impact; the \u201cone [additional] molecule rule\u201d is not the law.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Moreover, the basic approach set forth in Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (i)(l) seems sound\u2014that is, in assessing whether a cumulative effect requires an EIR, the lead agency shall consider whether the cumulative impact is significant and whether the proposed project\u2019s incremental effects are cumulatively considerable.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In the end, the greater the existing environmental problems are, the lower the threshold should be for treating a project\u2019s contribution to cumulative impacts as significant.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> But the language quoted in <em>San Joaquin Raptor </em>runs counter to this concept and puts the cart before the horse. This is because that language would effectively adopt a higher threshold \u201ccomparative approach\u201d for deciding whether to prepare an EIR, and a lower threshold \u201ccombined approach\u201d for governing a cumulative impact discussion in an EIR.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">Furthermore, the distinction drawn in the <em>San Joaquin Raptor </em>passage between EIR preparation and EIR discussion regarding cumulative impacts finds little support in CEQA law. Case law states that \u201c[w]hile [CEQA] section 21083 governs the situations in which an agency must prepare an EIR, its provisions have also been applied to the contents of an EIR once it is determined an EIR must be prepared.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Echoing this theme, the discussion following Guidelines section 15065 on mandatory findings of significance states that \u201c[t]hese mandatory findings [which include the \u2018cumulatively considerable\u2019 finding from CEQA section 21083] control not only the decision of whether to prepare an EIR but also the identification of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>effects to be analyzed in depth in the EIR . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> Finally, the discussion following Guidelines section 15355 remarks that \u201c[the] definition of the term \u2018cumulative impacts\u2019 is provided because the term is related to one of the mandatory findings of significant effect required by [CEQA] [s]ection 21083. A common understanding of the term is needed in order to implement the section.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\"> We conclude that Guidelines sections 15064(i)(4) and 15130(a)(4) are inconsistent with controlling CEQA law because they measure a proposed project\u2019s de minimis incremental impact relative to the existing cumulative impact, rather than focus on the combined effects of these impacts. A question arises as to whether these two sections can be saved by construing the de minimis effect in <em>absolute </em>rather than relative terms. We think not. Focusing on the de minimis effect in absolute terms isolates the effect individually, and this runs counter to the combined approach that CEQA cumulative impact law requires. Moreover, a de minimis effect in absolute terms would be akin to no environmental effect; the Guidelines already cover that concept, so Guidelines sections 15064(i)(4) and 15130(a)(4) would be unnecessary in this realm. Guidelines section 15130, subdivision (a)(1) states that \u201c[a]n EIR should not discuss impacts which do not result in part from the project evaluated in the EIR.\u201d And Guidelines section 15064, subdivision (i)(5) adds that the \u201cmere existence of significant cumulative impacts caused by other projects alone shall not constitute substantial evidence that the proposed project\u2019s incremental effects are cumulatively considerable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">Guidelines section 15152(f)(2) governs the assessment of whether there is a new significant cumulative effect in a tiered EIR process (\u201ctiering\u201d refers to incorporating the analysis from a general, broader EIR into a later, narrower EIR).<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Guidelines section 15152(f)(2) states, in part, that \u201c[a]t this point, the question is not whether there is a significant cumulative impact, but whether the effects of the project are cumulatively considerable. For a discussion on how to assess whether project impacts are cumulatively considerable, see [Guidelines] [s]ection 15064(i).\u201d We agree with the trial court that to the extent that Guidelines section 15152(f)(2) incorporates Guidelines section 15064(i)(4), it is invalid to that extent.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">5. <em>Guidelines Section 15130(b)(l)(B)2\u2014Cumulative Impacts: Defining \u201cProbable Future </em>Projects\u201d <em>for Cumulative Impact Purposes</em></p>\n<p id=\"b129-10\">This section defines \u201cprobable future projects,\u201d a term used in CEQA section 21083 on the subject of cumulative impacts.

Subdivision (f)(3)(C) of Guidelines section 15152 is not based on a similar statutory exception, prompting CBE\u2019s argument that this subdivision has no legal basis and is invalid because it does not explicitly require that an earlier EIR have actually addressed the impacts of the later project.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>Subdivision (f)(3)(C) of Guidelines section 15152 is phrased somewhat awkwardly; it would be clearer if it was prefaced, as is subdivision (f)(3)(B), with a statement that the significant environmental effects \u201chave been examined at a sufficient level of detail in the prior [EIR]\u201d (and they cannot be mitigated, etc.). With this clarification, the concept underlying subdivision (f)(3)(C) appears to fall within the fundamental concept of tiering\u2014a prior EIR has adequately addressed the environmental effects of a later project such that further <em>analysis </em>of those effects in the later EIR would be \u201cduplicative.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> As one commentator has remarked regarding subdivision (f)(3)(C), the Resources Agency apparently reasoned that limited societal resources are not well expended in preparing later EIR\u2019s, when those EIR\u2019s almost certainly would not result in any additional mitigation or other enhanced environmental protection.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-5\">Even assuming, however, that Guidelines section 15152(f)(3)(C) incorporates the fundamental concept of tiering, it suffers from another fundamental problem. The section appears to allow an agency, in approving a later project that has significant unavoidable impacts, to forego making a statement of overriding considerations <em>specifically tied to that project. </em>This is contrary to CEQA law. CEQA section 21094, subdivision (d) requires agencies that approve a later project to comply with CEQA section 21081. Under CEQA section 21081, an agency approving a project with significant environmental effects must find that each effect will be mitigated or avoided, or \u201cthat <em>specific </em>overriding economic, legal, social, technological, or other benefits of <em>the project </em>outweigh the . . . effect[] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> The requirement of a statement of overriding considerations is central to CEQA\u2019s role as a public accountability statute; it requires public officials, in approving environmentally detrimental projects, to justify their decisions based on counterbalancing social, economic or other benefits, and to point to substantial evidence in support.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Under Guidelines section 15152(f)(3)(C), however, an agency apparently could adopt one statement of overriding considerations for a prior, more general EIR, and then avoid future political accountability by approving later, more specific projects with significant unavoidable impacts pursuant to the prior EIR and statement of overriding considerations. Even though a prior EIR\u2019s <em>analysis </em>of environmental effects may be subject to being incorporated in a later EIR for a later, more specific project, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>responsible public officials must still go on the record and explain specifically why they are approving the later project despite <em>its </em>significant unavoidable impacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We conclude that Guidelines section 15152(f)(3)(C) is inconsistent with controlling CEQA law and is therefore invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">7. <em>Guidelines Section 15378(b)(5)\u2014Definition of Project: Organizational Activities Which Are Political or Not Physical Changes Excluded from Definition of \u201cProject\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-10\">As noted, with certain exceptions, CEQA requires public agencies to prepare an EIR for any \u201cproject\u201d they intend to carry out or approve which may have a significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Under CEQA section 21065, \u201c \u2018[pjrojecf means an activity which may cause either a direct physical change in the environment, or a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-11\">Guidelines section 15378(b)(5) excludes from the definition of \u201cproject\u201d the following: \u201cOrganizational or administrative activities of governments which are political or which are not physical changes in the environment (such as the reorganization of a school district or detachment of park land).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b133-12\">There are two problems with this Guideline, one grammatical and one substantive.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">The grammatical problem is with the use of the disjunctive \u201cor.\u201d Under that disjunctive, governmental political activities of an organizational or administrative nature are excluded from the definition of \u201cproject\u201d for CEQA purposes. This blanket exclusion cuts too broad a swath; in an Alice-in-Wonderland kind of way, it could arguably be stretched to encompass the very approval of a project. Even the proponent of this Guideline recognizes the impermissibly broad nature of this measure, noting that \u201c[i]n order to qualify as exempt under [it], the organizational or administrative activities must be both political <em>and. . </em>. not result in physical changes to the environment.\u201d (Italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">The substantive problem concerns the language \u201cwhich are not physical changes in the environment.\u201d Under the relevant CEQA statute, section 21065, a CEQA \u201cproject\u201d encompasses an activity \u201cwhich may <em>cause either </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>a direct physical change in the environment, <em>or </em>a reasonably foreseeable indirect physical change in the environment . . . .\u201d (Italics added.)

Guidelines section 15378(b)(5) encompasses only activities \u201cwhich are not physical changes\u201d; the section does not say, activities which <em>do not cause or result </em>in direct or indirect physical changes.

A categorical exemption shall not be used for an activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">Thus, a categorical exemption authorized by CEQA section 21084 is an exemption from CEQA for a <em>class </em>of projects that the Resources Agency determines will <em>generally </em>not have a significant effect on the environment.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">Guidelines section 15332 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">\u201cClass 32 consists of projects characterized as in-fill development meeting the conditions described in this section.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">\u201c(a) The project is consistent with the applicable general plan designation and all applicable general plan policies as well as with applicable zoning designation and regulations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>\u201c(b) The proposed development occurs within city limits on a project site of no more than five acres substantially surrounded by urban uses.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-5\">\u201c(c) The project site has no value, as habitat for endangered, rare or threatened species.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">\u201c(d) Approval of the project would not result in any significant effects relating to traffic, noise, air quality, or water quality.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">\u201c(e) The site can be adequately served by all required utilities and public services.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">In reading Guidelines section 15332, we cannot dispute the Resources Agency\u2019s finding that this class of projects generally will not' have a significant effect on the environment; that is, we do not see an inconsistency between Guidelines section 15332 and CEQA section 21084\u2019s requirement that any <em>class </em>of projects listed in the Guidelines as a categorical exemption must not have a significant effect on the environment. Guidelines section 15332 is limited to in-fill urban development, and subdivisions (a) through (e) specify, as the trial court found, \u201ccomprehensive environmentally protective conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">CBE counters with a series of arguments. CBE notes that Guidelines section 15332 applies to any type of in-fill urban project, ranging from industrial facilities to residential developments, and is broader than most categorical exemptions. CBE provides examples of diverse, under-five-acre urban projects with significant environmental impact, such as highway drill sites and electrical generation plants. However, all projects within Guidelines section 15332\u2019s scope have to comply with all applicable general plan designations and policies and all applicable zoning designations and regulations in addition to the other Guidelines section 15332 protective criteria.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">In a related vein, CBE observes that the Legislature has already provided statutory exemptions in the CEQA scheme for certain narrow classes of in-fill projects; thus, Guidelines section 15332 runs counter to legislative intent. However, statutory exemptions have an absolute quality not shared by categorical exemptions: a project that falls within a statutory exemption is not subject to CEQA even if it has the potential to significantly affect the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>environment.<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Moreover, the Legislature has authorized the adoption of categorical exemptions notwithstanding statutory ones.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">CBE maintains that the section 15332 phrase \u201csubstantially surrounded by urban uses\u201d could lead to piecemeal expansion of urban areas as projects avoid CEQA review under this exemption. However, one of the exceptions to categorical exemptions provides that such exemptions \u201care inapplicable when the cumulative impact of successive projects of the same type in the same place, over time is significant.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">CBE argues that the environmental effects listed in subdivisions (c) and (d) of Guidelines section 15332 necessarily foreclose the consideration of other effects such as aesthetics, cultural resources, water supply, and health and safety. That is not correct. An important exception to categorical exemptions, based on the <em>Chickering </em>decision, provides that a \u201ccategorical exemption shall not be used for a[] [particular] activity where there is a reasonable possibility that the activity will have a significant effect on the environment due to unusual circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> These other environmental effects that CBE mentions would constitute \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d under this exception for a project that otherwise meets the Guidelines section 15332 criteria. This is because a project that does meet the comprehensive environmentally protective criteria of section 15332 normally would not have other significant environmental effects; if there was a reasonable possibility that the project would have such effects, those effects would be \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d covered by the section 15300.2, subdivision (c) exception. In this way, these other effects would fall within the concept of unusual circumstances set forth in <em>Azusa: </em>\u201c[unusual] circumstances of a particular project (i) differ from the general circumstances of the projects covered by a particular categorical exemption, and (ii) those circumstances create an environmental risk that does not exist for the general class of exempt projects.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">CBE relies on <em>Chickering\u2019\u2019 </em>s statement \u201cthat where there is any reasonable possibility that a project or activity may have a significant effect on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>environment, an exemption would be improper,\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> and on <em>Mountain Lion\u2019s </em>reiteration that \u201c[a]ny activity that may have a significant effect on the environment cannot be categorically exempt.\u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> As we have explained, these statements cannot be read so broadly as to defeat the very idea underlying CEQA section 21084 of <em>classes </em>or <em>categories </em>of projects that <em>generally </em>do not have a significant effect on the environment. Instead, these statements provide the basis for the \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d exception of Guidelines section 15300.2, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The judgment is affirmed, except with respect to Guidelines section 15064(i)(3) and Guidelines section 15152(f)(2)\u2019s incorporation of Guidelines section 15064(i)(3), as explained herein.
