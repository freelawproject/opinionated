(Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11377, subd. (a), 11550, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 667, subds. (b)-(i), 1170.12.) At sentencing, the Honorable John T. Ball dismissed two of defendant\u2019s strikes in furtherance of justice (see Pen. Code, \u00a7 1385; <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Romero) </em>(1996) 13 Cal.4th 497 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628]) and imposed a one-strike term of 32 months for possession and a concurrent 90-day jail term for being under the influence. The district attorney immediately challenged the dismissal of two strikes by seeking a writ of mandate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-9\">On May 15, 2000, this court filed an opinion in which we concluded that Judge Ball had abused his discretion in dismissing the two strikes. <em>(People v. Superior Court </em>(Letteer) (May 15, 2000, H020324) [nonpub. opn.].)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We issued a peremptory writ of mandate, directing the superior court to vacate the dismissal order, reinstate the two strikes, and resentence defendant as a person with three strike prior convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1053-10\">On remand, the prosecutor disqualified Judge Ball from resentencing defendant by filing a peremptory challenge under Code of Civil Procedure, section 170.6, subdivision (2), and, over defendant\u2019s objection, resentencing proceeded before the Honorable Paul T. Teilh.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Judge Teilh denied defendant\u2019s request for a formal sentencing hearing, reinstated the previously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1312\">*1312</page-number>dismissed strikes, and imposed a Three Strikes term of 25 years to life for possession of methamphetamine and a concurrent six-month jail term for being under the influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-4\">On appeal from the judgment, defendant claims, among other things, that sentencing by Judge Teilh violated the terms of the plea bargain. We agree, reverse the judgment, and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1054-5\">II. <em>Violation of the Plea Bargain</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1054-6\">Citing <em>People v. Arbuckle </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 749 [150 Cal.Rptr. 778, 587 P.2d 220, 3 A.L.R.4th 1171] <em>(Arbuckle), </em>defendant contends that an implied term of the plea bargain entitled him to have Judge Ball resentence him, and therefore, resentencing by Judge Teilh violated the plea bargain and denied him due process of law. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1313\">*1313</page-number>In Arbuckle, the defendant entered a plea before a particular judge, but before the sentencing hearing, that judge was transferred to a different department. The defendant\u2019s request to have the case transferred was denied, and a different judge imposed sentence. <em>(Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 757.) In reversing the judgment, the California Supreme Court stated, \u201cAs a general principle . . . , whenever a judge accepts a plea bargain and retains sentencing discretion under the agreement, an implied term of the bargain is that sentence will be imposed by that judge. Because of the range of dispositions available to a sentencing judge, the propensity in sentencing demonstrated by a particular judge is an inherently significant factor in the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a guilty plea. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 756-757.) The court held that \u201c[b]ecause the defendant has been denied that aspect of his plea bargain, the sentence imposed by another judge cannot be allowed to stand. [Citations.] The defendant is entitled to be sentenced by [the original judge], or if internal court administrative practices render that impossible, then in the alternative defendant should be permitted to withdraw his plea.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at p. 757, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-5\">The People claim that <em>Arbuckle </em>is inapplicable here because at the time defendant entered his plea, he did not reasonably expect Judge Ball to sentence him, and therefore, sentencing by Judge Ball did not become an implied term of the plea bargain. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-6\">The People correctly note that <em>Arbuckle </em>rights arise only where the record affirmatively indicates that the defendant reasonably expected to be sentenced by the judge who took the plea. <em>(In re Mark L. </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 171, 177 [193 Cal.Rptr. 165, 666 P.2d 22]; <em>People v. Adams, supra, </em>224 Cal.App.3d at p. 1543; <em>People v. Horn </em>(1989) 213 Cal.App.3d 701, 707 [261 Cal.Rptr. 814]; <em>People v. Serrato, supra, </em>201 Cal.App.3d at p. 764; <em>People v. Guerra </em>(1988) 200 Cal.App.3d 1067, 1071-1072 [246 Cal.Rptr. 392]; <em>People v. Ruhl </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 311, 315 [214 Cal.Rptr. 93]; <em>In re James H. </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 911, 919-920 [212 Cal.Rptr. 61].) For example, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1314\">*1314</page-number><em>Arbuckle, </em>the court found a reasonable expectation because the judge who took the plea repeatedly used the personal pronoun in referring to the future sentencing hearing. <em>(Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 756, fn. 4.) Similarly, in <em>In re Mark L., </em>the court found a reasonable expectation because the judicial officer interchangeably used the personal pronoun and \u201c \u2018the Court\u2019 \u201d when referring to sentencing. <em>(In re Mark L., supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 177.)</p>\n<p id=\"A9lR\">Here, in taking the plea, Judge Ball referred to the possible alternative sentences \u201cthe court\u201d could impose. After accepting the plea, he stated, \u201cAll right. Then <em>the Court </em>will find that the defendant has freely and voluntarily waived his constitutional rights and entered a plea after having been advised of the consequences thereof.\u201d (Italics added.) He then referred the matter to the probation department, asking defense counsel if defendant waived time. Counsel waived time and asked if \u201cthe Court\u201d would be available for sentencing during a particular week. Judge Ball said that he would be.</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-5\">When Judge Ball and defense counsel said \u201cthe court,\u201d they were referring to Judge Ball. Moreover, in scheduling the sentencing hearing, Judge Ball indicated he would be the one to sentence defendant. Thus, the record affirmatively shows that defendant expected Judge Ball to sentence him. Indeed, Judge Ball did sentence him. At that time, he used \u201cI\u201d and \u201cthe court\u201d interchangeably, and counsel referred to him as \u201cthe court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1056-6\">Any possible ambiguity concerning defendant\u2019s expectation is dispelled by his conduct after entering his plea. He wrote Judge Ball a letter about the upcoming sentencing hearing, and in closing stated, \u201cYour Honor, I am truely [sic] frightened about all this. I haven\u2019t understood much of all that is happening or how it has become such a travesty. Your sheriff officers in your court room, as well as my attorney and Madam District Attorney have said you are a fair and just Judge. So I am placing my trust in you. Though your power terrifies me I believe what your Court officers have told me.\u201d Defendant\u2019s letter unmistakably reflects that he expected Judge Ball to sentence him.  Moreover, later, after the prosecutor successfully removed Judge Ball, defendant expressly objected to sentencing by Judge Teilh, claiming a violation of his <em>Arbuckle </em>rights. (See <em>People v. Horn, supra, </em>213 Cal.App.3d at p. 709 [lack of objection to sentencing by different judge relevant in determining existence of <em>Arbuckle </em>rights].)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1056-7\">The People further claim that even if defendant expected Judge Ball to sentence him, <em>Arbuckle </em>is still inapplicable. In support of this claim, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1315\">*1315</page-number>People cite <em>People v. Dunn </em>(1986) 176 Cal.App.3d 572 [222 Cal.Rptr. 273] <em>(Dunn). </em>Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-5\">In <em>Dunn, </em>the judge who took the plea retired before sentencing, and a different judge imposed sentence. On appeal, the court found <em>Arbuckle </em>inapplicable because the original judge\u2019s unavailability was due to \u201ca matter clearly beyond the power of the court to control\u201d\u2014retirement\u2014rather than an internal administrative problem or convenience of the court, as was the case in <em>Arbuckle. (Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.) In support of its holding, the court quoted <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1982) 129 Cal.App.3d 5 [180 Cal.Rptr. 759], a case where the original judge died before sentencing. According to <em>Watson, \u201cArbuckle </em>and the cases applying it [citations] involve situations where the original judge was unavailable for sentencing due to internal administrative scheduling problems. <em>Arbuckle </em>speaks only of such situations and it is doubtful whether its mandate would apply when, as here, the judge is unavailable due to his death.\u201d <em>(Watson, supra, </em>129 Cal.App.3d at p. 7; <em>Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-6\">Building on the <em>Watson </em>court\u2019s doubt, <em>Dunn </em>states that \u201ca negotiated plea does not carry with it an implied promise that the judge accepting the plea will not resign, retire, expire or be removed from the bench pending imposition of sentence. The People appropriately bear the risk of a judge\u2019s unavailability due to matters within the control of the court, but no good reason appears why they should bear the risk that the judge before whom defendant plead[ed] is no longer vested with judicial power to pass sentence. To the implied term recognized by <em>Arbuckle </em>that the judge accepting the plea will impose sentence must be added an implied condition: if that judge then still actively exercises judicial power.\u201d <em>(Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575; see also <em>People v. Jackson </em>(1987) 193 Cal.App.3d 393 [238 Cal.Rptr. 327] <em>[Arbuckle </em>inapplicable where unavailability due to illness].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-7\">The People argue that this case comes within the <em>Dunn </em>exception because the prosecutor\u2019s peremptory challenge \u201cmust also be considered an event' that removes the judge from the ability to exercise judicial power in a defendant\u2019s case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1057-8\">Initially, we question the validity of the <em>Dunn </em>exception. In effect, <em>Dunn </em>limited <em>Arbuckle </em>to its facts: unavailability due to administrative matters within the superior court\u2019s control. We acknowledge that in <em>Arbuckle, </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>court did not discuss whether a defendant should be allowed to withdraw the plea if the original judge becomes unavailable for reasons <em>outside </em>the control of the court, such as death, illness, retirement, removal from the bench or other circumstances. (See <em>People v. Martinez </em>(2000) 22 Cal.4th 106, 118 [91 Cal.Rptr.2d 687, 990 P.2d 563] [cases are not authority for propositions they do not consider].) However, when we view <em>Arbuckle </em>in light of the principles that govern the implementation of a plea bargain and the consequences of deviating from its terms,- we find the <em>Dunn </em>limitation on <em>Arbuckle </em>to be unwarranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">As noted, <em>Arbuckle </em>recognized that \u201cwhenever a judge accepts a plea bargain and retains sentencing discretion under the agreement, an implied term of the bargain is that sentence will be imposed by that judge. Because of the range of dispositions available to a sentencing judge, the propensity in sentencing demonstrated by a particular judge is an inherently significant factor in the defendant\u2019s decision to enter a guilty plea. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at pp. 756-757.)  It is settled that \u201cwhen a plea rests in any significant degree on a promise or agreement of the prosecutor, so that it can be said to be <em>part of the inducement </em>or consideration, such promise must be fulfilled.\u201d <em>(Santobello </em>v. <em>New York </em>(1971) 404 U.S. 257, 262 [92 S.Ct. 495, 499, 30 L.Ed.2d 427], italics added.) \u201cThe Supreme Court has thus recognized that due process applies not only to the procedure of accepting the plea [citation], but that the requirements of due process attach also to implementation of the bargain itself. It necessarily follows that violation of the bargain by an officer of the state raises a constitutional right to some remedy.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mancheno </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 855, 860 [187 Cal.Rptr. 441, 654 P.2d 211]; accord, <em>People v. Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024; see <em>People v. Vargas </em>(2001) 91 Cal.App.4th 506, 533 [110 Cal.Rptr.2d 210] [in essence, a plea bargain is a contract governed by contractual principles]; see, e.g., <em>People v. Quartermain </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 600, 620 [66 Cal.Rptr.2d 609, 941 P.2d 788] [breach deemed violation of due process]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Olea </em>(1977) 59 Cal.App.4th 1289 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 722] [same].) \u201cThis does not mean that <em>any </em>deviation from the terms of the agreement is constitutionally impermissible.\u201d <em>(People v. Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1024, original italics.) Rather, the variance must be \u201c \u2018significant\u2019 in the context of the plea bargain as a whole to violate the defendant\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; Santobello v. New York, supra, </em>404 U.S. at p. 262 [92 S.Ct. at pp. 498-499].) However, when there is such a variance, the violation of the plea bargain is not subject to harmless error analysis. Rather, the defendant is entitled to an appropriate remedy. <em>(In re Moser </em>(1993) 6 Cal.4th 342, 353-354 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 723, 862 P.2d 723]; <em>People v. Walker, supra, </em>54 Cal.3d at p. 1026; <em>In re Williams </em>(2000) 83 Cal.App.4th 936, 944 [100 Cal.Rptr.2d 144].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>Given these principles and the fact that sentencing by the original judge is an implied term of the plea bargain and represents an inherently important factor in the decision to enter a plea bargain, we conclude that sentencing by a different judge constitutes a significant deviation <em>regardless </em>of whether unavailability is due to matters within or outside the court\u2019s control. Certainly from the defendant\u2019s point of view, sentencing by a different judge does not become an insignificant deviation simply because unavailability is due to retirement rather than an administrative transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">We agree with <em>Dunn's </em>view that a plea bargain does not \u201ccarry with it an implied promise that the judge accepting the plea will not resign, retire, expire or be removed from the bench.\u201d <em>(Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.) However, <em>Dunn </em>only states the obvious and does not further explain why unavailability due to resignation, retirement, etc. should negate an implied term of the bargain and prevent the defendant from withdrawing the plea, even though sentencing by a different judge is a significant deviation from the plea bargain. Moreover, even if at the time of the plea a defendant knows, or should know, that the same judge will not impose sentence if he or she retires, resigns, dies, etc., <em>Dunn </em>does not explain why a defendant could not still reasonably expect the chance to withdraw the plea if that happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-5\">Instead of giving an explanation, <em>Dunn </em>suggests a justification. As noted, <em>Dunn </em>opines that although the prosecution should bear the risk of unavailability due to matters within the court\u2019s control\u2014i.e., an administrative transfer as occurred in Arbuckle\u2014there is no \u201cgood\u201d reason the prosecution should bear the risk of unavailability due to matters outside the court\u2019s control, such as resignation, retirement, death, etc. <em>(Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.) However, <em>Dunn </em>does not explain why in the first instance the prosecution should bear the risk of unavailability due to matters <em>within </em>the court\u2019s control; and if there is a \u201cgood\u201d reason, <em>Dunn </em>does not explain why it would not also apply when unavailability is due to matters <em>outside </em>the court\u2019s control. Nor does <em>Dunn </em>offer a \u201cgood\u201d reason why <em>the defendant </em>should bear the risk of unavailability in the latter situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\"><em>Dunn's </em>risk assessment approach implies that the equities between the parties differ depending on whether unavailability is due to matters within or outside the court\u2019s control. However, we fail to see how the equities might favor either party when unavailability is due to matters outside <em>both </em>parties\u2019 control. For this reason, we do not consider risk assessment to be helpful in determining when a defendant should be able to withdraw the plea. In our view, the issue is simply whether sentencing by a different judge constitutes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>a significant deviation from the terms of the plea bargain. If it is, then the defendant should not be held to the bargain and must be allowed to withdraw the plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">Nevertheless, assuming for purposes of argument that Dunn's exception to <em>Arbuckle </em>is valid, we find the exception inapplicable. Although Judge Ball\u2019s unavailability was due to matters <em>outside </em>the court\u2019s control, it was due to matters wholly within the prosecution\u2019s control\u2014i.e., its peremptory challenge. <em>Dunn </em>did not address this situation and does not suggest that the prosecution should not have to bear the risk of unavailability caused by its own election to remove the original judge. On the contrary, we find it both reasonable and appropriate for the prosecution to bear the risk under those circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-5\">The People argue that removing a judge via a peremptory challenge renders the judge unavailable in the same way that retirement, resignation, death, etc. do: In each situation, the judge is not able to exercise judicial power. We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-6\">As noted, in articulating its exception to <em>Arbuckle, Dunn </em>stated that the same judge will sentence the defendant only \u201cif that judge then still actively exercises judicial power.\u201d <em>(Dunn, supra, </em>176 Cal.App.3d at p. 575.) The context in <em>Dunn </em>gives the court\u2019s language its meaning and scope. There, the court was focusing on unavailability due to matters such as retirement, death, incapacitation, and permanent removal from the bench, which prevent a judge from actively exercising judicial power under <em>any </em>circumstances. Although Judge Ball could not sentence defendant, he was still actively exercising judicial power in other cases. We doubt the <em>Dunn </em>court intended its language to cover this situation, and we can think of no good reason it should be extended to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-7\"><em>Dunn's </em>inapplicability, however, does not end our discussion of defendant\u2019s claim. We point out that the prosecution had a statutory right to challenge Judge Ball. Thus, this case involves a conflict between that right and defendant\u2019s <em>Arbuckle </em>rights. To resolve it, we examine and balance the rights of each party and the burden on each if the other\u2019s right takes precedence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1060-8\">As stated, the requirements of due process apply not only to the procedure of accepting the plea bargain but also to the implementation of the bargain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>itself. Thus, a violation of the bargain gives rise to a constitutional right to some remedy. <em>(People v. Mancheno, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at p. 860.) <em>Arbuckle </em>rights protect a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation under the plea bargain concerning who will impose sentence. Moreover, by permitting the defendant to withdraw the plea if that judge is unavailable, <em>Arbuckle </em>rights also protect the fundamental rights that a defendant forfeits in entering a plea, including the right to a jury trial, to confront and cross-examine the People\u2019s witnesses, and to be free from compelled self-incrimination. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gurule </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 557, 634 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 345, 51 P.3d 224].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">The right to exercise a peremptory challenge is also \u201ca substantial right and an important part of California\u2019s system of due process that promotes fair and impartial trials and confidence in the judiciary.\u201d <em>(Stephens </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(2002) 96 Cal.App.4th 54, 61 [116 Cal.Rptr.2d 616]; <em>Truck Ins. Exchange v. Superior Court </em>(1998) 67 Cal.App.4th 142, 144 [78 Cal.Rptr.2d 721].) Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6 guarantees \u201cto litigants an extraordinary right to disqualify a judge. The right is \u2018automatic\u2019 in the sense that a good faith <em>belief </em>in prejudice is alone sufficient, proof of facts showing actual prejudice not being required. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(McCartney v. Commission on Judicial Qualifications </em>(1974) 12 Cal.3d 512, 531 [116 Cal.Rptr. 260, 526 P.2d 268], original italics, overruled on other grounds in <em>Spruance v.

Ball, Judge of the Superior Court of the County of Santa Clara, before whom the hearing in the aforesaid action is pending, is prejudiced against the People of the State of California, County of Santa Clara in this matter and against their attorney and the interest of the People of the State of California, County of Santa Clara so that this affiant cannot or believes she cannot have a fair and impartial hearing before the Honorable John T. Ball.\u201d (See Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 170.6, subd. (5) [standard content for affidavit].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>(1d) Although the rights of both parties derive from constitutional sources, the burden on each if the other party prevails and, more importantly, the fairness of that burden are much different. If the prosecution can remove the original judge without potential consequences\u2014i.e., withdrawal of the plea\u2014then the prosecution, in effect, can nullify an implied term of the plea bargain. Moreover, the defendant has no option but to accept sentencing by a different judge. Thus, the defendant remains bound by his or her decision to waive trial and enter a plea, but the prosecution retains all of its benefits under the bargain. In our view, it is unfair for the prosecution to nullify a promise that helped induce a plea and still fully enjoy the benefits of that plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">On the other hand, if the defendant is allowed to withdraw the plea when the prosecution elects to challenge the original judge, the prosecution has two options. It can forgo a challenge and retain the benefits of the plea bargain. Although it must then accept sentencing by a judge it believes is prejudiced, we find any unfairness mitigated by the fact that the judge is still bound by terms of the bargain negotiated by the prosecution. <em>(People v. Cunningham </em>(1996) 49 Cal.App.4th 1044, 1047-1048 [57 Cal.Rptr.2d 179].)  Presumably, when the prosecution accepted the bargain, the prosecutor knew and accepted the scope of judicial discretion it permitted and the range of possible sentences the court could impose. Under these circumstances, the opportunity for a judge who has been reversed to rule unfairly is quite limited.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">In any event, the prosecution has a second option: It can remove the judge. Of course, the defendant might respond by withdrawing the plea, and as a result, the prosecution would have to go to trial. However, making the prosecution do what it was required to do before the plea was negotiated\u2014 prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt at trial\u2014does not appear to be an <em>unfair </em>consequence of its decision to remove the judge and nullify part of the plea bargain. This is especially so because the prosecution can protect itself in advance from the withdrawal of a plea by requiring an <em>Arbuckle </em>waiver as a condition of the bargain. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Mikhail, supra, </em>13 Cal.App.4th at p. 851.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>On balance, we consider the unfairness to a defendant when the prosecution removes the original judge to be far greater than the unfairness to the prosecution when the defendant withdraws the plea. We further consider the burden on the prosecution when the defendant withdraws the plea to be justified by the need to protect the defendant\u2019s right to the benefits of his plea bargain and the fundamental rights waived in entering a plea. Consequently, we hold that because defendant was not allowed to withdraw his plea after the prosecution removed Judge Ball, sentencing by Judge Teilh violated his plea bargain. Therefore, under <em>Arbuckle, </em>defendant\u2019s sentence \u201ccannot be allowed to stand.\u201d <em>(Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 757.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">III. <em>Formal Sentencing Hearing</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">Because there is a possibility that on remand the matter could proceed directly to resentencing before Judge Ball, we address defendant\u2019s claim that he is entitled to a full sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">In our written decision in the writ proceeding, we directed the lower court as follows: \u201cLet a peremptory writ of mandate issue directing respondent court to vacate its order dismissing two prior serious felony convictions, and to enter a new and different order reinstating those convictions and resentencing real party in interest Mark Duane Letteer as a person who has suffered two or more prior serious felony convictions pursuant to [Penal Code] section 667, subdivision (e)(2). Our temporary stay order shall remain in effect until his decision is final.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Letteer), supra, </em>H020324.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">The People argue that we merely \u201cdirected the sentencing court to perform a ministerial task that did not allow for the exercise of further discretion.\u201d Thus, since continued litigation of the sentence was barred, defendant had no right to a formal sentencing hearing at which he could present additional evidence. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-9\">The writ proceeding and our subsequent opinion addressed only the propriety of the court\u2019s order dismissing two strikes. We did not discuss any other issues concerning Judge Ball\u2019s sentence or sentencing on remand, including the court\u2019s discretion to deem defendant\u2019s current conviction for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>simple possession of methamphetamine a misdemeanor.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> (See Pen. Code, \u00a7 17; <em>People v.

After quoting it he explained, \u201cPursuant to that I do make an order reinstating the convictions that had been previously dismissed, that prior serious felony convictions, and I feel that the matters before me now are to sentence the defendant as though he had never been sentenced before, which still leaves me the options that you\u2019ve indicated; however, after reading the probation report and all of the files that are in here, which were quite voluminous incidentally, including the two reports by [a psychological evaluator], I don\u2019t feel that the Court would entertain anything having to do with the <em>Romero </em>case on these matters.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">We now reverse the judgment and remand for further proceedings, including resentencing. Although the court is bound by our previous writ decision (see <em>People v. Stanley </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 764, 786 [42 Cal.Rptr.2d 543, 897 P.2d 481] [doctrine of law of the case applies to determinations made in writ proceedings]) and by the terms of the plea bargain, it retains discretion and all sentencing options under applicable law and must conduct a full hearing that includes the defendant\u2019s right to present evidence relevant to the sentencing determination.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (See <em>In re Cortez </em>(1971) 6 Cal.3d 78, 88 [98 Cal.Rptr. 307, 490 P.2d 819]; see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Buckhalter </em>(2001) 26 Cal.4th 20 [108 Cal.Rptr.2d 625, 25 P.3d 1103].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>IV. <em>Disposition</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">The judgment is reversed.

Where the judge, other than a judge assigned to the case for all purposes, court commissioner, or referee assigned to or who is scheduled to try the cause or hear the matter is known at least 10 days before the date set for trial or hearing, the motion shall be made at least five days before that date. If directed to the trial of a cause where there is a master calendar, the motion shall be made to the judge supervising the master calendar not later than the time the cause is assigned for trial. If directed to the trial of a cause that has been assigned to a judge for all purposes, the motion shall be made to the assigned judge or to the presiding judge by a party within 10 days after notice of the all purpose assignment, or if the party has not yet appeared in the action, then within 10 days after the appearance. If the court in which the action is pending is authorized to have no more than one judge and the motion claims that the duly elected or appointed judge of that court is prejudiced, the motion shall be made before the expiration of 30 days from the date of the first appearance in the action of the party who is making the motion or whose attorney is making the motion. In no event shall any judge, court commissioner, or referee entertain the motion if it be made after the drawing of the name of the first juror, or if there be no jury, after the making of an opening statement by counsel for plaintiff, or if there is no such statement, then after swearing in the first witness or the giving of any evidence or after trial of the cause has otherwise commenced. If the motion is directed to a hearing (other than the trial of a cause), the motion shall be made not later than the commencement of the hearing.

However, a defendant\u2019s reasonable expectation of having his sentence imposed, pursuant to bargain and guilty plea, by the judge who took his plea and ordered sentence reports should not be thwarted for mere administrative convenience. If the original judge is not available for sentencing purposes after a plea bargain, the defendant must be given the option of proceeding before the different judge available or of withdrawing his plea.\u201d <em>(Arbuckle, supra, </em>22 Cal.3d at p. 757, fn. 5.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1055-8\">The right to have the judge who accepted the plea impose sentence and the right to withdraw the plea if the judge is unavailable are generally referred to as <em>Arbuckle </em>rights. (See, e.g., <em>People v. Adams </em>(1990) 224 Cal.App.3d 1540, 1544 [274 Cal.Rptr. 629]; <em>People v. Serrato </em>(1988) 201 Cal.App.3d 761, 764 [247 Cal.Rptr. 322]; <em>People v.

Walker </em>(1991) 54 Cal.3d 1013, 1026 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 902, 819 P.2d 861], and cases cited there; e.g., <em>People v. Poole </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 516, 521 [214 Cal.Rptr. 502], and cases cited there.) A defendant may also expressly waive <em>Arbuckle </em>rights at the time of the plea. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Mikhail </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 846, 851 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 641].)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1060-9\">A similar issue was recently decided in <em>People v. Superior Court </em>(Jimenez) (2002) 28 Cal.4th 798, 805-809 [123 Cal.Rptr.2d 31, 50 P.3d 743]. There, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to suppress evidence and dismissed the case. Under Penal Code section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>1538.5, subdivision (j), the prosecutor was allowed to refile the charges and relitigate a renewed motion to suppress. However, under Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (p), \u201c[r]elitigation of the motion shall be heard by the same judge who granted the motion at the first hearing <em>if the judge is available.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) In <em>Jimenez, </em>the prosecution sought to avoid this provision by exercising a peremptory challenge and thereby rendering the original judge unavailable. However, the California Supreme Court prohibited this maneuver, explaining that it would encourage forum shopping by the prosecution and, in effect, nullify Penal Code section 1538.5, subdivision (p).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"AEV\">At oral argument, the People asserted that Code of Civil Procedure section 170.6, subdivision (2) creates a presumption that a judge who has been reversed will be prejudiced against the successful appellant. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">The statute, quoted at length in footnote 2, <em>ante, </em>states in detail when a party may exercise a peremptory challenge and in doing so, reveals a legislative intent to prevent a party from using a challenge to disrupt a trial after it has commenced. Consistently with this intent, however, the statute permits a challenge after trial, where a ruling or final judgment has been reversed on appeal and the matter is remanded to the same trial judge. Given the intent of the statute and the context of this latter provision, we do not infer an additional legislative intent to establish a presumption of prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">SimpIe possession of methamphetamine is a wobbler: \u201ca special class of crime which could be classified and punished as a felony or misdemeanor depending upon the severity of the facts surrounding its commission.\u201d <em>(People v.
