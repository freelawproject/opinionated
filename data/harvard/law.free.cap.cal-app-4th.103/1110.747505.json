Reluctantly, we conclude the answer is no. The summary, expedited enforcement procedure afforded by section 664.6 is only available when a settlement satisfies the statutory requirements designed to ensure the parties have actually consented to the terms of the settlement. A writing not signed by one of the parties (and, in this case, silent as to the extent of a party\u2019s obligation) does not satisfy section 664.6. Because the trial court entered judgment in these appeals pursuant to section 664.6, and reserved ruling on the plaintiffs\u2019 alternative motions for summary judgment, we reverse the judgments and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">I. <em>The CCR</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In 1988, several companies that previously manufactured, distributed or sold asbestos-containing products joined together to form a nonprofit corporation called the Center for Claims Resolution (CCR). The companies, referred to as \u201cmembers,\u201d established the CCR to administer all aspects of the litigation of asbestos-related claims brought against the companies. In a founding document, called the \u201cProducer Agreement Concerning Center for Claims Resolution\u201d (Producer Agreement), each member company designated the CCR its \u201csole agent to administer and arrange on [the member\u2019s] behalf for the evaluation, settlement, payment or defense of all asbestos-related claims\u201d against the member. Further, each member agreed to give the CCR \u201cexclusive authority\u201d to settle, pay or defend asbestos-related claims asserted against the member. While individual members ceded to the CCR their ability to negotiate or enter separate settlements with asbestos claimants, they also agreed to a formula (set forth in \u201cAttachment A\u201d to the Producer Agreement) for apportioning shares of liability and expenses among themselves in each particular case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The CCR generally bills members for their apportioned shares of a settled claim within 60 to 90 days before the claim is due to be paid. Often, members\u2019 shares are determined after the CCR settles a claim. Since its inception in 1988, the CCR has settled over 200,000 claims asserted against its members across the country.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1114\">*1114</page-number>Appellant GAF Corporation (GAF)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> was one of the founding members of the CCR in 1988. Over the years, the CCR settled numerous asbestos claims on behalf of GAF, and GAF paid its share of the settlements according to the CCR\u2019s calculations. However, in late 1999, the companies had a falling out. The CCR claimed GAF had violated the Producer Agreement by refusing to pay its apportioned shares of asbestos settlements the CCR had entered on its behalf. On December 17, 1999, GAF received notice from the CCR that GAF\u2019s membership in the CCR would be terminated, effective January 17, 2000. The parties disputed the extent of GAF\u2019s responsibility to pay shares of settlements the CCR had allocated to GAF before its expulsion. Pursuant to the Producer\u2019s Agreement, this dispute was submitted to confidential alternative dispute resolution proceedings. As of February 15, 2000, the CCR estimated the total amount of GAF\u2019s share of settlements, which had been billed to GAF but remained unpaid, exceeded $50 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">II. <em>The Alameda County Settlements</em></p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">The appeals now before us arose from settlements the CCR entered into with certain California asbestos plaintiffs during the several months before GAF was formally expelled from the CCR. In July 1999, counsel for the estate of James Gauss (and other asbestos plaintiffs) spoke with James McFadden, a \u201czone manager\u201d for the CCR, about settling several asbestos suits against CCR members. Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel and McFadden agreed to settle the Gauss family\u2019s claims against the CCR companies for a specific amount. In accordance with this agreement, on January 25, 2000, the Gauss plaintiffs signed a document releasing their claims against all CCR members, including GAF, in consideration for receiving the agreed-upon settlement sum. However, on February 15, 2000, the CCR sent the Gauss plaintiffs a check for less than the agreed-upon settlement amount. In a cover letter, McFadden explained that the CCR was remitting payment for the agreed-upon settlement <em>minus </em>the portion attributable to GAF (which came to approximately one-third of the total consideration). According to McFadden, the CCR had billed GAF but GAF refused to pay its share.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">A similar series of events occurred in the <em>Haught </em>case. On December 27, 1999, Haught\u2019s counsel (who had also represented the Gauss family) reached an agreement with McFadden to settle the claims against all CCR member companies for a specific sum. In consideration for this amount, on February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1115\">*1115</page-number>20, 2000, Haught and his family released the CCR defendants, including GAF, from all claims. Then, on March 23, 2000, the CCR presented the Haught plaintiffs with a check for less than the agreed-upon settlement amount, with an explanation that the missing money (approximately 40 percent of the total settlement) represented GAF\u2019s unpaid share.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">On March 16, 2000, plaintiffs in the <em>Gauss </em>case filed a motion to amend their complaint to add a cause of action against GAF for breach of a settlement contract, and a motion to enforce the settlement against GAF, pursuant to section 664.6 or the court\u2019s inherent power. In the event the court did not enforce the settlement, the Gauss plaintiffs sought the alternative relief of summary judgment against GAF. Following an expedited briefing schedule, on March 23, 2000, the trial court granted both of plaintiffs\u2019 motions and entered judgment against GAF for the portion of the CCR settlement that remained unpaid. The court later modified its order, and issued a judgment amended nunc pro tunc, to clarify that it had granted the plaintiffs\u2019 motion for judgment on the settlement but had reserved ruling on the alternative motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">On April 5, 2000, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel filed a similar motion to enforce the CCR settlement in the <em>Haught </em>case. Once again, the trial court heard the motion upon shortened time. GAF opposed the motion and sought leave to conduct expedited discovery regarding the scope of CCR\u2019s agency and its right to determine GAF\u2019s share of settlements. The court denied GAF\u2019s request to take discovery and, on April 20, 2000, granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion and entered judgment against GAF for the portion of the CCR settlement that remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-7\">On July 7, 2000, the same attorney who represented the <em>Gauss </em>and <em>Haught </em>plaintiffs filed a motion seeking to enforce settlements against GAF, or, in the alternative, seeking summary judgment against GAF, in 71 asbestos cases. The motion was filed in the trial court\u2019s coordinated asbestos proceedings, <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>(No. 607734-0). Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel declared that, between March and November 1999, he had reached agreements with the CCR\u2019s zone manager to settle the enumerated cases for specific sums. Pursuant to these agreements, the plaintiffs had signed releases discharging their claims against all CCR defendants, including GAF. Most of these releases were executed in February and March 2000; all but four of the releases were executed after GAF\u2019s expulsion from the CCR. In each of the 71 cases, the CCR remitted payment for less than the agreed-upon settlement amount, withholding a portion said to reflect GAF\u2019s unpaid share.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">After plaintiffs filed their motion, GAF served discovery on defendants represented by the CCR and sought to compel expedited responses. Upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1116\">*1116</page-number>CCR\u2019s motion, the court quashed this discovery. GAF also filed a motion to enforce the settlements at issue against the CCR defendants, claiming members of the CCR had a joint and several obligation to fund the settlements and the dispute about GAF\u2019s share was the subject of a pending arbitration. The court denied this motion. On August 29, 2000, the court issued an order granting plaintiffs\u2019 motion to enforce their settlement agreements against GAF pursuant to section 664.6. Once again, the court reserved ruling on plaintiffs\u2019 alternative motion for summary judgment. The court entered judgment against GAF in 64 cases for portions of the CCR settlement that remained unpaid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">We consolidated GAF\u2019s separate appeals from judgments entered in the <em>Gauss, Haught </em>and <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In January 2001, G-I Holdings advised this court that GAF had filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. Accordingly, all proceedings in these appeals were stayed until September 2001, when the federal court overseeing GAF\u2019s bankruptcy issued an order authorizing the appeals to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">I. <em>Court Erred in Entering Judgments Pursuant to Section 664.6</em></p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">\n<em>A. Section 664.6 Requires Signatures of the Settling Parties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">GAF contends the judgments in each of these cases must be reversed because GAF did not sign the settlement agreements and because the agreements did not specify a material term, namely GAF\u2019s share of the settlement.  A trial court\u2019s determination of factual matters on a motion to enforce settlement is reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>(Burckhard v. Del Monte Corp. </em>(1996) 48 Cal.App.4th 1912, 1916 [56 Cal.Rptr.2d 569].) However, GAF\u2019s claim primarily raises a question of law concerning the construction and application of section 664.6. As such, it requires independent appellate review. <em>(Burckhard, </em>at p. 1916; <em>Williams v. Saunders </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1158, 1162 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 571].)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Section 664.6 states: \u201cIf parties to pending litigation stipulate, in a writing signed by the parties outside the presence of the court or orally before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1117\">*1117</page-number>court, for settlement of the case, or part thereof, the court, upon motion, may enter judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement. If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the terms of the settlement.\u201d The Legislature enacted section 664.6 in 1981 to create a summary procedure for enforcing settlement agreements under certain circumstances. <em>(Levy v. Superior Court </em>(1995) 10 Cal.4th 578, 585 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 878, 896 P.2d 171].) Previously, settlement agreements could be enforced only by a motion for summary judgment, a separate suit in equity, or an amendment to the pleadings. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 584-585.)</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">In <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th 578, the Supreme Court considered whether trial courts may enter judgment on a settlement pursuant to section 664.6 when the written stipulation to settle is signed by a litigant\u2019s attorney, and not by the litigant personally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Noting that the statute requires a stipulation by the \u201cparties\u201d to pending litigation, the court concluded the term \u201cparties\u201d must be interpreted literally to mean the litigants themselves. <em>(Levy, </em>at p. 586.) Although the term \u201cparty\u201d is recognized in other contexts as including the litigant\u2019s attorney of record (e.g., \u00a7 437c), the court determined the Legislature intended \u201ca n\u00e1rrower meaning\u201d for the word, \u201cnamely the specific person or entity by or against whom legal proceedings are brought. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 583.) Unlike other steps an attorney takes in managing a lawsuit, the court reasoned, settlement ends the lawsuit and is thus \u201csuch a serious step that it requires the client\u2019s knowledge and express consent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">The majority in <em>Levy </em>also observed that section 664.6 was designed to provide an alternative procedure for enforcing settlements when certain strict requirements are met that will ensure protection of the settling parties. In enacting section 664.6, the Legislature \u201ccreated a summary, expedited procedure to enforce settlement agreements when certain requirements that decrease the likelihood of misunderstandings are met. Thus the statute requires the \u2018parties\u2019 to stipulate in writing or orally before the court that they have settled the case. The litigants\u2019 direct participation tends to ensure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1118\">*1118</page-number>that the settlement is the result of their mature reflection and deliberate assent. This protects the parties against hasty and improvident settlement agreements by impressing upon them the seriousness and finality of the decision to settle, and minimizes the possibility of conflicting interpretations of the settlement. [Citations.] It also protects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Levy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 585, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">None of the settlement documents in these cases bears the signature of a GAP corporate officer. Nonetheless, plaintiffs and the CCR-defendants (collectively respondents) argue the settlements are enforceable under section 664.6. Respondents first maintain the <em>Levy </em>rule does not apply to corporate parties, since a corporation can only act through its employees and agents. (See <em>Black </em>v. <em>Bank of America </em>(1994) 30 Cal.App.4th 1, 6 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 725].) But <em>Levy </em>makes no such distinction. In fact, the case construes the term \u201cparty\u201d in section 664.6 to mean \u201cthe specific person <em>or entity </em>by or against whom legal proceedings are brought.\u201d <em>(Levy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 583, italics added; see also <em>Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc. </em>(2002) 103 Cal.App.4th 30, 37 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 400] [agreement belatedly signed by corporate officer did not satisfy <em>Levy\u2019s </em>party-signature requirement]; <em>Burckhard v. Del Monte Corp., supra, </em>48 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1914-1915 <em>[Levy </em>rule barred enforcement under \u00a7 664.6 of settlements not signed by plaintiffs claiming asbestos-related injury or the corporate defendant].)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">In a related argument, plaintiffs suggest the holding of <em>Levy </em>is limited to the context of lawyer-signed settlement agreements. Once again, however, the <em>Levy </em>decision itself includes no such limitation. Moreover, at least two appellate decisions have concluded <em>Levy </em>bars the use of section 664.6 to enforce settlements signed by a party\u2019s spouse and attorney but not the party herself. In <em>Williams v. Saunders, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pages 1162-1163, the trial court found Saunders had authorized both her husband and her attorney to act on her behalf, yet the Court of Appeal concluded Saunders could not be bound by a settlement she did not personally sign. The court reasoned: \u201cAlthough <em>Levy </em>does not address the question whether the signature of a spouse and codefendant is sufficient to demonstrate assent to settlement terms for purposes of section 664.6, the court\u2019s assessment of the intent of the legislation supports the conclusion it is not.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1163; see also <em>Cortez v. Kenneally </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 523 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 671] [holding agreement signed by a party\u2019s attorney and her codefendant spouse not enforceable under \u00a7 664.6].)</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Of more substance is respondents\u2019 argument that the requirements of section 664.6 and <em>Levy </em>were satisfied because the settlement agreements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1119\">*1119</page-number>were signed by an agent GAF had expressly authorized to enter into settlements on its behalf. In the Producer Agreement, GAF designated the CCR as its \u201csole agent\u201d and gave the CCR \u201cexclusive authority and discretion\u201d to settle asbestos-related claims on its behalf Moreover, GAF acknowledges that no individual member of the CCR retained authority to settle asbestos claims on its own. Respondents urge us to excuse <em>Levy\u2019s </em>party-signature requirement under these exceptional circumstances\u2014in which only the party\u2019s agent, and not the party itself, had authority to settle the lawsuit. We decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The cases following <em>Levy </em>have recognized no exceptions to the rule that litigants themselves must sign a settlement for it to be enforceable <em>under section 664.6. </em>(See, e.g., <em>Harris v. Rudin, Richman &amp; Appel </em>(1999) 74 Cal.App.4th 299, 304-306 [87 Cal.Rptr.2d 822] [interpreting <em>Levy </em>to require signatures of <em>all </em>parties to a settlement, not just the party against whom enforcement is sought]; <em>Williams v. Saunders, supra, </em>55 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1162-1163 <em>[Levy </em>precludes enforcement under \u00a7 664.6 of settlement signed by spouse].) In <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Padilla </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 707, 716 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 722], the Sixth District Court of Appeal concluded <em>Levy </em>and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Department of Corrections </em>(1995) 38 Cal.App.4th 1700 [45 Cal.Rptr.2d 740] (concerning motions to enforce oral settlements made before the court) precluded reliance on agency principles as a means of satisfying the requirements of section 664.6. Indeed, <em>Levy </em>itself holds that the signature of a <em>duly authorized </em>attorney, who acts as an agent of the client (see <em>Blanton </em>v. <em>Womancare, Inc. </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 396, 403 [212 Cal.Rptr. 151, 696 P.2d 645, 48 A.L.R.4th 109]), does not suffice to permit enforcement of a settlement under section 664.6. (See <em>Levy v. Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 586, 592 (dis. opn. of Werdegar, J.).) We concur in the <em>Murphy </em>court\u2019s assessment that, in determining the Legislature intended strict safeguards to prevent section 664.6 from becoming a tool of abuse, the <em>Levy </em>decision \u201cappear[s] to reject traditional agency analysis . . . .\u201d <em>(Murphy v. Padilla, supra, </em>at p. 716.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">In support of their position that section 664.6 does permit enforcement of settlements signed by agents in special circumstances, respondents rely heavily on statements of the court in <em>Robertson v. Chen </em>(1996) 44 Cal.App.4th 1290 [52 Cal.Rptr.2d 264], However, these statements are dicta, and the actual holding of <em>Robertson </em>does not aid respondents. In <em>Robertson, </em>the defendants\u2019 mandatory settlement conference (MSC) statement, signed by an attorney, stated that a defense settlement offer would remain open until trial. When the plaintiffs later attempted to accept the offer, the defendants claimed it had been revoked. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1291-1292.) The Court of Appeal concluded the plaintiffs could not summarily enforce the settlement using section 664.6 because the MSC statement was signed only by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1120\">*1120</page-number>for one side. <em>(Robertson, </em>at p. 1293.) However, the court went on, in a lengthy discussion not essential to disposition of the case, to express the view that special considerations warrant a relaxation of <em>Levy's </em>party-signature requirement when a party is represented by insurance counsel and the carrier is providing defense and indemnity without a reservation of rights. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1293-1296.) When an insurer undertakes to provide a defense and pay indemnity without reservation, the <em>Robertson </em>court reasoned, the insurer\u2019s decision to settle within policy limits \u201cdoes not prejudice the \u2018substantial rights\u2019 of the insured.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1294.) In such cases, in which the insured party is generally precluded from interfering with the carrier\u2019s settlement negotiations, <em>Robertson </em>opined that the \u201csuperfluous\u201d signature of an insured should not be necessary to render the agreement enforceable under section 664.6. <em>(Robertson, </em>at pp. 1294-1295.)</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">As noted, <em>Robertson's </em>discussion of insurance-funded settlements is unquestionably dicta.  \u201cDicta is not authority upon which we can rely. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Mattco Forge, Inc. v. Arthur Young &amp; Co. </em>(1997) 52 Cal.App.4th 820, 850 [60 Cal.Rptr.2d 780].) Moreover, the court\u2019s discussion does not support respondents\u2019 position because, unlike <em>Robertson's </em>hypothetical insurance carrier, the CCR clearly had the ability to prejudice \u201csubstantial rights\u201d of GAP and, in fact, did so by purporting to bind GAP to millions of dollars in settlement obligations. When an insurance carrier agrees to handle the defense of a claim and pay indemnity, without reserving rights to itself, and then negotiates a settlement <em>within policy limits, </em>\u201cthe consent of the insured [to the settlement] is usually superfluous.\u201d <em>(Robertson v. Chen, supra, </em>44 Cal.4th at pp. 1294-1295.) Because the insured is not personally liable for such a settlement, <em>Levy's </em>concern for preventing impairment of a party\u2019s substantial rights is arguably not implicated. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 1295.) But, while GAP is like an insured in that it contractually ceded settlement authority to the CCR and promised not to interfere in the CCR\u2019s settlement negotiations with asbestos plaintiffs, GAP is different because it remained responsible for paying the settlement shares allocated to it.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In every settlement the CCR entered on GAP\u2019s behalf, the CCR imposed on GAP an obligation to pay. Under the principles discussed in <em>Levy, </em>such an obligation cannot be enforced using the summary expedited procedures of section 664.6 absent GAP\u2019s express consent to the settlement, as evidenced by the signature of its authorized corporate representative.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Plaintiffs also rely on <em>Gallo v. Getz </em>(1988) 205 Cal.App.3d 329 [252 Cal.Rptr. 193], a case decided before <em>Levy. </em>Stressing the unfairness of allowing GAP to \u201ctake complete advantage\u201d of the releases plaintiffs executed in favor of all CCR defendants, plaintiffs characterize <em>Gallo </em>as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1121\">*1121</page-number>holding that a party who accepts the benefits of a settlement cannot evade enforcement of the agreement under section 664.6. But the decision does not sweep as broadly as plaintiffs suggest. In <em>Gallo, </em>attorneys for both sides negotiated a settlement of a personal injury action. The plaintiff then refused to \u201cgo along\u201d with the settlement, and he did not sign the settlement agreement or release documents. <em>(Gallo, </em>at p. 332.) However, the plaintiff did accept, endorse and deposit a bank draft from the defendant\u2019s insurer, which was sent as part of the consideration for settlement of the plaintiffs claim. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 331-332.) Although the letter from the plaintiffs attorney memorializing settlement terms did not satisfy the requirements of section 664.6, the appellate court concluded the bank draft constituted a \u201cwriting\u201d signed by the parties and hence was sufficient to support enforcement of the settlement under section 664.6. <em>(Gallo, </em>at pp. 333-334.) <em>Gallo </em>is easily distinguishable from the present case on its facts, since the record contains <em>no </em>writing with GAF\u2019s signature indicating consent to a settlement. While the plaintiffs did release GAF, along with all the other CCR members, in all but four cases the plaintiffs executed these releases <em>after </em>GAF had been expelled from the CCR. Indeed, many of the releases were executed after plaintiffs\u2019 counsel began receiving only settlement payments from the CCR withholding GAF\u2019s unpaid share.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Because plaintiffs presented no writing signed by GAF indicating GAF\u2019s consent to settle their lawsuits, the trial court erred in entering judgment against GAF pursuant to section 664.6. Section 664.6, as construed by the Supreme Court in <em>Levy, </em>simply does not permit the use of its summary, expedited procedures to enforce a settlement agreement signed only by a party\u2019s agent. (See <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at p. 584 [the Legislature intended \u00a7 664.6 as an enforcement mechanism for settlements entered by the litigants themselves]; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Padilla, supra, </em>42 Cal.App.4t00000h at p. 716 <em>[Levy </em>\u201cappear[s] to reject traditional agency analysis . . .\u201d]; see also <em>Sully-Miller Contracting Co. v. Gledson/Cashman Construction, Inc., supra, </em>103 Cal.App.4th at p. 37 [\u201cBecause of its summary nature, strict compliance with the requirements of section 664.6 is prerequisite to invoking the power of the court to impose a settlement agreement\u201d].) Furthermore, the result we reach in this case is consistent with <em>Levy's </em>observation that the party-signature requirement of section 664.6 \u201cprotects parties from impairment of their substantial rights without their knowledge and consent. . . .\u201d <em>(Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>at p. 585, citation omitted.) Given the procedures followed here\u2014in which the CCR settled cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1122\">*1122</page-number>and <em>then </em>determined members\u2019 shares of responsibility for funding the settlements\u2014it appears GAP had no prior knowledge and did not consent to the obligations imposed upon it by the settlements. Although GAP and the other CCR members contractually agreed to these procedures, this fact does not excuse compliance with the requirements of section 664.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Plaintiffs complain this result will jeopardize mass tort settlements, especially in the asbestos context where (plaintiffs assert) the parties often rely on claims managers like the CCR to \u201cprocess[]\u201d settlements.  But \u201c[t]he statutory procedure for enforcing settlement agreements under section 664.6 is not exclusive. It is merely an expeditious, valid alternative statutorily created. <em>(Kilpatrick </em>v. <em>Beebe </em>(1990) 219 Cal.App.3d 1527, 1529 [269 Cal.Rptr. 52].) Settlement agreements may also be enforced by motion for summary judgment, by a separate suit in equity or by amendment of the pleadings to raise the settlement as an affirmative defense.\u201d <em>(Nicholson </em>v. <em>Barab </em>(1991) 233 Cal.App.3d 1671, 1681 [285 Cal.Rptr. 441]; see also <em>Levy </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>10 Cal.4th at pp. 586, fn. 5.; <em>Robertson v. Chen, supra, </em>44 Cal.App.4th at p. 1293 [\u201cSection 664.6 is not the exclusive means of enforcing a settlement agreement; it is simply a summary procedure available when certain prerequisites are satisfied\u201d].)  Our conclusion that plaintiffs cannot use the summary procedures of section 664.6 to enforce settlements signed only by a \u201cclaims manager,\u201d or other agent of a party, does not preclude plaintiffs from pursuing these other avenues of enforcement.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 664.6 remains available as a convenient enforcement mechanism for mass tort settlements that satisfy statutory requirements; however, settlements entered into by agents rather than the parties themselves must be enforced by other means. (See <em>Nicholson </em>v. <em>Barab, supra, </em>at p. 1681 [\u201cSettlement agreements not enforceable under . . . section 664.6 are governed by the legal principles applicable to contracts in general\u201d].)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">Also without merit is plaintiffs\u2019 claim that GAP \u201cconceded\u201d the settlements are enforceable under section 664.6 because GAP itself moved to enforce the settlements against the CCR in the <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>case. This motion does not constitute a \u201cjudicial admission\u201d of general enforceability under section 664.6, as plaintiffs suggest, because in the motion GAP specifically disputed the authority of the court to enforce the settlements against GAP, which had not signed the agreements. Rather, GAP\u2019s motion insisted that if the settlements were enforceable under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1123\">*1123</page-number>664.6, as the court had twice before held in the <em>Gauss </em>and <em>Haught </em>cases, they should not be enforced against GAF alone but against all CCR member companies under principles of joint and several liability. Given GAF\u2019s express and repeated statements that it disputed the trial court\u2019s authority to enter judgments against GAF as a nonsignatory to settlements, the motion cannot be construed as a binding judicial admission.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">B. <em>Section 664.6 Requires Specification of Settlement Terms</em></p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">In a related argument, GAF contends the judgments failed to satisfy section 664.6 because the settlements upon which they were based failed to include a material term\u2014namely, the amount GAF was obligated to pay. We agree the judgments cannot stand for this independent, alternative reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">Section 664.6 merely authorizes the trial court to enter judgment upon a written stipulation signed by the parties (or an oral stipulation made before the court) to settle the action. Here, the <em>only </em>writings presented to the trial court that arguably constituted written stipulations to settle the actions were letters sent by the CCR to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel before GAF was expelled from the CCR. These letters do not specify the obligation of any individual CCR member, including GAF, to fund the settlement. As a result, in order to affix dollar amounts to the judgments it entered against GAF pursuant to section 664.6, the trial court had to reach beyond these settlement letters and rely on subsequent letters from the CCR (sent, in most cases, after GAF was expelled from the CCR) advising plaintiffs\u2019 counsel as to the amount of each settlement it had allocated to GAF.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-9\">In general, before judgment can be entered upon a settlement under section 664.6, \u201cthere must be a \u2018writing signed by the parties\u2019 that contains the material terms\u201d of the agreement. <em>(Weddington Productions, Inc. </em>v. <em>Flick </em>(1998) 60 Cal.App.4th 793, 797 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 265], quoting \u00a7 664.6.) The court may consider evidence beyond this writing in deciding a section 664.6 motion, but only to determine what settlement terms the parties <em>previously </em>agreed upon. <em>(Weddington, </em>at p. 810; see also <em>Basinger v. Rogers &amp; Wells </em>(1990) 220 Cal.App.3d 16, 23 [269 Cal.Rptr. 332] [\u00a7 664.6 \u201cby its own terms, only grants the court authority to enter judgment \u2018pursuant to the terms of the settlement\u2019 \u201d].) Because the trial court had no writing specifying material terms of the settlements to be imposed on GAF, it erred in entering judgments for the plaintiffs in these cases pursuant to section 664.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">While we are sympathetic to plaintiffs\u2019 predicament, especially considering the reliance they have historically placed on the CCR\u2019s settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1124\">*1124</page-number>procedures and the difficulties posed by GAF\u2019s recent petition for bankruptcy relief, we are constrained by the unambiguous language of section 664.6 and Supreme Court precedent to reverse the judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">II. <em>Remaining Issues Not Ripe for </em>Decision<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b946-6\">Judgments entered against appellant GAF in the <em>Gauss, Haught </em>and <em>In re Complex Asbestos Litigation </em>cases are reversed, and these matters are remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.
