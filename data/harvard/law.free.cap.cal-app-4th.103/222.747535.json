When the clinic later became the target of an investigation into its widespread misuse of genetic materials, the Morrisons (along <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>with many others) sued the clinic and later settled their claims for an undisclosed amount of money. The Morrisons, \u201cwondering whether [they have] a genetic child or children in the world,\u201d then embarked on a campaign to intrude into the lives of another fertility clinic family (Judith and Jacob Doe) who might have innocently received Donna Morrison\u2019s genetic material. The Morrisons filed a complaint in which they asked the court to determine whether they are the genetic parents of the Does\u2019 twin daughters (now almost 14 years old) and, if so, to grant custody of the children (who know nothing about this claim and who have no reason to question their parentage) to the Morrisons. Although the Morrisons later withdrew their request for custody, they continued their efforts to compel blood tests and obtain the right to visit the twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The Does sought protective orders and moved to quash the Morrisons\u2019 complaint. When the Morrisons were unable to present any admissible evidence to establish a connection between their genetic material and the fertility services received by the Does, the trial court granted the Does\u2019 motion to quash and dismissed the Morrisons\u2019 complaint. The Morrisons appeal, claiming the trial court should have either admitted their inadmissible evidence or otherwise concluded that the Morrisons\u2019 curiosity justified a further intrusion into the Does\u2019 lives. We reject the Morrisons\u2019 claims and affirm. We hold that the Morrisons\u2019 evidence was properly excluded, and that they have not shown any link at all to the Does\u2019 daughters. We also hold that, assuming a genetic connection between the Morrisons and the twins, the best interests of the children dictate the result reached by the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">In 1988, Donna Prato-Morrison and Robert Morrison were fertility clinic patients of the Center for Reproductive Health (CRH) at the University of California at Irvine (UCI). As part of the <em>in vitro </em>fertilization process, the Morrisons\u2019 eggs and sperm were entrusted to CRH with the intent that the resulting embryos would produce the child they hoped to conceive. No pregnancy was achieved and the Morrisons ultimately abandoned their efforts on the assumption that any remaining genetic material would be destroyed by CRH.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">In the mid-1990\u2019s, UCI learned there had been medical and other improprieties at CRH. An investigation ensued, and findings were made that \u201cegg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>stealing\u201d had occurred\u2014\u201chuman eggs were taken from one patient and implanted in another without the consent of the donor.\u201d <em>(Stone v. Regents of University of California </em>(1999) 77 Cal.App.4th 736, 740 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 94].) The Morrisons (and many others) sued CRH, UCI, and the doctors involved in the \u201cegg stealing.\u201d The Morrisons\u2019 case was settled by the payment of money\u2014but only after the Morrisons learned through the discovery process that their genetic material might not have been destroyed, that Judith and Jacob Doe (who were also patients of the CRH fertility clinic) <em>might have </em>(without the Does\u2019 knowledge) received the Morrisons\u2019 eggs, sperm, or embryos, and that (in December 1988) Judith Doe had given birth to twin daughters, Ida and Rose. The Morrisons claim they are the twins\u2019 genetic parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">In 1996, the Morrisons filed a \u201ccomplaint to establish parental relationship,\u201d naming the Does as defendants, alleging that the Morrisons are the \u201cbiological and legal parents\u201d of the twins, and asking for custody, visitation rights, and an award of attorney\u2019s fees. Between 1996 and 1999, the Morrisons attempted to obtain blood tests and DNA samples from the twins but the Does refused to provide them and these \u201cnegotiations\u201d ultimately failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In 1999, the Morrisons filed an amended complaint in which they abandoned their quest for custody but reasserted their demands for blood tests and for visitation. At the Morrisons\u2019 request, a hearing was set to determine the Morrisons\u2019 right (1) to obtain DNA tests and (2) to have a mental health professional appointed to help determine \u201cthe commencement, frequency, degree of contact or visitation\u201d the Morrisons should have with the twins. The matter was continued from time to time.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In April 2000, the Does asked the trial court (1) to seal the records of this case; (2) to issue protective orders \u201cto ensure the privacy of the children in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>this potentially high-profile litigation, and to preclude deliberate or accidental disclosure of the existence of this litigation and the [Morrisons\u2019] claims ... to the children\u201d; and (3) to quash the Morrisons\u2019 petition on the grounds (among others) that (a) the Does are the \u201cpresumed natural and legal parents\u201d of the twins, and (b) the Morrisons lacked standing to pursue a parentage action or to compel blood or DNA testing. (Fam. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 7540, 7610, subd. (a), 7611, subd. (a), 7630, 7631, 7541, 7643, 7650.)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">In support of their motions, the Does submitted declarations establishing that since 1983 they have lived together continuously as husband and wife, that in addition to the twins they have two older children (one from Jacob\u2019s former marriage, the other together), and that the twins were conceived because the Does had \u201cactively tried to conceive with medical assistance, intending to use Jacob\u2019s sperm and anonymously and voluntarily donated ova.\u201d Judith Doe \u201cbecame pregnant by [her] husband,\u201d gave birth to the twins, and remains a \u201cfull time mother.\u201d Jacob Doe was \u201cneither impotent nor sterile\u201d at the time the twins were conceived or at the time they were bom, and he is their father (as well as the father of the Does\u2019 two older children). When Judith Doe gave birth to the twins, the Does \u201cknowingly and joyously received the twins into [their] home and family. [They] have adored [the twins and have] reared them in [the Does\u2019] culture and religion . . . The Does \u201care the only parents that Ida and Rose have ever known.\u201d The Does objected to the release of any medical information to the Morrisons, pointed out that the Morrisons\u2019 claims had caused \u201cgreat emotional stress\u201d to the Does, and said the introduction of the Morrisons into the Does\u2019 \u201cfamily life would be a monstrous intrusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">In opposition to the Does\u2019 motion to quash, the Morrisons claimed they had standing to pursue this action because Donna Morrison is \u201ca genetic mother.\u201d To prove this point, the Morrisons submitted a copy of a 1996 letter from UCI to the Morrisons and a copy of an unauthenticated \u201credacted copy\u201d of one handwritten page of \u201cthe seven page Teri Ord donor/recipient list in which\u201d Donna Morrison\u2019s name appeared. Other than by name, the Morrisons did not identify \u201cTeri Ord\u201d or explain her relationship to these proceedings. The Does objected to the Morrisons\u2019 \u201cevidence,\u201d pointing out that the unauthenticated list contained privileged information and did not connect the Morrisons to the Does or to anyone, genetically or otherwise. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 994, 1400, 1401.)</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">At a hearing held in June 2000, the family law court sustained the Does\u2019 objections to the Morrison\u2019s evidence and found that the Morrisons had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>failed to establish their status as \u201cinterested parties\u201d entitled to pursue a parentage action. The court nevertheless continued the matter to afford the Morrisons an opportunity to present additional evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">As \u201cadditional evidence,\u201d the Morrisons submitted an unredacted copy of the handwritten list and a declaration from Teri Ord\u2014who stated that she was employed from 1986 through and including 1988 by AMI Medical Center as an \u201cI[n] V[itro] Ffertilization] Biologist\u201d in charge of \u201cthe embryology lab at that facility.\u201d In that capacity, she states, she \u201cparticipated\u201d in \u201ctransfers of genetic materials obtained by the doctors [at UCI] from fertility patients. [\u00b6] According to laboratory records, Donna [Morrison] was an infertility patient at AMI. . . between March and May 1988, as was [Judith Doe].\u201d Ord stated that, based on information contained in other clinical and laboratory records, she prepared the handwritten document in <em>1995 </em>to show that, \u201cbetween March and May of <em>1988, </em>patient \u2018[Judith Doe]\u2019 received sixteen eggs from patient \u2018[Donna Morrison].\u2019 Twenty-one eggs were extracted from [Donna Morrison], and five transferred into [Donna Morrison\u2019s] own fallopian tubes. The remaining sixteen were transferred to [Judith Doe],\u201d and the notations next to Judith Doe\u2019s name show that \u201ca twin pregnancy resulted.\u201d (Italics added.) The Morrisons also submitted evidence that UCI\u2019s original clinical and laboratory records for its former patients were generally unavailable because they had been confiscated (in 1995) by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">The Does objected to Ord\u2019s declaration and compilation as hearsay, and on the ground that it violated the Does\u2019 physician-patient privilege and their right to reproductive privacy. In October 2000, the family law court sustained the Does\u2019 evidentiary objections and granted their motion to quash.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In April 2001, the court dismissed the Morrisons\u2019 action. The Morrisons appeal from the order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">The Morrisons contend their evidence is sufficient to establish Donna Morrison\u2019s status as the genetic mother and, therefore, her standing to pursue a parentage action. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u201cAny interested person may bring an action to determine the existence or nonexistence of a mother and child relationship\u201d (\u00a7 7650), but an unrelated person who is not a genetic parent is not an \u201cinterested person\u201d within the meaning of section 7650. <em>(West </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1997) 59 Cal.App.4th 302, 306 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 160]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Calvert </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 84, 90 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 494, 851 P.2d 776]; <em>Curiale </em>v. <em>Reagan </em>(1990) 222 Cal.App.3d 1597, 1598-1600 [272 Cal.Rptr. 520].)  The threshold question, therefore, is whether Ord\u2019s declaration and handwritten list were properly excluded by the trial court. If so, there is no evidence at all to suggest that Donna Morrison is the twins\u2019 genetic mother, or that either of the Morrisons is otherwise related to the twins.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">The declaration and list were properly excluded as inadmissible hearsay that does not satisfy the requirements of the business records exception to the hearsay rule.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Ord concedes in her declaration, the list was compiled from other, non-identified clinical and laboratory records, and she does not attempt to establish her personal knowledge of the information stated on her list.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> She does not say she was a percipient witness to the transfers of genetic material, or that she made the entries in the original records. She admits the list was not made at or near the time of the events it purports to describe, but was in fact made almost eight years later. She offers no clue as to <em>why </em>the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>list was made. By Ord\u2019s own admission, her sources of information and method and time of preparation show a lack of trustworthiness and defeat the Morrisons\u2019 contention that the list comes within the business records exception to the hearsay rule. (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1270-1272; <em>Daniels </em>v. <em>Department of Motor Vehicles </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d 532, 537-538 [189 Cal.Rptr. 512, 658 P.2d 1313]; <em>Dahl-Beck Electric Co. v. Rogge </em>(1969) 275 Cal.App.2d 893, 902 [80 Cal.Rptr. 440].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">To avoid this conclusion, the Morrisons contend the unavailability of the original records in itself makes Ord\u2019s statements and her list admissible. We disagree. When an original document is missing, secondary evidence offered to prove its content must be \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 1521, 1523.)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Since the list and Ord\u2019s statements are inadmissible hearsay, they are not \u201cotherwise admissible.\u201d As the trial court put it when it sustained the Does\u2019 objection, secondary evidence must \u201cmeet the threshold requirement of being trustworthy.\u201d <em>(Levy-Zentner Co. v. Southern Pac. Transportation Co. </em>(1977) 74 Cal.App.3d 762, 784-785 [142 Cal.Rptr. 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Since Ord\u2019s declaration and list were properly excluded and since there is no other evidence suggesting a genetic link between the Morrisons and the Does\u2019 twins, the Morrisons had no standing to pursue their parentage action.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">The Morrisons contend they should be allowed to \u201cdiscover\u201d whether the twins were bom \u201cas a result of the theft of their genetic materials,\u201d and that their rights as alleged biological parents ought to trump the Does\u2019 rights as presumed parents. We disagree.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">The Morrisons\u2019 \u201crights\u201d were vindicated when they accepted an undisclosed amount of money to resolve their lawsuit against CRH, UCI, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>individuals involved in the misuse of the Morrisons\u2019 genetic materials. The rights still at issue are not the Morrisons\u2019 rights. They are the rights of the Does and their twins to be free from the interference of strangers who have no standing to pursue their demands for blood tests or visitation rights, and the Morrisons cannot alter the focus of this issue by characterizing the Does\u2019 rights as mere privacy interests that may, under appropriate circumstances, give way to greater rights. <em>(Dawn D. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 944; cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>National Collegiate Athletic Assn. </em>(1994) 7 Cal.4th 1 [26 Cal.Rptr.2d 834, 865 P.2d 633].)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">The trial court found, and we agree, that the dismissal of this action is in the best interests of the children. More to the point, we conclude that, had the Morrisons presented proof of a genetic link to the twins sufficient to establish their standing to pursue a parentage action, it would not be in the best interests of the twins to have the Morrisons intrude into their lives, or to be subjected to the blood tests and \u201cmental health\u201d evaluation suggested by the Morrisons. Because the twins are now almost 14 years old, their relationship with their presumed parents is considerably more palpable than the possibility of a new relationship with a previously unknown biological parent, and the Morrisons will not be allowed to disrupt the Does\u2019 \u201cfamily in order to satisfy the [alleged] biological [parents\u2019] unilateral desire, however strong, to turn their genetic connection into a personal relationship.\u201d <em>(Dawn D. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at p. 947; <em>Steven W. </em>v. <em>Matthew S., supra, </em>33 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1116-1117; <em>Brian C. </em>v. <em>Ginger K. </em>(2000) 77 Cal.App.4th 1198, 1200-1201 [92 Cal.Rptr.2d 294] [substantive rules of paternity law will not be applied when their effect would be to \u201cterminat[e] an <em>existing </em>father-child relationship\u201d]; <em>In re Marriage of Freeman </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1437, 1446 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 439]; <em>In re Raphael P. </em>(2002) 97 Cal.App.4th 716, 730 [118 Cal.Rptr.2d 610] [social relationships may trump genetics in cases where legal recognition of a genetic parent would upset an existing parent-child relationship between the presumed parents and the child].)</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Simply put, the social relationship established by the Does and their daughters is more important to the children than a genetic relationship with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>a stranger. <em>(Dawn D. v. Superior Court, supra, </em>17 Cal.4th at pp. 941-942 [absent some prior social relationship with a child, an alleged biological link is insufficient to support a demand for an opportunity to establish a parental relationship with the child]; <em>Steven W. v.

The Does are awarded their costs of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Spencer, P. J., and Ortega, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-8\">In a declaration filed in October 1999, the Does\u2019 lawyer told the court the Morrisons are both employed as sheriffs deputies in Northern California; that the Morrisons\u2019 lawyer had told him that the Morrisons had engaged private investigators to locate and investigate the Does and their family, to engage in \u201csurveillance\u201d of the Does and the twins, to photograph the twins, and to obtain private information about the Does\u2019 home, their treatment of the twins, and the details of the twins\u2019 \u201chome and school situations.\u201d According to the Does\u2019 lawyer, his conversations with the Morrisons\u2019 lawyer \u201cwere punctuated by thinly veiled threats that [the Morrisons] would reveal their claims to [the twins]. On several occasions, [the Morrisons\u2019 lawyer] made statements to the effect that the information could not be kept from the children, and that the \u2018facts\u2019 would be known to the children even if their parents opposed such disclosures. The message was clear that if [the Does] were unwilling to introduce [the Morrisons] into the children\u2019s lives, that the litigation process would inevitably bring the matter to the children\u2019s attention. [\u00b6] \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 [\u00b6] My conversations with [the Morrisons\u2019 lawyer] led me to believe that [Donna Morrison] is obsessed with the notion that [the Does\u2019 children] are \u2018theirs,\u2019 and that she [is] willing and able to contact the children directly.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number><em>The Morrisons have never suggested that this description of their conduct is false or exaggerated.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-10\">Subsequent undesignated section references are to the Family Code.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In August 2000, one of the lawyers representing UCI in the \u201congoing Coordinated Fertility Litigation\u201d wrote to the Morrisons\u2019 lawyer to explain that, in September 1995, the FBI executed a number of search warrants and seized \u201csome former CRH patient clinical records.\u201d According to UCI\u2019s lawyer, \u201cthe US Attorney has consistently taken the position that any records in their possession are part of an ongoing grand jury investigation and cannot be released to any outside sources.\u201d There is nothing in the record to suggest that the Morrisons contacted the U.S. Attorney or otherwise attempted to track down the CRH medical records.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-7\">When the trial court sustained the evidentiary objection, the court stated: \u201c[The Morrisons] have failed to meet any one of the four prongs [of the business record exception to the hearsay rule].
