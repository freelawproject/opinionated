J.</author>\n<p id=\"AJO\">Mitchell D. Ellis appeals from a judgment in favor of respondent Lawrence D. Miller on Miller\u2019s action for equitable indemnity. The action arises from a previous personal injury lawsuit and ensuing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>malpractice action by the personal injury plaintiff against Attorneys Ellis, Miller, and Joseph Pisano for failing to bring the underlying case to trial within five years. Ellis contends the trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the collateral source rule to this action, in which one of two cotortfeasors (Miller) is seeking equitable indemnification from the other (Ellis) for sums paid in settlement of the underlying personal injury action by an insurance company. Because the trial court misapplied the collateral source rule and the remedy of equitable indemnification in a way that would result in unjust enrichment, we reverse and remand for modification of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Factual and Procedural Background</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">After suffering injury in a slip-and-fall accident in July 1990, Michael Fay retained appellant Ellis to represent him in a personal injury action. On April 9, 1991, Ellis filed suit on behalf of Fay. In 1992, Ellis associated respondent Miller to assist in the litigation of Fay\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">Miller was the attorney assigned to attend a trial-setting conference on Fay\u2019s personal injury lawsuit. Miller set the Fay matter for trial on a date that was past the five-year deadline. As a result the Fay case was dismissed for failure to comply with the five-year statute. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 583.310.)</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">Fay filed an action for legal malpractice against Ellis, Miller, and the fictitious firm of \u201cPisano and Ellis.\u201d Miller carried errors and omissions insurance coverage; neither Ellis nor Pisano had such coverage. Miller\u2019s malpractice insurance carrier nevertheless in effect provided Ellis and Pisano with a \u201ccourtesy defense.\u201d Ultimately, the insurer paid Fay $75,000 in settlement of Fay\u2019s lawsuit. In exchange, Fay and his attorney executed a global settlement and release prepared by Miller\u2019s malpractice insurer\u2019s outside counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This settlement agreement released not only Miller, but also Ellis, the fictitious firm of \u201cPisano &amp; Ellis,\u201d and \u201cany and all other agents, employees, persons, firms, associations, or corporations . . . who are or may ever become liable to the undersigned, of and from any and all claims, demands, damages, actions and causes of action of every kind, known or unknown, arising out of or in any way connected with the occurrence out of which it is claimed that the undersigned suffered damage to person and property and which resulted in the undersigned\u2019s legal malpractice claim against the parties released herein . . . with respect to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>handling of the undersigned\u2019s personal injury and worker\u2019s compensation actions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">In connection with the settlement of the malpractice action, Miller incurred $13,742.78 in attorney fees and costs. Of this amount Miller paid only his deductible in the amount of $5,000, while the insurance carrier paid the $8,742.78 remainder. Prior to the settlement of the malpractice action, Miller never advised Ellis or Pisano that he intended to pursue an action for equitable indemnity against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">On March 2, 2000, Miller filed the instant action against Ellis, Pisano, and the alleged firm of \u201cPisano &amp; Ellis\u201d for \u201cimplied equitable indemnity.\u201d In their pretrial briefing, Ellis and Pisano both argued that the global settlement and release was in good faith and constituted a complete defense to Miller\u2019s claim for equitable indemnity pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 877.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">At the conclusion of a two-day court trial, the trial court ruled in favor of Miller in his action for equitable indemnification against Ellis. The trial court found that Miller and Ellis were each 50 percent responsible for their legal malpractice in representing Fay, and should share the resulting damages equally. Based on its understanding and application of the collateral source rule, the trial court entered judgment for Miller ordering that he recover $40,000 from Ellis, or 50 percent of Miller\u2019s alleged damages of $75,000 plus the $5,000 deductible. The latter sum constituted the only amount Miller actually paid out of pocket. Although raised as a defense by both Ellis and Pisano, the trial court did not directly address the effect of the global settlement and release in its statement of decision. Instead, the trial court simply found that Miller\u2019s insurance carrier \u201cdid not tender nor provide a courtesy defense\u201d for Ellis or for \u201cPisano and Ellis,\u201d but \u201cdid include their names on the final release documents as a matter of policy to finalize that lawsuit.\u201d Implicitly, therefore, the trial court found the global release did not preclude Miller\u2019s claim for equitable indemnity against Ellis. On the other hand, the trial court did find that it would be neither equitable nor legally correct to impose liability on Pisano for Ellis\u2019s malpractice, because Pisano was not involved in representing Fay in any way and was in neither a partnership nor an unincorporated association with Ellis. The trial court therefore entered judgment in Pisano\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">Ellis and Miller filed separate appeals from the judgment. We have separately affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment for Pisano in Miller\u2019s appeal thereof. In this appeal, we address Ellis\u2019s appeal of the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Miller.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">The issue on this appeal is whether the trial court erred in its interpretation and application of the collateral source rule to permit respondent Miller to pursue appellant Ellis for equitable indemnification and hold him responsible for 50 percent of the full amount paid by Miller\u2019s insurance carrier to Fay on Miller\u2019s behalf. For the reasons which follow, and under the particular facts of this case, we conclude that the trial court misinterpreted and misapplied the collateral source rule as well as the doctrine of equitable indemnification. We must therefore reverse the judgment in Miller\u2019s favor insofar as it orders Ellis to pay Miller half of the amount the insurance carrier paid in settlement of the malpractice lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">Normally, an appellate court will review a trial court\u2019s apportionment of fault under the substantial evidence standard, giving as great deference to the fact finder\u2019s determination of negligence as to its resolution of any other conflict in the evidence. <em>(Rosh v. Cave Imaging Systems, Inc. </em>(1994) 26 Cal.App.4th 1225, 1233-1234 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 136].) In this case, however, appellant Ellis does not dispute the trial court\u2019s factual findings. Neither does he contest the trial court\u2019s legal conclusion that Miller and Ellis were \u201cequally responsible\u201d for their professional negligence toward Fay. Instead, Ellis challenges only the trial court\u2019s express <em>legal </em>conclusion that because Miller paid premiums to his insurance carrier in order to obtain the benefit of the insurer\u2019s payment to settle Fay\u2019s personal injury lawsuit, Miller \u201csuffered damages\u201d including that amount and was entitled to be indemnified for 50 percent thereof by his cotortfeasor, Ellis.  When there is no conflicting evidence on an issue, as here, the ultimate conclusion to be drawn from the evidence is a question of law. In the absence of any controverted factual evidence on this appeal, therefore, we are presented with a pure question of law for which the appropriate review is de novo. <em>(Saathoff v. City of San Diego </em>(1995) 35 Cal.App.4th 697, 700 [41 Cal.Rptr.2d 352]; <em>Board of Education </em>v. <em>Jack M. </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 691, 698-699, fit 3 [139 Cal.Rptr. 700, 566 P.2d 602].)</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">The collateral source rule \u201cprovides that if an injured party received some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor.\u201d <em>(Hrnjak </em>v. <em>Graymar, Inc. </em>(1971) 4 Cal.3d 725, 729 [94 Cal.Rptr. 623, 484 P.2d 599, 47 A.L.R.3d 224]; see also <em>Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist. </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 1, 6 [84 Cal.Rptr. 173, 465 P.2d 61, 77 A.L.R.3d 398] [where \u201can injured party receives some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor\u201d]; <em>Anheuser-Busch, Inc. v. Starley </em>(1946) 28 Cal.2d 347, 349 [170 P.2d 448, 166 A.L.R. 198] [\u201c[w]here a person suffers personal injury or property damage by reason of the wrongful act of another, an action against the wrongdoer for damages suffered is not precluded nor is the amount of the damages reduced by the receipt by him of payment for his loss from a source wholly independent of the wrongdoer\u201d]; <em>Jones </em>v. <em>California Casualty Indem. Exch. </em>(1970) 13 Cal.App.3d Supp. 1, 4 [91 Cal.Rptr. 726] [\u201c[s]tated simply, the collateral source rule provides that if a plaintiff receives some compensation for his injuries from a source wholly independent of the tortfeasor, such payment should not be deducted from the damages which the plaintiff would otherwise collect from the tortfeasor\u201d]; Comblum, Cal. Ins. Law Dict, and Desk Reference (West Group 2001) \u00a7 115.1, p. 207; Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation (The Rutter Group 2001) 9:37 to 9:38.1, pp. 9-9 to 9-10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">As repeatedly reaffirmed by the California appellate courts, the collateral source rule represents \u201ca policy judgment in favor of encouraging citizens to purchase and maintain insurance for personal injuries and other eventualities.\u201d <em>(Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at p. 10; see also <em>Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d at pp. 729-730; <em>Shaffer v. Debbas </em>(1993) 17 Cal.App.4th 33, 40 [21 Cal.Rptr.2d 110].) The rule is intended to ensure that the right of an <em>injured party </em>to be fully compensated for all his or her damages is protected, even if in some instances it entails that party obtaining double recovery from both the insurer and the wrongdoer. <em>(Hrnjak v. Graymar, Inc., supra, 4 </em>Cal.3d atp. 729; <em>Helfend </em>v. <em>Southern Cal. Rapid Transit Dist., supra, </em>2 Cal.3d at pp. 9-12; <em>Shaffer v. Debbas, supra, </em>17 Cal.App.4th at pp. 40-41.)  Here, respondent Miller was one of the two <em>tortfeasors </em>whose malpractice and professional negligence resulted in damages to Fay, the only injured party in this case. Obviously, the only right to damages for the joint malpractice of Miller and Ellis was Fay\u2019s, not that of either one of the two tortfeasors. Miller was in no sense an \u201cinjured party\u201d entitled to damages. Aside from his $5,000 insurance deductible, Miller did not advance any of the damages paid to Fay by his insurance carrier to settle the underlying personal injury action. Nevertheless, the trial court found that Miller \u201csuffered damages of $75,000 plus $5,000 toward attorney fees for a total of $80,000,\u201d and was entitled to recover 50 percent of that sum from Ellis \u201cby way of indemnity.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">The doctrine of equitable indemnification allows liability to be apportioned between wrongdoers based on their relative culpability. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>premised upon the principle that as a matter of fairness, joint tortfeasors should share the burden of discharging the legal obligation to the injured party for the damages caused by their mutual negligence. <em>(Western Steamship Lines, Inc. </em>v. <em>San Pedro Peninsula Hospital </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 100, 114-115 [32 Cal.Rptr.2d 263, 876 P.2d 1062]; <em>Children\u2019s Hospital v. Sedgwick </em>(1996) 45 Cal.App.4th 1780, 1787 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 725]; <em>Woodward-Gizienski &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Geotechnical Exploration, Inc. </em>(1989) 208 Cal.App.3d 64, 67 [255 Cal.Rptr. 800].) The concern is to avoid the inequity of one cotortfeasor bearing the entire burden of discharging the liability while the other cotortfeasor is allowed to pay nothing. Thus, the purpose of equitable indemnity is to prevent the unjust enrichment of some cotortfeasors at the expense of others, by requiring all cotortfeasors to bear their fair share on a comparative fault basis. <em>(American Motorcycle Assn. </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1978) 20 Cal.3d 578, 591-598, 608 [146 Cal.Rptr. 182, 578 P.2d 899]; <em>Woodward-Giziensld &amp; Associates v. Geotechnical Exploration, Inc., supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at p. 67.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Nevertheless, the remedy is not automatically available for all tortfeasors who have injured the same plaintiff. The courts must evaluate the circumstances of each case to determine if its application is appropriate in a given instance. Because indemnification is an equitable remedy designed to correct potential injustice, the courts will not apply it in a way which results in such injustice or unjust enrichment. <em>(Western Steamship Lines, Inc. v. San Pedro Peninsula Hospital, supra, </em>8 Cal.4th at pp. 108-109; <em>Children\u2019s Hospital v. Sedgwick, supra, </em>45 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1786-1789; <em>Woodward-Gizienski &amp; Associates v. Geotechnical Exploration, Inc., supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at pp. 67-70; <em>Munoz v. Davis </em>(1983) 141 Cal.App.3d 420, 426-427 [190 Cal.Rptr. 400].) Thus, equitable indemnity is not appropriate where it would have the perverse effect of allowing one tortfeasor to profit at the expense of other cotortfeasors. This would clearly defeat the very purpose of the doctrine, which is to <em>prevent </em>unjust enrichment. <em>(Woodward-Gizienski &amp; Associates v. Geotechnical Exploration, Inc., supra, </em>208 Cal.App.3d at pp. 67-68.)</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">It is undisputed that Ellis and Miller shared equal liability to Fay for their professional malpractice. In principle, then, Miller would be entitled to equitable indemnification from his cotortfeasor Ellis for any sums <em>paid by Miller </em>in excess of Miller\u2019s share of the fault in order to discharge their joint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>liability to Fay.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, in this case Miller himself paid nothing to Fay. Instead, Miller\u2019s insurance carrier paid Fay\u2019s claim for damages on Miller\u2019s behalf, in return for which Fay executed a release discharging Miller\u2019s liability completely. As the insured, Miller himself benefited from his insurance carrier\u2019s settlement payment to Fay. Miller\u2019s only payment out of his own pocket was the $5,000 deductible by which the insurance carrier\u2019s reimbursement of Miller\u2019s attorney fees was reduced. To permit Miller now to obtain \u201cindemnification\u201d from Ellis for the $75,000 paid to the injured party not by Miller himself, but by his insurance carrier, would effectively reward Miller for his own wrongdoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Although Miller\u2019s insurance carrier waived <em>its </em>subrogation rights, this did not result in Miller obtaining more rights that he otherwise would have had. Subrogation does no more than assign to the insurer the claims of its insured against the legally responsible party.  The waiver by Miller\u2019s insurance carrier of its subrogation rights simply left Miller with the same rights he had in the first place, no more and no less. <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. v. Maryland Casualty Co. </em>(1998) 65 Cal.App.4th 1279, 1291-1293 [77 Cal.Rptr.2d 296]; Croskey et al., Cal. Practice Guide: Insurance Litigation, <em>supra, </em>9:33 to 9:36, pp. 9-8 to 9-9.)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>\n                   Under the doctrine of equitable indemnity, Miller\u2019s only rights against Ellis were for sums which <em>Miller himself paid </em>in excess of his fair share under principles of comparative fault. Thus, the issue of subrogation and its waiver by Miller\u2019s insurer is essentially immaterial to this case. Miller\u2019s rights against Ellis are completely independent of any rights the insurance company itself may have had to recover against Ellis. They are instead dependent on whether it would be equitable to allow Miller to recover amounts which he never was required to pay, and in fact never did pay. To permit Miller now to recover from Ellis half of what the insurer paid to Fay on Miller\u2019s behalf would effectively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>permit Miller to profit from his own malpractice, contrary to the equitable principles underlying both the remedy of indemnity and the collateral source rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">In sum, we conclude the trial court erred as a matter of law in applying the doctrine of equitable indemnification and the collateral source rule to enter judgment in Miller\u2019s favor against Ellis for 50 percent of the $75,000 total paid by Miller\u2019s insurance company to Fay. Miller was not an injured party in this case; he was a cotortfeasor, equally responsible for the malpractice which caused Fay injury and resulted in the insurance carrier\u2019s settlement payment to Fay on Miller\u2019s behalf. Permitting Miller to obtain \u201creimbursement\u201d from Ellis for sums he never paid himself would result in unjust enrichment, contrary to the principles of fairness and equity underlying the doctrine of indemnification. Moreover, because Miller was not in any way an \u201cinjured party,\u201d the collateral source rule was unavailable to permit him to recover from Ellis despite the payment by his insurance company of his own liability to Fay.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Nevertheless, because Ellis was effectively a beneficiary of Miller\u2019s malpractice insurance, the insurer\u2019s defense of Fay\u2019s legal action against them both, and the settlement agreement and global release, Miller is entitled to equitable indemnification from Ellis of 50 percent of the $5,000 deductible Miller paid out-of-pocket for this defense, or $2,500.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">Disposition</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">The judgment in favor of Miller against Ellis is reversed and remanded for entry of a revised judgment, pursuant to which Ellis shall be ordered to pay Miller the total sum of $2,500. Each party shall bear his own costs on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Corrigan, J., and Parrilli, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Miller\u2019s malpractice insurer would not pay any money to settle the case unless there was a complete settlement including a global release executed by the claimant, releasing all participants. The global release was a form release utilized by Miller\u2019s malpractice insurance carrier\u2019s outside counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b341-8\">Under the collateral source doctrine, Fay\u2019s acceptance of the settlement amount paid by Miller\u2019s liability insurance carrier would not bar <em>Fay, </em>as the injured party, from seeking damages from Ellis as well, since Miller\u2019s insurance company was wholly independent of tortfeasor Ellis. In this instance, however, Fay <em>gave up </em>that right by executing the settlement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>and global release agreement, releasing Ellis as well as Miller from further liability. By virtue of the global release, therefore, Fay would not be able to take advantage of the collateral source doctrine to pursue payment from Ellis individually for the latter\u2019s cotortfeasor liability.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b343-6\">We note that Miller\u2019s action for indemnification against his cocounsel Ellis is not barred by any general rale of law or public policy prohibiting concurrent counsel or cocounsel from suing one another for indemnification of legal malpractice damages. As the Supreme Court has recently made clear, such an action for equitable indemnification may be brought so long as such a claim does not either (a) create a conflict between an attorney\u2019s duty to his or her client and the attorney\u2019s own self-interest; or (b) threaten the confidentiality of attorney-client communications. <em>(Musser </em>v. <em>Provencher </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 274, 284-285 [121 Cal.Rptr.2d 373, 48 P.3d 408].) The fact that an action for indemnity is not barred in all such cases by a blanket rule of policy does not, of course, mean that it was properly brought here, or that there are equitable grounds for granting the remedy of indemnity in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b343-7\">\u201cThe right of subrogation is purely derivative. An insurer entitled to subrogation is in the same position as an assignee of the insured\u2019s claim, and succeeds only to the rights of the insured. The subrogated insurer is said to \u2018 \u201cstand in the shoes\u201d \u2019 of its insured, because it has no greater rights than the insured and is subject to the same defenses assertable against the insured. Thus, an insurer cannot acquire by subrogation anything to which the insured has no rights, and may claim no rights which the insured does not have. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Maryland Casualty Co., supra, </em>65 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1292-1293.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b344-8\">We note that Miller\u2019s action for equitable indemnification appears to fail for another substantive reason: namely, the existence of the global settlement and release discharging both Miller <em>and </em>Ellis by name from any liability to Fay \u201carising out of or in any way connected with\u201d the underlying personal injury and subsequent \u201clegal malpractice claim against the parties released herein . . . with respect to their handling of\u2019 Fay\u2019s personal injury litigation. As seen, although this issue was not addressed directly in the trial court\u2019s statement of decision, the trial court implicitly concluded that the global release did not preclude Miller from recovering on his claim for equitable indemnity against Ellis. Because appellant Ellis did not raise this issue in his briefing, and respondent Miller has not had an opportunity to address it, we do not base our decision on the existence of the release. (Gov.
