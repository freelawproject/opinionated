The bill of exception shows that appellant requested and was granted a severance and George Tatum and Fox Hooper were placed on trial on the 11th day of August. They were found guilty and the punishment of each was assessed at five years in the penitentiary, with recommendation for suspended sentence. The next week of the same term of court appellant was placed on trial, and upon the voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>dire examination of the jury for the week the district attorney asked if any of said jurors had heard anything about the case. One of the jurors \u2014 Mr. Barr \u2014 indicated that he had heard something about it, and upon further inquiry from the district attorney said he had been in the courtroom the week before and heard part of the evidence while appellant\u2019s coindictees were being tried, and said he had \u201cheard the testimony of the two who were convicted,\u201d referring to George Tatum and Fox Hooper. The juror in question was excused. What he had said in reply to the district attorney\u2019s question was in the- presence of and was heard by the other jurors for the week. Appellant immediately requested leave to withdraw his announcement and moved the court to postpone the case upon the ground that the jury had learned of the conviction of appellant\u2019s coindictees, which fact it was claimed would cause them to believe that apappellant was also guilty. The court declined to grant appellant\u2019s motion and request, and required him to proceed with the selection of a jury from the panel then present. It appears from the court\u2019s qualification to the bill that Mr. Barr was not asked, nor did he relate the evidence he had heard upon the trial of the other parties, and the other jurors were not examined by appellant\u2019s counsel to ascertain what impression, if any, had been made upon their minds by the information that the other parties had been convicted, nor whether they had formed any opinion as a result thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It has been repeatedly held that a juror\u2019s knowledge of the conviction of an accused\u2019s codefendant will not disqualify the juror even though he may have heard the evidence on the trial which resulted in such conviction unless from such evidence he had formed an opinion as to accused\u2019s guilt which might influence his verdict. Thompson v. State, 19 Texas Crim. App. 593; Pierson v. State, 21 Texas Crim. App. 14; Peddy v. State, 31 Texas Crim. Rep. 547; Sanchez v. State, 90 Texas Crim. Rep. 518, 236 S. W. 734. It appears from the holdings in the cases mentioned that Mr. Barr himself would not have been subject to challenge from the mere fact of having heard some of the evidence in the former trial, and knowing the result thereof, much less, therefore, can it be said that other jurors who had not heard any of the evidence on the trial of appellant\u2019s co-defendants, but only knew they had been convicted, should have been dismissed by the court and held ineligible for service as jurors in the present trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
