Boyd, an inspector of the Texas Liquor Control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"530\">*530</page-number>Board, testified that on the 17th of April, 1937, he bought a pint of whisky from appellant. The testimony of appellant\u2019s witnesses raised the issue of alibi. The proof was sufficient to show that Upshur County was a dry area.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The two bills of exception brought forward are insufficient, in that no evidence is incorporated in said bills to verify the truth of appellant\u2019s objections. A mere statement of a ground of objection in a bill of exception is not a certificate of the judge that the facts which form the basis of the objection are true; it merely shows that such an objection was made.
