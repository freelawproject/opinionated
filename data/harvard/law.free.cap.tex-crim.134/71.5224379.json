J. Conn, </em>of Lufkin, and <em>Denman &amp; Fowler, </em>of Nacogdoches, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-17\"><em>Lloyd W.

According to her testimony, appellant had sexual intercourse with her on the 5th of April, 1936, in a corn field not far from the family residence. Further, she testified that she and appellant were standing at the time appellant accomplished his purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>Appellant did not testify and introduced no defensive testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">The State\u2019s attorney before this Court confesses error as to two of the bills of exception relating to argument of counsel for the State. One statement of counsel in argument to the jury was as follows: \u201cThe testimony stands uncontradicted that the defendant is the author of the downfall of this little girl.\u201d We quote the other statement: \u201cMaxine [prosecutrix] said he did do it, and to this good hour this statement has not been challenged.\u201d We agree with the State\u2019s attorney that said bills present reversible error. Article 710, C. C. P., reads as follows: \u201cAny defendant in a criminal action shall be permitted to testify in his own behalf therein, but the failure of any defendant to so testify shall not be taken as a circumstance against him, nor shall the same be alluded to or commented on by counsel in the cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The provisions of this article are mandatory. Only appellant could have denied that he had sexual relations with his daughter on the occasion in question. Hence it is clear that the remarks of counsel constituted a comment on the failure of the appellant to testify. See Opp v. State, 103 S. W. (2d) 748.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">We think bills of exception 7 to 10, both inclusive, set forth testimony which was improperly admitted over appellant\u2019s objection. Most of the testimony revealed by said bills appears to have been hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The judgment is reversed and the cause remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
