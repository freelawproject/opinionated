He says that no statement of facts was ever made, filed or delivered to him. Consequently, he maintains that he was, without fault on his part, deprived of a statement of facts and for that reason the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-18\">An examination of the transcript does not reveal any affidavit or order made thereon by the court. Nor is there any showing that .the same was ever presented to the court for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>order.
