The court charged the jury that before they could convict the appellant they had to find that he carried such pistol on premises not his own.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">The jury accepted the version of the two above referred to witnesses, and we see no reason for disturbing their verdict, and the judgment predicated thereon, and it is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
