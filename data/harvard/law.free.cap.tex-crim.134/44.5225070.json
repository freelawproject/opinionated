C., which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">\u201cWhoever shall have been three times convicted of a felony less than capital shall on such third conviction be imprisoned for life in the penitentiary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">The evidence heard upon the trial is not brought forward for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The only question presented for consideration is the sufficiency of the indictment in charging the previous offenses. Counsel for appellant insists that the counts of the'indictment charging the previous convictions are defective in failing to allege that the felonies therein set forth were \u201cless than capital,\u201d and in support of his contention cites the case of Helsley v. State, 80 S. W. (2d) 962. In the Helsley case, supra, the indictment was held defective in failing to disclose the nature and character of the previous offenses, the only description being that the offenses were \u201cfelonies.\u201d However, in the present case, the previous convictions are not only described as felonies but also as \u201cforgery,\u201d \u201cpassing a forged instrument,\u201d and \u201cburglary,\u201d all of which offenses are judicially known to be less than capital. Therefore, we think the indictment is sufficient in charging the previous offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
