At the time the search was made appellant, his wife, and several men were in the room where the beer was found. There was no evidence that appellant had sold any of said liquor. Appellant\u2019s wife testified that the beer belonged to appellant and George Williams. She said: \u201cYes, it was just a beer-drinking party. We were just drinking beer.\u201d Further, she testified that her husband had not sold any of the beer. Again we quote from her testimony: \u201cWe were not selling any of it. We were just having a beer party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">It is shown in bill of exception No. 1 that, over appellant\u2019s proper objection, the affidavit and search warrant were read to the jury. We quote the affidavit, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-11\">\u201cIN THE NAME AND BY AUTHORITY OF THE STATE OF TEXAS.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-12\">\u201cthe state of Texas, county of childress : In Justice Court, Precinct No. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-13\">\u201cBefore me, the undersigned authority, on this day personally appeared Richard Weinert and Sidney Partain, both known to me to be credible persons, who after being by me first duly sworn, upon their several oaths, each for himself, deposes and says:</p>\n<p id=\"b277-14\">\u201c1st.

The statements which went to the jury were hearsay and inadmissible. Uptmore v. State, 32 S. W. (2d) 474; Dillon v. State, 2 S. W. (2d) 251.
