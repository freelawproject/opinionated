However, on account of the severity of the punishment we have carefully gone over the facts herein. Briefly, they are as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">Appellants were charged by an indictment in the first count with killing Paul Henig by choking him with their hands; in the second count with killing Paul Henig by strangulation, and in the third count with killing him in some manner, and by some means and instruments and weapons to the grand jurors unknown.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">The facts show that the deceased, Mr. Henig, was at a neighbor\u2019s house at about 7 o\u2019clock in the evening of the night he was killed, and exhibited between fifty and sixty dollars in money which he carried in a pouched sack on his person. He seemed to be a small man, and probably rather sickly looking, of Jewish extraction, and owned and ran a small store in the town of Glenflora, and slept in the rear of the building on a cot. A little later in the same nignt deceased was seen at the home of another friend. About 9:30 that night another friend had parked his car just in front of Henig\u2019s store, and perceiving Mr. Henig approached, he moved his car in order that Mr. Henig could park his, Henig\u2019s car, in front of the store as was his custom to thus do. This is the last time deceased was seen alive by anyone, save the appellants. In a few minutes witnesses for the State heard some kind of noise proceeding from the direction of deceased\u2019s store, but could not describe it, and thought nothing of it. Sometime after breakfast, on the next day, friends of the deceased, not having seen him, and his store being closed, made an investigation, and found where a window of the store building had been prized open and an entry had been made therein, and located the deceased\u2019s body inside his store, where evidences of a struggle were seen, and from the surroundings it was deducible that deceased had met his death early in the previous night at the hands of an assailant whose motive was robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">There was very little blood in evidence, some about deceased\u2019s mouth where a tooth had been knocked out, evidently in the struggle; the deceased was dressed, except for his coat and vest, and his suspenders were down, his cot was broken down, and one of deceased\u2019s teeth was lying on a shelf, evidently the tooth which was knocked out when his mouth was cut, as shown by a bruise on his lip; there was also found a blanket, rolled up on the bed \u201clike you would roll up a quilt and wring it out,\u201d and on this blanket was found some blood. There was no money in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>his pockets except two nickels, although his pouch purse was in his pocket, but it was empty. The appellant Fobie Grays washed dishes and cooked at the drug store next door to deceased\u2019s place of business. The appellant Fobie Grays manifested a great interest in the proceedings after the discovery of the dead body. He was among one of the first in the store; he followed the officers around, and seemed to be trying to find out what they were talking about. This conduct caused his arrest, and he made the following confession, after having been given the legal warning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-4\">\u201cMy name is Fobie Grays; I am 22 years of age. I reside at Glen Flora, Texas. I have been working for Mr. Raymond Roecker at Glen Flora. On the night of Sunday, December 19, 1937, I got off from work at about 8 P. M. I went from Mr. Roecker\u2019s to Jud Sander\u2019s place, which is a colored restaurant across the track in Glen Flora from Mr. Roecker\u2019s place. I stayed at Jud\u2019s Place a few minutes and then went down to Louie Ray\u2019s place (confectionery). When I got to Louie\u2019s Place, Sam Cash was there. I was looking for Sam then because of some plans we had made that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-5\">\u201cAbout two o\u2019clock that same Sunday Sam Cash and I were standing in front of Mr. Jaeger\u2019s place and Sam asked me where we could get some money. I said I didn\u2019t know and Sam said: \u2018Do you reckon we could get some money from that Jew (meaning Paul Henig) ; maybe we could hide in his store until he comes in to go to sleep.\u2019 I said maybe we could do that and Sam told me to meet him across the track in the nigger quarter after I got off and we would see about hiding in the store.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-6\">\u201cThat is the reason I was looking for Sam that Sunday night after I got off from work. When I found Sam in Louie\u2019s Place he said: \u2018are you ready\u2019 and I said I was and we left together. When we were crossing the track about the depot we saw a car coming and it was Mr. Henig by himself. He drove up in front of his store and stopped his car and then he walked around to Mr. August Heyne\u2019s Place. While he was going to Mr. Heyne\u2019s place we went to the back of his store. Sam Cash took a piece of iron and placed it in the crack of the wooden window and pried it open. It came open easy. We then crawled in through that side of the glass window where the glass was broken out. Sam went in first. We went through the back where Mr. Henig lived to the front where some clothes were hanging and hid in the clothes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b505-7\">\u201cIn about five minutes Mr. Henig came in through the front door. He went behind the partition and started undressing. Sam told me to stay where I was and he tiptoed around the partition and then I heard Mr. Henig say: \u2018whoa, who is that?\u2019 Then I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>heard some tussling and heard something hit the wall on the side next to Mr. Roecker\u2019s. Then I heard Mr. Henig groan and I went around the partition. I met Sam and he said: T got the money, let\u2019s go.\u2019 We went out the window the same way we came in. When I saw Mr. Henig he was laying still on the floor in front of the cot. I don\u2019t know whether Sam choked him or what.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-5\">\u201cAbout Robert Ray\u2019s house Sam gave me $3.00 and told me that he got $6.00 loose out of his side pocket. Sam went home and I went to Henry Johnson\u2019s Place. Sam told me not to say anything about it. We didn\u2019t count the money until we got out the store. Sam may have gotten more money and held out on me.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-6\">\u201cWitness my hand at Wharton, Texas, this December 24, 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKZ\">\u201cWitness: \u201c(Signed) Fobe Grays.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-7\">\u201cC. R. Siebrecht</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuQ\">\u201cEd. R. Schattel.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">The appellant Sam Cash also made a statement after a proper warning, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-9\">\u201cOn Sunday afternoon about 2 or 3 o\u2019clock I was standing in front of Mr. Jeager\u2019s store talking to Phobie Grays; I call him Red. I asked Red where he could get some money and he told me we could rob the Jew, meaning Paul Henig. I didn\u2019t want to do that and told Red I was going to borrow some money for Christmas, but he finally argued me into robbing the Jew. That night I was at Louie Ray\u2019s Place when Red came in from work and asked if I was ready and I told him I guessed so.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b506-10\">\u201cWe walked across to the white side of the track down the sidewalk to the post office then in behind the post office and Raymond Roecker\u2019s place to the back of Paul Henig\u2019s store. Red picked up a piece of iron' behind the store and we both went to the window. Red pried the wooden window open with the iron then me and Red both raised the glass window, after Red had turned the latch by sticking his hand through the broken glass. Red went in first and I second. I reached back and pulled the glass window down and pulled the wooden window to. We then went toward the front of the store on the other side of the wall that separates the store from the living quarters in the back. I stood among some dresses and Red stood among some coats. In about five or ten minutes the Jew came in the front door of the store with his flash light on. We had seen him get out of his car and start south while we were watching from the corner of the post office and we were expecting him to come in soon. Mr. Henig walked right on back to the back of the store where he has his cot. I could hear the Jew laying his clothes by and then I heard a scuffle. Red had tiptoed back to where he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>and grabbed him before I knew what was happening. I heard the Jew say: \u2018Whoa, who is this/ then I heard some scuffling, then I heard something hit up against the wall, and then Mr. Henig groaned. Then I came around the wall and saw Red with one hand on Henig\u2019s throat and one hand in his pocket and they were tussling in front of the cot. I ran over and grabbed Mr. Henig by the waist. Red said: T got it/ and I turned loose and ran to the window and Red was right behind me. When I grabbed Henig he was groaning. When Red turned loose of him he let him fall right where he was. After we went out the window Red closed the windows and we both ran. We ran down the alley toward the railroad track and stopped at the calaboose. Red said he got six dollars; he gave me three dollars and kept three and told me not to say anything about it. Red said he didn\u2019t know whether he had killed the Jew or not; that he was groaning. Then Red went over toward Henry Johnson\u2019s and I went on home.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-3\">\u201cWhere this all happened was in Glen Flora, Wharton County, Texas, and the person whom I refer to as Red is Phobie Gray and the person I refer to as the Jew was Paul Henig. The acts that I have stated above happened last Sunday, December 19, 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-4\">\u201cI remember now that I held on to Mr. Henig and helped Red stretch him out on the floor, before we ran.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-5\">\u201cWitness my hand this the 24 day of December, A. D. 1937.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Axji\">\u201cWitnesses: \u201c(Signed) Sam Cash.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-6\">\u201cC. R. Siebrecht,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b507-7\">\u201cC. C. Elliott.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The county physician conducted a post-mortem examination of the deceased\u2019s body and found a bruise on his lip where the skin was knocked off, about ten or fifteen small abrasions where the skin was knocked off over his face, and his head and neck looked like they had some fingernail marks on them. There was an upper tooth knocked out. They opened his body, took out his brain and internal organs and found them all in a fairly healthy condition. However, his lungs showed a moderate amount of congestion, but no evidence of an organic disease present. The only thing about his body that showed what could have caused his death was suffocation, so the doctor said, strangulation or cutting his air off by putting something over his mouth or choking him. It could have been done by holding a blanket over his head, or by a person putting his hand over his nose or mouth. In the doctor\u2019s opinion the death of Paul Henig was caused by suffocation. The organs of his body evidenced a normal, healthy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>condition, save the congested lungs and the external bruises on his face and neck.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">We have gone into these facts rather thoroughly and carefully, not only on account of the gravity of the jury\u2019s verdict, but also on account of the fact that the record contains no bills of exceptions, and after such examination it seems to us that the State has met the burden placed upon it by proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the two appellants caused the death of Paul Henig by suffocating or strangling him. They were charged therewith in a properly drawn indictment, and we find no error in the proceedings at the trial. So believing, we have no alternative other than to affirm the judgment, which is accordingly done.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
