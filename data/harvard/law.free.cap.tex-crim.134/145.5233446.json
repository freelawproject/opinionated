Further, it is averred that on the 11th of April, 1937, the same being Sunday, appellant sold and delivered to Turner Keith intoxicating liquor, to-wit, \u201cwhisky, said liquor containing more than 14 per cent, of alcohol by volume.\u201d Again, it is alleged that the sale and delivery were not made upon the prescription of a duly licensed physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The proof on the part of the State was to the effect that Turner Keith, an inspector of the Liquor Control Board, went to appellant\u2019s place of business on the 11th of April, 1937, and purchased some whisky from appellant. The sale was not made upon the prescription of a duly licensed physician. Other inspectors were present when the sale was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the inspectors were accomplice witnesses can not be sustained. No deceptive methods were used by them to induce appellant to violate the law. A similar question was before this Court and was decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in the cases of Stevens v. State, 110 S. W. (2d) 906, and Wooldridge v. State, 109 S. W. (2d) 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">We deem it unnecessary to discuss appellant\u2019s motion to quash the complaint and information. The question here raised was decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in the case of Earl Hughes v. The State, Opinion No. 19337, delivered February 9, 1938. [Page 175 of this volume.]</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-13\">ON MOTION FOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b170-14\">Morrow, Presiding Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AgZ\">The legal questions presented are identically the same as those raised in the case of Hughes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>v. State, No. 19337, in which an opinion on motion for rehearing is this day delivered. [Page 175 of this volume. ] Upon the reasons and authority of that case, the motion for rehearing in the present instance is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
