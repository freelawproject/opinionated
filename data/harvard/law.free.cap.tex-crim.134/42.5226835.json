It is impossible to appraise the relevancy of the refused special charges or the objections to the court\u2019s instructions in the absence of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-12\">We discover no vice in the count of the indictment under which appellant was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-13\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-14\">ON APPELLANT\u2019S motion for rehearing.</p>\n<author id=\"b67-15\">Christian, Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AFb\">In the count of the indictment under which appellant was convicted the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d was misspelled, it being alleged that appellant <em>fraudelently </em>received and concealed the alleged stolen property. Appellant\u2019s motion to quash the indictment reads, in part, as follows: \u201cAnd for the further reason that said second count is fatally defective in that same contains words which have no meaning and which render said indictment, and especially the second count thereof, so vague, indefinite and uncertain that it is not possible to determine the offense sought to be charged against defendant.\u201d In his motion for rehearing appellant insists that there is no sufficient averment that he fraudulently received the alleged stolen property, his position being that the misspelling of the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d vitiates the indictment; In Limbrick v. State, 36 S. W. (2d) 1026, we had under consideration the sufficiency of an indictment charging theft of hogs. In that case the word \u201cfraudulently\u201d was misspelled in the indictment, the pleader having spelled it \u201cfraudently.\u201d We upheld the indictment. It is the rule that \u201cbad spelling of the word \u2018fraudu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>lently\u2019 will not vitiate an otherwise good indictment or information for theft if the sense is not affected and the meaning can not be mistaken.\u201d Branch\u2019s Ann. P. C., Sec. 2425; State v. Earp, 41 Texas 487. We are constrained to overrule appellant\u2019s contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">Appellant\u2019s motion for rehearing is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">The foregoing opinion of the Commission of Appeals has been examined by the Judges of the Court of Criminal Appeals and approved by the Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
