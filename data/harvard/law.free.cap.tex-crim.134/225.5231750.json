The statement of facts accompanying the record was not considered for the reason that same was not filed within the time required by law. It should have been filed by July 11, 1937. We find it to have been filed on October 19, 1937, and it comes too late. Under these circumstances the motion for rehearing will be overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
