Anderson, who was then and there the holder of a package store permit issued by the Texas Liquor Control Board authorizing the sale at retail of intoxicating liquor on and from premises situated at No. 1400 Franklin Avenue, in the city of Houston. Further, it is averred that on the 11th of April, 1937, the same being Sunday, appellant sold and delivered to V. L. Delaney intoxicating liquor, to-wit, \u201cwhisky, said liquor containing more than 14 per cent, of alcohol by volume.\u201d Again, it is alleged that the sale and delivery were not made upon a prescription of a duly licensed physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-19\">The testimony of the State was to the effect that V. L. Delaney, an inspector of the Texas Liquor Control Board, went with other inspectors to the place of business of Sterling D. Anderson, where Delaney purchased some whisky from appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>lant. The sale was not made upon the prescription of a duly-licensed physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\">Appellant\u2019s contention that the inspectors were accomplice witnesses can not be sustained. No deceptive methods were used by them to induce appellant to violate the law. A similar question was decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in the cases of Stevens v. State, 110 S. W. (2d) 906, and Wooldridge v. State, 109 S. W. (2d) 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The question herein raised relative to the sufficiency of the complaint was decided adversely to the appellant\u2019s contention in the case of Earl Hughes v.

State, No. 19337, opinion this day delivered [page 175 of this volume], and the same points are raised in the motion for rehearing herein as were therein presented, and on that authority this motion is overruled.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
