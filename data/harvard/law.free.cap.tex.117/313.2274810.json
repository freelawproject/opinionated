The banking statute (Art. 503) expressly provides that each shareholder of a banking corporation shall be entitled to one vote on each share of stock held by him. The railroad statutes expressly provide for the voting on each share of the stock of a railroad corporation in the election of directors and in making the by-laws. Art. 6289 and Aft. 6293. Evidently the Legislature considered that the public had an interest in the management of these corporations because of their quasi-public nature, which did not attach to a purely private corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b338-7\">It is plain that since Arts. 1323, 1326 and 1333 do not expressly forbid the exercise of the immemorial right to make contracts re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>specting the privilege of voting stock, and since they are not inconsistent with that right, they cannot be held to change the rule which permitted the exercise of that right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-3\">Three other provisions of the statutes which contemplate voting by stockholders are: Art. 1330, providing for increase in capital stock; Art. 1332, providing for decrease in capital stock, and Art. 1387, Sec. 3, providing how a corporation may be dissolved. None of these articles expressly forbid the denial to holders of certain classes of stock of the right to vote; and in this respect are similar to the articles already discussed; but from these last mentioned articles they differ in purpose and effect and require a different treatment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-4\">It will be noted that each of these three articles of the statute deal with matters of fundamental importance to the corporation. The question of the amount of its capital stock \u2014 the increase or decrease thereof \u2014 is one of vital and fundamental interest; for on such amount depends the ratio of dividends to investment; and nothing is more important to the corporation than the question of its dissolution \u2014its life or death. These statutes, then, deal with fundamental changes in the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-5\">The legislative attitude on the question of public policy is shown in various ways. First, the Legislature failed to put into the general corporation laws any provision expressly condemning such a contract as is involved here, while it did put into the banking and railroad corporation laws provisions entitling the stockholder to vote on each share of stock owned by him. Under the principle of interpretation that the mention of one thing implies the exclusion of another thing, the Legislature evidently intended in this way to show its approval of the old established rule permitting stockholders to make contracts concerning the right to vote.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b339-6\">But we do not have to rely upon these negative Acts of the Legislature. In 1925, prior to the incorporation of St. Regis Candies, Inc., the Legislature passed what is known as the non-par statute. Arts. 1538a to 1538m Rev. Stats., 1925. This is statutory confirmation of a well established rule, but it is more. It is an express declaration of public policy. It settles beyond question the public policy of the State on the point at issue here.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b339-7\"><em>Allen B.

Therefore the question immediately resolves itself to whether or not the unusual and revolu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>tionary provisions of the charter and by-laws of St. Regis Candies, Inc., denying a portion of the common stock the right to vote and placing the absolute control of the corporation in the hands of a person holding 51 per cent of a group of the common stock designated as Class <em>\u201cA,\u201d </em>are legal and binding on the parties or void as being prohibited by the Constitution and statutes or as being contrary to public policy.

He became associated with ' four other men for corporate purposes. They incorporated as St. Regis Candies, Inc. Xanthull\u2019s plant and business, at an agreed valuation, became the property of the corporation received in payment for 510 shares of \u201cClass A Stock\u201d and forty shares of \u201cClass B Stock\u201d of the corporation. The other associates on their part subscribed for the remaining 490 shares of \u201cClass A Stock\u201d and 210 shares of \u201cClass B Stock.\u201d Inferably \u2014 they paid the requisite proportion in cash and became liable for the remainder of their stock subscriptions. A charter was secured in which the declaration is made that the \u201ccapital stock\u201d is $125,000, divided into 1,250 shares of $100 each, and divided further \u201cinto two classes, 1,000 shares thereof being known as \u2018Class A\u2019 stock and 250 shares thereof being <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>known as \u2018Class B\u2019 stock\u201d \u2014 it being declared also that \u201cClass B. stock * * * shall have no voting privileges or power * * * no right to participate proportionately in future increases of capital stock * * * and shall be subject to such conditions, restrictions and limitations as may be imposed by the by-laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-3\">A meeting attended by Xanthull and three of the other associates was held, at which the foregoing charter recitations were definitely approved and at which by-laws were adopted in which: (a) \u201cClass B\u201d stock was restricted as in the charter; (b) future meetings of \u201cClass A\u201d stockholders were provided for; (c) it was provided that each \u201cClass A\u201d stockholder would have one vote for each share of that class of stock owned by him. It was also provided that the owners of \u201cClass B\u201d stock would be entitled to participate in meetings but without voting rights. The selection of directors was by by-law provisions left to \u201cClass A\u201d stockholders as was the matter of by-law amendments. The fifth associate ratified that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u201cUnder the agreements of the parties, Xanthull took charge of the business, &lt; managed and controlled its affairs * * * undisturbed until the 12th day of January, 1927\u201d (a period of about a year). On that day the associates, save Xanthull undertook to call a special meeting of the directors for a named date and issued notices therefor for the purpose of altering the by-laws so as to revoke the authority of the president (Xanthull) to manage the affairs of the corporation, and to provide for amendment of the charter and bylaws so as \u201cto eliminate the \u2018Class B\u2019 stock and make all of the stock in the corporation have the same rights, powers and preferences.\u201d The meeting was held, attended by all five of the associates, and over the protest of Xanthull the holders of \u201cClass B\u201d stock voted as if it were \u201cClass A\u201d stock. The result was that by affirmative vote of those holding 49 per cent of \u201cClass A\u201d stock and 210 shares of \u201cClass B Stock\u201d the changes proposed were ordered; Xanthull voted his 51 per cent of \u201cClass A Stock\u201d in the negative. A charter amendment was filed in the name of the corporation..</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">January 18, Xanthull, \u201cfor himself and in behalf of the St. Regis Candies, Inc.,\u201d brought suit against the other associates. The facts already stated were alleged and it was shown, further, that January 19 was the day regularly fixed for annual meeting of stockholders, that the meeting would be held and that the defendants would undertake to \u201cvote \u2018Class B Stock\u2019 and thereby control such meeting and elect directors of their own choosing and undertake to shape the policies of the corporation * * * and deprive him\u201d (Xanthull) \u201cof <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>the control of the corporation as conferred upon him by his ownership of 51 per cent of the \u2018Class A Stock\u2019 and by the terms of the charter and by-laws,\u201d etc., etc. It was prayed that defendants be restrained from voting the \u201cClass B Stock\u201d at the meeting or at any . other meeting and that the charter and by-laws amendments theretofore undertaken be declared void. Restraining order was issued. Defendants answered \u2014 alleging the agreements depriving \u201cClass B Stock\u201d of voting rights to be \u201ccontrary to the Constitution and statutes of this State and against public policy and therefor void.\u201d Upon hearing, the injunction prayed for was denied and an appeal was taken by Xanthull and the corporation to the Court of Civil Appeals, First District, wherein the cause is now pending.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-3\">That court has certified these questions :</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u201cNo. 1. Is the contract entered into between the appellant Xanthull and the appellees, which was carried into the charter of the corporation, by the terms of which Class A stock only had the right to vote, a valid contract, that is, is it binding as against the holders of Class B stock so as to exclude such stock from being voted? In other words, is there any provision in either our Constitution or statutes which demands that stock such as Class B in the present case shall have the right to vote regardless of a provision in the charter of the corporation to the contrary?</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">\u201cNo. 2. Is such contract void as against public policy?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">OPINION.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">The provisions of the charter and by-laws are by the parties assumed sufficient to evidence a contract in respect to preclusion of voting power in the holders of \u201cClass B\u201d stock, so-called. The assumption appears justified on the facts, and we join in its indulgence. See Overland Auto Co. v. Cleveland, 250 S. W., 453; Howe Grain &amp; Merc. Co. v. Jones, 21 Texas Civ. App., 198, 51 S. W., 24; 14 C. J., 161, 162, 346, 347; 7 R. C. L., 97, 142, 143.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">The parties have treated the rights belonging to \u201cClass B\u201d holders as being rights of stockholders and the agreement in respect thereto (rather, the .papers evidencing those rights) as being \u201cstock.\u201d Whether in truth such is the character of those rights, or certificates, is a question which may be pretermitted; for the purposes of this case, we treat the rights, or certificates, as being of \u201cstock\u201d character.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">Increase or decrease of \u201cauthorized\u201d stock (Arts. 1330, 1332, Rev. Stats., 1925), dissolution (Art. 1387, Rev. Stats., 1925) or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>other fundamental alteration of corporate purpose, structure or assets, has not been attempted in violation of the agreement; hence, questions pertaining to voting rights touching such proposals, are not directly involved \u2014 if involved at all, indirectly so and so far as that subject-matter may throw light upon what implications, if any, are to be drawn from expressed statutory declarations.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">This much has been said to posture the questions now presented; what is to be said has no reference to <em>futuro </em>situations of any different phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">In so far as specific constitutional declarations (Art. 12) are concerned, and in so far as relevant, they make up a command to the Legislature (not to the courts or to individuals) to provide by general laws: (a) For creation of corporations; (b) \u201cfor the adequate protection of the public;\u201d and (c) \u201cfor the adequate protection * * * of the individual stockholders.\u201d Except as to named \u25a0classes of corporations (other than the class to which St. Regis Candies, Inc., belongs), execution of the command has witness in Chapters 1-8 (Arts. 1302-1395), Title 32, Rev. Stats., 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">(a) Creation per Statute: Naming of purposes in Chap. 1 is followed in Chap. 2 (Art. 1303), by the declaration that \u201cprivate corporations\u201d are to be formed \u201cby the voluntary association of three or more persons.\u201d In Arts. 1304, 1305, 1307 and 1308 (with exceptions in 1310-1312) certain acts are prescribed for the corporators (and, in Art. 1313, for the Secretary of State) in perfection of the corporate entity. For aught that is shown St. Regis Candies, Inc., was sufficiently born. The abnormality claimed (classification of \u201cstock\u201d in the charter), if it be abnormality, did not prevent corporate life or make the life given subject to forfeiture at will of anybody save, possibly, the State (Staacke v. Routledge, 111 Texas, 489, 241 S. W., 994; Parks v. West, 102 Texas, 11, 18, 111 S. W., 726, and cases there cited).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">(b) Protection of the Public: The corporate field in general is marked out in Chap. 1; and in Chap. 2 (Art. 1304) the \u201cvoluntary associates\u201d are required to select and publicly name that part of the field which shall encompass corporate activity. The main purpose here is to protect the \u201cpublic;\u201d first, against too great delegation and any usurpation of power (Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 97 U. S., 659, 666, 24 L. Ed., 1036; Gulf, C. &amp; S. F. Ry. Co. v. Morris, 67 Texas, 692, 4 S. W., 156; North Side Ry. Co. v. Worthington, 88 Texas, 562, 53 Am. St., 778, 50 S. W., 1055; Bowman Lbr. Co. v. Pierson, 110 Texas, 543, 11 A. L. R., 547, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>221 S. W., 930); and, secondly, by affording the means whereby right to a claimed power or rightful use of an admitted power may be tested.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-3\">There must be a fund on hand or available with which to begin business and the amount of it (in so far as. it consists of capital stock) must be stated in the charter (Art. 1304). The fund may be wholly in cash or partly in cash and partly in credits represented by unpaid subscriptions (Arts. 1308, 1335, 1338, 1339, 1341, 1343, 1344, 1345). The fund may have constituents in form of \u201clabor done or property * * * received\u201d at proper valuation (Sec. 6, Art. 12, Constitution; Art. 1308, Rev. Stats., 1925). Such is the capital or capital stock in the absolute sense (Furr v. Chapman, Texas Comm. App., 286 S. W., 171; Scottish Union &amp; Natl. Ins. Co. v. Bowland, 196 U. S. 611, 25 Sup. Ct., 345, 350, 49 L. Ed., 619; Lee v. Sturges, 46 Ohio St., 153, 160, 19 N. E., 560, 2 L. R. A., 556). For some corporate purposes (other than those \u00f3f St. Regis Candies, Inc.), minima, and for others maxima, in respect to the fund, are prescribed (e. g. Art. 1302, Subds. 15, 16, 27 and 40). Undue impairment of the fund or a too large amount of indebtedness accrued is prohibited under corporate death penalty (Chap. 7, Title 32, Rev. Stats., 1925). All this, of course, is primarily in behalf of those to become creditors or strangers otherwise entitled \u2014 i. e, \u201cthe public.\u201d Ownership of the fund is by the corporate entity \u2014 distinguishable from members of the body (Powers v. Detroit, G. H. &amp; M. Ry. Co., 201 U. S., 543, 26 Sup. Ct., 556, 50 L. Ed., 806). On familiar principles, interest of a member therein has the characteristics of (a) indirection, (b) subordination to that of creditors, and (c) sequent contingency of realization in the form of profits or return of (or reimbursement for) his contribution. That, in the true sense, is the \u201cshare.\u201d Ibid.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Since in the fund there may be credits made up of subscriptions in part unpaid; it was thought proper to require in the charter (Art. 1304) a statement of \u201cthe number of shares into which\u201d the fund \u201cis divided,\u201d and in another paper (Art. 1308) an identification \u201cof each subscriber\u201d with showing of\u2018\u201cthe amount subscribed * * * and paid\u201d by him. Additional requirements are: A record of \u201call stock subscribed and transferred\u201d (Art. 1328) ; furnishing of that information, etc, to execution plaintiffs (Art. 1346).</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">(c) Protection of Individual Stockholders: A subsidiary purpose underlying each and all of the constitutional and statutory pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>visions already mentioned is protection of each stockholder against each and all of the others and the corporation and the public.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-3\">\u201cGeneral management\u201d of corporate affairs is vested in the directors. Art. 1327. The \u201cvoluntary associates\u201d in the beginning must select those officers (Art. 1304) \u2014 the manner of their selection being in nowise regulated in the statute. (Their selection in the present instance was in the manner freely adopted by the \u201cassociates.\u201d) The-first board having been thus created, the terms of Art. 1320 so operate as to vest power in the corporate entity \u201cto make by-laws * * * for the management of its property, the regulation of its affairs and the traftsfer of its stock,\u201d to \u201cincrease or diminish * * * the number of its directors\u201d and to \u201cappoint and remove subordinate officers and agents as the business of the corporation shall require.\u201d \u201cBy-laws\u201d are framed by the \u201cdirectors\u201d (Art. 1326) and are subject to alteration \u201cby a majority vote of the stockholders\u201d cast at a meeting called by the \u201cdirectors\u201d (Art. 1326). The power \u201cto increase or diminish * * * the number of directors\u201d is conditioned upon \u201cvote of its stockholders\u201d but the \u201cvote\u201d itself is to be governed by \u201cby-laws\u201d consistent \u201cwith existing laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">Authorized increase or decrease of \u201cauthorized capital stock\u201d may be secured by action of the directors based upon \u201ca two-thirds vote of all its stock,\u201d in the one case, or \u201ca two-thirds vote of all its outstanding \u2018stock\u201d in the other (Arts. 1330, 1332). Voluntary dissolution may be had \u201cwhere four-fifths in interest of all stock outstanding shall vote\u201d therefor \u201cat a stockholders\u2019 meeting\u201d or \u201cwhen, without a stockholders\u2019 meeting, all the stockholders * * * consent in writing.\u201d Art. 1387. ' In respect to action taken or proposed under these provisions (i. e., Arts. 1330, 1332 and 1387) and action taken or proposed in respect to other fundamental alterations of the corporate purpose, structure and properties, and for instant purposes, two assumptions are indulged in favor of the holders of \u201cClass B\u201d stock, so-called: (a) Every stockholder is entitled to vote, and, (b) those owners are \u201cstockholders.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">We have generally reviewed the constitutional and statutory provisions mentioned above for the purpose of indicating that no expressed declaration of voting right in a stockholder exists, save in the exceptional instances last mentioned and on the assumptions there made. If the right exists in virtue of law it rests in implication.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The fact that the Legislature, in execution of the command given, made specific provision for voting rights in what we have called the exceptional situations and omitted provision therefor in other cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>is not without cogency. With the exact subject of voting-rights present in the minds of the lawmakers, a specific enactment for named conditions and silence in respect to other conditions would seem to indicate a purposed omission in deference to liberty of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-3\">There are other situations of- like import:</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">(a) The general requirements of Art. 12 of the Constitution have reference to railroad and insurance corporations \u2014 as well as to corporations generally. But in executing the command the Legislature put railroad corporations into a class (Title 112, Arts. 6259-6534, Rev. Stats., 1925), and insurance corporations into another class (Title 78, Arts. 4679-5068, Rev. Stats., 1925).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In Art. 6289 certain \u201crules\u201d are named to be controlling in the \u201celection of the board of directors\u201d of a railroad corporation. Among the rules is this: \u201cEach stockholder shall have the right to vote * * * for the number of shares of stock owned by him for as many persons as there are directors to be elected.\u201d The matter of \u201cby-laws\u201d is the subject of Art. 6293, and it is there said that \u201cthe stockholders of the corporation shall be entitled to one vote for each share of stock held by them.\u201d Comparable provisions are made for \u201clife, health and accident insurance\u201d corporations (Art. 4718), \u201cmutual assessment accident companies\u201d (Art. 4789), \u201cmutual life insurance companies\u201d (Art. 4801), and \u201cmutual insurance companies\u201d (Art. 4868), and omitted in respect to various other classes of \u201cinsurance companies,\u201d etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">(b) By the terms of Sec. 16, Art. 16, Constitution, the Legislature is required to provide, by general laws, for the incorporation of \u201cbodies with banking and discounting privileges, for supervision, etc., and for adequate protection and security of depositors and creditors. Execution of the requirement has general evidence in Title 16, Rev. Stats., 1925 (Arts. 342-548). Amongst other things, it is there provided (Art. 503) that \u201cin the election of directors and in deciding all questions at meetings of shareholders * * * each shareholder shall be entitled to one vote on each share of stock held by him.\u201d In Art. 504 the general right thus declared is specifically preserved to an executor, administrator, guardian or trustee (i. e., he \u201cshall represent the shares of stock in his hands at all meetings of the corporation, and may vote as a shareholder\u201d) and to a pledgor (who \u201cmay nevertheless represent\u201d his pledged stock \u201cat all such meetings and may vote accordingly as a stockholder\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">There is, it seems to us, recognition (at least prima facie) of that freedom of contract necessary for the present agreement in its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>present aspects in the terms of the \u201cNon-par Corporation\u201d statute, enacted in 1925. Chap. 19a, Rev. Stats., 1925. In the first section of the Act (Art. 1538a), authority is given new corporations and pre-existing ones, except those \u201cauthorized to conduct a banking or insurance business,\u201d to make provision for \u201cissuance of its shares of stock without nominal or par value.\u201d It is there said that \u201cevery such share shall be equal in all respects to every other such share, except that the charter or any amendment may provide that such shares should be divided into different classes, the shares of each class to have such preference, designations, rights, privileges and powers and to be subject to such restrictions, limitations and qualifications as shall be stated in the charter or any amendment thereof.\u201d \u201cAny private corporation for profit, other than corporations organized to conduct a banking or insurance business,\u201d it is said in Art. 1538h, having authorized shares with par or face value, or shares without nominal or face value, or both, may, by vote of the holders of a majority of its outstanding stock <em>entitled to vote </em>at any annual meeting or at any special meeting called and held for the purpose, amend its charter so as to change its shares of stock with par or face value, or any class or classes thereof, * * * into * * * shares without nominal or face value * * * provided * * * that the preferences, rights, limitations, privileges and restrictions granted or imposed with respect to any shares of outstanding stock shall not be impaired, diminished or changed without the consent of the holder thereof.\u201d On the words of the statute, at least, there may be par value stock of a corporation (having no other kind) which may not be entitled to vote at a meeting held to determine change to a non-par corporation and the pre-existing \u201cpreferences,\u201d etc., are to continue (the change notwithstanding) unless the \u201cholder\u201d of the preferred or restricted stock (consent) to a different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">In its unrestricted scope, \u201cpublic policy\u201d is most vague in its expressions and implications \u2014 in the general manner of \u201cfraud.\u201d Story on Contracts, Sec. \u2014. For instant purposes it may be taken in these aspects : (a) When the lawmakers speak'upon a subject over which they have constitutional jurisdiction, their words define the \u201cpublic policy\u201d of the subject. United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Assn., 166 U. S., 290, 340, 17 Sup. Ct., 540, 41 L. Ed., 1007. Touching the subject in mind, they have not directly spoken contrary to what was agreed upon, nor have they used language upon which an inference against the right to agree and execute must be erected, (b) \u201cThe very meaning of \u2018public policy,\u2019 \u201d when used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>by an obligee against consensual obligation and performance \u201cis the interest of others than the parties.\u201d Beasley v. Texas &amp; P. Ry. Co., 191 U. S., 492, 498, 24 Sup. Ct., 164, 48 L. Ed., 274. In the situation presented it is difficult to perceive harm to the public in allowing able-minded men, dealing at arms length, to contract with reference to their own property and the conditions upon which a transfer of it to their corporate representative shall be made, (c) An important requirement of policy is \u201cthat men of full age and competent understanding shall have the utmost liberty of contracting and that their contracts, when entered into freely and voluntarily, shall be held sacred and shall be enforced by courts of justice\u201d unless, perchance, contravention of public right or welfare very clearly appears. Missouri, K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. Carter, 95 Texas, 461, 68 S. W., 159; Baltimore &amp; O. S. W. Ry. Co. v. Voigt, 176 U. S., 498, 20 Sup. Ct., 385, 44 L. Ed., 560; Printing &amp; N. R. Co. v. Sampson, 19 Eq. Cas. (L. R.). The claim of invalidating public policy is not sufficiently grounded to have warrant for striking down the agreement in question.
