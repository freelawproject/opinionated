More than a year later, on March 10, 1981, as a result of plea bargaining, the defendant agreed to plead guilty to the charge of conspiracy to sell marijuana.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the plea <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>proceeding, the court inquired into the factual basis of the plea, and explained to the defendant that he was giving up his right against self-incrimination and his rights to confrontation and trial. The court further indicated the penalty for the offense charged and warned the defendant that the court was not bound by the state\u2019s recommendation. Additionally, the court inquired into the voluntariness of the plea and whether the defendant was under the influence of drugs or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>otherwise incompetent during the plea proceeding. The court found that there was a factual basis for the plea and that the plea was voluntary. Thereafter, the court entered a finding of guilty, ordered a presentence investigation and continued the case for sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">The defendant\u2019s attorney again appeared before the court on May 22, 1981. At that time he informed the court that a dispute had arisen between himself and the state\u2019s attorney as to the terms of the presentence recommendation stated at the March 10, 1981 pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>ceeding. The court, therefore, granted counsel a one week extension to review the transcripts of the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">The defendant was present for sentencing on May 29, 1981. On that date, prior to the imposition of sentence, the defendant\u2019s counsel, alleging that the terms of the plea agreement as they appeared in the March 10, 1981 transcript were materially different from what he had explained to the defendant, moved to withdraw the guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant\u2019s counsel at no time offered any testimony in support of his mo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>tion to withdraw the plea. The court, after hearing argument and reviewing the March 10,1981 transcript, denied the defendant\u2019s motion. The court also denied the defendant\u2019s motion that he be committed to the \u201cTASC\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> drug dependency program and imposed a sentence of one and one-half to three years to serve. A nolle was entered on the weapons in a motor vehicle charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">On appeal the defendant asserts that he should be allowed to withdraw his guilty plea on the basis of Practice Book \u00a7 721 (2). That section authorizes the withdrawal of a guilty plea upon proof that \u201c[t]he plea was involuntary, or it was entered without knowledge of the nature of the charge or without knowledge that the sentence actually imposed could be imposed.\u201d The defendant claims that the record at the time of the plea (as set out in footnote 1) indicates that both the defendant and his attorney believed that, as part of the bargain, the defendant would be committed to the commissioner of mental health pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19-485 (now General Statutes \u00a7 21a-285) to allow him to continue participating in the \u201cTASC\u201d drug dependency program, with the sentence imposed suspended for the duration of the program, in return for his guilty plea. The defendant insists that this mistake of fact on the part of the defendant and his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>attorney as to the terms of the plea agreement persisted despite the statement by the assistant state\u2019s attorney of his intention to (1) recommend a sentence of not less than two and one-half years and not more than five years; (2) not to prosecute on a second count; and (3) not to oppose the defendant\u2019s application for drug dependency treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">In essence, the defendant claims that this guilty plea was not voluntary and intelligent because both the defendant and his attorney were laboring under a subjective misunderstanding of the plea agreement.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It is to be underscored that the defendant does not allege a broken prosecutorial promise. See <em>Santobello </em>v. <em>New York, </em>404 U.S. 257, 92 S. Ct. 495, 30 L. Ed. 2d 427 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">In order for a plea of guilty to be constitutionally valid, the record must affirmatively disclose that the defendant entered the plea voluntarily and intelligently. <em>Boykin </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>395 U.S. 238, 242, 89 S. Ct. 1709, 23 L. Ed. 2d 274 (1969); <em>State </em>v. <em>Godek, </em>182 Conn. 353, 356, 438 A.2d 114 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1031, 101 S. Ct. 1741, 68 L. Ed. 2d 226 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u201cBefore a guilty plea is accepted a defendant may withdraw it as a matter of right. Practice Book, 1978, \u00a7 720. After a guilty plea is accepted but before the imposition of sentence the court is obligated to permit withdrawal upon proof of one of the grounds in \u00a7 721. An evidentiary hearing is not required if the record of the plea proceeding and other information in the court file conclusively establishes that the motion is without merit. See <em>Fontaine </em>v. <em>United States, </em>411 U.S. 213, 215, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>93 S. Ct. 1461, 36 L. Ed. 2d 169 (1973).\u201d (Footnote omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>182 Conn. 176, 185, 438 A.2d 46 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">The burden is always on the defendant to show a plausible reason for the withdrawal of a plea of guilty. <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>173 Conn. 360, 374, 377 A.2d 1108 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>169 Conn. 38, 46, 362 A.2d 499 (1975). In considering whether to hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to withdraw a guilty plea the court may disregard any allegations of fact, whether contained in the motion or made in an offer of proof, which are either conclusory, vague or oblique. <em>State </em>v. <em>Torres, </em>supra, 185. Such allegations are discountenanced. <em>State </em>v. <em>Deboben, </em>187 Conn. 469, 474, 446 A.2d 828 (1982). To warrant consideration, the defendant must allege and provide facts which justify permitting him to withdraw his plea under \u00a7 721.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">An examination of the record of the March 10,1981 guilty plea reveals that the court personally addressed the defendant and explained to him the penalties for the crime charged. The court explained to the defendant that he had the right to confront witnesses against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>him, the right to trial and the right to avoid self-incrimination. The defendant responded affirmatively when he was asked if he understood and wished to give up these rights. The court questioned the defendant about the voluntariness of his plea. The defendant indicated that the plea was voluntary. The court further inquired as to the factual basis of the plea and the defendant admitted being part of the drug transaction. At the close of the canvass the court found that the plea was voluntary with a factual basis and thus entered a finding of guilty. These conclusions must stand unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts found. <em>Pandolphe\u2019s Auto Parts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Manchester, </em>181 Conn. 217, 221, 435 A.2d 24 (1980); see <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>supra, 45-46. Here we cannot make such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">Defense counsel, in support of his oral motion to withdraw the guilty plea, offered nothing other than the conclusory statement that the plea agreement as it appeared in the March 10 transcript was \u201csomewhat materially different\u201d than what he had explained to the defendant. The defendant was present, yet his testimony as to what defense counsel had related to him was not presented to the court. Indeed, defense counsel did not request an evidentiary hearing or make an offer of proof. The defendant\u2019s unsupported conclusory claims in light of our statements in <em>Torres </em>and <em>Deboben, </em>supra, cannot, in the presence of a facially valid plea of guilty, serve as sufficient proof to obligate the withdrawal of the defendant\u2019s plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">The question that remains is whether the defendant should now be afforded an opportunity, through a belated evidentiary hearing, to make a factual showing that he failed to understand that the sentence actually imposed would be or could be imposed. This record furnishes some basis for such an inquiry, since the colloquy at the time of the taking of the plea, on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>March 10, 1981, disclosed that the defendant\u2019s attorney and the state\u2019s attorney differed in their understanding of the terms of the plea bargain. Usually it is appropriate to infer that defense counsel, having been asked by the court to explain a proposed plea bargain to the defendant, will do so accurately. Such an inference is less plausible in this case, when no one, with the possible exception of the defendant who announced his confusion, recognized that there was a problem or took steps to alleviate it. Nor is it clear, on this record, that conclusive effect should be given to the defendant\u2019s statement, after consultation with his counsel, that he was in accord \u201cwith what the state\u2019s attorney has just finished saying.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">We reject this route for two reasons, one relating to its lack of timeliness and the other relating to the inherent problems of proof that it would generate. In order to ascertain what uncertainties existed, either objectively or subjectively, testimony would be required from at least the attorney for the defense and arguably the state\u2019s attorney as well. Such inquiries are better pursued, as we have held in cases concerning alleged inadequacy of counsel, by habeas corpus proceedings. <em>State </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>186 Conn. 574, 578-79, 442 A.2d 1335 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b272-9\"> During the March 10,1981 plea taking the following colloquy occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-10\">\u201cMr. Malone: David Lasher.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-11\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: Good morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-12\">\u201cThe Court: Good morning. This is here for what purpose today?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-13\">\u201cMr. Malone: Entry of a plea. This matter was removed from the jury list during the late 1980 session and continued for a court trial. There is a not guilty plea and election for trial to the court at the moment. Mr. Sucoll intends to enter a plea of guilty to conspiracy to sell marijuana. He\u2019ll have his client enter that plea and at the time of sentencing apply for the provisions of the drug treatment program under 19-485. It will be a felony plea and a presentence investigation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-14\">\u201cThe Court: Give me some representation in that regard.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b272-15\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: That\u2019s correct, the prior pleas may be withdrawn, Mr. Lasher will plead guilty. And my understanding is a part of that program, now the Tase program, and he will continue on that program for a period of twenty-four months. My understanding with accordance of the Statute 19-485 is any sentence imposed by the Court will be suspended during this period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cThe Court: All right did he go to plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-7\">\u201cMr. Malone: No Sir.

Is this a first offense here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AfV\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: Yes your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-19\">\u201cMr. Malone: Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-20\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: He has no previous history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-21\">\u201cThe Court: You\u2019re sure that your client is competent this morning to answer questions counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-22\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: I believe so your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-23\">\u201cThe Court: Well, all right, Mr. Lasher you\u2019ve entered a plea of guilty here to a felony and it carries a penalty of not more than seven years. And I ask you whether your plea is voluntary?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-24\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-25\">\u201cThe Court: Made of your own free will?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-26\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-27\">\u201cThe Court: Made without any promises, any inducements or any undue influence being used on you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-28\">\u201cThe Defendant: No your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-29\">\u201cThe Court: Has there been any plea bargaining in this matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-30\">\u201cMr. Sucoll: We\u2019ve discussed the matter your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b273-31\">\u201cThe Court: Has there been plea bargaining?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>\u201cMr. Malone: Well, it\u2019s our intention to recommend a sentence of not less than two and a half and not more than five years. And it\u2019s our intention not to prosecute him on the second count your Honor. And not to oppose his application for drug dependency treatment under that statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-8\">\u201cThe Court: Is that part of some sort of an agreement between counsel and the defendant here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-9\">\u201cMr. Sueoll: I would say that\u2019s accurate your Honor, yes. That he maintain or take part and complete that program which is offered by Tase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-10\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Lasher has this been conveyed to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-11\">\u201cMr. Sueoll: I told him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-12\">\u201cThe Defendant: You mean about the program?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-13\">\u201cThe Court: What we just finished talking about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-14\">\u201cThe Defendant: Yes your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-15\">\u201cThe Court: That the state has indicated what it is going to recommend at the time of sentencing, and that it will not oppose your treatment under the drug program.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-16\">\u201cThe Defendant: I don\u2019t understand your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b274-17\">\u201cThe Court: Counsel will you tell him what the agreement is.

Better practice dictates that the court should have questioned the defendant about each aspect of the state\u2019s recommendation rather than adopt the state\u2019s recommendation by reference. See Practice Book \u00a7 711.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b275-7\"> The entire colloquy as it relates to the motion to withdraw was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-8\">\u201cMr. Malone: Number thirty-eight, David Lasher.

It has come back through the transcript, Mr. Malone would in fact recommend a two to five and would not oppose the recommendation, but would not support it. And therefore I believe it somewhat materially different, which I believe to be true, which I explained to my client.
