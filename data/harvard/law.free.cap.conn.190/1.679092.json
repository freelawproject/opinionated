J.</author>\n<p id=\"AX\">The defendant, James R. Dudla, was charged by information with the crime of carrying a pistol without a permit in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 29-35.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After a trial to a jury, the defendant was found guilty as charged on March 30, 1977. The defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict, claiming, inter alia, error in the trial court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that \u201cno presumption of guilt may be raised, and no unfavorable inference may be drawn from the fact that a defendant does not see fit to testify.\u201d The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>denied the motion, and from the judgment of guilty the defendant appealed to this court. We agree with this claim of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">While the defendant\u2019s appeal was pending, the United States Supreme Court on March 9, 1981, decided <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>450 U.S. 288, 101 S. Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), holding that the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination requires a state trial court, upon request by the defendant, to caution the jury that no inference may be drawn from an accused\u2019s failure to testify.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b15-8\">It is uncontested that the trial court in this case refused to give a \u201cno inference charge\u201d which was requested by the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, had not yet been decided, however, when the defendant was tried. We therefore must decide whether, and to what extent, that decision should be applied retroactively.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b16-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>The decision in <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, answered the constitutional question \u201cspecifically anticipated and reserved . . . in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609, 615 n.6, [85 S. Ct. 1229, 14 L. Ed. 2d 106, reh. denied, 381 U.S. 957, 85 S. Ct. 1797, 14 L. Ed. 2d 730 (1965) ]....\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 295. In <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra, 615, the United States Supreme Court held that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment . . . forbids either comment by the prosecution on the accused\u2019s silence or instructions by the court that such silence is evidence of guilt,\u201d but did not rule on whether a \u201cno inference\u201d instruction must be given at the defendant\u2019s request. It is clear, however, that the constitutional basis of <em>Carter </em>is the same as that of <em>Griffin. </em>\u201cThe penalty was exacted in <em>Griffin </em>by adverse comment on the defendant\u2019s silence; the penalty may be just as severe when there is no adverse comment, but when the jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored instincts to guide it, to draw from the defendant\u2019 s silence broad inferences of guilt. . . . [T]he members of a jury, unless instructed otherwise, may well draw adverse inferences from a defendant\u2019s silence.\u201d <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, 301. Because the two cases are based on the same constitutional provision\u2014the fifth amendment guarantee against compulsory self-incrimination\u2014the question of their retrospective application should be resolved in the same way.</p>\n<p id=\"b16-7\">We applied the <em>Griffin </em>rule to a trio of cases in which appeals were pending at the time <em>Griffin </em>was announced, in accordance with the decision of the United States Supreme Court in <em>O'Connor </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>382 U.S. 286, 86 S. Ct. 445, 15 L. Ed. 2d 337 (1965). See <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>154 Conn. 41, 44, 221 A.2d 57 (1966) ; <em>State </em>v. <em>Vars, </em>154 Conn. 255, 270, 224 A.2d 744 (1966); <em>State </em>v. <em>Wilkas, </em>154 Conn. 407, 409-10, 225 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>A.2d 821 (1967). Those decisions were based largely on <em>Tehan </em>v. <em>Shott, </em>382 U.S. 406, 86 S. Ct. 459, 15 L. Ed. 2d 453, reh. denied, 383 U.S. 931, 86 S. Ct. 925, 15 L. Ed. 2d 850 (1966). In <em>State </em>v. <em>Annunziato, </em>supra, 44, we stated: <em>\u201c[Tehan </em>v. <em>Shott] </em>held that the <em>Griffin </em>rule does not require retrospective application to cases where \u2018[a]ll avenues of direct review of the . . . [defendant\u2019s] conviction . . . [had been] fully foreclosed . . . before . . . [the] decision in . . . <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra.\u2019 <em>[Tehan </em>v. <em>Shott, </em>supra,] 408. In the instant case, of course, the appeal of the defendant has just been argued, so that his case does not fall within the quoted rule of the <em>Tehan </em>case. In footnote 3 of the <em>Tehan </em>case (p. 409), it is stated that there is no \u2018question of the applicability of the <em>Griffin </em>rule to cases still pending on direct review at the time it was announced. Cf. <em>O\u2019Connor </em>v. <em>Ohio, </em>[supra].\u2019 \u201d We therefore applied the <em>Griffin </em>rule in reversing the defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b17-4\">We see no reason to treat the retroactivity of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, differently than we did that of <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>supra. The same constitutional rights and similar considerations of judicial economy are present in each case. See <em>Linkletter </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>381 U.S. 618, 636-37, 85 S. Ct. 1731, 14 L. Ed. 2d 601 (1965). We therefore hold that the rule of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>supra, is to be applied to all convictions that were not yet final<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at the time the decision was rendered.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Therefore, it was error for the trial court to refuse the requested \u201cno inference\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b18-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b18-7\">Our conclusion that there was error does not, however, necessarily mandate reversal. The state urges that the evidence of guilt was ample to support a conviction and that \u201cany error in these proceedings was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The principal evidence presented by the state was the testimony of state police officer Douglas Hanahan, who testified as follows. On October 9, 1975, at about 9 p.m., he observed the defendant illegally operating a motorcycle on route 15 in Orange. When Hanahan activated his lights and siren, the defendant did not stop immediately, but eventually pulled off the highway at a dark, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>grassy area. The defendant then reached into his jacket and removed a dark object. Hanahan feared the object was a gun, and ordered the defendant to drop it. The defendant threw the object down near where he was standing. After backup officers arrived, Hanahan searched the area where the object had been dropped, and found a .38 calibre revolver, which was later found to be operable and loaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-6\">Hanahan\u2019s testimony is the only evidence offered to link the defendant to the weapon, the possession of which is the basis of his conviction. Although the evidence presented might have been sufficient to support a conviction, this court will not presume to hold that the jury necessarily found Hanahan\u2019s testimony to be true. The jury are, of course, the sole judges of credibility of witnesses. <em>State </em>v. <em>Avcollie, </em>178 Conn. 450, 461, 423 A.2d 118 (1979), cert. denied, 444 U.S. 1015, 100 S. Ct. 667, 62 L. Ed. 2d 645 (1980). They are free to reject even uncontradicted testimony, if they do not find it credible. \u201cA trier is certainly not required to believe testimony merely because it is not directly contradicted\u201d; <em>Hills </em>v. <em>Servicemaster of Connecticut River Valley, Inc., </em>155 Conn. 214, 216-17, 230 A.2d 604 (1967); particularly in a criminal case. The jury might have doubted the uncorroborated testimony offered of the defendant\u2019s guilt, but convicted him because he did not take the stand to deny his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-7\">Because the jury might have considered the failure of the defendant to testify in determining the likelihood that the officer\u2019s testimony was true, we cannot find the trial court\u2019s failure to give a \u201cno inference\u201d charge to be harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-8\">There is error, the judgment is set aside and a new trial is ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b19-9\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b14-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes (Rev. to 1977) ] Sec. 29-35. carrying of pistol or revolver without permit restricted.

Ct. 1112, 67 L. Ed. 2d 241 (1981), applied retroactively. In that case, however, the defendant\u2019s challenge to the court\u2019s \u201cno inference\u201d instruction was primarily based on the language of General Statutes \u00a7 54-84 (b); see footnote 6, infra; which predated both <em>Carter </em>and the trial in <em>State </em>v. <em>Carrione, </em>supra. The retroactivity of <em>Carter </em>v. <em>Kentucky </em>was neither briefed nor argued in <em>Carrione.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b17-5\"> A judgment is considered final for these purposes when all avenues of direct appeal have been exhausted or when the time for filing a direct appeal has passed.

Ed. 2d 161 (1982), the court vacated the judgment in <em>Mack </em>v. <em>State, </em>641 P.2d 1122 (Okla. Crim.

In <em>United States </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>supra, 562, the Supreme Court held that \u201ca decision of this Court construing the Fourth Amendment is to be applied retroactively to all convictions that were not yet final at the time the decision was rendered.\u201d The clear implication of the remand in <em>Mack </em>is that the court expects similar retroactivity to be allowed in Fifth Amendment cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b18-12\">States other than Oklahoma have applied <em>Carter </em>retroactively to cases pending on appeal when <em>Carter </em>was announced. <em>People </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>632 P.2d 626 (Colo.

Section 54-84 (b) states: \u201cUnless the accused requests otherwise, the court shall instruct the jury that they may draw no unfavorable inferences from the accused\u2019s failure to testify.
