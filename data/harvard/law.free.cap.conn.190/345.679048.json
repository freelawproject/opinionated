The plaintiff wife filed an amended complaint alleging that the marriage had broken down irretrievably and seeking a decree of dissolution, custody of a minor child, support for said minor child, alimony, attorney\u2019s fees, and property division.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-9\">After an evidentiary hearing, the court rendered an oral decision dissolving the marriage and granting custody of the minor child to the plaintiff. The court ordered the defendant to pay one dollar per year in alimony and $325 per week in child support. In addition, the defendant was ordered to transfer his interest in the jointly owned home to the plaintiff, subject to \u201ca constructive trust in favor of Mr. Brown to the extent of fifteen percent of the net sale price of this house in the event she sells it or if she remarries, the net appraised value of the house.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In post-judgment proceedings, the trial court, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 3065, dissolved the stay of execution pending appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>to the extent of $275 per week for support and ordered the defendant to pay to the plaintiff the sum of $2000 to defend the appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">In his appeal the defendant claims that the court erred in (1) making the award of support (a) without considering the statutory criteria in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 46b-56 and 46b-84<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (b) in an amount far in excess <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>of the child\u2019s needs; (2) imposing a constructive trust on the real estate in favor of the defendant; and (3) awarding counsel fees of $2000 to defend the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">There is no dispute as to the facts stated in the financial affidavits submitted by both parties. The defendant had a gross weekly salary of $755, which was reduced to a net salary of $511.90 after payment of withholding and social security taxes plus union dues. The equity in the jointly owned home was approximately $50,000. The plaintiff in her affidavit stated that her weekly expenses for her household totaled'$340.23. At the time of trial the \u201chousehold\u201d included the plaintiff, her minor son and her daughter, who was over eighteen years of age.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In addition to the order of $325 per week for child support, the defendant was ordered to maintain Blue Cross and Blue Shield coverage for the minor son and to pay one-half of unreimbursed medical expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">\u201cTo determine the amount of support required by minor children, the court considers the needs of the children and the respective abilities of the parents to maintain them.\u201d <em>Whitney </em>v. <em>Whitney, </em>171 Conn. 23, 29, 368 A.2d 96 (1976). It is obvious that the child sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>port award was grossly disproportionate to the child\u2019s needs. Clearly, the costs of the household attributable to the support of the plaintiff and her adult daughter exceeded the $15.23 per week difference between the court\u2019s support award and the plaintiff\u2019s household financial needs. Child support orders must be based on the statutory criteria enumerated in General Statutes \u00a7 46b-84 of which one of the most important is the needs of the child. The support award may not be used to disguise alimony awards to the custodial parent. We hold that the trial court could not reasonably conclude that $325 per week was required for the minor child\u2019s support. <em>Pasquariello </em>v. <em>Pasquariello, </em>168 Conn. 579, 584, 362 A.2d 835 (1975). The award, therefore, was made in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">The trial court also was in error in imposing a constructive trust in favor of the defendant on the jointly owned home. \u201cA constructive trust arises where a person who holds title to property is subject to an equitable duty to convey it to another on the ground that he would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain it.\u201d 5 Scott on Trusts (3d Ed.) \u00a7 462, p. 3413. \u201cIt is not a trust in which the trustee is to have duties of administration lasting for an appreciable period of time, but rather a passive, temporary trust, in which the trustee\u2019s sole duty is to transfer the <em>title and possession </em>to the beneficiary.\u2019\u201d (Emphasis added.) Bogert, Law of Trusts (5th Ed.) \u00a7 77, p. 288.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">The trial court did not intend that if the plaintiff remarried or attempted to sell the house that title and possession of the house would vest in the defendant. The record indicates that it was the intent of the court that the defendant retain a beneficial interest in 15 percent of the value of the house, which would vest on the occurrence of either of the two contingencies. A constructive trust is not ordinarily established in a por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>tion of an indivisible asset. In this case, this \u201cconstructive trustee\u201d was placed under a duty to convey whatever title she has, not some portion of that title.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Our finding of error is not to be construed, however, as an indication that the court was without power to fashion the remedy which it contemplated. We hold only that a constructive trust was not the correct vehicle to accomplish that end. For example, the court could have granted a second mortgage on the property to the defendant. This action would have given the defendant a security interest in the property, which was the apparent intent of the trial court.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">The defendant\u2019s claim that the award of counsel fees to the plaintiff to defend the appeal was an abuse of discretion is not properly before us. Practice Book \u00a7 3062 states in part: \u201cShould the trial court, subsequent to the filing of the appeal, make a ruling which the appellant desires to have reviewed by the supreme court, the appellant <em>shall </em>amend his appeal . . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although the defendant did file an amended preliminary statement of issues, he did not amend the appeal as required by \u00a7 3096. \u201cThe right to an appeal is not a constitutional one. It is but a statutory privilege available to one who strictly complies with the statutes and rules on which the privilege is granted.\u201d <em>Chanosky v. City Building Supply Co., </em>152 Conn. 449, 451, 208 A.2d 337 (1965). Because the defendant did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>not comply with the mandate of \u00a7 3062, we will not consider his claim concerning attorney\u2019s fees. <em>Costello </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>186 Conn. 773, 778-79, 443 A.2d 1282 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">There is error; the judgment is set aside as to alimony, child support and division of property, and the case is remanded for a trial on the questions of alimony, child support and division of property in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b358-10\"> The court also issued other orders dividing the parties\u2019 jointly held personal property. These orders are not challenged on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b359-7\"> It is unclear whether this order, issued from the bench, reduced the judgment to $275 in support, or whether it only dissolved the stay to a limited extent. In view of our decision on the merits of the appeal, we need not resolve the ambiguity of the order.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b359-8\"> \u201c[General Statutes] Sec. 46b-56.
