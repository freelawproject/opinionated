J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFI\">This appeal by the plaintiff concerns the dismissal of the plaintiff\u2019s action by the trial court on the ground of lack of jurisdiction over an out of state defendant. The plaintiff, Standard Tallow Corporation, is a New Jersey corporation, authorized to do business in this state. The defendants, James Jowdy and Bahij Halaby,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were personal guarantors of a series of twelve promissory notes issued by Economat Supermarkets, Inc., a foreign corporation, and payable at a bank in New York. When Economat Supermarkets, Inc., defaulted on the notes, the plaintiff elected to exercise an acceleration clause therein and brought this action to collect the amount due from the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">The plaintiff obtained an order of prejudgment remedy from the court, <em>N. O\u2019Neill, J., </em>and real estate located in Danbury belonging to the defendant Halaby was attached by a deputy sheriff on February 25,1980. Notice by mail was sent to Halaby in New York State pursuant to an order of notice dated April 11, 1980. Halaby did own the real property attached, which was unrelated to the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action, but he was not a Connecticut resident when the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>On May 7, 1980, Halaby filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the attachment of real property owned by him was not sufficient to support the jurisdiction of the court over him. On June 10, 1980, the plaintiff filed a motion to postpone the hearing on Halaby\u2019s motion until fourteen days after Halaby complied with the plaintiff\u2019s discovery request, which was to be filed in the future. On June 13,1980, the plaintiff filed a ten page request for disclosure and production of documents directed to establishing facts upon which jurisdiction could be shown. Thereafter, on June 20, 1980, Halaby filed an objection to the plaintiff\u2019s motion to postpone. Arguments on both the motion to dismiss and the motion to postpone were heard on July 1,1980 by the court, <em>Moraghan, J. </em>At that time, the trial court refused the plaintiff\u2019s request for a trial-like hearing, but it did accept into evidence certain documents indicating Halaby\u2019s ownership of real estate and also indicating his ownership in 1976 of a business in Connecticut. The court orally denied the motion to postpone the hearing, thereby in effect denying the plaintiff\u2019s request for disclosure and production. By an order and memorandum of decision filed October 20, 1980, the court found that the plaintiff had based its assertion of jurisdiction solely on Halaby\u2019s ownership of real property located in Connecticut, that the plaintiff had the burden of proving jurisdiction, and that \u201cthe attachment of real property, without more, is insufficient to satisfy the minimum contacts standard required by <em>Shaffer </em>[v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977) ]\u201d for the assertion of quasi in rem jurisdiction. It therefore granted Halaby\u2019s motion to dismiss and to dissolve the prejudgment attachment of the defendant\u2019s property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The plaintiff appealed the dismissal to this court claiming that the court erred (1) by placing the burden on it to prove jurisdiction; (2) by denying it a trial-like hearing to determine contested issues of fact; (3) by refusing to postpone any hearing on the jurisdictional issue until the plaintiff could obtain discovery of facts to determine the extent of Halaby\u2019s contacts with the state of Connecticut; and (4) by finding that Halaby had insufficient contacts with Connecticut to justify the exercise of quasi in rem jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">We conclude that the trial court correctly placed the burden of proving jurisdiction on the plaintiff as the party alleging quasi in rem jurisdiction, but that it erred in denying the plaintiff a trial-like hearing and in denying a continuance of the hearing to permit discovery on the issue of jurisdiction. Because the plaintiff was prohibited from developing a factual record on the question of Halaby\u2019s actual contacts in the trial court, it would be premature at this time to address the question of whether Halaby\u2019s contacts are sufficient for the court to assert quasi in rem jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Burden of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">The plaintiff\u2019s first claim is that the burden of proof should be on a defendant who files a motion to dismiss thereby contesting the court\u2019s jurisdiction over him, rather than on the plaintiff who asks the court to assume jurisdiction. \u201c[A]ll assertions of state-court jurisdiction must be evaluated according to the standards set forth in <em>International Shoe </em>[Co. v. <em>Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 66 S. Ct. 154, 90 L. Ed. 95 (1945) ] and its progeny.\u201d <em>Shaffer </em>v. <em>Heitner, </em>433 U.S. 186, 212, 97 S. Ct. 2569, 53 L. Ed. 2d 683 (1977); see <em>Hodge </em>v. <em>Hodge, </em>178 Conn. 308, 318, 422 A.2d 280 (1979). Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>standards, as set out in <em>International Shoe, </em>require that \u201cin order to subject a defendant to a judgment <em>in personam, </em>if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, 316.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Whether sufficient minimum contacts exist for a court to have jurisdiction is clearly dependent on the facts of each particular case. \u201cLike any standard that requires a determination of \u2018reasonableness,\u2019 the \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 test of <em>International Shoe </em>is not susceptible of mechanical application; rather, the facts of each case must be weighed to determine whether the requisite \u2018affiliating circumstances\u2019 are present. <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>357 U.S. 235, 246 [78 S. Ct. 1228, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1283] (1958).\u201d <em>Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, </em>436 U.S. 84, 92, 98 S. Ct. 1690, 56 L. Ed. 2d 132, reh. denied, 438 U.S. 908, 98 S. Ct. 3127, 57 L. Ed. 2d 1150 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">In many cases jurisdiction is immediately evident, as where the sheriff\u2019s return shows abode service in Connecticut. When, however, the jurisdictional basis is not clear on the face of the record<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> because service is had under the long-arm statutes,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> additional facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>establishing the \u201cminimum contacts\u201d required by due process may need to be shown. It has not been the practice in this state to require these minimum contacts to be made a part of the allegations in the complaint. Because a lack of personal jurisdiction may be waived by the defendant,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the rules of practice require the defendant to challenge that jurisdiction by a motion to dismiss. Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 142, 143 (2), 144. If the defendant challenges the court\u2019s jurisdiction, it is then incumbent on the plaintiff to prove the facts establishing the requisite minimum contacts.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u201cThe general rule putting the burden of proof on the defendant as to jurisdictional issues raised is based on the presumption of the truth of the matters stated in the officer\u2019s return. When jurisdiction is based on personal or abode service, the matters stated in the return, if true, confer jurisdiction. When jurisdiction is based on constructive service, jurisdiction cannot arise solely from the acts recited in the return. There should be no presumption of the truth of the plaintiff\u2019s allegation of the additional facts necessary to confer jurisdiction.\u201d 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed.) \u00a7 96, p. 390. Placing the burden on the plaintiff to prove contested factual issues pertaining to jurisdiction is in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>accord with rulings in other states which have addressed the same question. See <em>Chavez </em>v. <em>Indiana, </em>122 Ariz. App. 560, 596 P.2d 698 (1979); <em>Pace Carpet Mills </em>v. <em>Life Carpet &amp; Tile Co., </em>365 So. 2d 445 (Fla. App. 1978); <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>11 Ill. 2d 378, 143 N.E.2d 673 (1957); <em>Mergenthaler Linotype </em>v. <em>Storch Enterprises, </em>66 Ill. App. 3d 789, 383 N.E.2d 1379 (1978); <em>Krupnick </em>v. <em>Danin, </em>86 App. Div. 2d 623, 446 N.Y.S.2d 357 (1982); <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>Seawright, </em>104 Wis. 2d 4, 310 N.W.2d 596 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"AvC\">This court has recognized that the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to prove jurisdiction over the person when constructive service is used. In <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>180 Conn. 223, 429 A.2d 478 (1980), the defendant, a New York resident, allegedly was served via a person alleged to be his agent in Connecticut, but was never personally served. He \u201cmoved to dismiss the complaint against him, alleging lack of personal jurisdiction over him. When this motion was heard, the plaintiff requested and received a continuance <em>to enable it to make an appropriate evidentiary showing.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id., 224. When a motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction raises a factual question which is not determinable from the face of the record, the burden of proof is on the plaintiff to present evidence which will establish jurisdiction. The trial court correctly placed this burden on the plaintiff.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">Trial-like hearing; Discovery</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The plaintiff next claims that the trial court erred by denying it a trial-like hearing on the question of jurisdiction. It further claims that the court erred by denying it an opportunity to obtain discovery from Halaby before a hearing was held.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-7\">The trial court denied without comment the plaintiffs motion to postpone the hearing on Halaby\u2019s motion to dismiss, and it proceeded immediately to hear argument on the motion to dismiss. The trial court in effect ruled that an evidentiary hearing was necessary when it recognized that the minimum contacts test of <em>International Shoe Co. </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>supra, should apply to the determination of jurisdiction and stated in its memorandum of decision that \u201cthe inquiry must focus on \u2018the relationship among the defendant, the forum and the litigation.\u2019 <em>Shaffer </em>[v. Heitner], supra, 204; <em>Rush </em>[v. <em>Savchuk, </em>444 U.S. 320, 327, 100 S. Ct. 571, 62 L. Ed. 2d 516 (1980) ].\u201d The trial court did accept into evidence five documents offered by the plaintiff to show contacts between Halaby and Connecticut, but this was only after the motion to postpone was denied and the plaintiff had properly excepted to the ruling, claiming that it must be permitted to develop evidence on the question of jurisdiction. It is unclear whether the court considered that accepting the five documents was the equivalent of an evidentiary hearing. No mention of the documents is made in the court\u2019s memorandum of decision, which was decided solely on the legal question of whether the defendant\u2019s ownership of real property alone was enough to meet due process requirements for asserting jurisdiction over him.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>A</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">DENIAL OF AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">As stated above, a determination of whether sufficient minimum contacts with Connecticut exist is a fact question. <em>Kulko </em>v. <em>California Superior Court, </em>supra; <em>Hanson </em>v. <em>Denckla, </em>supra. \u201cA motion to dismiss may . . . raise issues of fact and would, therefore, require a . . . hearing [to determine the facts]. . . . [Affidavits are insufficient to determine the facts unless, like the summary judgment, they disclose that no genuine issue as to a material fact exists.\u201d 1 Stephenson, Conn. Civ. Proc. (2d Ed. 1982 Sup.) \u00a7 108d p. S 73. \u201c \u2018In almost every setting where important decisions turn on questions of fact, due process requires an opportunity to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.\u2019 <em>Goldberg </em>v. <em>Kelly </em>[397 U.S. 254, 269, 90 S. Ct. 1011, 25 L. Ed. 2d 287 (1970) ].\u201d <em>Society for Savings </em>v. <em>Chestnut Estates, Inc., </em>176 Conn. 563, 574, 409 A.2d 1020 (1979). When issues of fact are necessary to the determination of a court\u2019s jurisdiction, due process requires that a trial-like hearing be held, in which an opportunity is provided to present evidence and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. The trial court erred in not holding such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">B-</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">DENIAL OF DISCOVERY</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">The plaintiff also claims that the trial court abused its discretion by denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion'to postpone the hearing in order to give the plaintiff an opportunity for discovery in its attempt to prove the requisite minimum contacts between Halaby and Connecticut. The effect of the court\u2019s action was to preclude any meaningful evidentiary hearing on the jurisdictional issue. As previously stated, such an evidentiary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>hearing was required. The denial of the plaintiffs motion for a continuance in effect denied discovery to the plaintiff on an issue which the court clearly recognized as requiring a resolution of contested fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u201cIn any civil action . . . where the court finds it reasonably probable that evidence outside the record will be required, a party may obtain . . . discovery of information or disclosure, production and inspection of papers, books or documents material to the subject matter involved in the pending action . . . and which are within the knowledge, possession or power of the party or person to whom the discovery is addressed. Discovery shall be permitted if the disclosure sought would be of assistance in the prosecution or defense of the action and if it can be provided by the disclosing party or person with substantially greater facility than it could otherwise be obtained by the party seeking disclosure. . . .\u201d Practice Book \u00a7 218. Although \u00a7 218 speaks in terms of \u201cany civil action\u201d and of \u201cthe prosecution or defense of the action,\u201d it is clear that discovery may be had to establish facts pertaining to personal jurisdiction. <em>Chrysler Credit Corporation </em>v. <em>Fairfield Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>supra.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">The granting or denial of a discovery request rests in the sound discretion of the court. <em>Kiessling </em>v. <em>Kiessling, </em>134 Conn. 564, 568, 59 A.2d 532 (1948). That <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>discretion is limited, however, by the provisions of the rules pertaining to discovery; Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 217-221;<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> especially the mandatory provision that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>discovery <em>\u201cshall </em>be permitted if the disclosure sought would be of assistance in the prosecution or defense of the action. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Practice Book \u00a7 218. The court\u2019s discretion applies to decisions concerning whether the information is material, privileged, substantially more available to the disclosing party, or within the disclosing party\u2019s knowledge, possession or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>power, as stated in \u00a7 218. A complete denial of discovery, however, is seldom within the court\u2019s discretion unless the court finds that one or more of the limitations on discovery expressed above applies. Denial of a motion to postpone a hearing may, as here, effectively preclude any discovery. When discovery is warranted under the principles discussed above, such a denial is an abuse of discretion. <em>Plouffe </em>v. <em>New York, N.H. &amp; H. R. Co., </em>160 Conn. 482, 490-91, 280 A.2d 359 (1971). Here, where the trial court had already recognized that a factual presentation was necessary, it was an abuse of discretion to deny the plaintiff any opportunity for discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">There is error, the judgment dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s action and dissolving the attachment of Halaby\u2019s property is set aside and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b61-9\"> Although both defendants were served and both filed appearances, only Halaby is concerned in the issues on this appeal; only he appeared before this court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b62-4\"> Although there is no judgment file in this case, the trial court did file an order granting Halaby\u2019s motion to dismiss the action and to dissolve the attachment.

That case, however, was decided at a time when the application of the minimum contacts test to assertions of quasi in rem jurisdiction was still in doubt. See, e.g., <em>Pennoyer </em>v. <em>Neff, </em>95 U.S. 714, 24 L. Ed. 565 (1878); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Balk, </em>198 U.S. 215, 25 S. Ct. 625, 49 L.
