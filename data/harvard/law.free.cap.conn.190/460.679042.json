The plaintiffs, John Patry and others, taxpayers and employees of the first fire taxation district of the city of West Haven with an interest in the \u201cFiremen\u2019s Pension Fund,\u201d brought an action to enjoin the defendant, Board of Trustees, Firemen\u2019s Pension Fund of West Haven, Connecticut, from using the pension fund to pay a retirement pension to Joseph C. Howell, and for a declaratory judgment to determine whether the action of the trustees in granting Joseph C. Howell a pension was valid. After a hearing before the court,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the defendant was permanently enjoined from paying the pension as presently formulated, and the action of the defendant in for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>mulating the pension was declared invalid, null and void. After the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue and to set aside the judgment was denied, the defendant appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">There is no dispute about the underlying facts. Joseph C. Howell, after thirty-one years of service, decided to retire as chief of the fire department of the first taxation district of West Haven. At Chief Howell\u2019s request, the defendant board of trustees of the firemen\u2019s pension fund met to act on his retirement and to determine the amount of his pension. The board approved his retirement and set the pension at 70 percent of his former salary. The 70 percent figure was opposed by a representative of the firefighters\u2019 union who claimed that the percentage was not authorized by the home rule ordinance of West Haven.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In determining the percentage figure, the board relied on the wording of \u00a7 5 (a) of the home rule ordinance adopted by the city on November 6,1973. The home rule ordinance provides, in relevant part, for disbursements from the firemen\u2019s pension fund as follows: \u201c(a) When any full-time employee of said district has served as such for a period of at least twenty-five years, the board of trustees shall, on his application in writing, retire such employee and pay him an annual pension in monthly installments during his life time of an amount equal to not less than one-half of the annual salary received by such employee preceding his retirement. In addition thereto any such employee who has served more than twenty-five years shall receive an additional two percent of his salary received preceding his retirement for each year over twenty-five, but in no event shall his pension exceed seventy percent of such salary.\u201d The board, in setting the Howell pension, took into account the following considerations: (1) the nature of the responsibilities borne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>by the chief of the department by virtue of his position; (2) the length of his service in the department and the nature of his service, which necessitated long workdays without overtime compensation; (3) the retirement of a prior chief of the department, under prior legislation, at 70 percent of his salary. The board took the view, according to testimony at the trial court hearing, that once someone had served for twenty-five years, the board had discretion to fix a pension at some percentage between the minimum of 50 percent and the maximum of 70 percent. Although the 70 percent figure might have been rationalized by selecting a base figure of 58 percent for the first twenty-five years of service and then adding 2 percent for each of the additional six years, or an additional 12 percent, that was not the basis upon which the board proceeded.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The trial court enjoined the defendant board from paying Howell the pension as it had been formulated. The court determined that the ordinance plainly limited additions to the base percentage to 2 additional percent of salary for each year\u2019s service over twenty-five. The court further held that the ordinance conferred no discretion upon the defendant to modify its statutory provisions, since such a grant of discretionary authority would have required explicit statutory language. In a motion to reargue, the defendant challenged both the substance and the form of the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">The defendant raises on this appeal the same issues that were presented to the trial court in the motion to reargue. The defendant claims that the trial court erred: (1) in construing the language of the home rule ordinance to preclude a 70 percent pension for retiring Chief Joseph C. Howell and (2) in enjoining the defendant from payment of said pension rather than remanding the matter for further action by the board of trustees. We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>Since the propriety of the action taken by the defendant necessarily turns on construction of \u00a7 5 (a) of the West Haven Home Rule Ordinance, it is helpful to review the history of the ordinance. Although there is apparently no discoverable history of the discussions that led to its approval, and therefore no legislative history as that term is normally understood, it is possible to trace the history of the ordinance through the legislative acts which preceded it. Starting in 1937, the General Assembly enacted a number of special acts concerning pensions for members of the fire department of the first taxation district of West Haven. The first of these special acts provided, for any member of the fire department who had contributed to a \u201cfiremen\u2019s relief fund,\u201d a pension \u201cequal to one-half of his regular monthly pay.\u201d 22 Spec. Acts 797, No. 399, \u00a7 5 (1937).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>This act was amended in 1967 to establish a pension fund similar in form to that of the present ordinance. The 1967 special act entitled a fireman, after twenty-five years of service, to a pension \u201cof at least one-half of his annual salary\u201d and \u201c[i]n addition thereto . . . [allowed him to] receive an additional two per cent of his basic salary . . . for each year over and above the said twenty-five years of service, but in no event shall his pension exceed seventy percent of his basic salary at the time of his retirement.\u201d 33 Spec. Acts 137, No. 144, \u00a7 1 (1967).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This act was amended in 1969 in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>variety of ways but with an express reservation that the amendment was not to affect \u201cinterests of any past or present fire department employee in any pension fund.\u201d 34 Spec. Acts 79, No. 100, \u00a7 6 (1969). The home rule ordinance that we must construe was approved in 1973. It continues the basic plan of the 1967 special act, but introduces a linguistic substitution of \u201cnot less than\u201d for \u201cat least\u201d in the description of the basic twenty-five year pension.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">This history provides support for some of the defendant\u2019s claims, but not for all of them. We conclude, as the defendant argues, that the present ordinance, when it authorizes a pension of \u201cnot less than one-half\u201d of a retiree\u2019s annual salary counsels a disposition that is the same as if the ordinance had read \u201cat least one-half.\u201d See <em>Treat </em>v. <em>Town Plan &amp; Zoning Commission, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>145 Conn. 136, 139, 139 A.2d 601 (1958). We are, however, unpersuaded that this conclusion requires us to hold that the ordinance confers discretion on the board of trustees to award a pension in any amount between 50 and 70 percent. Reading the ordinance as a whole, we construe its reference to \u201cnot less than\u201d as authorizing a payment of a pension beyond the amount of 50 percent of a retiree\u2019s annual salary only when an additional pension is earned by additional years of service. Nothing in the ordinance, textually or historically, confers upon the board the authority to consider the quality of the retiree\u2019s service or to provide the present retiree a pension comparable to that paid to former retirees who may or may not have been similarly situated.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">The defendant, while recognizing that the home rule ordinance does not expressly confer discretionary authority on the board, claims that the ordinance should be read to imply such authority. It argues that discretion for the board may be inferred from the combination of phraseology in \u00a7 5 that allows the board to set the pension at \u201cnot less than one-half\u201d and \u201cin no event . . . [to] exceed seventy percent.\u201d If we assume that the \u201cnot less than\u201d figure may be set at more than 50 percent, say at 58, then the addition of 12 percent for Chief Howell\u2019s six years of additional service would bring him to the 70 percent level. Even if we were to assume arguendo that the ordinance could reasonably be interpreted to confer this degree of discretion on the board, it is clear on the present record that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>board exercised no such discretion, for the testimony at the trial expressly disclaimed reliance on such a formula. In the alternative, the defendant relies on other provisions of the home rule ordinance which authorize the board of trustees \u201cto make all rules and regulations for the control and deposit of [the pension] fund.\u201d This reliance on Chapter 5, \u00a7 4, proves both too little and too much. On the one hand, the provisions of \u00a7 4, because they deal with general authority over \u201ccontrol and deposit,\u201d must, in case of conflict, give way to the more specific provisions of \u00a7 5 that expressly govern \u201cdisbursements from [the pension] fund.\u201d Accepted rules of construction assign precedence to provisions of special applicability over those of general applicability. <em>Budkofsky </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, </em>177 Conn. 588, 592, 419 A.2d 333 (1979); <em>Meriden </em>v. <em>Board of Tax Review, </em>161 Conn. 396, 401-402, 288 A.2d 435 (1971). On the other hand, the provisions of \u00a7 4 demonstrate that the drafters of the ordinance knew how to select language that would unequivocally confer discretion. Comparison of the broad powers conferred by \u00a7 4 with the narrow powers conferred by \u00a7 5 is indicative of an intent not to vest the board with discretion to determine the amount of pension funds to be paid to a retiree.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">The defendant\u2019s final argument suggests that the designation of the defendant as the administrative agency responsible for disbursement of the pension fund necessarily confers upon it discretionary authority to implement the provisions of the home rule ordinance in a manner consistent with its view of underlying policy. The defendant relies on cases such as <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 440-42, 423 A.2d 87 (1979), where we held that a commission, acting in a quasi-judicial capacity to determine whether a claimant had sustained a service-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>connected injury, had the right to exercise discretion to approve or disapprove applications for retirement benefits. <em>Riley </em>does not, however, stand for the proposition that a statute impliedly confers unfettered discretion upon an administrative agency by the mere act of entrusting the agency with the authority for disbursement of pension funds. Our case law, to the contrary, has consistently held that delegation of discretionary authority is valid only when premised upon a positive statutory basis supported by sufficient statutory guidelines. When the assertion of such discretionary authority conflicts with specific legislative mandates expressly providing a different result, the purported exercise of discretion is invalid. <em>Wadhams </em>v. <em>Torrington, </em>152 Conn. 454, 457-58, 208 A.2d 549 (1965); <em>Wilson v. West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 656-57, 116 A.2d 420 (1955); see generally <em>South East Property Owners &amp; Residents Assn. </em>v. <em>City Plan Commission, </em>156 Conn. 587, 590-91, 244 A.2d 394 (1968); <em>State ex rel. Huntington </em>v. <em>McNulty, </em>151 Conn. 447, 449, 199 A.2d 5 (1964). Courts in other jurisdictions have also refused to read enabling legislation to confer unlimited discretion on administrators of public pension funds. See, e.g., <em>Bergman </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees of Firemen\u2019s Retirement System, </em>425 S.W.2d 143, 146-47 (Mo. 1968); <em>Breen </em>v. <em>Board of Trustees, </em>299 N.Y. 8, 19, 85 N.E.2d 161 (1949); <em>State ex rel. Henderson </em>v. <em>Schuele, </em>25 Ohio St. 2d 179, 182, 267 N.E.2d 590 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">It is useful, finally, to consider the consequences that would ensue if we were to adopt the defendant\u2019s construction of the pension ordinance. It is undisputed that \u00a7 5 establishes a floor, retirement at half pay at age sixty-five after twenty-five years of service, and a ceiling, retirement at 70 percent of pay. It also establishes a pension ladder, with each rung representing an additional 2 percent of pay for each year of service past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>twenty-five years. The defendant\u2019s construction of these provisions would give the pension board the unfettered discretion to establish the floor at any rung of the ladder or even, as in the present case, to make it coincident with the ceiling. So construed, the ordinance violates the rule that an enactment conferring legislative power upon an administrative agency must not only declare legislative policy, but also establish primary standards for carrying out the policy or .lay down an intelligible principle to which the administrative body must conform. <em>New Milford </em>v. <em>SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 149, 384 A.2d 337 (1977); <em>State </em>v. <em>Stoddard, </em>126 Conn. 623, 628, 13 A.2d 586 (1940). The implications of such a confrontation are clear. Even if, arguendo, a literal reading of \u00a7 5 would confer unfettered discretionary authority upon the defendant, such a literal reading would have to be abandoned. \u201cWe are bound to assume that the legislature intended, in enacting a particular law, to achieve its purpose in a manner which is both effective and constitutional. <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Connecticut Personnel Appeal Board, </em>170 Conn. 668, 674, 368 A.2d 20 (1976); <em>Whitfield </em>v. <em>Empire Mutual Ins. Co., </em>167 Conn. 499, 507-508, 356 A.2d 139 (1975); <em>Amsel </em>v. <em>Brooks, </em>141 Conn. 288, 295, 106 A.2d 152, appeal dismissed, 348 U.S. 880, 75 S. Ct. 125, 99 L. Ed. 693 (1954).\u201d <em>Moscone </em>v. <em>Manson, </em>185 Conn. 124, 128, 440 A.2d 848 (1981). In determining the appropriate sphere of administrative authority, \u201ca truly helpful rule in the search for . . . legislative intent . . . is that where one construction will sustain the validity of an act while another will not do so, a court is justified in adopting the former even at the expense of departing from the literal meaning of the words used.\u201d <em>Wilson v. West Haven, </em>supra, 654-55. We therefore do not accept the defendant\u2019s construction of the pension ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Having concluded that the trial court correctly determined that the defendant board had exceeded its authority by awarding Chief Howell a 70 percent pension, we must now determine whether the trial court erred in its order permanently enjoining the defendant from paying him such a pension. The defendant urges that this order was inappropriate for two reasons: (1) the proper remedy was to remand the matter to the defendant for reformulation of the pension payment and (2) the plaintiffs failed to show such irreparable injury as was required to sustain the injunction. We disagree with both of these claims of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">With respect to the entry of an injunctive order in lieu of a remand, the defendant might have a stronger case if the trial court had issued a blanket injunction forbidding any pension payment whatsoever to Chief Howell. That, however, is not the tenor of the judgment. The court\u2019s injunction against payment of funds was carefully limited to preclude only \u201cthe payment of any funds for any purpose under the provisions of or related to the pension of Joseph C. Howell <em>as presently formulated.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) In light of the court\u2019s conclusions of law, such an order was clearly warranted. It in no way precluded the defendant from reconvening, at any time, to formulate a pension plan within the bounds set by the pension ordinance.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">The defendant\u2019s attack on the order because of a claimed lack of a showing of \u201cirreparable harm\u201d is equally groundless. In part, this argument simply restates the proposition, which we have rejected, that injunctive relief was unauthorized because the defendant had discretion to award the 70 percent pension. For the rest, the argument that the trial court failed to re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>quire the plaintiffs to meet their evidentiary burden of proving irreparable harm comes too late. The record discloses that no issue with regard to irreparable harm was raised either during the hearing before the trial court or in the defendant\u2019s motion to reargue and set aside the judgment. Even if we were to consider this claim despite its lack of timeliness, we would be hard pressed to find error in the trial court\u2019s conclusion that those who have an interest in a pension fund are necessarily irreparably damaged by improper disbursements of fund assets. \u201cWhether damages are to be viewed by a court of equity as \u2018irreparable\u2019 or not depends more upon the nature of the right which is injuriously affected than upon the pecuniary measure of the loss suffered.\u201d <em>Robertson </em>v. <em>Lewie, </em>77 Conn. 345, 346, 59 A. 409 (1904).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">In this opinion Healey, Parskey and Bieluch, Js., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b473-9\"> At the hearing, the parties stipulated that the case would be decided on its merits rather than as a special hearing on the plaintiffs\u2019 application for a temporary injunction.

In its construction of \u00a7 5 (a), the majority effectively reads the \u201cnot less than\u201d phrase out of the ordinance by rendering it superfluous and of no force.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">Moreover, although it is true that ambiguous phrases should not be considered in isolation but in the context of the statute as a whole; <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>King, </em>169 Conn. 140, 144, 363 A.2d 68 (1975); I discern nothing in the language of \u00a7 5 (a) which justifies the conclusion that \u201cnot less than one-half\u201d means <em>exactly </em>one-half. Indeed, in my view, the construction of \u201cnot less than one-half\u201d according to its \u201ccommonly accepted meaning\u201d; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>supra, 326; General Statutes \u00a7 1-1 (a); compels the conclusion that while the pension awarded <em>must </em>be one-half of the preretirement salary, it <em>may </em>be higher. There is ample support for the proposition that the phrases \u201cat least\u201d or \u201cnot less than,\u201d while mandating a minimum, do not establish a maximum as well. See, e.g., <em>Turley </em>v. <em>Bolin, </em>27 Ariz. App. 345, 348-50, 554 P.2d 1288 (1976) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>(the phrase petitions \u201cshall be filed . . . not less than four months preceding the date of election\u201d reserves a minimum filing deadline and implies the right to file at any time prior to four months); <em>Peters </em>v. <em>Fenner, </em>294 Minn. 488, 489, 199 N.W.2d 795 (1972) (where contract contained language requiring buyer to make monthly payments of \u201cnot less than $223.84,\u201d \u201cnot less than\u201d confers on purchaser an unqualified right to prepay entire amount in any month); <em>People </em>v. <em>Jackson, </em>27 App. Div. 2d 943, 279 N.Y.S.2d 259 (1967) (\u201cnot less than\u201d not to be construed as equivalent to \u201cnot more than\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">I also cannot agree with the majority that such a construction of \u201cnot less than\u201d would confer \u201cunfettered\u201d or \u201cunlimited\u201d discretion upon the board. In this regard it is helpful to note, first, the mandatory language contained within \u00a7 5 (a). The section provides that the board (1) <em>shall </em>pay retirees with at least twenty-five years of service an amount equal to not less than one-half of their preretirement salary; (2) <em>shall </em>pay such retirees an additional 2 percent of their salary for each year over twenty-five; (3) but in no event <em>shall </em>the pension awarded exceed 70 percent of an employee\u2019s preretirement salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">We have consistently held that the use of the word \u201cshall\u201d in a statutory context ordinarily connotes a duty the character of which is mandatory and not permissive. Burwell <em>v. Board of Selectmen, </em>178 Conn. 509, 517, 423 A.2d 156 (1979); <em>Morris </em>v. <em>Timenterial, Inc., </em>168 Conn. 41, 43, 357 A.2d 507 (1975). The board, therefore, <em>must </em>pay a twenty-five year retiree 50 percent of his salary, <em>must </em>provide an additional 2 percent for each year over twenty-five, and <em>must not </em>award a pension which exceeds 70 percent of the employee\u2019s salary. I do not read the majority opinion to hold otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>In light of these mandatory directives, I cannot agree that \u00a7 5 (a) confers \u201cunfettered\u201d discretion upon the board. Under no circumstances may the board award a pension in any amount below 50 percent or above 70 percent of a retiree\u2019s salary. As a retiree\u2019s length of service extends beyond twenty-five years, the board\u2019s discretion becomes correspondingly narrower until it disappears altogether regarding employees with thirty-five or more years of full-time service. In the present case, for example, it cannot be disputed that pursuant to the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 5 (a), Chief Howell is entitled to a pension of 62 percent of his former salary. The degree of discretion vested in the board, therefore, is limited to 8 percent of that salary. If the \u201cnot less than\u201d phrase is given its common and ordinary meaning consistent with the overall statutory scheme, the language confers upon the board the discretion to award that percentage of a retiree\u2019s preretirement salary, between a minimum of 50 percent and a maximum of 70 percent, which has not been provided for by the additional 2 percent for each year of full-time service over twenty-five years. Thus, if a retiree elects retirement after exactly twenty-five years, the ordinance vests in the defendant discretionary power to award any additional sum but only up to a maximum of 20 percent of the preretirement salary.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The majority asserts that even if it is assumed, arguendo, that the ordinance may reasonably be interpreted in this manner, it nevertheless interprets the position of the board, based on the record before us, as expressly disclaiming reliance on such a formula. According to the majority, the defendant\u2019s position, with which it disagrees, is simply that the board is vested with discretion, regardless of years of service beyond twenty-five years, to set the minimum pension award at any amount between 50 and 70 percent, inclusive. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>Because of the mandatory \u201cpension ladder\u201d delineated within \u00a7 5 (a), as well as the mandate that a pension must not exceed 70 percent of salary, I agree that this is an erroneous interpretation of the statute, although I do not agree that this was in fact the position of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">A fair interpretation of the testimony elicited at trial rebuts the majority\u2019s conclusion that the board, by expressly disclaiming reliance on the 2 percent formula, construed its discretion as \u201cunfettered\u201d between a minimum of 50 percent and a maximum of 70 percent. Steven Alderman, a trustee of the defendant board and the only witness to testify at trial, commented at length concerning the criteria utilized by the board in arriving at the pension at issue. It is clear that the dominant consideration, in light of Chief Howell\u2019s employment history and service to the community, was to reward him with a pension at the same percentage of salary, 70 percent, as the previous fire chief. Alderman expressly acknowledged, however, that the board considered the years of service beyond the twenty-five year minimum,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> as well as the language contained within the ordinance itself.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Although Alderman stated that the board did not follow the \u201ctwo percent formula,\u201d a fair reading of this testimony is not that the board chose to eschew the clear mandatory language of \u00a7 5 (a), but that the board chose not to limit itself exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>sively to the formula. Strict adherence to the \u201ctwo percent formula\u201d would limit Chief Howell\u2019s pension to 62 percent of his preretirement salary, and clearly, in light of his employment history, the board wished to award him the maximum amount permissible under the ordinance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">To construe the board\u2019s position as authorizing it to award a pension in any amount between 50 and 70 percent, inclusive, <em>regardless </em>of years of service beyond twenty-five years, effectively labels the actions of the board as a deliberate flouting of the mandatory provisions of \u00a7 5 (a). It is unreasonable to conclude that pursuant to its efforts to award Chief Howell a 70 percent pension, the board eschewed the precise and mandatory power which allowed it to attain the 62 percent plateau without the exercise of discretion. Even if it is assumed that the evidence elicited at trial is equivocal concerning the exact method utilized by the board in arriving at the 70 percent figure, the construction of the board\u2019s position by the majority would seem to violate the principle that public officials, acting officially, are entitled to a presumption that they have properly and accurately performed their duty until the contrary appears. <em>State </em>v. <em>Ward, </em>172 Conn. 163, 171, 374 A.2d 168 (1976); <em>Parham </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>172 Conn. 126, 134, 374 A.2d 137 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">Because of the construction given the board\u2019s position, the majority quite correctly concludes that where \u201cthe assertion of such discretionary authority conflicts with specific legislative mandates expressly providing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>a different result, the purported exercise of discretion is invalid.\u201d The short answer to this principle, however, is that a construction of the board\u2019s position as delineated above, which gives full effect to all of the statutory provisions, does not conflict with specific legislative mandates.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">It is true that \u00a7 5 (a) does not delineate specific standards for the board to apply in exercising its discretion under the ordinance. In light of the statutory scheme, however, which mandates a floor, a ceiling and a \u201cpension ladder\u201d based upon additional years of service, the ordinance \u201c \u2018establishes] primary standards\u2019 \u201d and \u201c \u2018lay[s] down an intelligible principle to which the administrative officer or body must conform.\u2019 \u201d <em>New Milford </em>v. <em>SCA Services of Connecticut, Inc., </em>174 Conn. 146, 149, 384 A.2d 337 (1977). \u201cThe duties of an administrative agency . . . necessarily include the right to exercise discretion .... In exercising that discretion, the factors to be taken into consideration \u2018are not mechanical or self-defining standards,\u2019 and, thus, wide areas of judgment are implied. Such discretion is the \u2018lifeblood\u2019 of the administrative process.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>178 Conn. 438, 442, 423 A.2d 87 (1979). Pension statutes have as their purpose \u201cthe promotion of the general welfare, and for that reason pension statutes are liberally construed to accomplish that objective.\u201d 3 Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th Ed.) \u00a7 71.09. \u201c[W]here power over a particular subject matter has been delegated to a municipal corporation by the legislature, without any express limitations, the extent to which that power shall be exercised rests in the discretion of the municipal authorities, and as long as it is exercised in good faith and for a municipal purpose the courts have no ground upon which to interfere.\u201d 56 Am. Jur. 2d 286, Municipal Corporations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>\u00a7 227. Indeed, this court has previously sanctioned a legislative grant of discretion without any discernible standards other than \u201csuch sums\u201d \u201cat such times\u201d that the board \u201cmay deem advisable.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Kirby </em>v. <em>Board of Fire Commissioners, </em>129 Conn. 419, 426, 29 A.2d 452 (1942). Since this court has placed its imprimatur upon a delegation of discretion as unbridled as the phrase \u201cmay deem advisable,\u201d it is difficult to understand why the \u201cnot less than\u201d phrase, tempered as it is by the mandatory limitations of \u00a7 5 (a), should fail because of inadequate standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Undoubtedly, circumstances may arise where an administrative body, in exercising its discretion, will abuse that discretion. This possibility, however, should not, ipso facto, eliminate that discretion. In the present case the board listed several factors relating to the nature and commitment of Chief Howell\u2019s service to the department as justification for exercising its discretion. \u201cIt is unrealistic to demand detailed standards which are impracticable.\u201d <em>Forest Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Planning &amp; Zoning Commission, </em>155 Conn. 669, 679, 236 A.2d 917 (1967). The several criteria on which the board exercised its discretion in the present case clearly indicate the impracticability of limiting discretion to specific enumerated factors beyond the mandates of \u00a7 5 (a). The fact that this discretion could be abused is not a valid basis upon which to divest the board of such discretion. \u201cIn an appeal of this nature, it is neither our function nor that of the [trial court] to retry the case or to substitute our or its judgment for that of the defendant [board].\u201d <em>Riley </em>v. <em>State Employees\u2019 Retirement Commission, </em>supra, 441. There are, however, recognized principles upon which a court may vacate an award entered pursuant to the exercise of discretion: a showing that the entity acted illegally, arbitrarily, or in abuse of the discretion vested upon it. Id., 444.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Finally, the majority has failed to consider adequately the practical construction previously placed upon a similar act (insofar as the present issue is concerned) with reference to the retirement of the former chief. It is clear that such previous action by the board is entitled to some consideration in our construction of \u201cwhat the law is.\u201d <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 657, 116 A.2d 420 (1955). Although the previous fire chief was retired under the provisions of a prior special act and not the home rule ordinance, it is undisputed that he received a pension at 70 percent of his preretirement salary. Because the first special act provided for retirement strictly at 50 percent of income, it is reasonable to infer that the prior chief could have received his pension only under the provisions of the 1967 special act, which contained the \u201cat least\u201d language, the mandatory pension ladder, and which the majority concedes is the functional equivalent to the present home rule ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">The majority dismisses consideration of the prior practice because there were \u201cfew particulars\u201d concerning the prior chiefs service with the fire department, thereby implying that he may have served for thirty-five years or more and that therefore no discretion was involved in that award. A careful reading of Alderman\u2019s testimony, however, justifies the conclusion that both the prior chief, Johnson, and Chief Howell retired after thirty-one years of full-time employment with the fire department.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Therefore the board must have exercised discretion in retiring the previous chief at 70 percent of his preretirement salary.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b493-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>Although the record does not reveal a statement of purpose behind the promulgation of the present ordinance, it is a reasonable assumption that its purpose is to encourage the continuation in service of experienced, dedicated personnel and to reward yeoman service via a discretionary additional sum. By its judicial excision of the \u201cnot less than\u201d provision of the ordinance, the majority has effectively thwarted the board in its attempt to fulfill that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-4\">I would find error in the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case with direction to render judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\"> This omission of the phrase \u201cnot less than\u201d takes on added significance when the legislative history of the ordinance is considered. As the majority opinion reveals, the first special act concerning fire department pensions provided simply a pension \u201cequal to one-half of his regular monthly pay.\u201d The act was subsequently amended to provide a pension \u201cof at least one-half of his annual salary,\u201d which the majority concedes is the functional equivalent of the present \u201cnot less than one-half\u201d statutory language. Although the legislative history fails to provide insight as to the reason for the subsequent inclusion of \u201cat least,\u201d \u201camendments carry with them a presumption that they are effecting a change in the existing law.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Unemployment Security Board of Review, </em>181 Conn. 1, 21 n.6, 434 A.2d 293 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> Alderman: \u201cWe took into consideration the part over 25 years, mainly the 6 percent, that we\u2014the six years at 2 percent extra, but in reality, I think more than anything else, we took into consideration his service and what he had served.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> Alderman: \u201cI think that we took into consideration what the prior Chief had done and the language of what we felt we could give Chief Howell, in the Home Rule Ordinance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">A reasonable interpretation of this statement is that the board considered what it had done for the prior chief, i.e., extra compensation for meritorious service, and then applied to that amount a sum in accordance with the precise arithmetical formula contained within the Home Rule Ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> Similarly, the trial court, in its memorandum of decision, relied on the board\u2019s failure to follow the statutory formula in declaring the pension awarded Chief Howell to be null and void. Here again, I interpret the board\u2019s action; see footnotes 2-3, supra; as a decision not to limit the award to the mandatory directives delineated within the ordinance so as to attain the maximum allowable pension consistent with the statutory scheme.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\"> Alderman: \u201cSo, we felt that in total, he [Chief Howell] should be treated the same as the previous chief, William Johnson. That he should also be retired at 70 percent, considering he had also worked for thirty-one years for the Department.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b492-8\"> Furthermore, it is noted that in argument, when inquiry was made concerning the proposition of <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>West Haven, </em>142 Conn. 646, 657, 116 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>A.2d 420 (1955), delineated above, counsel for the plaintiff, while not disputing that proposition, sought to distinguish the award to the former chief because that pension was awarded under the terms of a prior statute. This argument, however, is effectively rebutted by the fact that only the 1967 act authorized a pension beyond 50 percent of salary, and is, as the majority concedes, the functional equivalent of the present ordinance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
