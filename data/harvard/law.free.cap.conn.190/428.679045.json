At a subsequent hearing, the court\u2019s disposition of the case was to place him on probation until July 12, 1980.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because one of the issues raised in this appeal is whether the court, <em>Brenneman, J., </em>erred in denying a motion to suppress a pretrial identification, we will first set out the evidence presented at that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Pretrial Indentification Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The circumstances surrounding the court's, <em>Brenneman, J., </em>denial of the motion to suppress identification evidence after an evidentiary hearing are the following: At the hearing the state presented two witnesses, the victim and Robert J. Cagianello, a Hart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>ford police officer who investigated the incident; the defendant juvenile was not present. Officer Cagianello said that at the scene the victim said that her assailant Was \u201cReggie\u201d and she knew him because he had been her paper boy for approximately two years. He was not sure of the exact time of the attack although he thought it was approximately 5:45 p.m. She gave the police a physical description of her assailant and also a clothing description, saying he had a blue jacket on. While the victim identified her assailant only as Reggie, Cagianello believed the police obtained his full name from the superintendent of the building in which the victim resided. As the result of information obtained at the scene, the police put out a description; they also went to his home that night but he was not there. The next day the police picked Reggie up at a gym where they knew he played ball. At that time Cagianello said that he had a blue jacket on and that he matched the description given by the victim. They brought him to a parking lot on Tremont Street<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> where the victim viewed him from a police car, identified him as Reggie, and indicated that he was the boy who robbed her.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The victim testified that at approximately 6:15 p.m. on November 15,1979, while walking on the driveway at 77 Oxford Street, a young man came from behind the garage and grabbed her handbag. This caused her to fall to the ground, hitting her head, and her assailant kept pulling at her handbag and dragging her on the ground for about ten feet. He said nothing. It was \u201cdusk like\u201d and there were flood lights from other buildings that shone in the area. As she was being pulled, she \u201chad the presence of mind to look \u2014 to give him a good look.\u201d From her position during the pulling, she recognized him as Reggie, her paper boy for the past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>two years. He had collected for the paper at her door every week. The last time that she had seen him before the robbery was about a week earlier when he was collecting.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\">The Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">This appeal, as previously noted, arose out of an incident that occurred in Hartford on November 15,1979, at approximately 6 p.m., in the yard of 84 Oxford Street, just after the victim had parked her car in the garage. While walking from the garage toward the driveway between two buildings in order to get to her apartment at 77 Oxford Street, she was attacked by a single assailant with whom she struggled as he tried to seize her pocketbook. She fell to the ground, was hit on the head and was injured. She was treated right after the attack at a Hartford hospital. The same night she told police investigating the incident that she recognized her assailant as Reggie (the respondent juvenile), who had been her newspaper boy for the past two years.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The police went to the juvenile\u2019s home that night but he was not there. The next day police officers located him and brought him to a prearranged location at a parking lot on Tremont Street where another police officer was present with the victim. She immediately identified him as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">At the trial, the victim again identified the juvenile as the one who robbed and attacked her on November 15,1979. The police officer who took her to the \u201cshow-up\u201d on Tremont Street on November 16, 1979, also testified to her identification at that time. The matter of the time surrounding the November 15 attack was developed at trial. The defense was alibi and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>juvenile\u2019s aunt, sister and brother, with whom he lived, were witnesses. Ms. Litto, the acting director of a recreational center, which was \u201cdiagonally across the street\u201d from the juvenile\u2019s home, also testified. The hospital record concerning the victim\u2019s visit and treatment<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there on November 15, 1979, was introduced as an exhibit by the state.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The time stamp on the hospital record, which the trial court understood as indicating the time of the victim\u2019s arrival there, was 6:18 p.m., which relates to that portion of the typewritten entry on the hospital records which recites: \u201cPt states approx 25 min ago on Oxford St. Hartford, Ct. she was assaulted when a purse snatcher knocked her down. . . .\u201d The defendant himself testified, but only as to his height and weight as that affected the victim\u2019s evidence on those two matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">In an oral decision from the bench the trial court <em>Kline, J., </em>found the juvenile guilty on the three counts of the petition. In doing so the court was obviously impressed by the \u201cvery positive identification\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the victim made the night of the attack, pointing out that \u201cknowing him as well as she did, it\u2019s hard to see how she could misidentify him, she told the police exactly who it was after it occurred.\u201d As to the \u201cshow-up,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>the court said: \u201cThey [the police] were at the house that very night[. It] wasn\u2019t the identification the next day that made any difference, one way or another.\u201d The strength of this identification overcame the deficiencies in the victim\u2019s testimony as to the height and weight of her assailant and the time of the attack. The court stated that it could not rely on this latter testimony. It is obvious, both from the finding of guilty and this statement of the court, that the alibi evidence was not as credible<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> as claimed and, therefore, the court concluded that the state had satisfied its full burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">On his appeal, the juvenile claims that the court erred: (1) in refusing to suppress the identification testimony; (2) in considering incompetent hearsay evidence; and (3) in finding facts on critical issues unsupported by evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We turn first to the claim that the court erred in refusing to suppress the identification testimony. The juvenile argues that there was ample evidence at the hearing on the motion to suppress to show that the victim\u2019s identification would have been \u201chighly suspect\u201d under the circumstances even without the impermissibly suggestive \u201cshow-up.\u201d He maintains that inasmuch as virtually the sole issue in the trial court was the reliability of his identification by the victim as her assailant, the state must be found not to have sustained its burden of proof on the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification both in and out of court. He argues that his due process rights were violated in the identification procedures permitted in this case. Included in the attack on her identification is the assertion that no supporting testimony or physical evidence \u201cto cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>rob\u00f3rate her identification\u2014e.g. fingerprints, shoe marks, weapon, clothing, handbag, or other fruits of the crime\u2014was offered to tie the respondent to the crime.\u201d On the other hand, the state, recognizing the suggestive nature of \u201cshow-ups,\u201d argues that the victim\u2019s pretrial identification was reliable under the surrounding circumstances. It also claims that the \u201cshow-up\u201d \u201cwas merely a confirmation, not a basis for initial identification.\u201d The state insists that the pretrial \u201cshow-up\u201d did not taint the victim\u2019s in-court identification. In arguing that it sustained its burden of proof, the state urges that the motion to suppress was properly denied and that there was no error in admitting the in-court identification. We agree with the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201c Tn determining whether identification procedures violate a defendant\u2019s due process rights, the required inquiry is made on an ad hoc basis and is two-pronged: first, it must be determined whether the identification procedure was [impermissibly and] unnecessarily suggestive; and second, if it is found to have been so, it must be determined whether the identification was nevertheless reliable based on examination of the \u201ctotality of the circumstances.\u201d [Citations omitted.]\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Theriault, </em>182 Conn. 366, 371-72, 438 A.2d 432 (1980).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Hamele, </em>188 Conn. 372, 376, 449 A.2d 1020 (1982); see <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 97 S.

At oral argument, the state conceded that the \u201cshow-up\u201d confrontation was \u201csuggestive,\u201d but not \u201cunnecessarily suggestive.\u201d \u201cAlthough one man confrontations do not per se constitute a denial of due process; <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra; <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>United States, </em>390 U.S. 377, 88 S.

Ct. 1612, 71 L. Ed. 2d 848 (1982). \u201c \u2018The factors to be considered in determining the reliability of an identification \u201cinclude the opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\u2019 degree of attention, the accuracy of his [or her] prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation. Against these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, 114 (citing <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra, 199-200).\u2019 <em>State </em>v. <em>Piskorski, </em>[177 Conn. 677, 742, 419 A.2d 866, cert. denied, 444 U.S. 935, 100 S. Ct. 283, 62 L. Ed. 2d 194 (1979)].\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>187 Conn. 602, 616, 447 A.2d 734 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">The reliability of the victim\u2019s identification of the defendant as her assailant is disclosed by the circumstances, most of which we have already set out. We would also note that the victim had a good and sufficient opportunity to view her assailant at the time of the assault at close range and with adequate lighting; these factors enhance reliability. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Yanishefsky, </em>500 F.2d 1327, 1330-31 (2d Cir. 1974); <em>Willin v. Ajello, </em>496 F. Sup. 804, 808 (D. Conn. 1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Willin, 177 </em>Conn. 248, 254n, 413 A.2d 829 (1979). The victim in this case, rather than yielding, kept struggling to keep her handbag. She had the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>presence of mind \u201cto give him a good look.\u201d This spills over into her degree of attention. It has been stated \u201cthat the victim of [a] crime is apt to be a more reliable source of identification than is a mere spectator to the incident.\u201d <em>Willin </em>v. <em>Ajello, </em>supra, 808. This proposition has been said to be so because the personal impact of the criminal episode is likely to leave a victim with \u201ca particularly vivid recollection of events\u201d along with the thought that a victim\u2019s \u201cspecial emotional stake . . . make[s] him especially \u2018motivated to make a careful observation of the perpetrator.\u2019 \u201d <em>Willin </em>v. <em>Ajello, </em>supra, quoting <em>United States ex rel. Phipps </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>428 F.2d 912, 915 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 400 U.S. 908, 91 S. Ct. 151, 27 L. Ed. 2d 146 (1970). During the suppression hearing in this case, the court, <em>Brenneman, J., </em>aptly observed: \u201cThe degree of attention she gave him, it seems to me a woman with presence of mind to hang on to her purse a couple of minutes while being dragged is being rather intent on observation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">On the accuracy of her prior description of the assailant, the victim, shortly after the attack, told the police that he was Reggie, her newsboy for two years. She also told them that he was about fifteen or sixteen years old, had a short haircut and was wearing a blue jacket.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> There is no evidence that the victim was uncertain or vague at the time of the \u201cshow-up\u201d identification. Cagianello, who was with her at that time, testified that she said that the boy at the \u201cshow-up\u201d was Reggie, the same boy that robbed her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He also said that on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>both nights the defendant wore the same blue jacket. Such identification supports its reliability.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">At the suppression hearing, Cagianello said that the \u201cshow-up\u201d was \u201cwithin 24 hours\u201d although it apparently took place in the early evening of November 16. \u201cLapse of time between the crime and the confrontation is also important; the longer the interval, the greater the dangers that the initial image will have dimmed and that the second image will play a significant role. Also, a long interval between the initial observation and the trial coupled with an improper confrontation a comparatively short time before the witness appears in court enhances the danger that he may be relying on his most recent encounter.\u201d <em>United States ex rel. Phipps </em>v. <em>Follette, </em>supra. Under the circumstances, we think the elapsed time here was reasonable. See <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, 116 (two days). The elapsed time was hardly such as to be a \u201cseriously negative factor\u201d in asserting the validity of the identification process. See <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra, 201 (where identification held valid even though there was a lapse of seven months between the rape and the confrontation). Under the totality of circumstances, the victim\u2019s \u201cshow-up\u201d identification of the defendant as her assailant was sufficiently reliable to be admitted under relevant constitutional standards; <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra; <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra; and the motion to suppress was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test also is the test of admissibility of the in-court identification. Thus, here too it must be determined, under such circumstances, whether the identification is sufficiently reliable despite the suggestiveness of a \u201cshow-up.\u201d Applying the guidelines of such cases as <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra, and <em>Manson </em>v. <em>Brathwaite, </em>supra, the analysis concerning the victim\u2019s in-court identification is com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>parable to the \u201cshow-up\u201d identification. Two matters, however, we would note. First, the lapse of time between the crimes and the in-court identification was approximately six months. Under the facts of this case this does not constitute even \u201ca somewhat negative factor.\u201d <em>Neil </em>v. <em>Biggers, </em>supra, 201; see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams, </em>596 F.2d 44 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 442 U.S. 946, 99 S. Ct. 2893, 61 L. Ed. 2d 317 (1979) (in-court identification admitted 32 months after the crime). In addition, the reliability of the victim\u2019s identification was greatly enhanced by the certainty with which it was made at every stage in the identification process. See <em>United States </em>v. <em>Sanchez, </em>603 F.2d 381, 386 (2d Cir. 1979). There was no violation of the defendant\u2019s due process rights in admitting the in-court identification; the \u201cshow-up\u201d did not taint her in-court identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">In making his other two claims of error, the defendant argues that to counter the victim\u2019s identification, he offered the testimony of Ms. Litto and three members of his family, which, taken together, is \u201cwholly inconsistent\u201d with his guilt. He maintains that the trial court resolved this conflict by relying in its decision on the victim\u2019s \u201cvery, very positive description.\u201d He further asserts that in reaching this result, the trial court created its own \u201ctheory\u201d of the case (1) by using \u201cincompetent\u201d hearsay evidence,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> and (2) in making findings on critical issues of fact which are unsupported by the evidence. In rejecting this theory, we do not agree with either of those claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We must reject the defendant\u2019s claim because a fair reading of the transcript indicates that the court did not rely on incompetent hearsay and facts unsupported <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>by the evidence in order to support its finding of guilty. After the court had made its remarks about the evidence, the court stated: \u201cIf the victim weren\u2019t so positive, as I said earlier, in her identification, I would say that I would find the defendant not guilty.\u201d These remarks indicate that the trial court acknowledged that it could not have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt premised upon the \u201ctheory\u201d the defendant attributes to the trial court. Instead, immediately following these qualifying remarks, the court stated: \u201cHowever, in light of the very positive identification, her relationship with the young man over the past two years, and knowing him as well as she did, it\u2019s hard to see how she could misidentify him, she told the police exactly who it was after it occurred. They were at the house that very night [. It] wasn\u2019t the identification the next day that made any difference one way or another. I [am] going to have to find him guilty of the three counts.\u201d It is clear that based upon the strength of the victim\u2019s identification, the court found the defendant guilty and chose not to credit the defendant\u2019s alibi evidence. This it was entitled to do, and we cannot conclude that the court\u2019s decision was clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 3060D.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b441-8\"> At oral argument, the question arose as to whether this case was moot. This juvenile, having been found delinquent, was placed on probation which he completed without incident on August 11, 1980. At oral argument, counsel for the juvenile informed us that insofar as she was aware no proceedings seeking an erasure of the juvenile\u2019s record pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 1062 had yet been undertaken. \u201cSection 1062 is a bifurcated provision only part of which is self-executing.\u201d <em>In re Juvenile Appeal (82-AB), </em>188 Conn. 557, 560, 452 A.2d 113 (1982). Even if we assume, as we do from what is before us, that he has been relieved from further accountability to the court, that circumstance, while triggering the two year period for the erasure of records under Practice Book \u00a7 1062, is not inconsistent in this case with the continued existence of a reviewable order, the adjudication of delinquency itself.
