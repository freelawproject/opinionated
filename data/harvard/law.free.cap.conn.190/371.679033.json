Healey, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Afn\">The plaintiff in this case is the Hartford Division of Emhart Industries, Inc. (Emhart). Emhart operates a manufacturing plant located in Windsor. The defendant, Local 376 of the International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>&amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America (union), is the certified bargaining representative of Emhart\u2019s employees. There are also six individually named defendants. Philip Wheeler, James Bowen and Robert Madore are all officers of the union; Wheeler is president, while Bowen and Madore are the business agents for the union. Joseph Belliveau, Felix Velez and George Johnson are all employees of Emhart and members of the union. In addition, Belliveau is the shop chairman for the union, and Velez and Johnson were designated as \u201cpicket captains\u201d for the union by Wheeler.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">At midnight on September 12,1982, the then existing collective bargaining agreement between Emhart and the union expired. Because the parties were unable to negotiate a new contract, the union commenced a strike against Emhart immediately upon the expiration of the old contract. The union began picketing the plant on Monday morning, September 13,1982. On Wednesday, September 15,1982, Emhart filed a verified complaint and an application for a temporary restraining order, a temporary injunction and a permanent injunction, alleging that the union and the individually named defendants were engaged in unlawful conduct. Hearings on Emhart\u2019s request for injunctive relief began on September 17, 1982, and concluded on October 5, 1982. On October 13, 1982, the trial court, <em>Kremski, J., </em>filed a \u201cMemorandum of Decision and Finding of Facts,\u201d in which it found that there was a basis for issuing a temporary injunction. It, therefore, granted Emhart\u2019s request for a temporary injunction, attaching a copy of its order to the memorandum.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants appealed from this order on October 25, 1982.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Although the defendants have raised a number of issues in their brief, these issues can be synthesized into three broad claims.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Their first claim is that, pursuant to the criteria set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 31-115,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> there was insufficient evidence to justify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>the issuance of a temporary injunction against any of the individually named defendants or the union. Their second claim is that the injunction issued by the trial court was overly broad and vague. Finally, they claim that the trial court erred in admitting into evidence certain documents as full exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">At the time that the strike began there were 318 union members<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> working at Emhart\u2019s plant in Windsor, and 287 nonunion employees. There are four entrances to the plant. Two of the entrances open onto <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>Day Hill Road in Windsor, while the other two open onto Addison Road. Once the picketing began, however, only one entrance was used except for limited time periods. This entrance was designated as Gate A on a map of the plant introduced into evidence by Emhart, and was referred to as such throughout the proceedings. The decision to utilize one entrance was apparently reached after the chief of the Windsor police force, Maxie L. Patterson, cautioned Emhart officials against the use of all four gates. Chief Patterson testified that he told the officials: \u201cThat for them to utilize the gates, it would require a considerable amount of manpower on my part to insure that the vehicles could be safely gotten in, that traffic could be adequately handled to preclude any serious injuries, and particularly ak&gt;ng Day Hill Road, because we\u2019re talking about a peak traffic hour period, at approximately \u2014from the time period of seven o\u2019clock until eight o\u2019clock in the morning, and also the evening hours, when the plant lets out, and at the time frame of approximately four twenty p.m., and I did express to him that I did have some reservations about the safety of being able to utilize those gates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Picketers began to arrive at the plant at around 5 a.m. on Monday, September 13. From that date until the date of the hearings, the defendants admit that picketing took place on a 24 hour basis. A number of employees testified to delays of up to two hours caused by the picketing, particularly during the peak rush hours in the mornings. One employee also testified to a similar delay when he attempted to leave the plant on the afternoon of the first day of picketing. In addition, Emhart introduced into evidence, over the union\u2019s objection, the time cards of the employees who reported to work, as well as a summary of the hours they lost during the first week of the strike. The summary in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>dicated that the total number of hours lost due to strike delay was 1248. These delays were a result of the manner in which the picketing was conducted. The court found that the defendants \u201cpicketed in mass\u201d at the gate to the plaintiffs plant. The picketers would walk in a circular line in the driveway leading to Gate A. No car was permitted to pass through this circular line, either to enter or to leave the plant, until the picketers made a full rotation. The trial court estimated that anywhere between ten and thirty pickets would walk in the circle, with each rotation taking between one and one-half and two minutes. The court found that the rate at which vehicles were permitted to pass through the picket line was from 30 to 40 per hour. This, in turn, caused the traffic to back up for a number of blocks impeding traffic on the adjoining streets. The court found that the pickets employed the same tactics when the plaintiffs employees were leaving the premises. Furthermore, although the court found that the number of picketers walking in the circular picket line was ten to thirty, there was also testimony that the actual number of picketers surrounding the plant was, at times, much greater.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">The picketers intimidated some nonstriking employees who attempted to enter the plant by subjecting them to verbal abuse and to verbal threats. In addition, one employee testified that he observed a picketer copying down license plate numbers of the cars that drove through the picket line. There was also evidence of individual acts of violence and vandalism. At one point, on Monday, September 20, about fifty picketers surrounded a nonstriking employee\u2019s blue Honda automobile and jumped up and down on it, kicked its sides, pounded on the roof, scratched some paint off and cracked its windshield, and also verbally threatened the driver. This incident led to the arrest of one of the picketers.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>There were also reports introduced into evidence, over the defendants\u2019 objection, which were prepared by agents of Burns International Security Services, Inc., whose duties included securing the building and the property and filling out these reports. Certain of these reports indicated that on three separate occasions people having business with Emhart drove up to the plant and were either verbally harassed or prevented from entering. On one occasion, a bottle was thrown at a vehicle. There were also numerous reports that on different days unidentified strikers would drop or throw glass bottles and ball bearings on the premises of the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">There was substantial evidence describing the action of the union and the individual defendants during the strike. The union president, Wheeler, testified that it was the union\u2019s normal procedure to set up a rotational picket line and to let cars pass through only after the picketers had completed a full rotation. There was testimony that Felix Velez, whom Wheeler appointed along with George Johnson to take care of the picketers, was controlling the picket line and determining when to let cars pass through the line. There was also testimony that all six of the individual defendants were near the gate while picketing was going on and that Bowen, Belliveau, Johnson and Velez actually participated in the picketing. Furthermore, as has been previously noted, while the picketing was taking place the people who went through the line were subjected to verbal harassment. One of the police reports introduced by Emhart stated that the \u201clabor leaders\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>aggravated the situation on one occasion by informing the picketers that they \u201ccould legally continue\u201d being verbally abusive towards the occupants of the vehicles passing through the picket line.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">In addition, Wheeler testified that he was present at the time of the incident that occurred on September 20, where a nonstriking employee's car was surrounded and repeatedly battered by a group of picketers who also subjected the driver to verbal threats. Rather than directing his attention to curtail the actions of the picketers, however, Wheeler yelled at the guard, telling him to open the gate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">In regard to the activity of the police in supervising the picket line it is evident from the record that, for the most part, from Monday, September 13, when the picketing began, until Thursday, September 16, the police took little action to prevent the picketers from engaging in their rotational picketing. It is also clear, however, that the police did not determine how the picketers should conduct their picket line. When the police arrived on the first day that the picketing started, September 13, the picketers had already established their procedure of letting one car through after each revolution. Wheeler himself testified that this was what they normally did. Furthermore, when Chief Patterson talked to Wheeler at that time about the \u201cindividuals [picketers] interfering with the flow of the traffic going through,\u201d Patterson testified that \u201che [Wheeler] basically did not want to discuss it.\u201d When the traffic began to back up the first day of the strike, a police report filed by Lieutenant Nick Riccio indicates that when he attempted to discuss the situation with Wheeler, Wheeler \u201cwas adamant and belligerent that he was going to operate in this manner and that he had no intentions of altering his plans.\u201d Another police report describes an incident that took place on Thurs<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>day, September 16, when a police officer tried to make an adjustment in the picket line because he felt that the picketers were making more than one revolution before letting a car through. The report states that when he tried to let a car through, Felix Velez became upset and hostile and started yelling and cursing at the officer. This incident led to Velez\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">The police did take affirmative action on Friday, September 17. On that afternoon Chief Patterson assigned approximately thirty officers to the plant area, whereas he had initially assigned only eight or nine per shift. He had a police commander announce over the public address system that any individual blocking the driveway was violating state law and that they had to move out of the way. Failure to do so, he informed them, would result in their arrest. Rather than obey these orders, Bowen, Madore and Velez walked into the middle of the driveway leading to Gate A. Chief Patterson testified that Bowen \u201ccalled for all of the individuals standing in and around the area, to come out into the middle of the driveway, and, you know, to further block the driveway.\u201d Bowen, Madore and Velez were then arrested, with Madore having to be physically subdued by the police. The police then made a wedge through the picketers in order to separate them to either side of the driveway so that the traffic could proceed through the gate unimpeded. After the police line had been formed, and cars started coming out of the plant, two more union members who had been picketing broke through the line and blocked the cars from exiting. They, too, were arrested. In order to increase the flow of traffic in and out of the plant, the police utilized this procedure for moving the picketers off the driveway from that date until the time that the court hearings were proceeding. Once the police left their positions at the driveway, however, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>before they arrived, the picket line would form up again and the picketers would follow their normal procedure.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">Chief Patterson also testified in regard to the ability of his force to continue monitoring the picketers. As previously noted, the contingent of officers assigned to the plant during the strike was eight or nine per shift and this eventually decreased to four to seven officers per shift. On the afternoon of Friday, September 17, however, the police chief assigned thirty officers to the plant in order to move the picketers away from the entrance to the plant. Thereafter, this task required a contingent of between thirteen and twenty officers each morning and afternoon to expedite ingress to and egress from the plant. Three of these officers were detectives. The extra officers, many of whom were on overtime, had to report two hours earlier than normal in the morning and one hour earlier in the afternoon, although only a portion of this time was spent actually clearing an entrance to the plant.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The police chief testified that \u201chopefully\u201d he would not have to continue assigning this number of officers to the plant because it was \u201cbasically seriously impairing the operation of the police department.\u201d He then went on to explain how his department\u2019s operations were being impaired: \u201cThe composition of these officers that is resulting from pulling officers from other details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and other assignments. Basically, the detective bureau is literally stripped. Detectives aren\u2019t following up on criminal investigations and burglaries and other type of criminal incidents. Other traffic posts that are normally manned in the morning and the evening, at a major traffic intersection, is [sic] not being manned, because of having had to pull that individual officer. All of the special assignment officers have been pulled from various details. The crime prevention officer, all of the administrative officers, all available supervisors have been placed on the assignment, and I just physically can\u2019t continue to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">We now turn to the issues raised by this appeal. Because some of the underlying facts relied upon by the plaintiff in seeking an injunction were contained in documents which the defendants claim were inadmissible, we will deal with the evidentiary issues first. We will then address the question of whether Emhart introduced sufficient facts to warrant the issuance of an injunction pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114 and 31-115. Finally, we will discuss the issue of whether the actual injunction issued was overly broad or vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Evidentiary Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">The defendants claim that the trial court erred by admitting three sets of records into evidence as full exhibits over the objections of the defendants\u2019 counsel.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>The three sets of records consist of the following: (a) police reports filed by officers of the Windsor police force assigned to the plant during the strike; (b) \u201cincident reports\u201d filed by employees of Burns International Security Services, Inc. (Burns Security); and (c) time cards of nonstriking employees reflecting the amount of time they lost due to the strike as well as a summary sheet of data compiled from those cards. The defendants claim that the court erred in concluding that these documents satisfied the business entry exception to the hearsay rule as set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180. It should be noted at this point that the defendants do not claim on appeal that the court erred in admitting any particular record. Rather, the claimed errors in admitting each of the three sets of records apply to each set as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">To be admissible under the business record exception to the hearsay rule, a trial court judge must find that the record satisfies each of the three conditions set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-180.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>determine, before concluding that it is admissible, that the record was made in the regular course of business, that it was the regular course of such business to make such a record, and that it was made at the time of the act described in the report, or within a reasonable time thereafter. See generally <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>175 Conn. 1, 4, 392 A.2d 488 (1978); <em>Szela </em>v. <em>Johnson Motor Lines, Inc., </em>145 Conn. 714, 723, 146 A.2d 910 (1958). Once these criteria have been met by the party seeking to introduce the record, however, it does not necessarily follow that the record itself is generally admissible, nor does it mean that everything in it is required to be admitted into evidence. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>supra; <em>Mucci </em>v. <em>LeMonte, </em>157 Conn. 566, 569, 254 A.2d 879 (1969); <em>Maggi </em>v. <em>Mendillo, </em>147 Conn. 663, 667, 165 A.2d 603 (1960). For example, the information contained in the record must be relevant to the issues being tried. See <em>Maggi </em>v. <em>Mendillo, </em>supra. In addition, the information contained in the report must be based on the \u201centrant\u2019s own observation or on information of others whose business duty it was to transmit it to the entrant.\u201d <em>Mucci </em>v. <em>LeMonte, </em>supra. If the information does not have such a basis, it adds another level of hearsay to the report which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>necessitates a separate exception to the hearsay rule in order to justify its admission. <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Plante, </em>supra, 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">With these general principles in mind, we now turn to the defendants\u2019 claims of error arising out of the introduction of the police reports. The defendants\u2019 first claim in this regard is that Emhart introduced only the copies of the reports and that, based on the testimony of Chief Patterson, through whom the reports were introduced, the court erred in concluding that a proper foundation for their admission had been established. Prior to the introduction of these reports, Chief Patterson testified that each report was \u201cmade in the ordinary course of business,\u201d that it was \u201cthe ordinary course of business to make such a document,\u201d and that it was in \u201cthe ordinary course of business to make such a document at or near the time of the event recorded.\u201d He also testified that the forms on which the reports are written have three attached pages so that for each report there is an original and two carbon copies. The original was kept in the records section of the police department, while the third copy of the three part set was the actual document that was admitted into evidence. Chief Patterson did not compare the copies of the police reports that were introduced with the original reports. He did testify, however, that he had had occasion to fill out such forms and that on those occasions the carbon copy had always accurately reflected the original document. He testified further that it was possible for the original to be amended after the copy had been detached, but that this was \u201cunlikely\u201d to happen without his having knowledge of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\" On the basis of the foregoing evidence, we must reject the defendants\u2019 claim that Emhart did not lay a proper foundation to introduce carbon copies of the police reports. General Statutes \u00a7 52-180 specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>permits the introduction of copies provided the copies were made in the regular course of business and the process by which the copies were prepared accurately reproduced the original. Here, Chief Patterson testified that these documents were made in the regular course of business, that he had personally used such types of forms in filling out reports and that the copies had accurately reflected the original.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This testimony provided a sufficient basis for the trial court to conclude that the documents satisfied the criteria of General Statutes \u00a7 52-180. There is no requirement, as the defendants suggest, that the witness through whom the documents are admitted must have compared the copy with the original. Rather, it-is evident from the statute that the legislature intended the issue of whether the copy accurately reflected the original to be resolved by the process by which the copy was made.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In fact, the statute permits the introduction of copies where the \u201coriginal may be destroyed in the regular course of business.\u201d In many instances this would preclude a witness from comparing the original and the copy because, under the statute, the witness through whom the documents are introduced need not be the person who made the document. See E. <em>Paul Kovacs &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Alpert, </em>180 Conn. 120, 127, 429 A.2d 829 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Finally, we cannot find that the trial court erred in admitting the police reports because Chief Patterson testified that it was possible for an officer to change the original report without changing the copies. This statement must be considered in light of his entire testimony. First, he immediately qualified this statement by saying that it would be \u201cunlikely\u201d for this to happen without his having personal knowledge of it. He had previously been asked whether \u201csometimes the officer may type something on the original and then type other things on the second and third copy, is that correct?\u201d to which he had replied, \u201c[n]o.\u201d These qualifications, together with his testimony that, based upon his personal observation, the copies accurately reflected the original, form a sufficient basis upon which the trial court could find that the statutory criteria had been met. The trial court properly determined that any doubt about the accuracy of the reports in this situation would go to the weight to be afforded the documents, not to their admissibility. See <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>179 Conn. 349, 358, 426 A.2d 305 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The second claimed error raised by the defendants in regard to the police reports is not properly before this court. The defendants claim that Chief Patterson was able to identify only the signatures on the reports and not the printed handwritings. In addition, they point out that in one report it appeared that it was prepared by an officer other than the one who signed it, while Patterson testified that it was not the normal practice for officers to write each other\u2019s reports. According to the defendants, each of these factors raises a question as to whether the reports were based on personal observation. The problem with this claim, i.e., that the reports were not based on personal observation, is that the defendants never asserted this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>specific objection in the trial court directed to this claimed deficiency. On appeal, this court will not review a claim, except in exceptional circumstances, where the claim raised on appeal is different from the objection raised in the trial court. <em>Cahill </em>v. <em>Board of Education, </em>187 Conn. 94, 99, 444 A.2d 907 (1982); <em>Witek </em>v. <em>Southbury, </em>132 Conn. 104, 110, 42 A.2d 843 (1945). No such exceptional circumstances have been put forth in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">The second set of documents which the defendants claim was inadmissible consists of \u201cincident reports\u201d prepared by employees of Burns Security. The defendants\u2019 first claim of error arising from their introduction is that the person through whom they were introduced, Ed Bradley, a field supervisor for Burns Security, could not testify as to how soon after the incident described in each report the actual reports were filled out. As noted previously, this is one of the requirements for admissibility pursuant to the statute. The defendants\u2019 claim, however, is without merit. Before each document was introduced, Bradley testified that the reports were made at or near the time of the incident reported therein. He also testified that the Burns employees submitted \u201cthis type of report\u201d to him every day. On the basis of this testimony, the trial court could reasonably conclude that the statutory requirements had been satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">We would note at this point that the inability of Bradley to testify as to the exact date and time when a report was filled out does not render the report inadmissible. We have held that the statute should be liberally interpreted. See <em>General Motors Acceptance Corporation </em>v. <em>Capitol Garage, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 593, 597, 227 A.2d 548 (1967). In part, this is due to the fact that the statute recognizes that the trustworthiness of such documents comes from their being used for busi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>ness and not for litigation. See <em>American Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Valenti, </em>supra, 357; see generally <em>In re Estate of Indyk, </em>488 Pa. 567, 413 A.2d 371 (1979). In light of this principle, if it can be demonstrated, as it was in this case, that it was the regular business practice to file reports within a reasonable time after the incident itself, this is sufficient to assure that the report was made at a time when the incident was fresh in the author\u2019s mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">The defendants also claim that it is unclear whether the reports filed by the Burns Security employees were based upon personal observation. This claim is without merit. Although Bradley said that he could not testify that each report was based upon a guard\u2019s personal observation, his testimony indicated that it was their practice to base the reports on personal observation. He also testified that if someone approached a security guard and reported an incident outside of that guard\u2019s field of observation, this would not be written down in an incident report. This was because \u201c[i]t would have to be investigated by the officer who was there, to the fact whether or not what [the person] was telling [the officer] was true.\u201d Absent some other evidence indicating that the reports were not based upon personal observation, Bradley\u2019s testimony was sufficient to meet the statutory requirement.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">The defendants point to the fact that Bradley could only identify the signature on the reports, and not the handwriting in the report, as a factor negating a finding that they were based on personal observation. We disagree. First, there is absolutely no requirement in the statute that the witness through whom a report is admitted be able to identify the handwriting. In addition, the defendants have not set forth how this factor bears any relationship to the issue of whether the report was based upon personal observation. Finally, the defendants\u2019 claim would actually defeat the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>behind the rule. The reliability of business records arises, in part, from the fact that \u201c[t]he habit and system of making such a record with regularity calls for accuracy through the interest and purpose of the entrant . ...\u201d 5 Wigmore, Evidence (Chadbourn Rev.) \u00a7 1522 (1). It has also aptly been noted that \u201c[t]he complex nature of modern business organizations is such that all participants in the preparation of a record can most often not be identified . . . .\u201d McCormick, Evidence (2d Ed.) \u00a7 312; see also <em>In re Estate of Indyk, </em>supra; <em>State </em>v. <em>Burclaff, </em>138 Vt. 461, 466-67, 418 A.2d 38 (1980). Moreover, we have already noted that our statute should be liberally construed. <em>General Motors Acceptance Corporation </em>v. <em>Capitol Garage, Inc., </em>supra. In view of the size and complexity of business today, it would be difficult to require a testifying witness to be able to identify, in all instances, a person\u2019s handwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">The defendants also claim that there is evidence that the security guards based their reports on what they saw on a television monitor and that this is further evidence that the reports were not based upon personal observation. The short answer to this claim is that this objection was never raised in the trial court. Therefore, we will not consider the issue. See <em>Roche </em>v. <em>Fairfield, </em>186 Conn. 490, 505, 442 A.2d 911 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">The defendants\u2019 final claim of error in regard to the incident reports is that they \u201cinvariably use the amorphous term \u2018strikers.\u2019 \u201d They claim that unless the reports can be shown to relate to any of the defendants, they are irrelevant. Assuming arguendo that we agreed with this claim, the problem is that according to the memorandum of decision and the injunction that was issued, the trial court agreed with it. That is, nowhere in the memorandum of decision is reference made to any of the occurrences described in the incident reports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>which were attributed solely to \u201cstrikers,\u201d except the blue Honda incident concerning which there was testimony not only from the driver of the blue Honda, but also from one of the pickets who was present. In view of the fact that these individual reports were not used as a basis for the trial court\u2019s decision, any error in admitting them was rendered harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">The final set of documents which the defendants claim were erroneously introduced consists of time cards of nonstriking employees indicating the time they lost from work due to strike delay, as well as a summary of the information in these cards. Our review of the evidence indicates that there was substantial evidence from the mouths of witnesses regarding the delays caused by the strike so that the evidence contained in the time cards can be considered cumulative. Even if we assume arguendo that the court did err in concluding that these documents satisfied the criteria of General Statutes \u00a7 52-180, any error was rendered harmless by the introduction of this direct evidence. Therefore, we do not address this issue. See <em>Pisel </em>v. <em>Stamford Hospital, </em>180 Conn. 314, 327, 430 A.2d 1 (1980); <em>State </em>v. <em>Boyd, </em>178 Conn. 600, 604, 424 A.2d 279 (1979); <em>Guhring </em>v. <em>Gumpper, </em>117 Conn. 548, 552, 169 A. 189 (1933).</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">Propriety of Issuing the Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b403-7\">We now turn to the issue of whether the trial court erred in concluding that Emhart had satisfied its burden pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114 and 31-115. We begin by noting the various constraints placed upon the judiciary by the statutes governing labor disputes, General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-112 through 31-121. The federal counterpart to these statutes, known as the Norris-LaGuardia Act; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 101 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>through 115; has been interpreted as taking \u201cfederal courts out of the labor injunction business except in . . . very limited circumstances . . . <footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> Marine Cooks &amp; Stewards, AFL </em>v. <em>Panama S.

It is a thoroughly pragmatic and historical circumstance, recognized by judicial decisions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>that a strike \u201cwhen legitimately employed is an economic weapon which in great measure implements and supports the principles of the collective bargaining system.\u201d <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Erie Resistor Corporation, </em>373 U.S. 221, 234, 83 S.

State courts should also be mindful of unwarranted intrusions into labor disputes when issuing injunctions due to the doctrine of federal preemption. See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>San Diego County District Council of Carpenters, </em>436 U.S. 180, 188, 98 S. Ct. 1745, 56 L.

Finally, it must be recognized \u201cthat peaceful picketing carried on in a location open generally to the public is, absent other factors involving the purpose or manner of the picketing, protected by the First Amendment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 </em>v. <em>Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., </em>391 U.S. 308, 313, 88 S.

While these principles do not act as a bar against the issuance of injunctions by state courts, they do establish a limiting framework within which a state court must exercise its discretion in any given case.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">Before an injunction may issue, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-115, the trial court must find that the plaintiff has satisfied its burden of proving each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>criteria provided therein. The plaintiff must establish \u201c(a) [t]hat unlawful acts have been threatened and will be committed by a person or persons unless such person or persons are restrained therefrom, but no injunction or temporary restraining order shall be issued on account of any threat or unlawful act except against the person or persons, association or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or actually authorizing or ratifying the same after actual knowledge thereof; (b) that substantial and irreparable injury to the complainant or his property will follow; (c) that as to each item of relief granted greater injury would be inflicted upon the complainant by the denial of relief than would be inflicted upon the defendants by the granting of relief; (d) that the complainant has no adequate remedy at law; and (e) that the public \u2022officers charged with the duty to protect the complainant\u2019s property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection.\u201d We will discuss each of these elements in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">The defendants claim that the record is \u201cembarrassingly barren\u201d of credible evidence regarding any unlawful activity undertaken by the defendants. We disagree, as did the trial court, which was the arbiter of credibility. First, as indicated above, the record is replete with evidence that the picketers conducted their picket line in such a way as to block ingress to and egress from the plant. Numerous courts, including those in this jurisdiction, have held that \u201c[interference with a free right of ingress and egress to and from a plant by those who had such a right is unlawful. <em>American Steel Foundries </em>v. <em>Tri-City Central Trades Council, </em>257 U.S. 184 [42 S. Ct. 72, 66 L. Ed. 189 (1921)]. Mass and circular picketing is in the same category. <em>Goldfinger </em>v. <em>Feintuch, </em>276 N.Y. 281, 286 [11 N.E.2d 910 (1937)].\u201d <em>Anaconda Co. </em>v. <em>United Automobile Workers, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>165; see <em>Turner &amp; Seymour Mfg.

J.S., Labor Relations \u00a7 816. The state interest justifying judicial action is Emhart\u2019s right to the reasonable use and free access to its property. In the present case, the striking employees effectively usurped Emhart\u2019s right to determine when the nonstriking employees would get into the plant to work. See <em>Westinghouse Electric Corporation </em>v. <em>United Electrical, Radio &amp; Machine Workers of America, Local No. 110, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">Furthermore, even though there was little actual physical violence, the conduct of the picket line in this case cannot be considered \u201cpeaceful.\u201d This court has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>said, \u201c[t]o intimidate is to inspire with fear, to overawe or make afraid. Fear may be inspired without physical violence or spoken threats, moral intimidation may be accomplished by a menacing attitude and a display of force which may coerce the will as effe'ctually as actual physical violence. The gathering of strikers in considerable numbers at the entrance of a factory with threatening attitude toward employees, who must run the gauntlet of a hostile picket line in going to and from work, may overawe and make them afraid by a show of force which itself is intimidating. The well considered authorities all hold that the conduct of a strike may be such as to constitute intimidation though there is no use of force or physical violence.\u201d <em>Levy &amp; Devaney, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Pocketbook Workers Union, </em>114 Conn. 319, 322, 158 A. 795 (1932); see also <em>Anaconda Co. </em>v. <em>United Automobile Workers, </em>supra, 164-65; cf. <em>Youngdahl v. Rainfair, Inc., </em>355 U.S. 131, 138-39, 78 S. Ct. 206, 2 L. Ed. 2d 151 (1957); <em>Smitty\u2019s Super Markets, Inc. </em>v. <em>Retail Store Employees Local 322, </em>637 S.W.2d 148, 155 (Mo. Ct. App. 1982). Concededly, the \u201cspoken threats\u201d and \u201cmoral intimidation\u201d must be of such a nature so that the picketers\u2019 first amendment rights will not be infringed by any court action. In the present case, however, the actions of the picketers went beyond that protected level. There was substantial evidence of cars being stopped by groups of picketers numbering ten to thirty people. As the nonstriking employees waited for the picketers\u2019 permission to enter, a function we have already noted the picketers impermissibly usurped, they were, as the trial court stated, \u201csubjected to threats, jeers and so forth.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that \u201c[pjhysical violence and prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>erty damage was feared.\u201d A similar conclusion was reached by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Youngdahl </em>v. <em>Rainfair, Inc., </em>supra: \u201cWhen, in a small community, more than 30 people get together . . . and heap abuse on their neighbors and former friends, a court is justified in finding that violence is imminent.\u201d Id., 138-39. There was also evidence that the picketers and, in particular, the union leaders acted belligerently towards the police and deliberately refused to comply with their requests regarding the conduct of the picket line. When all these facts are considered together, we cannot find that the trial court was clearly erroneous in determining that unlawful acts had been committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">To justify the issuance of an injunction against individual defendants and/or a union pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-115 (a) and 31-114, however, it is not enough that unlawful acts be committed by picketers who happen to be union members. \u201c[N]o injunction . . . shall be issued on account of any threat or unlawful act except against the person or persons, association or organization making the threat or committing the unlawful act or actually authorizing or ratifying the same after actual knowledge thereof . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-115 (a). General Statutes \u00a7 31-114 places even more stringent limits on a trial court before a finding of \u201cvicarious\u201d responsibility or liability would be justified. \u201cNo officer or member of any association or organization, and no association or organization participating or interested in a labor dispute, shall be held responsible or liable in any court for the unlawful acts of individual officers, members or agents, except upon proof of actual participation in, or actual authorization of, such acts, or ratification of such acts after actual knowledge thereof.\u201d The parameters of what constitutes \u201cactual\u201d participation, authorization or ratification have been discussed at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>length in two of our cases. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists, supra; Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local 299, </em>150 Conn. 266, 188 A.2d 499 (1963). Both cases impliedly adopted the view first espoused by the United States Supreme Court in <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America </em>v. <em>United States, </em>330 U.S. 395, 403, 67 S. Ct. 775, 91 L. Ed. 973 (1947), that responsibility for unlawful activity must be established by \u201cclear proof.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Federal courts applying the counterpart to our statute have said that \u201c[t]he statutory requirement of \u2018clear proof lies somewhere between the traditional burdens of reasonable doubt and preponderance of the evidence. <em>[United Mine Workers of America </em>v. <em>Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 737, 86 S. Ct. 1130, 16 L. Ed. 2d 218 (1966)].\u201d <em>Kayser-Roth Corporation </em>v. <em>Textile Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, </em>479 F.2d 524, 526 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 976, 94 S. Ct. 292, 38 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1973); see <em>Dacey </em>v. <em>Connecticut Bar Assn., </em>170 Conn. 520, 537, 368 A.2d 125 (1976). Both <em>United Aircraft and Benoit </em>also adopted the view that more than a showing of common law agency was required in order to establish that an officer of the union actually participated in, authorized or ratified unlawful activity. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists, </em>supra, 86-87; <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number><em>299, </em>supra, 274. As stated in <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists, </em>supra: \u201cWe conclude that, in requiring <em>actual </em>authorization in order to impose liability, it is the intent expressed in \u00a7 31-114 to require more than the agency rules of respondeat superior and more than the general authority with which an officer of the organization is clothed by virtue of his office. We subscribe to the proposition that the statute requires proof by the plaintiff that the acts complained of were either expressly authorized by the organization to be charged or were such that they flowed from that authorization. . . . When we come to the element of participation, we conclude that if representatives of the organization to be charged are proved to have actually taken part in the illegal acts complained of then the organization can be held liable for those acts depending upon the number and status of the persons participating and the extent of the organization\u2019s knowledge of and power to control their actions. In applying this rule, care must be taken in cases such as those before us to treat the individuals involved in their proper relationship.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) Id., 88-89. Finally, it should be noted that while the purpose of these statutes is to protect unions and their officers from liability, it is still true, and we have earlier held, that a union acts through the instrumentalities of individuals. <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local 299, </em>supra, 273. \u201cCertainly an association or organization cannot escape responsibility by standing orders disavowing authority on the part of its officers to make any agreements in violation of the Sherman Act and disclaiming union responsibility for such agreements. Facile arrangements do not create immunity from the act, whether they are made by employee or by employer groups.\u201d <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America </em>v. <em>United States, </em>supra, 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>With these principles in mind, there can be no doubt that the individual defendants and the union actually-participated in or authorized the picketing which we have previously concluded was unlawful. All six of the individual defendants were seen at various times at the picket line, with four of them either leading the picketers or walking in the line. The \u201cnumber and status\u201d of these six individuals were enough to hold the union responsible: one was the union president; two were business agents; two were designated as \u201cpicket captains\u201d by the president; and one was shop chairman. Furthermore, Wheeler, the union president, testified that the rotational picketing used was the union\u2019s normal procedure. In <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America, </em>the United States Supreme Court also said: \u201cAnd the custom or traditional practice of a particular union can also be a source of actual authorization of an officer to act for and bind the union.\u201d <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America v. United States, </em>supra, 410. While each case calls for an individual examination of the union hierarchy, under the circumstances of this case there was clear proof upon which the trial court could enjoin the defendant union.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">There was also clear proof that the individual defendants and the union participated in or authorized the verbal harassment and intimidation of the nonstriking employees which led to a situation in which physical violence and property damage was feared. As noted previously, all six defendants were at the picket line at various times while this was going on. Wheeler, himself, was described as being belligerent to a police lieutenant, as was Velez. Velez, Bower and Madore were all arrested for disobeying direct police orders. Another police report indicated that the \u201clabor leaders\u201d aggravated the situation on one occasion by inform<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>ing the picketers that they \u201ccould legally continue being verbally abusive.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Finally, at one point when a nonstriking employee\u2019s car was surrounded and was being attacked, Wheeler took no action to restrain the picketers; rather, he started yelling at the guard inside the gate. When a person in such a position remains effectively silent in the face of such activity, it clearly can be considered a relevant factor in determining the element of participation or authorization.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Considering this evidence as a whole, we conclude that the trial court was justified in finding clear proof that the defendants either participated in or authorized the harassment and intimidation, or that such actions \u201cflowed\u201d from that participation and/or authorization. <em>United Aircraft Corporation v. International Assn. of Machinists, </em>supra, 88. To hold otherwise would permit a \u201cfacile arrangement\u201d of union leaders appearing to stand apart to create immunity from the act; a consequence not intended by the use of the term \u201cactual\u201d participation or authorization. See <em>United Brotherhood of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of America v. United States, </em>supra; cf. <em>James R. Snyder Co. v. Edward Rose &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>546 F.2d 206, 209 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>Harlem River Consumers Coop., Inc. s. Associated Grocers, </em>450 F.2d 271, 273-74 (2d Cir. 1971); <em>White Oak Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers of America, </em>318 F.2d 591, 598 (6th Cir. 1963). Although there must be clear proof of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>authorization or participation, such proof may be circumstantial. See <em>James R. Snyder Co. </em>v. <em>Edward Rose &amp; Sons, Inc., </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">The next two elements that we will consider which Emhart was required to prove under the statute were that it suffered substantial and irreparable injury to its business or property and that it did not have an adequate remedy at law.' General Statutes \u00a7 31-115 (b) and (d). The trial court concluded that the effect of the defendants\u2019 actions on Emhart and its employees \u201ccannot but result in substantial and irreparable injury to [Emhart], over and above and separate from the economic effect of the strike.\u201d We agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that there was no adequate remedy at law because only the issuance of an injunction could prevent the continuing injury.

Sup. 157, 165, 382 A.2d 544 (1977); <em>Kaplan\u2019s Fruit &amp; Produce Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court of Los Angeles County, </em>26 Cal. 3d 60, 80-81, 603 P.2d 1341 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\">The next element that must be considered is whether \u201cas to each item of relief granted greater injury would be inflicted upon the complainant by the denial of relief than would be inflicted upon the defendants by the granting of relief . . . .\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-115 (c). The statute, in essence, contemplates a weighing of the equities in each case, a process which the trial court\u2019s memorandum indicates it undertook in this case. See generally <em>DeCecco </em>v. <em>Beach, </em>174 Conn. 29, 35, 381 A.2d 543 (1977). The injunction issued by the trial court did not prohibit all picketing. Rather, it was limited to prohibiting that picketing and/or violence which would interfere with the use of Emhart\u2019s property, activity which we have held unlawful. Therefore, weighing the substantial harm to Emhart with the fact that only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>unlawful activity is being restrained, we cannot conclude that the trial court erred in finding that Emhart satisfied this element of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">The final element under the statute that must be proven before an injunction may be issued is whether \u201cthe public officers charged with the duty to protect the complainant\u2019s property are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 31-115 (e). The trial court found that the Windsor police force could not \u201ccontinue to place the necessary personnel at the site of the picketing and ignore their duty to the whole community . . . .\u2019\u2019In their brief, the defendants challenge this finding by citing evidence which the trial court \u201capparently ignored.\u201d This argument, however, ignores the limited nature of our review. \u201cWhere there is conflicting evidence, as claimed by the defendants, we do not retry the facts or pass upon the credibility of.the witnesses. The trial court determines the credibility of witnesses; <em>Faiola </em>v. <em>Faiola, </em>156 Conn. 12, 15, 238 A.2d 405 [1968]; <em>Romaniello </em>v. <em>Dyna Distributors, Inc., </em>154 Conn. 605, 606, 227 A.2d 430 [1967]; and the weight of the evidence is not determined by the number of witnesses for or against any one proposition. <em>Cooke </em>v. <em>United Aircraft Corporation, </em>152 Conn. 214, 218, 205 A.2d 484 [1964]. Where the evidence, as here, is in conflict, its probative force is for the trier. <em>Parish of St. Andrew\u2019s Church </em>v. <em>Zoning Board of Appeals, </em>155 Conn. 350, 359, 232 A.2d 916 [1967].\u201d <em>Robert Lawrence Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Del Vecchio, </em>178 Conn. 1, 14, 420 A.2d 1142 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">The exact circumstances warranting a finding that the public officials were \u201cunwilling or unable\u201d to furnish adequate protection cannot be established in a single case. Rather, it should be a finding left to the discretion of the trial court in each instance. Certainly, there must be more than a \u201cpro forma\u201d request by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>employer to the police for aid. See <em>Cimarron Coal Corporation v. District No. 23, United Mine Workers, </em>416 F.2d 844, 846 (6th Cir. 1969). In addition, we would agree that, absent any other factors, if it was demonstrated that \u201cthe police authorities are maintaining at <em>all </em>times at [the] plant a force of officers sufficient to preserve order, to protect the property, and to allow all persons who wish to enter or leave to do so without physical interference, [there would be insufficient evidence to] make the necessary finding that those authorities are unable or unwilling to furnish adequate protection.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Heinz Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>United Auto Workers, </em>20 F. Sup. 116, 117 (E.D. Pa. 1937); see generally <em>Donnelly Garment Co. </em>v. <em>Dubinsky, </em>154 F.2d 38, 42-43 (8th Cir. 1946); 51B C.J.S., Labor Relations \u00a7 858. We are not faced with this type of situation, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">On the basis of what transpired from Monday, September 13,1982, through Thursday, September 16, 1982, we could not say the Windsor police were \u201cunwilling or unable\u201d to furnish adequate protection. Although Chief Patterson and Lieutenant Riccio were rebuffed by Wheeler when they attempted to talk to him about the picketing procedure on the day that it commenced, there was no evidence that the police either commanded the picketers to alter their procedure or that they took any action to compel the picketers to change. This evidence would have been relevant in establishing that the police were \u201cunable\u201d to act. In addition, there was no evidence that the police refrained from taking action in order to ensure that the situation remained under control. This type of evidence would have been relevant in determining whether the police were \u201cunwilling\u201d adequately to protect, and to provide reasonable access to, Emhart\u2019s property.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>The situation changed, however, on Friday, September 17,1982. From that day onward, Chief Patterson assigned an extra contingent of officers every morning and evening to open up the picket line. We have already noted the picketers\u2019 initial resistance to this procedure, and we also noted that as soon as the police left their positions, the picketers returned to their rotatio'nal picketing which obstructed access to and from the plant. On the basis of this evidence, the trial court could reasonably conclude that these extra officers would be necessary every day, and not only at peak rush hours, in order to assure free access to the plant. We have also set out Chief Patterson\u2019s testimony as to the effects on his force of continuing to assign extra officers to Emhart; officers were being pulled from other assignments; criminal investigations were not being followed up; and other traffic posts were not being manned. Even if we were to conclude that the police had the situation under control, we do not believe that the intent of the statute in using the terms \u201cunwilling or unable,\u201d was to require public officials to commit so much of their resources to one facility that the rest of a town would be left without adequate police service.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">We conclude that the trial court could have reasonably found that Emhart satisfied its burden of establishing each of the elements set forth in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114 and 31-115. Even when these criteria have been met, the issuance of an injunction still lies within the discretion of the trial court. <em>Hartford </em>v. <em>American Arbitration Assn., </em>174 Conn. 472, 477, 391 A.2d 137 (1978); see <em>Moore </em>v. <em>Seraf\u00edn, </em>163 Conn. 1, 6, 301 A.2d 238 (1972). Once the criteria have been met, however, our review is limited to whether the trial court abused its discretion. See <em>H. O. Canfield </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Co. v. <em>United Construction Workers, </em>136 Conn. 293, 299, 70 A.2d 547 (1949). We cannot so conclude in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Scope of the Injunction</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">The final issue to be addressed is the scope of the injunction. The defendants claim that the injunction is invalid because it is both overly broad and vague. Except for the final paragraph of the injunction, we do not agree with the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-7\">\u201cThe scope of a temporary injunction will depend on the nature of the case, the evidence presented in the hearing and the relief sought.\u201d <em>Eads Coal Co. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers of America, District No. </em>12, 131 Ill. App. 2d 1082, 1086, 269 N.E.2d 359 (1971); see <em>Berin </em>v. <em>Olson, </em>183 Conn. 337, 343, 439 A.2d 357 (1981); <em>Dupuis </em>v. <em>Submarine Base Credit Union, Inc., </em>170 Conn. 344, 356, 365 A.2d 1093 (1976); see generally <em>Old Ben Coal Corporation </em>v. <em>Local Union No. 1487 of United Mine Workers of America, </em>500 F.2d 950, 953 (7th Cir. 1974). In addition, an injunction prohibiting picketing must be limited so that it does not infringe a defendant\u2019s first amendment rights. See <em>Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 </em>v. <em>Logan Valley Plaza, Inc., </em>391 U.S. 308, 313-14, 88 S. Ct. 1601, 20 L. Ed. 2d 603 (1968); <em>Thornhill </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>310 U.S. 88, 60 S. Ct. 736, 84 L. Ed. 1093 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-8\">In the present case, the unlawful conduct being enjoined was the congregating and picketing in such fashion so as to impede ingress to and egress from the plant, and the use of harassment and intimidation so as to cause fear of physical injury to both person and property. Our review of the injunction indicates that this conduct is all that is being enjoined\u2014not lawful con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>duct which would be constitutionally protected. Paragraph A enjoins congregating and picketing which blocks or interferes with entry into the plant. Paragraph B enjoins the use of force or threat of force so as to impede access. Paragraph C limits the number of picketers that are to remain at the entrances. We believe that this is a reasonable limitation where the trial court concludes that the number of picketers has contributed to the situation giving rise to the threat of violence and blocking access to a plant. <em>Kay-Fries, Inc. </em>v. <em>Martino, </em>73 App. Div. 2d 342, 352, 426 N.Y.S.2d 304 (1980); see also <em>PTA Sales, Inc. </em>v. <em>Retail Clerks Local No. 462, </em>76 N.M. 581, 585, 633 P.2d 689 (1981); cf. <em>Johnson Brothers Wholesale Liquor Co. </em>v. <em>United Farm Workers National Union, AFL-CIO, </em>308 Minn. 87, 241 N.W.2d 292 (1976). Paragraph D enjoins the picketers from the use of threats or intimidation in conducting their strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">The final paragraph of the injunction prohibits the defendants from \u201c[interfering in any unlawful way with the operation of plaintiff\u2019s business.\u201d The court was obviously motivated by a concern for Emhart\u2019s business based upon the actions of the defendants. Furthermore, Emhart had included such a request for relief in their complaint. This paragraph, however, is not limited in any manner to the issues that arose during the hearing or that were mentioned in the memorandum of decision. Relying on paragraph E, the defendants could be found in violation of the court\u2019s order for activity completely unrelated to the picketing or any violence, or threat of violence, engendered by the defendants\u2019 conduct. We conclude, therefore, that this particular paragraph was impermissibly broad and must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">In determining whether an injunction is void for vagueness, the court in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Professional </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number><em>Air Traffic Controllers, </em>678 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1982), stated: \u201cThe \u2018void for vagueness\u2019 doctrine is a procedural due process concept which requires the giving of appropriate notice of a proscription before a person can be held accountable for its violation. Thus, a government regulation can neither forbid nor require \u2018the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application . . . .\u2019 <em>Connally </em>v. <em>General Construction Co., </em>269 U.S. 385, 391, 46 S. Ct. 126, 127, 70 L. Ed. 322 (1926).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">The injunction issued in this case, without considering paragraph E, clearly satisfies this test. The defendants first challenge paragraph A of the injunction which prohibits: \u201cA. Congregating in mass and engaging in mass picketing, or otherwise in close formation around the entrance or leading to the entrance of plaintiff\u2019s premises at Day Hill Road, Windsor, Connecticut, in such a way as to block said entrance and prevent, interfere with or impede entrance into or egress from said premises or streets leading to said premises by plaintiff\u2019s officers and employees, members of the public and persons doing business with the plaintiff who may wish to enter or leave.\u201d The defendants claim that the use of the words \u201cinterfere with or impede\u201d entrance into or egress from said premises is too vague because \u201c[tjaken literally, this language forbids all picketing and concerted activity because picketing, by its nature, will impede ingress and egress.\u201d The problem with the defendants\u2019 argument is that by lifting four words out of the whole paragraph, they do not actually represent what, in fact, it enjoins. For example, under the defendants\u2019 argument, if a small group of picketers is standing near the entrance to the plant, without blocking it in any way, and a nonstriking employee or other person having business with Emhart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>drives up to the plant, sees the pickets and decides not to enter, the picketers could be held in contempt for \u201cinterfering with or impeding\u201d access to the plant. Clearly, however, this situation is not covered by the injunction because there are two conditions that have not been met. First, the picketers have not been shown to be \u201c[congregating in mass and engaging in mass picketing, or otherwise in close formation . . . .\u201d Secondly, the picketers'have not been shown to be acting \u201caround the entrance or leading to the entrance [of the plant] in such a way as to block said entrance . . . .\u201d With these two conditions, the injunction prohibits only what we have found to be unlawful conduct. Rather than being vague, it is, in fact, quite explicit.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">The defendants\u2019 objection to paragraph B of the injunction suffers from the same fault as their first objection. That paragraph enjoins the following conduct: \u201cB. By force, violence or intimidation, or threat of force or violence, or by the use of offensive language or gestures, impeding or interfering with plaintiff\u2019s officers or employees, persons doing business with the plaintiff or members of the public who may wish to enter or leave the plaintiff\u2019s premises.\u201d The defendants claim that the words \u201cby the use of offensive language or gestures\u201d are vague because \u201cwhat is offensive to one person may not be to . . . anyone else.\u201d Thus, they claim, the injunction does not put them on notice of what conduct will subject them to contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">In support of their argument, the defendants cite <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1977-6), </em>34 Conn. Sup. 575, 377 A.2d 1342 (1976). This case, however, actually undermines the defendants\u2019 argument. The court there reversed a conviction for the use of an offensive gesture under a statute prohibiting \u201cabusive or obscene <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>language or [making] an obscene gesture.\u201d General Statutes \u00a7 53a-181. The court did not hold the statute unconstitutional because it was vague. In fact, it specifically stated that the \u201cexpression directed against a particular individual or group . . . might be beyond the pale of constitutionally protected speech.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anonymous (1977-6), </em>supra, 577, citing <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>315 U.S. 568, 571-72, 62 S. Ct. 766, 86 L. Ed. 1031 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In the present case, the use of the words \u201coffensive language or gestures\u201d cannot be considered in a vacuum. They are qualified inasmuch as their use must interfere or impede people from entering or leaving Emhart\u2019s plants. This language is somewhat similar to the statutory language which the Supreme Court upheld in <em>Chaplinsky </em>v. <em>New Hampshire, </em>supra, 569. The test which the state court applied in that case, and which was favorably cited by the Supreme Court is similar to the test set forth in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Professional Air Traffic Controllers, </em>supra. That is, the language and/or gestures must be such that an individual of common intelligence would feel threatened. The same test would control the injunction issued in this case. To require a trial court to delineate specifically each word or gesture which would be found offensive as well as the exact nature of what would constitute an interference with a person\u2019s doing business with Emhart would be impossible. On the other hand, the injunction cannot be interpreted so that the words are subject to the whim of any particular judge. Rather, what is prohibited is that conduct or language which would cause a reasonable individual to be threatened or feel threatened to such an extent that it would interfere with that individual\u2019s doing business with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Emhart. With this limitation, therefore, we cannot conclude that this paragraph is unconstitutionally vague.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">In conclusion, we hold that Emhart satisfied its burden in proving each of the criteria provided for in General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 31-114 and 31-115. Having satisfied this burden, the trial court was well within its discretion to issue an injunction. The entire injunction itself was properly entered except for paragraph E which we find to be overly broad. Therefore, there is no error in the judgment except for paragraph E of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">There is error in part, the judgment is set aside and the case is remanded with direction to render judgment as on file except that paragraph E of the injunction must be stricken.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b385-5\"> The temporary injunction entered by the court stated as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"A7G\">\u201cNOW THEREFORE, it is</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u201cORDERED that the Defendants and all their members, officers, agents, or employees, and all persons acting in concert with or otherwise par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>ticipating with the Defendants hereto or any of them or acting in their aid or behalf or under their direction, supervision or control be and they hereby are enjoined, restrained, and prohibited from:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u201cA.

For example, in this case, even though Chief Patterson testified as to the accuracy of the copies, if the defendants had requested to examine the originals and, after examination, they turned out to be different in some material aspect from the copies, the trial court could properly consider this factor in determining whether to admit the copies into evidence. If the court determined that the copies were admissible, this factor could still be utilized in determining how much weight to give to the copies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b404-5\"> We have stated that because our statutes are similar to the federal statute, the interpretation of the latter by the United States Supreme Court is deemed \u201cparticularly pertinent\u201d in construing our own statute. <em>United Aircraft Corporation </em>v. <em>International Assn. of Machinists, </em>161 Conn. 79, 85, 285 A.2d 330 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1016, 92 S. Ct. 675, 30 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1972); see <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local 299, </em>150 Conn. 266, 274, 188 A.2d 499 (1963).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b408-4\"> There was also testimony that license plate numbers of nonstriking employees were being reported. See <em>United Aircraft Corporation v. International Assn. of Machinists, </em>161 Conn. 79, 93, 95, 285 A.2d 330 (1971), cert. denied, 404 U.S. 1016, 92 S. Ct. 675, 30 L. Ed. 2d 663 (1972).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b410-4\"> The defendants claim that the burden of \u201cclear proof\u2019 also applies when proving that unlawful acts were committed. None of the cases cited by the defendants extends this burden beyond the area of proving union responsibility. In fact, in <em>Ramsey </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers of America, </em>401 U.S. 302, 91 S. Ct. 658, 28 L. Ed. 2d 64 (1971), the Supreme Court explicitly held that under the federal counterpart to General Statutes \u00a7 31-114; see <em>Benoit </em>v. <em>Amalgamated Local 299, </em>150 Conn. 266, 188 A.2d 499 (1963); the clear and convincing standard was only required \u201cas to the Union\u2019s authorization, participation in, or ratification of the acts allegedly performed on its behalf.\u201d Id., 311; see also <em>Harlem River Consumers Coop., Inc. </em>v. <em>Associated Grocers, </em>450 F.2d 271, 273 (2d Cir. 1971). We believe that unions and individual officers will be sufficiently protected by limiting this higher burden of proof to this element.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b413-4\"> As noted previously, we agree with the defendants that a trial court should view with skepticism a report attributing such a broad claim to an indefinite group of people such as \u201clabor leaders,\u201d especially where the officer who wrote the report is not in court to testify. The report, however, was admissible and, under the circumstances of this case in which it was consistent with other evidence, it could be given credence by the trial court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b413-5\"> In contrast, where a union officer does take some action to restrain the picketers but is unsuccessful in his efforts, this should not be relied upon as a factor demonstrating union participation or authorization. It should be the policy of our courts to encourage all reasonable efforts in ensuring labor peace.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b415-5\"> The defendants claim that any loss of access was due, in large part, to the actions of Emhart officials in closing three of the four entrances. We disagree. Emhart has the right to make reasonable use of its property, and in this case we have indicated that there was testimony that the decision to close the other gates was made after consultation with Chief Patterson who stated that it would be easier to ensure the safety of all concerned if only the one gate was opened. In these circumstances, we cannot conclude that the delays due to lack of access were self-inflicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b424-14\"><em> </em>The defendants\u2019 final challenge to paragraph C of the injunction is not at all related to its being vague and will not be considered to any greater extent than we have already done.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
