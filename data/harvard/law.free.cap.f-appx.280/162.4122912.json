For the reasons that follow, we will deny both petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Petitioners, wife and husband,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> are natives and citizens of Indonesia and are Christians. Alim entered the United States on January 11, 1999, as a B-2 non-immigrant visitor and was authorized to remain temporarily within the United States until February 10, 2000. On October 29, 2001, Alim was issued a Notice to Appear, which alleged that she was in the country without authorization. Kho entered the United States on November 5, 1998, as a B-2 non-immigrant visitor and was authorized to remain temporarily within the United States until November 4, 1999. On November 19, 2001, Kho was issued a Notice to Appear, which alleged that he was in the country without authorization. In response, Petitioners applied for asylum, withholding of removal, relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d), and voluntary departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">In denying their claims on September 19, 2005, the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) concluded that Petitioners\u2019 asylum applications were untimely. The IJ further found that Petitioners had not satisfied the requirements for withholding of removal pursuant to \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A) or for relief under the CAT. The IJ granted their applications for voluntary departure. On April 5, 2007, the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Thereafter, Petitioners filed a timely petition for review. (C.A. No. 07-2382.) On May 4, 2007, Petitioners filed a motion for reconsideration with the BIA, which the BIA denied on July 10, 2007. On August 9, 2007, Petitioners filed a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of their motion for reconsideration, (C.A. No. 07-3393), and moved to consolidate both petitions. The petitions for review have been consolidated and are ripe for disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-14\">Because the BIA\u2019s decision, which dismissed Petitioners\u2019 appeal, adopted a portion of the IJ\u2019s decision, we will review the determinations of both the BIA and the I J. <em>See Shehu v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>482 F.3d 652, 657 (3d Cir.2007). We will sustain their determinations if they are supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>Id. </em>Under the substantial evidence standard, we will uphold the determinations of the BIA and the IJ \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (citations omitted). We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion for reconsideration for an abuse of discretion. <em>Nocon v. I.N.S., </em>789 F.2d 1028, 1033 (3d Cir.1986). Under the abuse of discretion standard, the BIA\u2019s decision may be reversed only if it is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 174 (3d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-15\">In most cases, we have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal involving the denial of asylum. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). However, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3) provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review any determination regarding the timeliness of an asylum application and the applicability of the exceptions. <em>See Tarrawally v. Ashcroft, </em>338 F.3d 180, 185 (3d Cir.2003). Petitioners argue that we have jurisdiction to review the denial of their asylum applications because the IJ and the BIA failed to apply the proper legal standard in determining the timeliness of them applications.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> More <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>specifically, Petitioners argue that the IJ and BIA failed to properly review the evidence in the record by failing to consider Petitioner Alim\u2019s psychological evaluation. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">The IJ\u2019s decision states, \u201c[t]he Court has considered <em>all </em>of the reasoning that the respondents have provided the Court as to why they filed an application in a tardy fashion, and the Court, therefore, finds that none of these reasons amount to ... extraordinary circumstances as that term is defined.\u201d (Petr.\u2019s App. 11) (emphasis added). On appeal, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and reasoning for denying Petitioners\u2019 asylum applications and specifically stated that the Petitioners had failed to \u201cdemonstrate the existence of extraordinary circumstances preventing them from filing for asylum within the statutory and regulatory time limits.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 12.) The BIA\u2019s decision denying reconsideration further reiterates that the BIA considered the evidence in the record, stating \u201cthe respondent wife\u2019s emotional impairment was considered but was not deemed to have been of such nature as to excuse timely filing of the asylum application.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Based on the foregoing, we conclude that the IJ and the BIA properly considered the evidence in the record. Accordingly, because there is no legal error, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s determination regarding the timeliness of Petitioners\u2019 asylum application and the applicability of the exceptions. <em>See Tarraivally, </em>338 F.3d at 185.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Petitioners also argue that the IJ and the BIA erred in concluding that they failed to establish past persecution on account of race, religion and membership in a particular social group. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). To obtain withholding of removal, Petitioners must demonstrate a \u201cclear probability\u201d that their \u201c[lives] or freedom would be threatened\u201d on account of one of the aforementioned grounds. <em>Wang v. Gonzales, </em>405 F.3d 134, 139 (3d Cir.2005); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). If, however, Petitioners establish that they suffered past persecution it is presumed that their lives or freedom would be threatened for purposes of withholding of removal. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). The Government may then rebut this presump-tion by proving certain criteria by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(A)-(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-10\">\n<em>Petitioner Alim</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b190-11\">At her hearing before the IJ, Alim testified that she was afraid to return to Indonesia because, while residing there, she was the victim of an attempted rape. Two Muslim men attacked her and her friend after their motorcycle broke down. An elderly man stopped and prevented the men from raping her and assisted Alim and her friend in returning home. Alim did not report the incident to the police. After that incident, she worked from her home because she was afraid to go outside. Alim also testified that in 1998, her friend\u2019s father was murdered. Several individuals broke into a store owned by her friend\u2019s parents, and then struck her friend\u2019s father until he was unconscious. The assailants then poured gasoline over his unconscious body and lit him on fire. The store was located approximately one hour away from Alim\u2019s residence. Alim also testified that her brother still resides and works in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">The IJ concluded, and the BIA affirmed, that the attempted rape incident, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>certainly horrendous, was an isolated criminal event, which was not motivated by Alim\u2019s ethnicity or religion. Alim argues that, because the IJ and the BIA failed to consider whether she established persecution based on a particular social group, specifically her gender, we should remand her case for further consideration. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Alim\u2019s application for withholding of removal asserts that she was persecuted on account of being a \u201cChinese woman,\u201d living in Indonesia, not simply as a female living in Indonesia. (Petr.\u2019s App. 90.) Alim\u2019s membership in a social group is, therefore, dependent on her ethnicity as well as her gender. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the attempted rape of Alim was not motivated by her ethnicity addressed not only her claim involving persecution on account of ethnicity, but also her claim involving persecution on account of her membership in a particular social group, i.e., as a Chinese woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">We further conclude that the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s decisions regarding Alim\u2019s withholding of removal application are supported by substantial evidence in the record. Alim\u2019s account of isolated criminal acts do not rise to the level of persecution that would compel a contrary conclusion to the determinations of the IJ and the BIA. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005). Furthermore, none of the incidents recounted by Alim compels the conclusion that she has established a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>Petitioner Kho</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Kho testified that he left Indonesia because conditions were chaotic. While residing in Indonesia, his car was stopped by rioters, who then attacked him. The rioters broke out the windows of his car, pulled him out of the vehicle, and kicked him in the face. The rioters took his wallet and wristwatch, and broke his arm by hitting him with a stick. A security guard eventually got Kho back into his vehicle and drove him away from the scene. Kho testified that he went to the hospital as a result of the attack and stayed overnight for treatment. He did not report the incident to the police. Kho also testified that a threatening flyer had been put on his front porch, which stated, \u201ckill the Chinese\u201d, and \u201cwe will impregnate the women.\u201d Several of the flyers had been distributed throughout Kho\u2019s neighborhood. Additionally, when Kho last spoke to his mother, who still resides in Indonesia, she told him that, while holding a worship meeting at her home, three or four Muslim members of the community stopped by to question her regarding the gathering in her home. Kho\u2019s mother told the group that she was simply visiting with friends. The group left, but warned Kho\u2019s mother that she could not hold prayer meetings without a permit.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Upon review of the record, we conclude that the determinations by the BIA and the IJ are supported by substantial evidence. Persecution is defined as \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993)). None of the incidents Kho testified regarding compels a contrary conclusion to the findings of the BIA and the IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">Given the deferential standard of review that governs, we will not disturb the decisions of the BIA and the IJ.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> For the foregoing reasons, we will deny Petitioners\u2019 petitions for review. In light of our disposition of Petitioners\u2019 petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>view, Petitioners\u2019 motion for a stay of removal is denied as moot. <em>See Catney v.
