GORSUCH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b740-11\">On April 1, 1991, Jerry Lewis Brown was convicted pursuant to two separate plea agreements of one count of rape by instrumentation after former conviction of two or more felonies, one count of first degree rape after former conviction of two or more felonies, one count of second degree rape, one count of second degree rape after former conviction of two or more felonies, and two counts of lewd molestation. Mr. Brown received a life sentence on each count.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">On February 20, 2007, Mr. Brown filed a <em>;pro se </em>petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, arguing that (1) he was mentally incompetent at the time he entered into his plea agreements and (2) his counsel was ineffective in not discovering this fact. On February 26, 2007, 2007 WL 641520, the district court determined that the petition was subject to dismissal as barred by the one-year statute of limitations applicable to habeas corpus proceedings and ordered Mr. Brown to show cause why his petition should not be dismissed. Mr. Brown timely responded to the court\u2019s order, arguing that after exhausting his state remedies in 1994 jailhouse lawyers and prison clerks refused to assist him, in part because his \u201ccrimes involve very small children.\u201d Mr. Brown further asserted that he has a severe reading disability, was not made aware of the one-year statute of limitations, and remains mentally incompetent. The district court found that none of these proffered reasons entitled Mr. Brown to equitable tolling of the limitations period, and dismissed his petition as time barred. Mr. Brown filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment, attaching two handwritten statements from fellow inmates stating that Mr. Brown \u201cappears to [the declarant] to be incapable of rational thought.\u201d App., Doc. 8. The district court denied the motion, as well as Mr. Brown\u2019s motion for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>(\u201cIFP\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-17\">Mr. Brown now seeks a COA from this court and also renews his motion to proceed IFP. Because Mr. Brown\u2019s petition was denied on procedural grounds, we may issue a COA only if Mr. Brown makes \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), such that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling,\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). Based on our independent review of the record in this case, and for substantially the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>reasons given by the district court, we conclude that no reasonable jurist could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s statute of limitations ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) established a one-year statute of limitations for filing a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). For prisoners such as Mr. Brown whose convictions became final prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment on April 24, 1996, the limitations period began on the date on which AEDPA was enacted and expired a year later, on April 24, 1997.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A); <em>United States v. Hurst, </em>322 F.3d 1256, 1259-61 (10th Cir.2003). Mr. Brown filed his petition nearly a decade after the limitations period expired, and so unless he can demonstrate that the limitations period was equitably tolled, his petition was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Mr. Brown has not, however, made a showing sufficient to lead any reasonable jurists to debate whether he was entitled to equitable tolling. We have squarely held that the fact that a prisoner did not know about AEDPA\u2019s limitations period does not entitle the prisoner to equitable tolling, <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998); neither, more broadly, does \u201cignorance of the law, even for an incarcerated pro se petitioner, ... excuse prompt filing,\u201d <em>Marsh v. Soares, </em>223 F.3d 1217, 1220 (10th Cir.2000). With respect to his claim that he was mentally incompetent from April 24, 1996 to April 24, 1997, the district court correctly noted that we have never recognized mental incapacity as a justification for equitable tolling. <em>Harms v. Internal Revenue Serv., </em>321 F.3d 1001, 1006 (10th Cir.2003). Moreover, those courts that do recognize equitable tolling for mental incapacity only do so in \u201cexceptional circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Brown\u2019s response to the district court\u2019s order failed to indicate any evidence pointing to his incompetence during 1996-97, let alone that his mental incapacity elevates his circumstances to the exceptional. Indeed, nowhere does Mr. Brown even indicate the nature of his incompetence, such as by identifying himself as developmentally disabled or by pointing to a specific mental illness from which he suffers. The only detail about his mental incompetence Mr. Brown provided in his response is that it does not require that he be confined to the prison medical unit. And though Mr. Brown\u2019s petition appears to state that he was certified as incompetent by health professionals in 1977, that was 20 years prior to the time period relevant to this matter. The only evidence Mr. Brown is able to muster of his incompetence in 1996-97 is the written statements of two fellow inmates attached to his motion to alter or amend the judgment. These statements, however, provide neither the declarant\u2019s qualifications to make judgments about mental capacity, nor, apart from general observation, the basis for the opinions expressed. These statements are, moreover, completely silent as to anything exceptional about Mr. Brown\u2019s circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Finally, with respect to Mr. Brown\u2019s motion to proceed IFP, we note that his \u201cStatement of Institutional Accounts\u201d indicates that he has in excess of $850 in his savings account, and under Okla. Stat. tit. 57, \u00a7 549(A)(5), funds from an inmate\u2019s savings account may be used for fees or costs in filing a federal action. Thus, Mr. Brown apparently has the financial ability to pay the $455 filing fee for this appeal, and he has offered no convinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ing reason to conclude otherwise. He is therefore ordered to pay the requisite filing fee and his motion to proceed IFP is denied. <em>See United States v. Silva, </em>430 F.3d 1096, 1100 (10th Cir.2005); <em>see also Clark v. Oklahoma, </em>468 F.3d 711, 714-15 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b740-13\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b741-7\">. Mr. Brown does not suggest that application of any of the other provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1) would result in a longer limitations period, nor did he pursue any post-conviction relief during the one-year limitations period that would entitle him to statutory tolling under Section 2244(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
