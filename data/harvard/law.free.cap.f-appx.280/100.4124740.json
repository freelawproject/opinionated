These are defendants\u2019 second appeals; their first appeals resulted in affirmance of their convictions, vacatur of their sentences, and remand for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2005). <em>See United States v. Argentina, </em>137 Fed.Appx. 428 (2d Cir.2005). Familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review are presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-20\">A. <em>Brasco. </em>Brasco argues that his Confrontation Clause rights were violated by the admission of hearsay, and by the government\u2019s failure to preserve the declarant\u2019s testimony before his death. These arguments are foreclosed by the law of the case doctrine, as we addressed them on Brasco\u2019s first appeal. <em>See United States v. Quintieri, </em>306 F.3d 1217, 1229 (2d Cir.2002). We identify no intervening change of controlling law or other compelling reason that warrants revisiting our previous rulings on these issues. <em>See United States v. Tenzer, </em>213 F.3d 34, 39 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-21\">B. <em>Rankins. </em>Rankins\u2019s Rule 33 motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence was properly denied as untimely. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 (requiring such motion to be \u201cfiled within 3 years after the verdict or finding of guilty\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-22\">Having finished serving his sentence of incarceration, Rankins has withdrawn his appeal insofar as it affects his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-23\">Finding no merit in Brasco\u2019s or Ran-kins\u2019s remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgments of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
