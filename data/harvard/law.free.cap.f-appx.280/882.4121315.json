Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). Where the BIA expressly adopts and affirms the IJ\u2019s decision and adds its own analysis, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Savoury v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>449 F.3d 1307, 1312 (11th Cir.2006). To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) (en banc). We will affirm the IJ or BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number><em>v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-4\">The Attorney General \u201cmay not remove an alien to a country if the Attorney General decides that the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). \u201cAn alien bears the burden of demonstrating that [she] more-likely-than-not would be persecuted or tortured upon [her] return to the country in question.\u201d <em>Mendoza, </em>327 F.3d at 1287. If credible, a petitioner\u2019s testimony may be enough to satisfy this burden without corroboration. <em>Id. </em>An applicant for withholding of removal may not show merely that she is a member of a particular social group, but must show persecution on account of membership in a particular social group. <em>Castillo-A\u00f1as v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>446 F.3d 1190, 1198 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 977, 166 L.Ed.2d 709 (2007); INA \u00a7 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-6\">The burden of proof is on the applicant to establish eligibility for withholding of removal under the CAT. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2); <em>Reyes-Sanchez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>369 F.3d 1239, 1242 (11th Cir.2004). The applicant must establish that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if returned to the proposed country of removal. <em>Id. </em>The applicant must also demonstrate that the feared torture would be by the government or with the government\u2019s acquiescence. <em>Reyes-Sanchez, </em>369 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b910-7\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test and will not substitute our judgment for that of the IJ or BIA with respect to credibility findings. <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b910-8\">[T]he IJ [or BIA] must offer specific, cogent reasons for an adverse credibility finding. Once an adverse credibility finding is made, the burden is on the applicant alien to show that the IJ\u2019s [or BIA\u2019s] credibility decision was not supported by specific, cogent reasons or was not based on substantial evidence. A credibility determination, like any fact finding, may not be overturned unless the record compels it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b910-11\"><em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1282, 1287 (11th Cir.2005) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b910-12\">\u201cIndications of reliable testimony include consistency on direct examination, consistency with the written application, and the absence of embellishments.\u201d <em>Ruiz v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>440 F.3d 1247, 1255 (11th Cir.2006). If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain her burden of proof in establishing her eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. \u201cConversely, an adverse credibility determination alone may be sufficient to support the denial of an asylum application.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe weaker an applicant\u2019s testimony, ... the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). We have held that an applicant\u2019s failure to mention certain aspects of her claim before the hearing can support an adverse credibility finding. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287 (holding that in light of an applicant\u2019s omission of various relevant facts from his asylum application, \u201csubstantial evidence supported] the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"AAv\">In this case, the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision and added its own analysis regarding the adverse credibility finding. Therefore, we review, under the substantial evidence test, the IJ\u2019s decision regarding eligibility for withholding of removal and CAT relief, and the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>at 1284; <em>Savoury, </em>449 F.3d at 1312; <em>Adefemi, </em>386 F.3d at 1026-27. Upon review of the record, and upon consideration of the briefs of the parties, we conclude that the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding, and the IJ\u2019s findings regarding Doumbia\u2019s eligibility withholding of removal and CAT relief, were based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">The IJ and BIA explicitly found that Doumbia\u2019s testimony was not credible, they gave specific, cogent reasons for their determination, and their findings were supported by substantial evidence. Because Doumbia was found not to be credible, she needed to present other evidence to establish eligibility for withholding of removal or CAT relief, but she failed to do so. Thus, substantial evidence supports the finding that Doumbia was not eligible for withholding of removal or CAT relief. Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-6\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b909-14\">. Doumbia concedes that we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s determination that her asylum application was untimely. <em>See </em>INA \u00a7 208(a)(3), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
