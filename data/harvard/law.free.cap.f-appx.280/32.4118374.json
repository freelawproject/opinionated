Mejia was sentenced principally to life imprisonment. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">Mejia challenges his conviction on two grounds, neither of which have any merit. His first argument is that the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress inculpatory statements, and the fruits thereof, was in error. Mejia contends that his multiple <em>Miranda </em>waivers were invalidated by a police officer\u2019s subsequent assurance, made in response to Mejia\u2019s fears of gang reprisals, that his statements would not be disclosed to other members of Mejia\u2019s criminal organization, \u201cMS-13.\u201d This argument was not raised in the District Court, and for good reason, since it is completely devoid of merit. The police officer\u2019s comments did not undermine the repeated warnings given to Mejia that his statements could be used against him in legal proceedings, and therefore do not cause us to question that his <em>Miranda </em>waiver was made knowingly and voluntarily-</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Mejia\u2019s second challenge arises from the government\u2019s introduction into evidence of a videotape recording of members of MS-13 attending a wake for one of its deceased members. This videotape\u2019s probative value, Mejia contends, was \u201cfar outweighed\u201d by its prejudicial impact and should have been excluded by the District Court pursuant to Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. \u201cWe review evidentiary rulings under a deferential abuse of discretion standard and give district court judges wide latitude in determining whether evidence is admissible at trial.\u201d <em>Meloff v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 138, 148 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). The significant probative value of this videotape is clear: it confirmed the existence of the MS-13 gang and corroborated the testimony of the government\u2019s expert witness with respect to the gang\u2019s practices and conduct. This evidence went directly to the issue of whether Mejia\u2019s criminal conduct was related to a racketeering enterprise. Balanced against this substantial probative value is the danger that the videotape of a young man\u2019s wake \u2014 possibly the result of gang violence \u2014 would unfairly prejudice the jury against Mejia. We find this risk of unfair prejudice vanishingly small, particularly in light of the District Court\u2019s limiting instructions, and see no abuse of discretion in the Court\u2019s decision to admit the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-11\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
