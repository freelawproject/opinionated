Scott raises four issues on appeal. First, Scott argues that the district court\u2019s sentence of 120 months was not an upward variance based on factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), but rather an upward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. He thus asserts that the court committed procedural error by failing to consider the appropriateness of the next criminal history category when it upwardly departed, as required under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Second, Scott argues that even if the district court imposed a variance rather than a departure, the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors alone cannot support the extraordinary variance, particularly because many of the bases for the sentence were already accounted for in the calculated guideline range, thereby making the 120-month sentence unreasonable. Third, Scott contends that the district court plainly erred by violating his Confrontation Clause rights when it considered the hearsay evidence in his codefendants\u2019 presentence investigation reports (\u201cPSi\u201d), without providing Scott the opportunity to rebut that information. Finally, Scott argues that a breakdown in the relationship between his attorney and him resulted in ineffective assistance of counsel during Scott\u2019s sentencing hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-5\">I. Section 3553(a) Variance/Section 4A1.3 Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">We review a district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and its application of the guidelines to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Kinard, </em>472 F.3d 1294, 1297 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). In <em>United States v. </em>Irizarry, 458 F.3d 1208, 1211 (11th Cir.2006), <em>pet. for cert. granted, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 828, 169 L.Ed.2d 625 (2008), in determining whether a sentence was imposed as a result of a guidelines departure or a variance pursuant to \u00a7 3553(a), we considered the process undertaken by the district court in making its determination. Specifically, we found that the sentence imposed was a variance due to the following factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-11\">The district court correctly calculated the advisory guidelines range. The court then considered the adequacy of this range in the light of the sentencing factors listed in 18 U.S.C. section 3553(a) and the evidence presented at the sentencing hearing. After concluding that the guidelines range did not adequately address the future risk Defendant posed to the public, the court exercised its <em>post-Booker </em>discretion to impose a reasonable sentence outside the sentencing guidelines range.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 1211-1212 (internal citations omitted) (holding that notice required for upward departure was not required in this case because the sentence was an upward variance, which requires no notice).</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">Section 4A1.3 of the guidelines allows a sentencing court to upwardly depart when it believes that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes....\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l). When departing upward under \u00a7 4A1.3, \u201cthe court must look first to the next criminal history category. If that categoiy adequately reflects the defendant\u2019s past conduct, then the court must state its findings and sentence the defendant within the range for the new category.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>989 F.2d 1137, 1142 (11th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted). If the court finds that this new category is still inadequate to reflect the defendant\u2019s criminal history, \u201cthe court must look to the next highest category and repeat its inquiry.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">To determine a reasonable sentence or impose a variance from a defendant\u2019s guideline range, the district court must consider the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>including the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense, and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-4\">Because the district court explicitly stated that it was conducting a variance pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and enumerated several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in arriving at its sentence, the court committed no procedural error because it was not required to consider intervening criminal history categories as it would were it conducting an upward departure under 28 U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">II. Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">We review a final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785 (11th Cir.2005). In conducting this review, we apply a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We first review whether the district court committed a procedural error, such as incorrectly calculating the guidelines, treating the guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, imposing a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence. <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. If there were no such procedural errors, we \u201cthen consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.; see also United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1182 n. 3 (11th Cir.2006) (identifying distinct inquiries into procedural and substantive aspects of a sentence). This review involves inquiring whether the \u00a7 3553(a) factors supported the sentence and justified any deviation from the defendant\u2019s sentencing range. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 600. The factors presented in \u00a7 3553(a) include:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-13\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-14\"><em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and we will not \u201csubstitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because our review is not <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) (internal citations and quotations omitted), abrogated on other grounds by <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-17\">In its recent <em>Gall </em>decision, the Supreme Court stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-18\">In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may ... take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines. We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinar/ circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range. We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b955-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. at 594-95. When a sentencing judge determines that a non-guideline sentence is warranted, \u201che must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597. However, \u201ca major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In reviewing the sentence for reasonableness, an appellate court \u201cmay consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance. The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A defendant challenging his sentence bears the burden of establishing that- it is unreasonable. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">The district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, basing its decision, in part, on Scott\u2019s substantial criminal history, including previous fraud-related convictions for which Scott received no criminal history points, and which were therefore not accounted for in his advisory guideline range. The court also considered Scott\u2019s ongoing criminal conduct, a factor that was also not accounted for in Scott\u2019s advisory guideline range. The court\u2019s decision to sentence Scott to 120 months was therefore reasonable, because that decision was based upon the need to reflect the seriousness of Scott\u2019s offense, as well as to provide just punishment and to protect the public from Scott\u2019s further fraudulent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">III. Opportunity to Rebut Hearsay Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">In <em>United States v. Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d 1490 (11th Cir.1990), we held that, \u201c[a] court may consider any information (including hearsay), regardless of its admissibility at trial, in determining whether factors exist that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, provided that the information is sufficiently reliable.\u201d <em>Castellanos, </em>904 F.2d at 1495. \u201cThe district court may rely on such evidence \u2018as long as the evidence has sufficient indicia of reliability, the court makes explicit findings of fact as to credibility, and the defendant has an opportunity to rebut the evidence.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Zlatogur, </em>271 F.3d 1025, 1031 (11th Cir.2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-12\">When a defendant raises a sentencing argument for the first time on appeal, we review for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). Under plain error review, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325,. 1328-29 (11th Cir.2005). If these three prongs are met, we may exercise our discretion to notice the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 1329. \u201cAn error is plain it if is obvious and clear under current law.\u201d <em>United States v. Eckhardt, </em>466 F.3d 938, 948 (11th Cir.2006). For an error to affect substantial rights, \u201cin most cases it means that the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). The party seeking to establish plain error has the burden of persuasion as to prejudice. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1299 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-13\">Scott has not met his burden of persuasion as to demonstrating that any plain error was prejudicial; that is, that it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings. There is no constitutional right to confrontation during sentencing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>and the district court\u2019s consideration of the PSIs did not affect the outcome of Scott\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">IV. Ineffective Assistance</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are generally not considered for the first time on appeal, except in cases where the record is sufficiently developed. <em>United States v. Verbitskaya, </em>406 F.3d 1324, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (addressing defendant\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim because record was sufficiently developed). An appellate court generally cannot adequately decide an ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised for the first time on direct appeal because the focus at trial was not whether defense counsel\u2019s actions were prejudicial or supported by reasonable strategy. <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504-05, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1694, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003). The preferable means for deciding a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel is through a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion, \u201ceven if the record contains some indication of deficiencies in counsel\u2019s performance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">There could be a number of reasons why Johnson made the decisions he did in representing Scott, and the record here is insufficient to establish whether Johnson was truly ineffective or used sound strategy during the sentencing phase of his representation. Moreover, Scott argues that the record as a whole should be considered. However, Scott\u2019s claim is expressly limited to the sentencing phase, and it is unclear what effect the record as a whole would have on an analysis of counsel\u2019s performance at sentencing, without further development of the record. Thus, we decline to consider these claims on direct appeal, without prejudice to Scott\u2019s ability to raise them later in a \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-7\">Upon consideration of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we discern no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b956-20\">.
