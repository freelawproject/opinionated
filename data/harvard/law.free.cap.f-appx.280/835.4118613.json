Raborn. But the land had come to Douglas K. Raborn in a document entitled \u201cConveyance Deed to Trustee Under Trust Agreement,\u201d and the document purports to convey the land to \u201cDouglas K. Raborn, as Trustee under the Raborn Farm Trust Agreement dated January 25, 1991.\u201d A dispute arose about whether the land could be lawfully included in Raborn\u2019s bankruptcy estate. The Bankruptcy Trustee argued \u201cYes\u201d; and he prevailed in the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-22\">On appeal, we faced an issue of state law \u2014 the meaning of the conveyance \u2014 that we considered outcome determinative. Setting out the background in some detail, we certified the state law issue to the Supreme Court of Florida. <em>In re Raborn, </em>470 F.3d 1319 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-23\">The Supreme Court of Florida clarified the applicable state law for us. <em>See Raborn v. Menotte, </em>974 So.2d 328 (Fla.2008) (holding that the deed in question conveys the land in trust, not fee simple).</p>\n<p id=\"b861-24\">In the light of the Florida opinion, we conclude that the pertinent land cannot be part of the bankruptcy estate. Therefore, we vacate the grant of summary judgment to the Bankruptcy Trustee and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-25\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
