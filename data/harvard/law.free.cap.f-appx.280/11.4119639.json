His violation was the commission of anoth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>er federal offense: in 2006, Carrera pled guilty to a charge of car-jacking in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2119(1), based upon conduct which occurred in March 2005, while he was on supervised release from his imprisonment for the 1997 offense. The district court revoked his supervised release term and imposed a sentence of eighteen months, to be served consecutively to a fifty-month sentence for his carjacking conviction. Carrera has filed a notice of appeal. Appellant\u2019s counsel has filed a brief under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting the lack of any meritorious ground for appeal, and has moved to withdraw as counsel. Carrera has not filed a separate pro se brief. As required by <em>Anders, </em>we have conducted a full examination of the proceedings. Because it is clear that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, we affirm the revocation and sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<p id=\"b38-4\">\u201cWe review revocation sentences for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. McInnis, </em>429 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). \u201cThe statutory maximum, based on the original offense rather than the grade of release violation, ultimately limits the court\u2019s sentencing discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, Carrera\u2019s original 1997 offense of conspiracy to distribute multi-kilogram quantities of cocaine and crack cocaine was a Class A felony. The eighteen-month revocation sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum for a Class A felony (5 years). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-5\">Consistent with 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e), the court stated that it had considered the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(1) before it arrived at the revocation sentence. The court took into account the advisory guideline range under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4, and imposed a sentence within that range (acknowledging that it was not required to do so). <em>See McInnis, </em>429 F.3d at 4 (\u201cPursuant to \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B), the court need only consider, not implement, the advisory sentence range provided in the guidelines\u2019 policy statements\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b38-8\">Based upon a Grade A violation of supervised release (the 2006 ear-jacking offense) and a criminal history category (CHC) of I for the 1997 offense, the court correctly identified the guideline imprisonment range as 12-18 months. At sentencing, defense counsel argued that the district court should have applied the guideline imprisonment range of 4-10 months contained in the Magistrate Judge\u2019s July 2005 Report and Recommendation. However, the Report and Recommendation pre-dated Carrera\u2019s guilty plea to the federal car-jacking offense on which this revocation was based. It was prepared in connection with the Probation Officer\u2019s initial motion for revocation based upon Carrera\u2019s arrest under Puerto Rico charges of robbery and firearm possession. The Magistrate Judge determined that violation to be a \u201cGrade B violation,\u201d yielding the guideline range of 4-10 months under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B1.4. The Probation Officer later filed an amended motion for revocation based upon the federal car-jacking charge, which was correctly determined to be a \u201cGrade A violation,\u201d yielding a 12-18 month range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b38-9\">The district court clarified in response to \u25a0 defense counsel\u2019s request for reconsideration, that it had considered the criminal history pre-dating the 1997 offense (not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>the 2006 offense) in arriving at the revocation sentence. The record supports the district court\u2019s statement that Carrera\u2019s \u201ccriminal history up to [the commission of the 1997 offense] was violent.\u201d The presentence investigation report (PSR) for the 1997 offense reported a prior criminal conviction of aggravated assault. <em>See </em>PSR, p. 8. There was no abuse of discretion in the sentencing court\u2019s consideration of that criminal history or the violent nature of the car-jacking offense in determining the length of the revocation sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">In imposing a consecutive sentence, the district court correctly stated that it was following the policy (rather than mandate) of the Sentencing Commission. <em>See </em>Sent. Tr., p. 13. There is no suggestion that the court misinterpreted the guidelines to <em>require </em>a consecutive sentence. <em>Cf. United States v. Crudup, </em>375 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.2004) (holding that 2003 amendment to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3 worked a substantive change to that guideline by \u201ceneourag[ing] district courts to impose consecutive sentences, while at the same time permitting them \u2014 in the exercise of their sound discretion \u2014 to make the federal sentence concurrent\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b39-6\">Carrera objected at the revocation sentencing hearing that the negotiations that led to the amended plea agreement for the 2006 car-jacking offense included the parties\u2019 alleged agreement to recommend a 10-month, concurrent sentence in the revocation case. There is nothing in the amended plea agreement itself to indicate that any such promise was part of the negotiation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the parties had so agreed, there would not have been a breach since the parties both did recommend a 10-month concurrent sentence. Finally, the amended plea agreement was entered with respect to the 2006 offense which was before a different district court judge for sentencing than the judge who presided over the revocation proceedings in this case. There was no plea agreement entered with respect to the violation of supervised release. The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to following the parties\u2019 recommendation to impose a concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-9\">The revocation of appellant\u2019s supervised release term and the imposition of an 18-month consecutive sentence are <em>affirmed. </em>Appellant\u2019s counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is <em>granted.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b38-6\">. U.S.S.G. 7B1.1 classifies violations according to the type of offense committed by the conduct of the releasee, and defines a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d with reference to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2, which in turn relies upon the statutory elements of the offense and potential punishments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b39-7\">. The amended plea agreement for the 2006 offense makes no mention of the pending revocation proceedings with respect to the 1997 offense, and it contains a provision that the written agreement \"constitutes the complete agreement between the United States, the defendant, and defendant\u2019s counsel,\" and that the government \u201chas made no promises or representations except as set forth in writing in this plea agreement and den[ies] the existence of any other term and conditions not stated herein.\u201d Amended Plea Agreement, Dkt.
