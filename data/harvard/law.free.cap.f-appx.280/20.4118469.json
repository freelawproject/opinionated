Bianchini, Magistrate Judge), dated July 9, 2007, affirming a decision of Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) Joseph F. Gibbons, dated October 19, 2005, which denied Rivers\u2019s application for supplemental social security income (SSI) and disability benefits (DIB). We assume the parties familiarity with the facts and the extensive procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-14\">The ALJ\u2019s task in these proceedings was to determine whether Rivers had a \u201cdisability,\u201d <em>see </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 423(d)(1)(A), and therefore eligible for social security benefits for two periods \u2014 from September 1, 1978 to September 16, 1984, and from May 1, 1989 to October 31, 1995.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cWhen deciding an appeal from a denial of disability benefits, we focus on the administrative ruling rather than the district court\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Green-Younger v. Barnhart, </em>335 F.3d 99, 105 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conduct a plena<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>ry review of the administrative record to determine whether, considering the record as a whole, substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s decision and the correct legal standards have been applied. <em>See Shaw v. Chater, </em>221 F.3d 126, 131 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">As an initial matter, we note that Rivers does not contest the ALJ\u2019s determination that she was ineligible for DIB during the second period, from 1989 to 1995, because she failed to meet the insured status requirements at the time of her alleged onset of disability. Because Rivers did not apply for DIB for the first period, our review concerns only Rivers\u2019s eligibility for SSI.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Contrary to Rivers\u2019s allegations, the ALJ considered and credited the reports of Rivers\u2019s treating physicians in evaluating the severity of her symptoms. For the period from 1978 to 1984, the ALJ considered the notes of four treating physicians and observed that their examinations of Rivers revealed mostly normal results. For example, on November 17, 1982, Dr. Azar found no historical or clinical evidence of neurological disease and noted that Rivers\u2019s motor, coordination and sensory modalities were normal. On January 25, 1983, Dr. Cobus found no evidence of neurologic disease, and his only finding of abnormality was a restricted cervical range of motion. Dr. Nicknish diagnosed Rivers in 1977 with \u201cdecompensated low back type syndrome,\u201d and his later treatment notes reflect Rivers\u2019s complaints of pain, although his notes do not indicate that Rivers\u2019s syndrome was of such severity as to be disabling. Indeed, Dr. Nicknish repeatedly prescribed outpatient physical therapy and Motrin to treat Rivers\u2019s symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Similarly, the ALJ considered the evaluation of treating physicians for the period from 1989 to 1995. Rivers was diagnosed with diabetes in 1989, and she struggled to keep her insulin levels under control. Nevertheless, the record does not suggest that Rivers\u2019s diabetes resulted in severe physical limitations on her ability to work. In addition, although Rivers asserts that the ALJ ignored her physicians\u2019 conclusions that she suffered from fibromyalgia, the ALJ\u2019s opinion reflects otherwise. The ALJ recognized that Drs. Davis and Hazard diagnosed Rivers as likely having fibromyalgia in 1994 and 1995. While we recognize that fibromyalgia is \u201ca disease that eludes [objective] measurement,\u201d <em>see Green-Younger, </em>335 F.3d at 108, mere diagnosis of fibromyalgia without a finding as to the severity of symptoms and limitations does not mandate a finding of disability, <em>see id. </em>at 104 (physician diagnosing fibromyalgia stated that the condition \u201cin certain instances can be debilitating\u201d). Unlike the claimant in Green-Younger\u2014 whose doctor diagnosed her fibromyalgia as \u201csevere\u201d and the cause of marked limitations in the claimant\u2019s activities of daily living, <em>id. </em>at 104 \u2014 the record in this case contains no such finding. Indeed, Dr. Davis indicated that Rivers should continue her exercise regimen on the Nordic-Track and treadmill and consult with a physical therapist to treat her chronic lower back pain and fibromyalgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">Nor was the ALJ required to credit Rivers\u2019s testimony about the severity of her pain and the functional limitations it caused. \u2018Where there is conflicting evidence about a claimant\u2019s pain, the ALJ must make credibility findings.\u201d <em>Snell v. Apfel, </em>177 F.3d 128, 135 (2d Cir.1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>Here, the ALJ found that Rivers\u2019s testimony was not credible, noting that clinical findings indicate only mild or slight symptoms and Rivers\u2019s work activities were not consistent with those of \u201can individual suffering from disabling pain.\u201d <em>See </em>SSR 96-7p, Titles II and XVI: Evaluation of Symptoms in Disability Claims: Assessing the Credibility of an Individual\u2019s Statements (1996) (\u201cA report of negative findings from the application of medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques is one of the many factors that appropriately are to be considered in the overall assessment of credibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Rivers\u2019s allegation that the ALJ failed to consider her impairments in combination was raised for the first time on appeal, and arguably is waived. In any event, this allegation is not supported by the record. The ALJ opinion evaluates and discusses Rivers\u2019s ailments in combination, as did her treating physicians. Furthermore, the ALJ opinion recognizes that Rivers \u201csuffered from severe musculoskeletal and endocrine impairments\u201d during the relevant periods, but found that \u201csaid impairments failed to meet or equal the level of severity of any disabling condition contained in [the] Appendix.\u201d This conclusion suggests that, contrary to Rivers\u2019s assertion, the ALJ considered the cumulative effect of her impairments.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">In sum, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion, based on the record as a whole and application of the correct legal standards, that Rivers did not suffer from a disabling condition of comparable severity to those listed in Appendix 1, Sub-part P of Part 404 of the Social Security Regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-10\">Substantial evidence also supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Rivers had the residual functional capacity (\u201cRFC\u201d) to perform a full range of light work during the relevant periods. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1545, 404.1567(b) (describing standard for RFC to perform \u201clight work\u201d). Rivers was employed as a bartender for much of the first period, and as a clerk at a newsstand and waitress for much of the second period. Although none of her work during these periods constitutes \u201cpast relevant work\u201d because Rivers did not earn enough to meet the threshold for \u201csubstantial gainful activity,\u201d <em>see </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(b) (describing \u201cpast relevant work\u201d by reference to periods of \u201csubstantial gainful activity\u201d), Rivers met that threshold during 1988, when she was employed as a clerk at a newsstand<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because this position qualifies as \u201clight work,\u201d substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that, during the relevant periods, Rivers did not qualify for benefits because she had the RFC to perform her past relevant work as a clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-12\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b47-15\">. Rivers filed an application for SSI on September 25, 1978. On October 17, 1984, she filed for SSI and DIB. Rivers was denied both applications.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b48-6\">. Although Rivers argues that the ALJ should not have made a credibility finding on remand, the remedial order in <em>Dixon </em>calls for a \"full reopening\u201d of cases and reevaluation pursuant to the five-step framework. This evaluation includes resolving any evidentiary conflicts and assessing the credibility of witnesses, including the claimant. <em>See Carroll v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number><em>Sec'y of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>705 F.2d 638, 642 (2d Cir.1983). The district court thus did not abuse its discretion in this regard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b49-8\">. Rivers asserts that a substantial amount of her income in 1988 from New York State Disability, rather than earnings from her work as a clerk and a waitress, which could affect whether this period qualifies as past relevant work, Rivers was unable to introduce evidence to substantiate this assertion because the state agency destroys records after three years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
