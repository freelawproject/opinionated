We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>Perez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 770, 773 (9th Cir.2008), we grant the petition and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">The BIA abused its discretion by failing to specifically address the effect of the affidavit of Cabrera-Monserate\u2019s counsel stating that he never received the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Singh v. Gonzales, </em>494 F.3d 1170, 1172-73 (9th Cir.2007) (explaining that \u201c[h]ad the BIA considered and specifically addressed the effect of Singh\u2019s and his counsel\u2019s affidavits of nonreceipt, it may well have concluded that the presumption of mailing created by the cover letter was rebutted\u201d). In the present case, as in <em>Singh, </em>Cabrera-Monserate submitted evidence that might have rebutted the presumption that the BIA\u2019s decision was mailed on the date of the transmittal letter. Cf<em>. Haroutunian v. INS, </em>87 F.3d 374, 375 (9th Cir.1996). We therefore remand for the BIA to determine in the first instance whether that evidence is sufficient to overcome the presumption of mailing, and then to articulate its reasoning accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-13\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b607-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
