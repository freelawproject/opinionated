McClendon appeals from the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment rejecting McClendon\u2019s claims grounded in work-related injuries to his knee. Finding no genuine issues of material fact raised by McClendon, the district court\u2019s summary judgment rejected all of McClendon\u2019s claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-19\">Having carefully reviewed the record on appeal, including the briefs of the parties and the district court\u2019s detailed analysis, we are satisfied that the district court\u2019s rulings are fully supported. The overarching taint from McClendon\u2019s repeated men-. dacity in denying prior injuries and difficulties with the knee implicated in this action pervades his case and defeats his efforts to paint the acts of the defendants in a light favorable to him. As indicated by the district court, the prolonged investigation conducted by Claims Management, Inc. before authorizing surgery was both explained and justified by the doubt and suspicion McClendon himself created by his denial of prior problems with the knee.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-20\">For essentially the same reasons so well explicated by the district court, its grant of summary judgment for the DefendantsAppellees is, in all respects,</p>\n<p id=\"b380-21\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
