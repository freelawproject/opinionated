Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005). <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>150 Fed.Appx. 221 (4th Cir.2005) (unpublished) (affirming conviction but vacating and remanding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>sentence). At resentencing, the court imposed the same sentence, 262 months\u2019 imprisonment, or the bottom of the Sentencing Guidelines range of imprisonment. On appeal, Williams claimed the court erred by giving a sentence within the Guidelines a presumption of reasonableness and defaulting to a Guidelines sentence without giving full consideration to the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2008) sentencing factors. He also claimed the court gave undue weight to acquitted conduct in determining his Guidelines sentence. Finding no error, we affirmed. <em>See United States v. Williams, </em>254 Fed.Appx. 209 (4th Cir.2007) (unpublished). On March 24, 2008, the Supreme Court granted Williams\u2019 petition for writ of certiorari, vacated this court\u2019s opinion and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-7\">Appellate courts review sentences imposed by district courts for reasonableness, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). When sentencing a defendant, a district court must first properly calculate the Guidelines range. The Guidelines are \u201cthe starting point and the initial benchmark.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596. Next, the court should give the parties the opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate. The court is then instructed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in light of the parties\u2019 requests with respect to the sentence. <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473. In the Fourth Circuit, \u201c[\u00e1] sentence within the proper Sentencing Guidelines range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>491 F.3d 178, 193 (4th Cir.2007); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence). This presumption can be rebutted only by showing that the sentence is unreasonable when measured against the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 379 (4th Cir.2006). The district court, however, must not presume that a sentence within the Guidelines is reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596-97. The court must instead \u201cmake an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Upon review, we must first determine whether the district court committed any significant procedural, error, <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If we find the sentence is procedurally sound, we must next \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We must \u201ctake into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range. If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b331-12\">We find the district court appropriately followed the <em>post-Booker </em>sentencing procedure. It properly determined the offense level and criminal history category. We find no procedural error. We further find the sentence was substantively reasonable. There is no evidence the district court considered a sentence within the Guidelines to be presumptively reasonable. We further find the court did not give disproportionate weight to the acquitted conduct which was part of the relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Accordingly, we affirm Williams\u2019 sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
