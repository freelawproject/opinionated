We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the agency\u2019s continuous physical presence determination. <em>Lopez-Alvarado v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 847, 850-51 (9th Cir.2004). In No. 06-70839, we grant the petition for review and remand. In No. 06-72606, we dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-16\">Substantial evidence does not support the agency\u2019s determination that Diaz failed to demonstrate the requisite presence where Diaz testified that he entered the United States on September 15, 1987; his declaration and cancellation application reflect the September 15, 1987 entry date; he provided sworn affidavits from friends supporting a 1987 entry date; and the IJ found him to be credible. <em>See id. </em>at 852-53 (alien established continuous physical presence through testimony and documentary evidence despite certain inconsistencies in dates). We remand to the agency for further proceedings regarding Diaz\u2019s eligibility for cancellation of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-17\">In light of our disposition, we need not reach the contentions in No. 06-72606.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-18\">No. 06-70839: PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-19\">No. 06-72606: PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b670-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
