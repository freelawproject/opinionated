MacLeod petitions for review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying her corrective action under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (\u201cVEOA\u201d). <em>MacLeod v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. PH-3443-07-0183-1-1 (May 1, 2007) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d); MacLeod v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. PH-3443-07-0183-1-1 (Dec. 6, 2007) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>We <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">MacLeod is the wife of a service-connected disabled veteran. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 2. Her husband has been unable to qualify for any appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. <em>Id. </em>MacLeod is therefore \u201cpreference eligible\u201d under the VEOA. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2108(3)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">On August 23, 2006, the Veterans Administration (\u2018VA\u201d) issued two announcements for the position of Voluntary Services Officer (GS-301-13) in the VA Connecticut Healthcare System. The first announcement was entitled \u201cPROMOTION ANNOUNCEMENT\u201d and stated that it was \u201ca solicitation for applications from current VA employees for competitive promotion consideration.\u201d Resp\u2019t\u2019s Appx. 16. The Promotion Announcement indicated that it was \u201cOPEN TO ALL SOURCES,\u201d meaning that certain eligible non-VA employees could apply, including applicants eligible as a result of \u201cspecial appointing authorities such as those for disabled veterans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The second announcement was entitled \u2018VACANCY ANNOUNCEMENT,\u201d stated that it was \u201cOPEN TO ALL U.S. CITIZENS,\u201d and was posted on the USAJOBS website. <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">MacLeod submitted an application in response to the Vacancy Announcement. <em>Initial Decision </em>at 3. The VA issued three separate Merit Promotion Certificates listing candidates who were qualified for the Voluntary Services Officer position, either because they were current VA employees eligible for promotion or transfer, or because they were \u201cpreference eligible\u201d under the VEOA. MacLeod\u2019s name appeared on one of these certificates. The VA also generated a Certificate of Eligibles, listing three candidates for the position who were neither current VA employees nor otherwise eligible to apply under the Promotion Announcement, but who could have applied under the Vacancy Announcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"964\">*964</page-number>The VA interviewed and rated the candidates and did not select MacLeod for the position. <em>Id. </em>Instead, the VA selected a current VA employee who transferred from a different VA facility. <em>Id. </em>at 3 \u2014 4. This selection was reflected on a Merit Promotion Certificate.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">MacLeod filed a complaint under the VEOA with the Department of Labor. <em>Id. </em>at 2. The Department found her complaint to be without merit, and MacLeod appealed to the Board. <em>Id. </em>at 1. An administrative judge of the Board denied the- appeal, <em>id. </em>at 2, and the Board denied MacLeod\u2019s petition for review, <em>Final Order </em>at 2-3. MacLeod petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b990-5\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9). \u201cOur scope of review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. Specifically, we must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless we find it to be arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Abell v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>343 F.3d 1378, 1382-83 (Fed.Cir.2003) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b990-7\">As we explained in <em>Joseph v. Federal Trade Commission, </em>\u201c[flederal agencies generally use two types of selection to fill vacancies: (1) the open \u2018competitive examination\u2019 process and (2) the \u2018merit promotion\u2019 process.\u201d 505 F.3d 1380, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 330.101, 332.101, 335.103 (2007)). The \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process is typically open to the public and is used to select and review applicants who are not currently agency employees. <em>Id. </em>By contrast, \u201c[t]he merit promotion process is used when the position is to be filled by an employee of the agency or by an applicant from outside the agency who has \u2018status\u2019 in the competitive service.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1382 (citing 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 335.103(b)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b990-9\">Veterans and other \u201cpreference eligible\u201d persons under the VEOA are given special advantages in <em>both </em>the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process and the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process. <em>Id. </em>at 1381-82. However, the type of advantage that the veteran or \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person receives depends on which process is used. In the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process, additional points are added to the final rating scores of \u201cpreference eligible\u201d applicants, and \u201cpreference eligible\u201d applicants are ranked ahead of other applicants who have the same score. <em>Id. </em>at 1381. By contrast, in the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process, the special advantage that a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person gets is simply the \u201copportunity to apply\u201d for vacancies that are otherwise open only to current agency employees:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtR\">Congress has provided ... that \u201cfor all merit promotion announcements ... veterans ... are eligible to apply.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f)(3)-(4). Veterans \u201cmay not be denied the opportunity to compete for vacant positions for which the agency making the announcement will accept applications from individuals outside its own workforce under merit promotion procedures.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f)(1).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b990-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 1382; <em>see also Abell, </em>343 F.3d at 1383 (\u201cThe VEOA ensures that a preference eligible veteran ... has the opportunity to apply for [merit promotion] vacancies.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b990-11\">We have expressly held that when an agency uses the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process, a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person is entitled <em>only </em>to the right to compete, not to the point and ranking preferences that would have applied if the agency had used the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process. <em>See Joseph, </em>505 F.3d at 1382 (\u201cVeterans\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"965\">*965</page-number>point preferences under the competitive appointment process do not apply in the merit promotion process.\u201d); <em>Abell, </em>343 F.3d at 1383 (\u201cIn other words, the VEOA gave [the veteran] the right to apply for the three vacant positions announced by the [agency]. However, the VEOA did not ensure that his application would be successful.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\">Moreover, an agency is permitted to seek applicants for a position under both the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d procedure and the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d procedure, but then ultimately fill the position using the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d procedure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-6\">[The veteran] received his ten point veterans\u2019 preference under the competitive examination procedure, but the [agency] then decided to make the appointment under the alternative merit promotion procedure. We know of no statute or regulatory provision that required the [agency], once it undertook to inaugurate the selection process by following the alternative procedure, to limit itself to the competitive examination process in making its final selection. As the Board pointed out in this case, \u201c[a]n agency has the discretion to fill a vacant position by any authorized method.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0x\"><em>Joseph, </em>505 F.3d at 1384 (quoting <em>Joseph v. Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, </em>103 M.S.P.R. 684, 689 (2006)). When an agency conducts \u201csimultaneous parallel procedures under the competitive examination and merit promotion processes\u201d but ultimately fills the position using the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process, a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person is entitled only to the opportunity to compete, not to point or ranking preferences. <em>Id. </em>at 1384-85; <em>Abell, </em>343 F.3d at 1383.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-7\">In this ease, it is clear from the record that the VA ultimately filled the Voluntary Services Officer position using the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process, not the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process. Specifically, the Promotion Announcement demonstrated the VA\u2019s intent to proceed under the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process, and the VA finalized its selection of a candidate by issuing a Merit Promotion Certificate that listed qualified candidates \u201c[i]n accordance with the procedures of the Merit Promotion Plan.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s Appx. Tab 5, at C-l. The VA therefore satisfied its obligations under the VEOA by allowing MacLeod to compete in the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-9\">We have considered each of MacLeod\u2019s arguments to the contrary but do not find them persuasive. We briefly address three of those arguments here. First, MacLeod argues that the Vacancy Announcement posted on USAJOBS demonstrates that the VA was proceeding under the \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d process, because it was listed as \u201cOPEN TO ALL U.S. CITIZENS.\u201d At most, this second announcement shows that the VA used \u201csimultaneous parallel procedures under the competitive examination and merit promotion processes.\u201d <em>Joseph, </em>505 F.3d at 1384. It does not change the fact that the VA ultimately used the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process to fill the position.</p>\n<p id=\"b991-10\">Second, relying on <em>Brown v. Department of Veterans Affairs, </em>247 F.3d 1222 (Fed.Cir.2001), MacLeod argues that a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person \u201cseeking initial appointment or retention in employment\u201d is entitled to preferential treatment over an existing agency employee seeking a transfer or promotion. <em>See id. </em>at 1223 (\u201cThe AJ concluded that veterans receive preference only when \u2018seeking initial appointment or retention in employment.\u2019 \u201d). <em>Brown </em>held simply that a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person that is already employed by an agency is not entitled to preferential treatment when seeking promotion or retention. <em>Id. </em>at 1224. It said nothing about the comparative treatment of \u201cpreference eligible\u201d non-employees and agency employees seeking to compete for a posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>tion under the \u201cmerit promotion\u201d process. As we held in <em>Joseph, </em>the point and ranking preferences to which a \u201cpreference eligible\u201d person is entitled when \u201cseeking initial appointment\u201d are only applicable when an agency uses \u201ccompetitive examination\u201d to fill a position. 505 F.3d at 1382.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-4\">Finally, MacLeod argues that the Board conducted a \u201ccursory review\u201d of the findings of the administrative judge. The Board made the decision of the administrative judge final by denying MacLeod\u2019s petition for review. <em>See Final Order </em>at 3 (\u201cThe initial decision of the administrative judge is final. This is the Board\u2019s final decision in this matter.\u201d); <em>see also </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.113(b) (\u201cIf the Board denies all petitions for review, the initial decision will become final when the Board issues its last decision denying a petition for review.\u201d). The Board also made clear that it \u201cfully consider[ed] the filings\u201d in reaching its decision. <em>Final Order </em>at 2. We see nothing in the record to suggest that MacLeod\u2019s arguments were not fully and fairly considered by the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm </em>the order of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
