We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-27\">Marquez contends that the district court erred by failing to allow him to address the court at the revocation hearing, as required by Federal Rule of Criminal Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>cedure 32.1. We reject this contention because Marquez was personally addressed by the court, was provided with the opportunity to speak on his own behalf, and was not intimidated or deterred from speaking. <em>See United States v. Mack, </em>200 F.3d 653, 658 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">Marquez contends that his sentence was \u201cprocedurally and substantively unreasonable\u201d because the district court failed to consider the sentencing factors, failed to state reasons for the sentence, failed to consider the Sentencing Guidelines, and failed to impose a sentence that was not greater than necessary to satisfy the sentencing goals. We review the sentence for reasonableness. <em>See United States v. Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d 1173, 1176 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">We conclude that the district court considered the appropriate sentencing factors and imposed a sentence that complied with the purposes of sentencing upon revocation of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e); <em>Miqbel, </em>444 F.3d at 1182.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">Finally, Marquez contends that the supervised release revocation procedures set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) violate <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). This contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Huertar-Pimental, </em>445 F.3d 1220, 1224-25 (9th Cir.2006). We reject Marquez\u2019s contention that <em>Huerta-Pimental </em>is no longer good law in light of <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b636-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
