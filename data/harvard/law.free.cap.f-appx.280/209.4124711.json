For the following reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-24\">Pahlevi is a native and citizen of Indonesia. Pahlevi is ethnically Chinese and a Catholic. Pahlevi also identifies himself as a homosexual. Pahlevi\u2019s parents are both deceased and his brother and sister live in Indonesia. On August 28, 2002, Pahlevi applied for asylum and withholding of removal. The former Immigration and Naturalization Service (\u201cINS\u201d) commenced removal proceedings on or about October 28, 2002, and charged Pahlevi as removable under INA \u00a7 237(a)(1)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(1)(B), as an alien who remained in the United States for a time longer than permitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-26\">In support of his application, Pahlevi claimed that he had suffered past persecution and feared future persecution on the basis of his ethnicity, religion, and mem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>bership in a particular social group (sexual orientation). Petitioner testified that as a child he was verbally insulted by other children because of his Chinese background. A rock was thrown at him and he still bears the resulting scar. In addition, Pahlevi\u2019s family was robbed twice. Both occasions were reported to the police, but they took no action in response. In 1998, Pahlevi witnessed the robbery of a customer\u2019s husband outside a salon where Pahlevi worked. The customer\u2019s husband was Chinese and was robbed by two Indonesian Muslim men at knife-point. When the robbers saw Pahlevi, they told him to keep quiet or he would die.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">Pahlevi further testified that he had been baptized Catholic and went to church on a weekly basis. Pahlevi did not claim to have personally experienced any incidents of harm on account of his religion. However, he did describe an incident where his brother-in-law\u2019s relative was on her way to a mass when a suitcase containing a bomb exploded next to her and caused her a very serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">In addition, Pahlevi testified that he is gay and wanted asylum because he can be open about his sexuality in the United States and fears the discrimination he would face in Indonesia. Pahlevi testified that when he told his brother and sister about his sexual orientation, they did not respond favorably. Pahlevi confided to a few friends that he was gay, including a close friend named Johnny who was also gay. Johnny owned the salon where Pahlevi worked from 1998-2002. Johnny continues to live in Surabaya and became openly gay before Pahlevi left the country. Although Johnny initially lost customers when he became openly gay, most of those customers later returned. When Pahlevi went shopping with Johnny, people insulted them regarding their sexual orientation. Pahlevi claimed Johnny continues to be verbally insulted in Indonesia.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">Pahlevi was also acquainted with another gay individual whom he called \u201cMr. A.\u201d Mr. A had a partner named Johnny (\u201cJohnny II\u201d). Mr. A told Pahlevi that Johnny II was killed by homophobic individuals, but Pahlevi did not have independent knowledge that this was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) rendered an oral decision finding Pahlevi removable as charged and denying his application for asylum and withholding of removal. Although the IJ found that Pahlevi was credible, the IJ concluded that Pahlevi failed to show that the harm he experienced rose to the level of persecution or that he faced a reasonable possibility or clear probability of future persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds. The BIA affirmed, reasoning that Pahlevi\u2019s experiences \u201cdo not amount to past persecution.\u201d The BIA further concluded that the record (which included various articles and the 2004 U.S. Department of State Country Report on Human Rights Practices and the 2004 International Religious Freedom Report for Indonesia) \u201ccontains no evidence demonstrating that the respondent faces an individualized risk of persecution or that there is a pattern or practice of persecution.\u201d Pahlevi timely petitioned for review of the BIA\u2019s order dismissing his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">We exercise jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s final order of removal under INA \u00a7 242(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Because the BIA appears to have substantially relied on the findings of the IJ, we have jurisdiction to review the decisions of both the BIA and the IJ. <em>See Xie v. Ashcroft, </em>359 F.3d 239, 242 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-11\">Our review of these decisions is for substantial evidence, considering whether they are \u201csupported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>Balasubramanrim v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number><em>INS, </em>143 F.3d 157, 161 (3d Cir.1998) (quotation omitted). The decisions must be affirmed \u201cunless the evidence not only supports a contrary conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Zubeda v. Ashcroft, </em>333 F.3d 463, 471 (3d Cir.2003) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">The BIA\u2019s conclusion that Pahlevi failed to establish past persecution is supported by substantial evidence in the record. Although the incidents described by Pahlevi (including the name-calling during his childhood, the two robberies of his family, and the verbal insults regarding his sexual orientation) are unfortunate, they do not rise to the level of persecution. <em>See Lie v. Ashcroft, </em>396 F.3d 530, 536 (3d Cir.2005) (holding that an ethnic Chinese Indonesian\u2019s account of two isolated criminal acts by unknown assailants, which resulted only in the theft of some personal property and a minor injury, was not sufficiently severe to constitute persecution). <em>See also Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1243 (3d Cir.1993) (\u201cpersecution is an extreme concept that does not include every sort of treatment our society regards as offensive.\u201d). Moreover, the other incidents that he described were not personally directed to him, and do not demonstrate past persecution under the circumstances presented here.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">Nor has Pahlevi established a well-founded fear of future persecution. Pahlevi failed to show that he would be individually singled out for persecution or that there is a pattern or practice of persecution against Chinese Christians or homosexuals. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(2)(iii)(A). We have held that violence directed against Chinese Christians in Indonesia \u201cdoes not appear to be sufficiently widespread as to constitute a pattern or practice,\u201d <em>Lie, </em>396 F.3d at 537, and Pahlevi failed to adduce evidence warranting a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Finally, on appeal, Pahlevi contends that it is \u201cclear from the administrative record that homosexuals are persecuted in Indonesia,\u201d and that the IJ and the BIA \u201cignored\u201d this \u201cfact.\u201d However, Pahlevi cites nothing in support of this bald assertion. In any event, the record in this case does not compel the conclusion that there is a systemic, pervasive, or organized persecution of homosexuals in Indonesia. <em>See id. </em>(discussing what constitutes a pattern or practice of persecution). Further, as the IJ noted \u201cthere is insufficient evidence of widespread targeting by -non-state actors that the government is unwilling or unable to control\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Because we conclude that Pahlevi failed to establish his eligibility for asylum, we necessarily conclude that he has not satisfied the more stringent requirements for withholding of removal. <em>See Paripovic v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 240, 246 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
