Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>see Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1105 (9th Cir.2006), we dismiss in part, and grant in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-29\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s determination that petitioner\u2019s asylum application was untimely because that finding is based on disputed facts. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3); <em>Ramadan v. Gon</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number><em>zales, </em>479 F.3d 646, 650 (9th Cir.2007) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">We also lack jurisdiction to review petitioner\u2019s contention that he qualifies for humanitarian asylum because he failed to exhaust this claim before the agency. <em>See Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is not supported by substantial evidence because it rests on the IJ\u2019s speculation and conjecture. <em>See Zhou v. Gonzales, </em>437 F.3d 860, 865 (9th Cir.2006). Further, petitioner\u2019s use of aliases when confronted by immigration and law enforcement officials does not support a negative credibility finding. <em>See Turcios v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1396, 1400-01 (9th Cir.1987). Where, as here, the IJ\u2019s credibility determination rests on insufficient and impermissible grounds, the petitioner is deemed credible and corroborating evidence is not required. <em>See Singh, </em>439 F.3d at 1109.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Accordingly, we grant the petition for review and remand for the agency to consider whether, taking petitioner\u2019s testimony as true, he has shown eligibility for withholding of removal and protection under CAT. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16-18, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DISMISSED in part; GRANTED in part; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b652-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as providedby 9th Cir.
