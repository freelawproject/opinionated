Because the parties are familiar with the factual and procedural history of this case, we will not recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides for dismissal of a complaint that fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6). A complaint should not be dismissed \u201cunless it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Love v. United States, </em>915 F.2d 1242, 1245 (9th Cir.1990) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). The dismissal of a complaint for failure to state a claim is reviewed <em>de novo. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">Title III of the ADA prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis of disability in the full and equal enjoyment of the ... accommodations of any place of public accommodation by any person who owns, leases (or leases to), or operates a place of public accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12182(a). Places of public accommodation under the ADA are \u201cdefined in terms of 12 extensive categories,\u201d <em>PGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, </em>532 U.S. 661, 676, 121 S.Ct. 1879, 149 L.Ed.2d 904 (2001), including places of lodging, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12181(7)(A); places of public gathering, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12181(7)(D); places of recreation, <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12181(7)(I) &amp; (L); places of education, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12181(7)(J); and places of exercise, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 12181(7)(L). The phrase \u201cpublic accommodation\u201d \u201cshould be construed liberally.\u201d <em>PGA Tour, </em>532 U.S. at 676, 121 S.Ct. 1879.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-12\">Appellants\u2019 complaint alleges that Troop 223 and the Western Council operate and/or lease Camp Emerald Bay, a place of public accommodation within the meaning of the ADA. At this stage of the litigation the record does not contain any detailed information about Camp Emerald Bay. The complaint alleges, however, that Troop 223 \u201coffers recreational and educational opportunities\u201d to preteen boys and their families at Camp Emerald Bay. As the district court acknowledged, this suffices to suggest that Camp Emerald Bay may be a place of recreation or education covered by the ADA. Alternatively, Camp Emerald Bay may be a place of lodging, or a place of public gathering. The district court erred by going beyond the complaint to find prematurely that Camp Emerald Bay could not be either a place of lodging or a place of public gathering. Appellants are entitled to undertake discovery in aid of their allegation that Camp Emerald Bay is a place of public accommodation under the ADA. At this point, they have alleged enough for a potentially viable claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-13\">Even if Camp Emerald Bay is a place of public accommodation, Troop 223 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>and the Western Council argue, and the district court agreed, that the Boy Scouts is a private club, which Title III of the ADA expressly exempts from its provisions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12187. We have not yet addressed whether the Boy Scouts is a private club. The determination of whether an organization is a private club is necessarily a factually intensive inquiry examining whether the organization is open to the public at large. <em>See Clegg v. Cult Awareness Network, </em>18 F.3d 752, 755 n. 3 (9th Cir.1994). The resolution of this sort of factually intensive inquiry is inappropriate on a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim where facts have not yet been presented to the court. Therefore, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s grant of the motion to dismiss, and REMAND the case for further proceedings. REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b696-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
