O\u2019Grady guilty of two counts of extortion under color of official right, one count of conspiring to commit extortion under color of official right, and two counts of bribery. The District Court sentenced O\u2019Grady to 43 months imprisonment and imposed a $5,000 fine. O\u2019Grady appeals his conviction, contending that (1) the government failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and the jury\u2019s verdict was against the reasonable weight of the evidence, (2) inadmissible testimony was admitted at trial, (3) the trial court denied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, (4) the trial court erred by interrupting his cross-examination of a witness, (5) the trial court erred by failing to excuse a juror, (6) the trial court erred by allowing the deliberating jury to have transcripts of audio and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>video recordings played during the trial, and (7) the jury charges were misleading and confusing. Finding no error, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">I. <em>BACKGROUND</em></p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">Defendant Raymond J. O\u2019Grady served as a Township Commiteeman for the Township of Middletown, New Jersey. As a Committeeman O\u2019Grady had been appointed by charter and served as mayor for various calendar years. Although it did not occur, O\u2019Grady indicated to others his expectation that he would be appointed mayor again in 2005. During his time as a Committeeman, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) conducted \u201cOperation Bid Rig\u201d \u2014 an investigation designed to uncover political corruption. Two FBI agents held themselves out as employees of a business involved in construction and demolition work. These agents made it known they were interested in paying bribes to local officials who were in a position to award no-bid emergency contracts. Anthony Palughi, serving as the Superintendent of Bridges for Monmouth County, introduced the undercover agents to O\u2019Grady. At the time, Palughi was not aware of the investigation. After his arrest in December 2004, Palughi agreed to become a cooperating witness and recorded conversations with O\u2019Grady in that capacity.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The agents, and later Palughi, audio and video recorded various meetings with O\u2019Grady. The parties are familiar with the contents of these recordings. Because we write primarily for their benefit, we omit any discussion of facts not relevant to our discussion. During deliberations, the District Court gave the jury transcripts of the recorded conversations that had been admitted into evidence and played for the jury during trial. No tape player was provided to the jury, but the District Court informed the jury that the recordings would be available upon request and also repeatedly cautioned the jury to rely on the recordings if they conflicted with the transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">On October 15, 2004, O\u2019Grady met the undercover agents for lunch. The agents indicated that \u201c[t]he boss ... knows you\u2019re helping us do things ____he also knows you\u2019re influential and ... that what, in January, you\u2019re gonna become the may- or.... And he knows you\u2019re gonna look out for our best interests.\u201d After O\u2019Grady responded \u201cI could possibly help you out,\u201d the agents told O\u2019Grady to stop by them office for \u201ca little early Christmas gift or whatever.\u201d O\u2019Grady also claimed he could \u201csmell a cop a mile away\u201d and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t talk out in the open.\u201d On October 21, O\u2019Grady stopped by the office to pick up the \u201cearly Christmas gift.\u201d A videotape shows one undercover agent telling O\u2019Grady \u201cwe\u2019re looking for stuff under the emergency threshold\u201d and that the undercover cop handed O\u2019Grady a white envelope while saying \u201cthe boss wanted to do a little taking care of you.\u201d The envelope contained $1,000 in cash. The agent testified that \u201clooking for stuff under the emergency threshold\u201d meant \u201cobtaining no-bid contracts for us once he became Mayor, or using his position as Committeeman to help get those contracts!)]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">On February 17, 2005, the undercover agents met with O\u2019Grady at a restaurant. A videotape shows an undercover agent handing O\u2019Grady a white envelope while he said \u201cthat\u2019s the five from [the boss].\u201d The agent testified that the envelope contained $5,000 in cash. During this meeting, O\u2019Grady warned the agents that \u201cyou guys are hot\u201d and advised the agents \u201c[t]here are some great words in this world. I do not recollect I can not remember. They can\u2019t get you for perjury or false statements or anything like that for any<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>thing you can\u2019t remember or can not recollect.\u201d The undercover agent testified that he understood the warning \u201cyou guys are hot\u201d to mean that \u201claw enforcement is taking an interest or looking into our activities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">From 1990 until 2004, O\u2019Grady also served as the Director of the Monmouth County Motor Pool. In this capacity, O\u2019Grady was responsible for repairing all county vehicles and for ordering needed parts. Matthew and Stephen Appolonia owned International Trucks of Central Jersey (ITCJ). O\u2019Grady purchased trucks parts from and sent trucks to be repaired by ITCJ. Beginning as early as 2001, O\u2019Grady directly, and indirectly through Palughi, received corrupt cash payments from ITCJ. O\u2019Grady utilized his position and authority to order unnecessary equipment and supplies and caused the approval of inflated costs or false charges from ITCJ in order to offset the corrupt payments made to O\u2019Grady. On February 9, 2005, O\u2019Grady advised Palughi he was \u201cdistancing\u201d himself from the Appolonias \u201cjust in case anybody is watching\u201d but indicated he would \u201creestablish\u201d the relationship later.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">At trial, Palughi testified that between October and December 2004, O\u2019Grady caused the generation of a backdated voucher for $6,000 from the County of Monmouth to ITCJ so that Monmouth County would pay for the repair of a vehicle Monmouth County had traded back to ITCJ. In fact, the county did not own the vehicle at the time of the repair. In exchange, O\u2019Grady accepted $2,000 in cash, giving $700 to Palughi. O\u2019Grady later shredded the voucher because he feared an investigation. O\u2019Grady told Palughi, \u201c[t]he only thing that, that anybody in this mix knows about our [expletive] dealings, was that one invoice\u201d and warned Palughi to be careful of what he said.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">During O\u2019Grady\u2019s trial, on June 2, 2006, prior to the second day of cooperating witness Palughi\u2019s direct examination, Palughi attempted suicide by taking an overdose of blood pressure medication. At the hospital, Palughi was examined by the hospital psychiatrist, Dr. Schwartzman. In a psychiatric report dated June 5, the doctor told the district judge that in her opinion, Palughi \u201cseems to have the capacity to testify immediately after his discharge from the hospital today.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Palughi continued to testify on June 6. O\u2019Grady received a copy of the psychiatric report and the District Court released Palughi\u2019s hospital records. The District Court repeatedly denied O\u2019Grady\u2019s request for a Fed. R.Evid. 104 hearing on competency. After reviewing Dr. Schwartzman\u2019s report, the District Court found nothing in it to require further psychiatric examination. O\u2019Grady\u2019s counsel was allowed to cross-examine Palughi on the suicide attempt. During cross examination, counsel asked Palughi \u201cisn\u2019t it a fact that amongst the reasons you attempted to take your life was because you were feeling guilty about what you were doing here in this courtroom?\u201d and Palughi responded \u201c[a]bsolutely, sir.\u201d Defense counsel later used this testimony to attack Palughi\u2019s reliability, asking the jury to believe that Palughi would lie to keep himself out of jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>During defense counsel\u2019s cross examination of Palughi, the District Court interrupted to instruct counsel to rephrase a question and warn counsel not to be argumentative or repetitive, to ask Palughi a series of questions relating to his job appointments, and to chastise counsel in front of the jury for characterizing the witness\u2019s answers and ordering Palughi to \u201cwait a minute\u201d rather than asking the court to cut Palughi off. Defense counsel did not object at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Following closing arguments, Juror Number 8 expressed job-related concerns about continuing jury service. After the District Court contacted the employer, the juror reconfirmed that the juror could abide by the oath to remain fair and open minded. The District Court ordered the juror not to discuss the matter with the other jury members. The court retained the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">O\u2019Grady challenges four aspects of the District Court\u2019s jury instructions. His contentions are as follows: First, the District Court erroneously charged the jury about not drawing an unfavorable inference from O\u2019Grady\u2019s constitutional right to remain silent and not testify. Second, the District Court erroneously instructed the jury that a conspiracy, once formed, is presumed to continue until its objects are completed or there is an affirmative act of termination by one of its members. Third, the District Court misinsti\u2019ucted the jury regarding the <em>mens rea </em>required for a Hobbs Act conviction because the instruction failed to convey the requirement that the defendant <em>\u201cagree </em>to take or withhold some official action in exchange for the benefit received.\u201d Fourth, the District Court erred when it instructed the jury that it was sufficient for the Government to prove that the defendant committed just one of the acts charged in the indictment when the indictment used the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d rather than the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d as used in the underlying statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">The District Court exercised subject matter jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3281. We have appellate jurisdiction over challenges to the final judgment of conviction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">II. <em>DISCUSSION</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">A. Sufficiency and Weight-of-the-Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">O\u2019Grady argues that the government failed to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Where, as here, the defendant did not preserve an insufficiency of the evidence claim by filing a timely motion for a judgment of acquittal, we reverse only if we find \u201cplain error.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b); <em>U.S. v. Wolfe, </em>245 F.3d 257, 260-61 (3d Cir.2001). We review the record in the light most favorable to the prosecution to determine whether any rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the available evidence. <em>Wolfe, </em>245 F.3d at 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-12\">Regarding \u201cOperation Bid Rig\u201d, O\u2019Grady argues the government failed to provide sufficient evidence of the intent and/or knowledge required. Counts 1 and 2 charged attempted extortion under color of official right, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a). \u201c[T]he Government need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not entitled, knowing that the payment was made in return for official acts.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Urban, </em>404 F.3d 754, 768 (3d Cir.2005). Count 3 charged O\u2019Grady with bribery in connection with federal programs, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(a)(1)(B). The statute does not require proof of a specific <em>quid pro quo, </em>or payment in return for an identifiable official act. <em>U.S. v. Gee, </em>432 F.3d 713, 714-15 (7th Cir.2005). The record is full of evidence and testimony from which a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>reasonable juror could conclude that O\u2019Grady possessed the requisite mens rea required by both statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">Regarding the ITCJ scheme, O\u2019Grady argues that the government failed to prove the elements of Counts 4 and 5, which charged O\u2019Grady with extorting cash payments and accepting bribes from the Appolonias. O\u2019Grady argues that the only evidence in support of these charges was Palughi\u2019s testimony, there was no direct evidence that the envelopes given to him by ITCJ contained cash, and there was no documentary evidence to corroborate the charges. These arguments lack merit. Even if the recorded conversations did not corroborate Palughi\u2019s testimony, \u201cuncorroborated accomplice testimony may constitutionally provide the exclusive basis for a criminal conviction.\u201d <em>See U.S. v. De Larosa, </em>450 F.2d 1057, 1060 (3d Cir.1971) (citing <em>Caminetti v. U.S., </em>242 U.S. 470, 37 S.Ct. 192, 61 L.Ed. 442 (1917)). Furthermore, \u201c[t]he government must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, but may do so solely by circumstantial evidence.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Dent, </em>149 F.3d 180, 188 (3d Cir.1998). A reasonable jury could infer from the evidence that O\u2019Grady participated in this scheme and that the envelopes contained cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">O\u2019Grady also argues that the jury\u2019s verdict was against the reasonable weight of the evidence. This claim is waived because O\u2019Grady\u2019s Rule 33 motion was untimely filed and the government objected. <em>See Eberhart v. U.S., </em>546 U.S. 12, 126 S.Ct. 403, 407, 163 L.Ed.2d 14 (2005). Even assuming O\u2019Grady did not waive this claim, we find no basis for granting this extraordinary relief. \u201cNew trials because the verdict is against the weight of the evidence are proper only when the record shows that the jury verdict resulted in a miscarriage of justice or where the verdict, on the record, cries out to be overturned or shocks the conscience.\u201d <em>Williamson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., </em>926 F.2d 1344, 1353 (3d Cir.1991). We have reviewed the record and find no plausible basis to disturb the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">B. Admissibility of Testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">O\u2019Grady argues that the District Court improperly allowed an FBI agent to testify as to his understanding of tape recorded conversations between himself and O\u2019Grady. Specifically, O\u2019Grady challenges the admissibility of the agent\u2019s testimony that O\u2019Grady\u2019s statement \u201cyou guys are hot\u201d meant \u201cthat law enforcement is taking an interest or looking into our activities.\u201d We review this claim for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Williams, </em>458 F.3d 312, 315 (3d Cir.2006). Under Fed. R.Evid. 701, this Court permits lay witnesses to interpret \u201ccode-like\u201d conversations if it is helpful to an understanding of the testimony of the witness on the stand. <em>See U.S. v. De Pen, </em>778 F.2d 963, 977-78 (3d Cir.1985). But interpretation of clear statements is not permissible. <em>See U.S. v. Dicker, </em>853 F.2d 1103, 1109-10 (3d Cir. 1988). The meaning of O\u2019Grady\u2019s statements were not clear and straightforward but \u201ccode-like.\u201d The agent\u2019s testimony was based on his direct perception of the conversation and helped the factfinder to determine O\u2019Grady\u2019s mental state regarding his involvement in the scheme. We find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">C. Confrontation Clause and Cross-Examination of Palughi</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">O\u2019Grady argues the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. First, he argues that the District Court\u2019s failure to hold a Fed. R.Evid. 104 competency hearing caused him to curtail his cross-examination of Palughi. He also argues that the District Court impermissibly interrupted his cross-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>examination of Palughi when it instructed counsel to rephrase a question, warned counsel not to be argumentative or repetitive, asked Palughi a series of questions, and chastised counsel in front of the jury. The \u201cConfrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Fensterer, </em>474 U.S. 15, 20, 106 S.Ct. 292, 88 L.Ed.2d 15 (1985) (per curiam) (emphasis in original). However, a district court \u201cretains wide latitude insofar as the Confrontation Clause is concerned to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination to avoid, among other things, harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, or interrogation that is only marginally relevant or repetitive.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Lore, </em>430 F.3d 190, 207-08 (3d Cir.2005). We review limitations on cross-examination for abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>O\u2019Grady had the opportunity to cross-examine Palughi to whatever extent he wished. To the extent, if at all, O\u2019Grady limited his cross-examination due to concern for Palughi\u2019s mental health, this decision was self-imposed and not judicial error. Furthermore, the District Court\u2019s interruptions were within the District Court\u2019s discretion to impose reasonable limits on the cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">D. Transcripts of Recorded Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">O\u2019Grady argues the District Court erred by providing the deliberating jury with transcripts of recordings played during trial without also providing the jury with the recordings and a tape player. We review the decision to admit properly authenticated transcripts for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Ademaj, </em>170 F.3d 58, 65 n. 6 (1st Cir.1999). When the District Court allows juries to use transcripts of taped conversations as an aid during deliberations, this Court has found no abuse of discretion when there is \u201cnothing in the record to indicate that the jury relied improperly on the transcript or that the transcript contained inaccuracies that would substantially affect defendant\u2019s rights in the event the jury had relied upon it.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Pecora, </em>798 F.2d 614, 631 (3d Cir.1986). O\u2019Grady does not point to any such inaccuracy. We decline to accept O\u2019Gradjfs argument that a tape player <em>must </em>accompany the transcripts during deliberations. <em>See U.S. v. Rengifo, </em>789 F.2d 975, 980 (1st Cir.1986). The District Court repeatedly told the jury that the actual recordings would be available upon request and that the jury should rely on the actual recordings in the event of any inconsistency. Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">E. Retaining the Juror</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">O\u2019Grady argues the District Court erred by retaining Juror No. 8. Specifically, he claims that retaining the juror potentially influenced and rushed the jury\u2019s deliberations. Where, as here, the defendant failed to object to the trial court\u2019s decision and apparently acquiesced by stating \u201cwe don\u2019t care if you substitute,\u201d he cannot later claim error. \u201c[I]f a defendant has an objection, there is an obligation to call the matter to the court\u2019s attention so the trial judge will have the opportunity to remedy the situation.\u201d <em>Estelle v. Williams, </em>425 U.S. 501, 508 n. 3, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 48 L.Ed.2d 126 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Even assuming O\u2019Grady did not waive this claim, it lacks merit. We review a District Court\u2019s decision to excuse or retain a sitting juror for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Cameron, </em>464 F.2d 333, 334-35 (3d Cir.1972) (per curiam). Where a district court interviews a juror and takes affirmative steps to ascertain that the juror can serve fairly and impartially, we have held there is no abuse of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Vega, </em>285 F.3d 256, 265-67 (3d Cir.2002). The District Court properly interviewed the juror, ascertained that the juror could remain fair and impartial, and cautioned the juror not to discuss the matter with the other jury members. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">F. Jury Instructions</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">O\u2019Grady challenges four aspects of the District Court\u2019s jury instructions. \u201cReview of the legal standard enunciated in a jury instruction is plenary, but review of the wording of the instruction, <em>ie., </em>the expression, is for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Yeaman, </em>194 F.3d 442, 452 (3d Cir.1999) (internal quotations and citations omitted). First, although O\u2019Grady requested the jury instruction regarding a defendant\u2019s decision not to testify and affirmed he wanted it after the District Court read the instruction aloud, he now challenges that instruction. Generally, \u201ca party may not challenge as error a ruling or other trial proceeding invited by that party.\u201d <em>U.S. v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1247 (11th Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted). Even assuming O\u2019Grady may challenge this instruction, the District Court\u2019s instruction was almost identical to the one this Court approved in <em>U.S. v. Flores, </em>454 F.3d 149, 159-60 (3d Cir.2006). Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Next, O\u2019Grady argues the District Court improperly instructed the jury that it was sufficient for the Government to prove that the defendant committed just one of the acts charged in the indictment when the indictment used the conjunctive \u201cand\u201d rather than the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d as used in the underlying statute. We have held that while an indictment employs the conjunctive, jury instructions may employ the disjunctive where the statute employs the disjunctive. <em>U.S. v. Cusumano, </em>943 F.2d 305, 311 (3d Cir.1991). Accordingly, the District Court\u2019s instruction to the jury was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Additionally, O\u2019Grady argues the District Court incorrectly charged the jury regarding conspiracy liability and the <em>mens rea </em>required for a Hobbs Act conviction. O\u2019Grady failed to object to these instructions at trial. Under the plain error standard, before we can correct an error not raised at trial, we must find (1) an error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affected substantial rights. <em>Flores, </em>454 F.3d at 156-57. \u201cIf all three conditions are met, we may in our discretion grant relief, but only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">O\u2019Grady\u2019s arguments misstate the law underlying the challenged instructions. Regarding conspiracy liability, the District Court properly instructed the jury that a conspiracy, once formed, is presumed to continue until its objectives are accomplished or until an affirmative act of termination by its members. Contrary to O\u2019Grady\u2019s contention, this does not place a burden on the defendant to disprove his participation in the conspiracy. <em>U.S. v. Steele, </em>685 F.2d 793, 803-04 (3d Cir.1982). Rather, once the government has- shown the defendant entered into a conspiracy, the defendant must \u201cpresent evidence\u201d of withdrawal from the conspiracy. <em>Id. </em>If the defendant makes this prima facie showing, the government must rebut it. <em>Id. </em>O\u2019Grady confuses burden of proof with burden of production. Therefore, we find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-10\">Regarding the <em>mens rea </em>required for a Hobbs Act conviction, contrary to O\u2019Grady\u2019s argument that the government must prove O\u2019Grady entered into an \u201cactual agreement\u201d, the \u201c[g]overnment need only show that a public official has obtained a payment to which he was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>entitled, knowing that the payment was in return for official acts ...\u201d <em>U.S. v. Bradley, </em>173 F.3d 225, 231 (3d Cir.1999). The District Court\u2019s instruction properly conveyed that requirement.
