Harvey, in his official capacity; (2) the Hon. John B. Dangler of the New Jersey Superior Court, in his official capacity; (3) Adam Siire, the lawyer suing O\u2019Callaghan in New York state court; (4) the law firm of Einhorn, Harris, Ascher, Barbarito, Frost &amp; Ironson, P.C. (\u201cEinhorn Harris\u201d), which has represented D.T.B.\u2019s mother in the custody hearings; and (5) Dr. Susan Edwards, a psychologist whom the New Jersey court appointed as an expert in the custody proceedings. The District Court granted the defendants\u2019 joint motion to dismiss with prejudice. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The difficult-to-follow facts, as related by O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s convoluted complaint, are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">\u2022 June 2000: O\u2019Callaghan sued D.T.B.\u2019s mother in New Jersey Superior Court, before the Hon. John J. Harper, for the right to increased visitation and communication with D.T.B.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-12\">\u2022 August 2000: Based on a \u201cfake New York psychologist\u2019s letter,\u201d Judge Harper ruled that O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s visitation and communication rights should remain very limited. (App. 46-47.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-13\">\u2022 August 2002: The Hon. David B. Rand, also of the New Jersey Superior Court, adopted the recommendation of a \u201cDr. L.,\u201d who opined that O\u2019Callaghan should have much more time with D.T.B., that D.T.B. should not attend the boarding school to which his mother was planning on sending him, and that D.T.B. should undergo intensive counseling. The New Jersey Appellate Division then stayed the proceedings before Judge Rand on an emergency application by D.T.B.\u2019s mother and Einhorn Harris, and ordered that D.T.B. should go to the boarding school and that his counseling sessions should end.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-14\">\u2022 October 2002: The New Jersey Appellate Division affirmed Judge Harper\u2019s August 2000 ruling regarding limited visitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-15\">\u2022 January 2003: Judge Rand held a conference at which he \u201cencouraged and authorized Einhorn Harris to participate in a \u2018sanctions\u2019 and defamation per <em>se </em>proceeding\u201d against O\u2019Callaghan, made defamatory statements, and ordered a <em>\u201cGulagesque </em>mental health examination\u201d of O\u2019Callaghan. (App. 47.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-16\">\u2022 July 2003: The New Jersey Appellate Division remanded the custody proceedings to the Superior Court for a plenary hearing regarding O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s visitation rights and the boarding school issue. Judge Rand then held another conference, at which he conceded that he had no jurisdiction to hold the January 2003 conference. However, he did not conduct the plenary hearing required by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Appellate Division and instead instituted the same conditions as he did at the January 2003 conference, including the <em>\u201cGulagesque </em>medical exam.\u201d (App. 49.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">\u2022 August-September 2003: O\u2019Callaghan presented the Superior Court with the results of the required medical exam. Judge Dangler, who had taken over the case from Judge Rand, then implemented Judge Rand\u2019s conditions, denied O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s request for a hearing and refused to restart D.T.B.\u2019s counseling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-6\">\u2022 October 2003: At Judge Dangler\u2019s request and with the insistence and sponsorship of Sifre, Dr. Edwards intervened by submitting a report to the Superior Court that indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that D.T.B. should continue to attend the boarding school. The report was sealed 10 days later.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-7\">\u2022 November 2003: Edwards sent the report to the New York state court hearing the \u201cmalicious prosecution/punitive damages\u201d suit brought by Sifre against O\u2019Callaghan. (App. 50.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-8\">\u2022 April 2004: Judge Dangler ruled that D.T.B. could go on a school trip to Latvia, despite O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s opposition based on his fear that terrorists in Latvia would target the American schoolchildren.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-9\">\u2022 July 2004: Judge Dangler interviewed D.T.B. privately, awarded attorney\u2019s fees against O\u2019Callaghan, and imposed further visitation restrictions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-10\">\u2022 November 2004: The New Jersey Appellate Division denied motions filed by O\u2019Callaghan for interlocutory appeal of Judge Dangler\u2019s various orders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-11\">In August 2005, the District Court dismissed <em>sua sponte, </em>but without prejudice, a 36-page complaint filed by O\u2019Callaghan, finding that it violated Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a) because the complaint was \u201cconfusing, unnecessarily verbose, and there is no cognizable claim that can be gleaned from the pleadings.\u201d (App. 21.)</p>\n<p id=\"b180-16\">In September 2005, O\u2019Callaghan filed the complaint in this ease, which is somewhat shorter but still very similar to the complaint dismissed the previous month. His new complaint sought the following relief: (1) declaratory judgment against Judge Dangler, declaring that Judge Dangler\u2019s conduct of the Superior Court proceedings and his promotion of the submissions of Sifre, Edwards, and Einhorn Harris to the New York court violated O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s and D.T.B.\u2019s constitutional rights;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (2) declaratory judgment against Sifre, Edwards, and Einhorn Harris, declaring that all three conspired to deny O\u2019Callaghan and D.T.B. their constitutional rights; (3) declaratory judgment against Edwards, declaring that she invaded O\u2019Callaghan\u2019s privacy; (4) compensatory damages against Edwards for defamation; and (5) injunctive relief against Sifre, Edwards, and Einhorn Harris, requiring them to cease any \u201cwrongful, deceitful and injurious submissions\u201d to \u201cany person, entity, government agency, court, or otherwise\u201d and to issue formal retractions to any who received Edwards\u2019 submissions. (App. 61-62).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-17\">The District Court dismissed all of these claims on a number of alternate grounds, including the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b180-18\">(1) As to Harvey, the Court found that the complaint necessarily failed to state a claim because he was not mentioned anywhere in the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-19\">(2) The damages claim against Edwards for defamation was held to be barred by both states\u2019 applicable statute of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>limitations because it was filed more than one year after her report was submitted to either the New Jersey or New York court. <em>See </em>N.J. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 2A:14-3; N.Y. C.P.L.R. \u00a7 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">(3) Regarding all three declaratory \u25a0judgment claims, the Court made the discretionary decision not to exercise jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act because \u201cany ruling rendered by the District Court would not settle the controversy, would not serve a useful purpose in clarifying legal relations, would be used in a race for <em>res judicata, </em>would strip the Appellate Division and Supreme Court of New Jersey of them authority to review and would encroach upon the state\u2019s jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cappellate review at the state level afford the plaintiff an alternative and more effective remedy.\u201d (App. 7). <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a) (\u201cIn a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, ... any court of the United States ... <em>may </em>declare the rights and other legal relations of any interested party seeking such declaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought.\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">(4) Finally, regarding the claim for injunctive relief against Sifre, Edwards, and Einhorn Harris, the Court found that abstention was appropriate under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), because there is an ongoing proceeding in New York state court, the state of New York \u201chas an important interest in controlling and reviewing filings submitted to its courts,\u201d and the state court here \u201cis better equipped to determine whether any such filing is \u2018wrongful, deceitful and injurious.\u2019 \u201d (App. 10-11). <em>See Yang v. Tsui </em>416 F.3d 199, 202 (3d Cir.2005) (\u201cThree requirements must be met before <em>Younger </em>abstention is appropriate: (1) there must be an ongoing state judicial proceeding to which the federal plaintiff is a party and with which the federal proceeding will interfere, (2) the state proceedings must implicate important state interests, and (3) the state proceedings must afford an adequate opportunity to raise the claims.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b181-8\">We find no error in the reasoning of the District Court in its thorough opinion, as we have detailed it above. Accordingly, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b180-14\">. The alleged constitutional violations appear to be the denial of due process, discrimination against children of unmarried parents, and discrimination against unmarried fathers.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
