On appeal, Gedinez claims that the District Court violated his right to a fair trial by (1) refusing to let him be tried separately from his co-defendant, (2) admitting evidence of his prior bad acts that should have been excluded pursuant to Federal Rules of Evidence 403 and 404, and (3) declining to recuse itself after it came to light that Judge Stein owned stock in a bank victimized by Gedinez\u2019s fraud. Gedinez also contends that (4) the District Court violated his Sixth Amendment rights of confrontation by admitting, through the testimony of another witness, statements of his non-testifying co-defendant. Finally, Gedinez claims that (5) the evidence introduced at trial was insufficient to support his conviction, (6) he received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel, and (7) the twenty-seven month sentence imposed upon him was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-18\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history. Upon review of the record, we conclude that the seven issues Gedinez raises on appeal are all lacking in merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-19\">(1) \u201cWhether to grant or deny a severance motion is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.\u201d <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 115 (2d Cir.1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Values of efficiency and fairness weigh heavily in favor of trying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>jointly defendants who are charged with participation \u201cin a common plan or scheme.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201cIt would impair both the efficiency and the fairness of the criminal justice system to require ... that prosecutors ... present[ ] the same evidence again and again, requiring victims and witnesses to repeat the inconvenience (and sometimes trauma) of testifying, and randomly favoring the last-tried defendants who have the advantage of knowing the prosecution\u2019s case beforehand.\u201d (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Rosa, </em>11 F.3d 315, 341 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cEvidence at the joint trial of alleged coconspirators that, because of the alleged conspiratorial nature of the illegal activity, would have been admissible at a separate trial of the moving defendant is neither spillover nor prejudicial.\u201d). \u201cAccordingly, a district court\u2019s denial of a severance motion ... will be reversed only if a defendant can show prejudice so severe that his conviction constituted a miscarriage of justice, and that the denial of his motion constituted an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Salameh, </em>152 F.3d at 115 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Because Gedinez has failed to make such a showing, his first claim on appeal is unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">(2) \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to admit evidence of other crimes for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Lumpkin, </em>192 F.3d 280, 287 (2d Cir.1999). In doing so, we take an \u201cinclusionary\u201d approach, \u201callowing evidence to be admitted for any legitimate purpose other than to show a defendant\u2019s criminal propensity.\u201d <em>United States v. Zackson, </em>6 F.3d 911, 921 (2d Cir.1993). The evidence that Gedinez challenges was properly admitted to \u201cinform the jury of the background of the conspiracy charged, ... explain how the illegal relationship between participants in the crime developed, [and] explain the mutual trust that existed between coconspirators.\u201d <em>Rosa, </em>11 F.3d at 334. Furthermore, taking into account the nature of the other evidence admitted against Gedinez with respect to his charged crimes, it cannot be said that the \u201cprobative value\u201d of any evidence relating to other crimes was \u201csubstantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\u201d Federal Rule of Evidence 403. Accordingly, we reject Gedinez\u2019s second claim on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">(3) We conclude that Judge Stein\u2019s ownership of stock in a bank victimized by Gedinez\u2019s fraud did not require Judge Stein to recuse himself in light of the fact that the 4,100 shares owned by Judge Stein amounted to only .000091 percent of the roughly 4.5 billion shares then-outstanding. <em>Cf. United States v. Lauersen, </em>348 F.3d 329, 335 (2d Cir.2003) (noting with approval our earlier holding in <em>United States v. Ravich, </em>421 F.2d 1196, 1205 (2d Cir.1970) that \u201cownership of a small amount [ \u2014 specifically, .0072 percent \u2014 ] of the stock\u201d of a bank victimized by the defendant\u2019s crime \u201cdid not disqualify a judge from presiding at the criminal trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">(4) We further conclude that Gedinez\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was not violated by the District Court\u2019s admission of a statement that Gedinez\u2019s non-testifying co-defendant made to an acquaintance. As an initial matter, we conclude that the statement was non-testimonial in nature. <em>Cf. Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006) (noting that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not\u201d); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>506 F.3d 151, 156 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that \u201cthe Confrontation Clause simply has no application to nontestimonial statements\u201d (quoting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number><em>United States v. Feliz, </em>467 F.3d 227, 231 (2d Cir.2006))). We also note that, before admitting the statement, the District Court replaced Gedinez\u2019s name with a neutral pronoun. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>936 F.2d 698, 700 (2d Cir.1991). Because the statement standing alone does not otherwise connect Gedinez to the crime, even if the statement in question was testimonial, its admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">(5) We reject Gedinez\u2019s sufficiency challenge upon concluding that the record contains sufficient evidence for a rational fact-finder to find Gedinez guilty of his offenses of conviction. <em>Cf. United States v. Carlo, </em>507 F.3d 799, 801 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201cOn an appeal challenging the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, and reverse only if no rational factfinder could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d); <em>United States v. Glenn, </em>312 F.3d 58, 64 (2d Cir.2002) (noting that, in evaluating a sufficiency challenge, we \u201cdefer to the jury\u2019s assessment of witness credibility and the jury\u2019s resolution of conflicting testimony\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">(6) Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are best \u201clitigated in the first instance in the district court, the forum best suited to developing the facts necessary to determining the adequacy of representation during an entire trial.\u201d <em>Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003); <em>accord United States v. Khedr, </em>343 F.3d 96, 100 (2d Cir.2003). Accordingly, \u201cin most cases[,] a motion brought under \u00a7 2255 is preferable to direct appeal for deciding claims of ineffective-assistance.\u201d <em>Massaro, </em>538 U.S. at 504, 123 S.Ct. 1690; <em>accord Khedr, </em>343 F.3d at 99-100. In keeping with this guidance, we decline to consider Gedinez\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims at this stage of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">(7) Finally, we reject Gedinez\u2019s challenge to the reasonableness of the sentence imposed upon him. Gedinez\u2019s claim that the District Court committed procedural error by considering conduct outside of his conduct of conviction is without merit in light of <em>United States v. Vaughn, </em>430 F.3d 518, 527 (2d Cir.2005) (noting that \u201cdistrict courts may find facts relevant to sentencing by a preponderance of the evidence ... as long as the judge does not impose (1) a sentence in the belief that the Guidelines are mandatory, (2) a sentence that exceeds the statutory maximum authorized by the jury verdict, or (3) a mandatory minimum sentence under \u00a7 841(b) not authorized by the verdict\u201d). Nor has our review of the record revealed any errors that would undermine the substantive reasonableness of Gedinez\u2019s sentence. <em>Cf. Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007) (emphasizing that \u201cthe familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions\u201d); <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19 (2d Cir.2006) observing that we will deem a sentence substantively reasonable unless the sentencing judge \u201cexceeded the bounds of allowable discretion[,] ... committed an error of law in the course of exercising discretion, or made a clearly erroneous finding of fact\u201d (modifications in original, internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-10\">Having considered all of Gedinez\u2019s arguments on appeal and found them to be without merit, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
