Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d 804, 804 (5th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Under <em>Gall, </em>prior to reviewing a sentence under the abuse-of-discretion standard, an appellate court must first determine whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. If the sentencing decision is proeedurally sound, the appellate court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence\u201d under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[A] sentence within a properly calculated Guideline range is presumptively reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see also Rita v. United </em>States, - U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Coil challenges the remedial portion of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), arguing that to the extent that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision made the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, <em>Booker </em>was wrongly decided and should be overruled because it violates the Separation of Powers doctrine. Coil concedes that this court cannot overrule <em>Booker </em>and acknowledges \u201cthat this Court rejected a similar (though not identical) argument in <em>United States v. Scrog-gins, </em>411 F.3d 572 (5th Cir.2005),\u201d and he raises the issue to preserve its further review. As Coil concedes, absent an intervening decision to the contrary by the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion <em>Booker </em>opinion is binding. <em>See Hopwood v. Texas, </em>84 F.3d 720, 722 (5th Cir.1996) (Politz, C.J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (\u201cThe Supreme Court has left no doubt that as a constitutionally inferior court, we are compelled to follow faithfully a directly controlling Supreme Court precedent unless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-15\">Coil argues that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category as II because the court included two sentences of imprisonment of less than one year and imposed more than ten years before the offenses of conviction commenced, in violation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(e)(2). Issues not raised in an appeal prior to this court\u2019s last order of remand are deemed abandoned. <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>73 F.3d 1322, 1329 (5th Cir.1996). Coil\u2019s challenge to the calculation of his criminal history score was not raised in his appeal prior to this court\u2019s last order of remand and is deemed abandoned. <em>See Eason, </em>73 F.3d at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-16\">Coil argues that the district court failed to make findings justifying the enhancements to his base offense level on count 23. Because Coil did not raise this argument in the district court, review of this procedural objection is for plain error only. <em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 805-06 (relying on <em>United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) (applying plain error to unraised issue concerning the reasonableness of a sentence), <em>peti</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number><em>tion for cert. filed </em>(Jan. 22, 2008) (No. 07-8978)). On plain error review, this court \u201cmay correct the sentencing determination only if (1) there is error (and in light of <em>Booker, </em>an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 sentence equates to a finding of error); (2) it is plain; and (3) it affects substantial rights.\u201d <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392 (citation omitted). \u201cMoreover, [Fed.R.Crim.P.] 52(b) leaves the decision to correct the forfeited error within the sound discretion of the court of appeals, and the court should not exercise that discretion unless the error seriously affectfs] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">At resentencing, the district court considered Coil\u2019s objections to the Presentence Report\u2019s (PSR) recommended enhancements for a leadership role in the offense, for more than minimal planning, and for the use of sophisticated means and overruled them. In overruling the objections, the court stated that the enhancements were \u201ctraditional considerations that [had] always been applied by sentencing courts with or without guidelines before, during, and after.\u201d The court added that it was \u201cmore than appropriate to apply them to any process of arriving at a reasonable sentence in this case.\u201d The record reflects that the district court adopted the PSR., The district court may adopt the recitation of facts found in the PSR, provided that there is a sufficient basis for these facts and the defendant adduces no rebuttal evidence. <em>United States v. Caldwell, </em>448 F.3d 287, 290 (5th Cir.2006). Coil has not met the burden of demonstrating that the district court should not have relied upon the PSR. <em>See United States v. Betancourt, </em>422 F.3d 240, 248 (5th Cir.2005). He has shown no error, plain or otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">Coil asserts that the district court did not refer to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) or to any of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) in imposing sentence. This court requires arguments to be briefed in order to be preserved. <em>Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 225 (5th Cir.1993); Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9). Coil\u2019s broad statement of error without argument or citation to relevant authority is inadequate for purposes of appeal, and the issue is deemed abandoned. <em>See Yohey, </em>985 F.2d at 225.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">Finally, Coil argues that his 60-month statutory maximum sentence on count 23 was unreasonable because the sentence deprived him of any benefit for acceptance of responsibility. He notes that his guidelines range was 63 to 78 months of imprisonment or more than the 60-month statutory maximum, and he refers to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(a), which provides that \u201cwhere the statutorily authorized maximum sentence is less than the minimum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily authorized maximum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d Coil relies on <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>64 F.3d 638 (11th Cir.1995), a <em>pre-Booker </em>decision, arguing that the district court had the discretion to downwardly depart.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">To the extent that Coil argues that the district court should have downwardly departed based on his acceptance of responsibility, a court of appeals is generally without jurisdiction to review a sentencing court\u2019s refusal to grant a downward departure when its decision is based upon a determination that a departure was not warranted on the facts of the case before it. <em>United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 424 (5th Cir.2006). The court retains jurisdiction to review \u201cwhether the district court\u2019s imposition of a guideline sentence instead of a non-guideline sentence was reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Nikonova, </em>480 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. de</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number><em>nied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 163, 169 L.Ed.2d 112 (2007). Because Coil did not argue in the district court that the 60-month sentence deprived him of credit for acceptance of responsibility and rendered his sentence unreasonable, review is for plain error only. <em>See Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 805-06; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Coil\u2019s sentence, within a properly calculated guidelines range, is presumptively reasonable. <em>See Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d at 554. Because Coil\u2019s 60-month sentence was within the advisory guidelines range, this court \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United, States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519-20 (5th Cir.2005). Coil has not shown error, plain or otherwise with respect to his argument that his 60-month sentence was unreasonable because it failed to accord him credit for acceptance of responsibility. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596; <em>see also Lopez-Velasquez, </em>526 F.3d at 805-06; <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-11\"><em> </em>Pursuant to 5th Cir.
