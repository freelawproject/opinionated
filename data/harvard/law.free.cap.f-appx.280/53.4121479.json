DeFonzo, pretermitting his application for asylum, granting him withholding of removal to China, and ordering him removed to France. <em>In re Haiyong Li, </em>No. A98 906 355 (B.I.A. Sept. 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 906 355 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 19, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-20\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements that decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-21\">In addition to the statutory requirement that petitioners exhaust the categories of relief they seek, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), in order for us to hear argument on any particular issue, petitioners must first raise that issue before the BIA. <em>See Foster v. INS, </em>376 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.2004). While not jurisdictional, this judicially imposed exhaustion requirement is mandatory. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). Because the sole argument Li raises before us \u2014 regarding whether he established \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d such that the one-year deadline was inapplicable to his asylum application \u2014 was not raised in his appeal to the BIA, and because the government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, we therefore decline to consider the issue. ' <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>at 124. Because Li waived any challenge to the issues we would be \u201cempowered to review,\u201d his petition for review must be denied. <em>See Nwogu v. Gonzales, </em>491 F.3d 80, 84 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
