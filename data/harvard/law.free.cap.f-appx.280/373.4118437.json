The decision to terminate Waris\u2019s employment was based on numerous complaints about his attitude, verbal attacks, and unprofessional conduct after previous reprimands, including sending an improper email to his subordinates and supervisors about a member of the United States Congress who sponsored a public immunization event through the clinic.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-27\">Waris, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed suit alleging discrimination based on race and national origin and violation of constitutional rights. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>The district court adopted the findings and recommendation of a magistrate judge and granted summary judgment for the Defendants. We agree with the district court that Waris failed to demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of race or national origin discrimination in that no evidence of disparate treatment was advanced. Waris also failed to adequately state any claim for violation of constitutional rights. Finding that there was no jurisdiction once the Defendants were granted summary judgment, the district court properly refused to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the state law claims. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">For the reasons adopted by the district court, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b399-28\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
