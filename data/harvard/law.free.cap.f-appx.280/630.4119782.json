We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for abuse of discretion, <em>see Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion when it denied reconsideration because Hayrapetyan\u2019s motion merely disagreed with the BIA\u2019s prior decision and did not specify errors of law or fact as required by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(6)(C) (\u201cThe motion [to reconsider] shall specify the errors of law or fact in the previous order and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\u201d). Further, the BIA did not abuse its discretion when it also construed the motion as a motion to reopen, <em>see Mohammed v. Gonzales, </em>400 F.3d 785, 793 (9th Cir.2005), and concluded that Hayrapetyan did not put forth evidence of changed circumstances, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii) (permitting a motion to reopen based on evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered, if such evidence is material and was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">To the extent Hayrapetyan raises contentions regarding the BIA\u2019s underlying decision, we lack jurisdiction to review those contentions because this petition is not timely as to that decision. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995) (holding that Congress \u201cenvisioned two separate petitions filed to review two separate final orders\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b656-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
