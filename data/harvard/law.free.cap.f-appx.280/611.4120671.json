We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-8\">Cohen alleges that ICE violated 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(4)(A) by failing to remove him in 2003, when he was placed into ICE custody while awaiting trial on the charges for which he is currently imprisoned. Cohen\u2019s claim is barred by the plain language of the statute, as Congress has explicitly stated that there is no right of action under that provision. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(a)(4)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-9\">Cohen next seeks to challenge the 2001 reinstatement of his 1996 removal order. The district court correctly held that it had no jurisdiction to consider the validity of the reinstatement order in a habeas petition, as the proper vehicle for a challenge to a reinstatement order is a petition for review filed directly with this Court. <em>See Castro-Cortez v. INS, </em>239 F.3d 1037, 1047 (9th Cir.2001) <em>(abrogated on other grounds by Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>548 U.S. 30, 126 S.Ct. 2422, 165 L.Ed.2d 323 (2006)). Even if review were appropriate, our recent en banc decision in <em>Morales-Izquierdo v. Gonzales, </em>486 F.3d 484, 495, 496 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), forecloses Cohen\u2019s due process argument as well as his claim that 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 241.8 is ultra vires to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-13\">Cohen also challenges the 1996 removal order itself. He contends that the Immigration Court lacked jurisdiction over his case, as it was stayed under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.6(a) (1995) pending resolution of an interlocutory appeal he filed with the BIA. Section 3.6 is properly read to provide for an automatic stay pending appeal of a final order of removal, not an interlocutory appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Cohen similarly argues that he was unlawfully deported at a time when his deportation was stayed under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a)(3) (1994). This Court has already determined that there was no stay of deportation in effect when Cohen was deported, and we are bound by that determination. <em>United States v. Cohen, </em>55 Fed.Appx. 852 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b638-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b638-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b638-11\">. The BIA considers interlocutory appeals in exceptional cases only. <em>Matter of Ku, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 712, 713 (B.I.A.1976); <em>Matter of Sacco, </em>15 I. &amp; N. Dec. 109, 110 (B.I.A.1974). Because the BIA declined to hear Cohen\u2019s interlocutory appeal, we do not reach the issue of whether 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.6(a) would automatically stay the proceedings in the rare case where the BIA does accept jurisdiction over an interlocutory appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
