He contends that insufficient evidence supported his conviction; alternatively, he contends that the district court erred by making an improper comment in front of the jury and by providing a misleading answer to a request the jury made during deliberations. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-19\">1. Romero first contends that there was insufficient evidence to support his conviction because the object he possessed (a vegetable knife) is not a \u201cprohibited object,\u201d as that phrase is defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791. A \u201cprohibited object\u201d is defined as, among other things, a \u201cweapon\u201d or an object \u201cdesigned or intended to be used as a weapon.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1791(d)(1). Thus, the Government needed to prove that the vegetable knife was a weapon, an object designed to be a weapon, or an object intended to be used a weapon. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>87 F.3d 133, 136 n. 2 (5th Cir.1996) (\u201c[A] disjunctive statute may be pleaded conjunctively and proved disjunc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>tively.\u201d (internal citation and quotation marks omitted)). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational juror could have found that Romero possessed the knife to defend himself (i.e., as an object intended to be used as a weapon) and not simply as a ticket to solitary confinement, as he claimed at trial. While some evidence indicated that Romero never intended to use the knife as a weapon, other evidence (including Romero\u2019s own statements) indicated that he did. Given the conflicting evidence, a rational juror could have found that Romero intended to use the knife as a weapon.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-5\">2. Romero next contends that the evidence establishes that he met his defense of duress as a matter of law. To prove his defense, Romero needed to show, among other things, that he \u201chad no reasonable legal alternative to violating the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Willis, </em>38 F.3d 170, 175 (5th Cir.1994) (internal citation omitted). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, a rational juror could have concluded that Romero failed to establish that element. A rational juror could have concluded that providing prison officials with more detailed information about the threats he had received was a reasonable legal alternative to taking the knife. While Romero testified why providing prison officials with more information might not be a reasonable alternative, the jury was entitled to conclude to the contrary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">3. Romero also contends that he was prejudiced when the district court sustained a Government objection during his cross-examination and purportedly made a comment that undermined his defense. Romero argues that the comment signaled to the jury that the district court agreed with the Government that he was providing elusive answers and that his testimony was not credible. Because Romero did not object below, we review for plain error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The district court\u2019s comment was within its wide discretion to control the tone and tempo of the trial and did not constitute plain error. <em>See United States v. Saenz, </em>134 F.3d 697, 701, 704 (5th Cir.1998). The court\u2019s single comment was not quantitatively or qualitatively substantial, and the district court instructed the jury that it was not to consider such comments in its deliberations. <em>See idr, United States v. Bermea, </em>30 F.3d 1539, 1571-72 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-9\">4. Finally, Romero contends that the district court prejudiced the outcome of his trial by responding incompletely to the jury\u2019s request to review trial testimony. Romero argues that the district court did not provide all of the transcript sections that were encompassed by the jury\u2019s request and omitted relevant evidence that may have influenced the jury\u2019s verdict. As Romero made no objection below, our review is again for plain error.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-10\">\u201c[A] trial judge has broad discretion in responding to the jury\u2019s request for the transcript of a particular witnesses] testimony!)]\u201d <em>United States v. Schmitt, </em>748 F.2d 249, 256 (5th Cir.1984). The testimony that Romero argues was improperly omitted was not responsive to the jury\u2019s request; although the additional testimony may have provided context to the excerpt provided to the jury, the district court did not plainly err in limiting its response to the portion of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>the transcript that was directly responsive.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b396-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
