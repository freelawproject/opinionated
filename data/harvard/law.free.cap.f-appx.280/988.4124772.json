Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>DE-1221-07-391-W-1, DE-1221-07-0280-W-1, 108 M.S.P.R. 20 (M.S.P.B. Jan. 7, 2008) <em>(\u201cFinal Order\u201d). </em>Because Fast Wolf has failed to meet his burden to demonstrate error in the Board\u2019s decision, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1015-10\">Fast Wolf and the Department of Health and Human Services (\u201cthe agency\u201d) entered into a settlement agreement to resolve two individual-right-of-action appeals Fast Wolf had filed with the Board. On July 30, 2007, after concluding that \u201cthe parties understand and freely accept the terms of the agreement,\u201d an administrative judge entered the executed settlement agreement into the record for purposes of enforcement and dismissed the appeals. <em>Fast Wolf v. Dep\u2019t of Health &amp; Human Servs., </em>DE-1221-07-391-W-1, DE-1221-07-0280-W-1, slip op. at 2 (M.S.P.B. July 30, 2007) <em>(\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). </em>Among other things, the settlement agreement provided for the agency to rescind various personnel actions in exchange for Fast Wolf withdrawing his individual-right-of-action appeals and resigning from his position.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-12\">Following entry of the executed settlement agreement and dismissal of the appeals in the AJ\u2019s <em>Initial Decision, </em>Fast Wolf filed before the Board a petition for review, requesting that the Board \u201creopen and consider [his] appeal based on the Agency\u2019s actions that constructively discharged [him] and coerced [him] to settle.\u201d Pet\u2019r\u2019s App. at 1. The Board, applying the standard set forth at 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.115(d), dismissed Fast Wolfs petition for review after concluding \u201cthat there [wa]s no new, previously unavailable, evidence and that the administrative judge made no error in law or regulation that affects the outcome.\u201d <em>Final Order </em>at 1. Thus, the dismissal by the AJ became the final decision of the Board. Fast Wolf timely appealed that decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-13\">Our scope of review of Board decisions is defined and limited by statute. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). \u201cThe agency\u2019s action in this case must be affirmed unless it is found to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). \u201cThe petitioner bears the burden of establishing error in the Board\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Harris v. DVA, </em>142 F.3d 1463, 1467 (Fed.Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1015-14\">The thrust of Fast Wolfs appeal is that the settlement agreement is invalid because he was coerced into executing it. In support of his position, Fast Wolf makes various allegations of agency misconduct relating to what he characterizes as intolerable working conditions. <em>E.g., </em>Pet\u2019r\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"990\">*990</page-number>App. at 1-2. These allegations, however, relate not to whether he was coerced into executing the settlement agreement, but rather to the underlying merits of his individual-right-of-action appeals. Fast Wolfs allegations are irrelevant unless he can demonstrate that the settlement was coerced. That he has failed to do. Moreover, Fast Wolf has not shown that the evidence presented to the Board was previously unavailable, nor has he otherwise pointed to an error of law by the AJ that might have affected the outcome. As a result, he has failed to meet his burden to demonstrate error in the Board\u2019s decision. The decision of the Board is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-4\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
