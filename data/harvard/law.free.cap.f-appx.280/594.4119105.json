Our review is de novo, <em>see Miller v. County of Santa Cruz, </em>39 F.3d 1030, 1032 (9th Cir.1994), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-23\">The district court held that this action was precluded by the collateral estoppel effect of a prior negligence action against Wells Fargo regarding the same fraud. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>Mid-Century argues that its action was brought by a different insurer and involves different checks cashed at different times.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">The district court correctly determined that both actions required consideration of whether Wells Fargo acted below the standard of care in accepting a series of checks made payable to \u201cSouthern California Auto Auction.\u201d The issues involving acceptance of those checks are identical. <em>See Kourtis v. Cameron, </em>419 F.3d 989, 995 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">Privity also exists between the two insurers as to the issues presented in this appeal. They stood in the shoes of the same insured party to litigate the same issues. <em>See Irwin v. Mascott, </em>370 F.3d 924, 929-30 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">Finally, Mid-Century\u2019s argument that it is entitled to damages for all checks following the June 2001 check that Wells Fargo negligently accepted cannot succeed. Mid-Century contends that the jury\u2019s finding amounted to a finding that Wells Fargo accepted the check in bad faith, and that this finding entitles Mid-Century to consequential damages for all the subsequent fraudulent checks. The district court correctly observed, in rejecting this claim, that the <em>National Union </em>jury found only negligence and made no finding of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">The district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b620-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
