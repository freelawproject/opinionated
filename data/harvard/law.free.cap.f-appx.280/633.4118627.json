R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b660-8\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b660-9\">Aramis Arredondo, a Nevada state prisoner, appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s orders dismissing his action for failure to comply with a court order, and denying his motion to alter the judgment, in his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action alleging that defendants violated his civil rights by using excessive force when arresting him. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to alter the judgment. <em>Weeks v. Bayer, </em>246 F.3d 1231, 1234 (9th Cir.2001). We vacate the district court\u2019s order denying Arredondo\u2019s motion to alter the judgment and remand for consideration of Arredondo\u2019s reply.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-10\">The district court ruled on Arredondo\u2019s motion to alter the judgment after the defendants\u2019 opposition but before receiving Arredondo\u2019s reply. The district court denied the motion, finding Arredondo failed to show he did not receive the order instructing him to sign the pretrial order. Arredondo\u2019s reply, however, contained relevant evidence regarding the prison mail log and his attempts to obtain it. Arredondo\u2019s motion and reply were timely under the mailbox rule. <em>See Caldwell v. Amend, </em>30 F.3d 1199, 1201 (9th Cir.1994). We therefore vacate the district court\u2019s order denying the motion and remand for the district court to consider Arredondo\u2019s reply and its attached evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Arredondo\u2019s contentions that the district court judge was biased are not supported by the record. <em>See Toth v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., </em>862 F.2d 1381, 1388 (9th Cir.1988) (holding that a judge\u2019s legal decisions cannot be used as evidence of bias).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\">In light of this disposition, we decline to consider Arredondo\u2019s remaining contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-15\">We deny defendants\u2019 request for sanctions. Each party shall bear its own costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-16\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b660-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>ed by 9th Cir.
