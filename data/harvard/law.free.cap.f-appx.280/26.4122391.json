Clifford Wallace, United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b53-13\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b53-14\">Okobo Vieira appeals from a judgment entered on August 30, 2006 in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Block, J.), convicting him, following a jury trial, of conspiring to import cocaine, importing cocaine, and conspiring to distribute and possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 963, 952(a), 846, and 841, respectively. The conspiracy was led primarily by a Guyanese national named Devendr\u00e1 Persaud. Persaud\u2019s girlfriend, Alicia Jagnarain, testified as a cooperating witness for the government at trial. The district court sentenced Vieira to 140 months of incarceration, to be followed by five years of supervised release, and also imposed a special assessment of $500. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-15\">On appeal, Vieira argues: (1) that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his convictions on counts one and two of the Indictment, which respectively charged him with conspiring to import more than five kilograms of cocaine in January 2003, and importing more than five kilograms of cocaine in January 2003; (2) that the district court erred in admitting hearsay evidence; (3) that the government violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by eliciting testimony regarding a co-defendant\u2019s post-arrest confession; and (4) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>that the government\u2019s unintentional failure to disclose a report containing debriefings of a government witness entitles him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>a challenge to the sufficiency of evidence and \u201caffirm if the evidence, when viewed in its totality and in the light most favorable to the government, would permit any rational jury to find the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Geibel, </em>369 F.3d 682, 689 (2d Cir.2004). Vieira argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he knew the January 28, 2003 scheme to import cargo involved illegal drugs, as opposed to some other type of contraband. The government, however, introduced a drug ledger and testimony which indicated that Vieira had purchased kilogram quantities of cocaine from Persaud prior to January 28, 2003. Moreover, Jagnarain testified that Vieira was involved in a scheme to import cocaine in cargo handled by his place of business, and that Vieira\u2019s role was to \u201cget [the cargo] out of the shipping company, so they didn\u2019t have to produce a person ... with an ID.\u201d When the cargo was intercepted by Customs at JFK Airport, it was Vieira who alerted Persaud to the seizure. The jury was entitled to conclude that someone who was so deeply involved in the scheme could not have remained ignorant of the scheme\u2019s essential objective. Viewed in the light most favorable to the government, the evidence sufficiently established Vieira\u2019s guilt on counts one and two.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Rule 801(d)(2)(E) of the Federal Rules of Evidence provides that \u201c[a] statement is not hearsay if ... [it] is offered against a party and is ... [made] by a coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.\u201d The contents of the hearsay statement at issue \u201cshall be considered but are not alone sufficient to establish ... the existence of the conspiracy.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(E). Vieira argues that certain hearsay testimony by Jagnarain \u2014 relating a statement of Persaud \u2014 was incorrectly admitted under Rule 801(d)(2)(E) because there was insufficient independent evidence of Vieira\u2019s involvement in the conspiracy, and Persaud\u2019s statement was not made in furtherance of the conspiracy. Because Vieira did not object to this testimony at trial, we review his claim for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). The independent evidence of Vieira\u2019s involvement with the conspiracy included a drug ledger which indicated an ongoing drug-related relationship between Persaud and Vieira prior to the January 2003 importation, telephone records which revealed that more than 350 calls were made between phones registered to Vieira and Persaud over a six-month period, and documentary evidence which established that Vieira\u2019s father\u2019s company was used in the importation scheme. This evidence sufficiently established \u201ca likelihood of an illicit association between the declarant and the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Ginsberg, </em>758 F.2d 823, 828 (2d Cir.1985) (internal quotation marks omitted). Further, Persaud\u2019s statement to a co-conspirator communicated the logistics of the importation scheme, thereby facilitating criminal activity. [T 198-99]. Thus, the admission of Jagnarain\u2019s hearsay testimony did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Vieira further argues that the government violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by eliciting Special Agent Michael Giovanoni\u2019s testimony that one of Vieira\u2019s co-defendants, Brentnol Hooper, admitted to carrying one of Vieira\u2019s cell phones on the day of the failed importa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>tion. <em>See Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 126, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) (despite jury instructions to the contrary, admission of a non-testifying co-defendant\u2019s confession violated petitioner\u2019s right of cross-examination secured by the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment). Because Vieira did not object to this portion of Giovanoni\u2019s testimony at trial, his claim is reviewed for plain error.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 51(b); Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1). The fact that Hooper had a cell phone that was registered to Vieira was established by independent and uncontroverted documentary evidence. And, in light of the fact that Vieira\u2019s father owned the import/export business for which Hooper worked, Hooper\u2019s possession of a cell phone registered to Vieira was not materially incriminating. In contrast to Vieira\u2019s assertion, nothing in Giovanoni\u2019s testimony established that Vieira gave Hooper the phone for the purpose of carrying out the smuggling operation. Indeed, the entirety of Giovanoni\u2019s testimony about Hooper\u2019s statement was that Hooper had said \u201che had his own phone, and one in the name of Okobo Vieira\u201d on the day of the seizure. [GA 235]. Thus, Vieira cannot establish that the admission of this testimony amounted to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">Vieira\u2019s final claim is that the government\u2019s unintentional non-disclosure of \u201c3500 material,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, entitles him to a new trial. When the government\u2019s failure to disclose \u201c3500 material\u201d is unintentional, \u201ca new trial is required only if there is a significant chance that this added item, developed by skilled counsel, could have induced a reasonable doubt in the minds of enough jurors to avoid a conviction.\u201d <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>345 F.3d 59, 78 n. 14 (2d Cir.2003). Vieira does not identify anything in the undisclosed report that was not already evoked at Jagnarain\u2019s cross-examination. The jury credited Jagnarain\u2019s testimony despite Vieira\u2019s substantial efforts to discredit her and, as a result, it is highly unlikely that the addition of one cumulative proffer report would have changed the outcome of the trial. Furthermore, while Jagnarain\u2019s testimony formed the bulk of the government\u2019s case against Vieira, there was independent evidence corroborating her claim that Vieira was involved in the conspiracy: (1) the drug ledger; (2) telephone records establishing hundreds of phone calls between phones registered to Persaud and Vieira; and (3) the involvement of Vieira\u2019s father\u2019s business in the shipment of drugs, which was established through documentary evidence. Thus, no new trial is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em>. </em>Although Vieira asserts that plain error review is inapplicable because the government mentioned <em>Bruton </em>prior to Giovanoni\u2019s testimony, the government\u2019s prediction that Giovanoni\u2019s testimony would avoid <em>Bruton </em>issues did not relieve Vieira of his obligation to timely object and state the specific grounds for his objection, if not apparent. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 51(b); Fed.R.Evid. 103(a)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
