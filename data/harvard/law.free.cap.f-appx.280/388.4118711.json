On the first go-around, the district court sentenced Coleman to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, a 54% upward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines range. We vacated the sentence and remanded for re-sentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court imposed the same sentence. This time, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-15\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b415-16\">Coleman pled guilty to one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Coleman\u2019s Guidelines range was 63 to 78 months. Prior to sentencing, the district court told the parties that it was considering an upward departure because of Coleman\u2019s \u201ccriminal history and the nature of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, at sentencing, the district court made no mention of Coleman\u2019s history and instead \u201cindicated that it considered Coleman\u2019s offense to be a different situation from a typical felon-in-possession charge.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court sentenced Coleman to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment, 42 months above the top of the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>On appeal, we held that the district court failed to articulate sufficient reasons to justify the upward departure. We concluded that the court\u2019s finding that Coleman\u2019s offense presented a \u201c \u2018different situation\u2019 from a typical felon in possession charge\u201d rested upon a clearly erroneous factual finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Turning to Coleman\u2019s criminal history, we found that it could not support the sentence for two reasons. First, the district court did not mention it during the sentencing hearing. Second, assuming we should consider it, we concluded that the district court failed to explain why Coleman\u2019s criminal history justified an upward departure:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">Even if we were to consider the explanation in the written judgment, however, we would find it inadequate, because the court did not \u201cspecify in writing ... the specific reasons why the applicable criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(c)(1). In <em>United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345 (5th Cir.2006), we upheld a sentence where the court\u2019s written statement failed to provide specific factual reasons; we did so because the court had expressly adopted the findings of the PSR, which recommended a departure under \u00a7 4A1.3.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">Coleman\u2019s PSR makes no such recommendation. Although Coleman has a number of older convictions that were not considered in calculating his criminal history score, the district court did not indicate why criminal history category VI does not adequately account for these convictions, particularly in view of the fact that none of Coleman\u2019s prior felony convictions was for violent conduct. Without specific, stated reasons for the upward departure, the departure does not survive the abuse-of-discretion standard of review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">Accordingly, we vacated and remanded for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">The district court scheduled a re-sentencing hearing. The day of the hearing, but prior to the hearing, the district court gave the parties a written memorandum that explained that the court would impose the same sentence as before. The court stated that \u201ceven though the defendant has scored sufficient criminal history points to place him in category VI, even the highest criminal category seriously under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history.\u201d The court went on to explain that Coleman\u2019s criminal history score failed to account for eleven prior felonies and misdemeanors because of the age of the conviction or the unavailability of offense reports. Nor did the criminal history score account for five intervening arrests. The court also felt that the state courts had afforded Coleman \u201cunearned leniency.\u201d The court noted that Coleman had been convicted of \u201csimple battery,\u201d as well as two convictions for burglary of an inhabited dwelling \u2014 thus, the court found that Coleman\u2019s criminal history \u201cis not a violence-free record.\u201d Based on Coleman\u2019s \u201ccontinuous criminal involvement for the past 27 years and the fact that his criminal history score seriously misrepresents his criminal history,\u201d the court stated that it would impose the same 120 month sentence as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">During the sentencing hearing, the court told the parties that its memorandum ruling laid out reasons for the upward departure. The court then stated, \u201cSince this is not the initial sentencing, I do not believe <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>there is any right to allocution. I heard all at the first sentencing, so I don\u2019t thin[k] there is any need to go through that.\u201d The court then re-imposed the original sentence.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-5\">Coleman\u2019s counsel objected,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-6\">I would object for the record, your Hon- or, and note the Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion. I just got handed the copy of the memorandum ruling, and I note that the Fifth Circuit opinion notes that it did not adequately account \u2014 the district court did not indicate why criminal history category six does not adequately account for these convictions particularly in view of the fact that none of Coleman\u2019s prior felony convictions were for violent conduct. And I noted, and just briefly when I was able to read the memorandum ruling, it appears that some mention was made about that. So just\u2014 because I just got it, I need to object again for the record; and for the sentence imposed again, for the same reasons I earlier objected to.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The court overruled the objection. This appeal follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">The Supreme Court has explained that its \u201cexplanation of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review in the <em>[United States </em>v.] <em>Booker </em>[543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) ] opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is so \u201c[r]egardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In conducting this review, we first \u201censure that the district court committed no significant procedural error.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error, and its interpretation of the Guidelines <em>de novo.</em><footnotemark><em>9</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We then consider the \u201csubstantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. When conducting this review, the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b417-18\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b417-19\">Coleman first argues that the district court erred by not offering him the opportunity to allocute at the re-sentencing hearing. The Government does not challenge Coleman\u2019s contention that the right to allocution extends to re-sentencing.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Government does contend, however, that our review is limited to plain error because Coleman failed to object.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> We agree. Although Coleman\u2019s counsel objected during the re-sentencing hearing, the objection did not raise Coleman\u2019s right to allocute.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>Pursuant to our en banc decision in <em>United States v. Reyna, </em>the Government concedes the district court\u2019s error in failing to invite Coleman to allocute was plain,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that it affected Coleman\u2019s substantial rights.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Government urges, however, that we should not exercise our discretion to correct the error because it does not \u201c\u2018seriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">In <em>Reyna, </em>we rejected a \u201cblanket rule that once prejudice is found ... the error invariably requires correction.\u201d We explained that \u201cthe right to allocution \u2018is not a fundamental defect that inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice nor an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, we recognized that \u201c[i]n a limited class of cases, a review of the record may reveal, despite the presence of disputed sentencing issues, that the violation of a defendant\u2019s right to allocution does not violate the last <em>Olano </em>prong.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> There must be a basis in the record for concluding that a reasonable jurist would have imposed a lesser sentence.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">We decline to exercise our discretion because Coleman has not pointed to anything that would have moved a reasonable jurist to impose a lesser sentence. As for explanation, the district court was specific as to why it was re-imposing the sentence: Coleman\u2019s long and continuous criminal history, which it thought the criminal history score failed to reflect. Coleman points to nothing that would have undermined or altered this understanding of his criminal history or the role of substance abuse. Coleman makes no argument that the list of convictions and other arrests in the PSR contained conduct for which Coleman was not responsible or otherwise misdescribed the pertinent facts. To the extent Coleman contends that there were disputed fact issues as to the underlying offense conduct that he might have cleared up, he does not explain why it would have mattered when the district court unambiguously explained that it was departing upward based on the under-representation of his criminal history. In short, Coleman points to nothing that arguably would have impacted the district court\u2019s thinking. We therefore find no \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d and decline to exercise our discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b418-9\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b418-10\">Coleman next argues that the 42 month upward departure is unreasonable, that the district court abused its discre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>tion. The Guidelines provide that \u201c[i]f reliable information indicates that the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history or the likelihood that the defendant will commit other crimes, an upward departure may be warranted.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We review the decision to depart, and the extent of the departure, for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> \u201cAn upward departure by a district court is not an abuse of discretion if the court\u2019s reasons for departing 1) \u2018advance the objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)\u2019 and 2) \u2018are justified by the facts of the ease.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">The nub of Coleman\u2019s claim is that his criminal history does not justify the departure. However, as the district court explained, Coleman had some eleven other convictions, a mixture of felony and misdemeanors, that were not reflected in his criminal history score. The district court was particularly concerned with the continuous nature of Coleman\u2019s criminal acts, that is, he has consistently broken the law for more than twenty-five years; the court\u2019s concern with Coleman\u2019s recidivism is justified, as is a conclusion that his recidivism was not adequately accounted for. Moreover, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s concern that Coleman received \u201cunearned leniency\u201d from the prior sentencing courts was unmerited.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We do not think the district court abused its discretion in determining that an upward departure was warranted, nor was the extent of the departure unreasonable. We have previously affirmed departures for similar reasoning and where the departure was of a similar or greater magnitude.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">Coleman also argues that the district court improperly relied on five prior arrests of his that did not lead to convictions to justify the upward departure. As Coleman explains, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(3) provides that \u201c[a] prior arrest record itself shall not be considered for purposes of an upward departure under this policy statement.\u201d We need not delve into this purported error deeply, for we think it is clear that the court would not have imposed a different sentence but for the alleged error.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> To the extent Coleman argues that the district court \u201cdouble counted\u201d his conviction for burglary of an inhabited dwelling \u2014 that is, relied on it to depart upwardly even though it was factored into his criminal history score \u2014 we do not read the district court as counting it twice. Rather, we understand the court as making the point that it thought that some of Coleman\u2019s crimes involved what it considered violent conduct. Coleman also complains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>about the district court\u2019s recitation of the facts of the underlying offense in its written reasons; however, Coleman has shown no reversible error in that discussion, especially given that the district court upwardly departed because of Coleman\u2019s under-represented criminal history.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b415-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
