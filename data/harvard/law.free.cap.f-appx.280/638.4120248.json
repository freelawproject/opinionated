We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-16\">The government contends that, pursuant to <em>United States v. Combs, </em>470 F.3d 1294 (9th Cir.2006), Sanchez-Hernandez is precluded from arguing that the district court imposed a vindictive sentence on remand. We conclude that <em>Combs </em>is not applicable because this case was not remanded pursuant to the limited remand procedure adopted in <em>United States v. Ameline, </em>409 F.3d 1073 (9th Cir.2005) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-17\">Sanchez-Hernandez contends that vindictive sentencing may be presumed in this case because his sentence was increased on remand by more than six years based on the same facts that existed at the time of his initial sentencing. Because the district court\u2019s reasons for the sentence affirmatively appear in the record, no presumption of vindictiveness exists. <em>See United States v. Peyton, </em>353 F.3d 1080, 1085-87 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b665-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
