Sept. 28, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). \u201cAn abuse of discretion may be found ... where the [BIA\u2019s] decision provides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or conclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir.2001) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In reviewing the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen, this Court has remained mindful of the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that motions to reopen are \u201cdisfavored.\u201d <em>See Maghradze v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 150, 154 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 107, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988)). Here, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Lin\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-10\">Lin\u2019s September 2006 motion to reopen was untimely in light of the fact that it was filed more than eight years after the IJ\u2019s November 1997 decision ordering Lin\u2019s deportation. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (an alien may only file one motion to reopen and must do so within 90 days of the final administrative decision). The BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that Lin failed to establish material \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality\u201d sufficient to excuse the untimely filing of her motion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(e)(7)(C)(ii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA properly found that the birth of Lin\u2019s children did not excuse the untimely and number barred filing where this Court has explicitly rejected the argument that changed personal circumstances in the United States constitute \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality.\u201d <em>Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005). And, as the BIA observed, it previously evaluated the same or similar country-conditions evidence as that which Lin submitted and it found such evidence to be insufficient to establish a material change in country conditions warranting reopening. <em>See Matter of C-C-, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 899, 900-03 (B.I.A.2006); <em>Matter of S-Y-G-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 247, 258 (B.I.A.2007); <em>see also Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185, 189-90 (B.I.A.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-14\">Although Lin argues that the BIA abused its discretion by not sufficiently considering the evidence she submitted, this Court does not require the agency to \u201cexpressly parse or refute on the record each individual argument or piece of evidence offered,\u201d especially evidence which the agency \u201cis asked to consider time and again.\u201d <em>Wei Guam) Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 275 (2d Cir.2006) (citations omitted). The BIA\u2019s summary analysis was not an abuse of discretion in light of the fact that Lin fails to identify any substan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>tive country-conditions evidence that the BIA overlooked demonstrating that individuals with U.S.-born children are subject to persecution in China. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">We see no support for Lin\u2019s contention that the BIA declined to credit the village notice she submitted because it was merely a photocopy. Rather, the BIA rejected the authenticity of the document because of the IJ\u2019s earlier adverse credibility determination. Lin has waived any challenge to the BIA\u2019s reliance on the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
