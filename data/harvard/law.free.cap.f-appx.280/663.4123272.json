We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">To the extent that MacCool\u2019s claims arise out of either his validation as a member of the Aryan Brotherhood on October 10, 1997, or his transfer to New Jersey on April 5, 1999, they are barred by the two-year statute of limitations applicable in Arizona. A.R.S. \u00a7 12-542(1). His theory of a continuing violation does not save these claims, as both were discrete acts that occurred outside the timely filing period. <em>See Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 114, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002); <em>Carpinteria Valley Farms, Ltd. v. County of Santa Barbara, </em>344 F.3d 822, 828 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-5\">In any event, the conditions of confinement about which MacCool complains are not atypical, nor does he have a protected interest in avoiding interstate transfer. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 483 n. 5, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995); <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, </em>461 U.S. 238, 248-49, 103 S.Ct. 1741, 75 L.Ed.2d 813 (1983). That incarceration in New Jersey may, as a practical matter, prevent his family from visiting does not offend either due process or the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Overton v. Bazzetta, </em>539 U.S. 126, 135-37, 123 S.Ct. 2162, 156 L.Ed.2d 162 (2003). MacCool has visitation rights as well as alternative means of communication. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 123 S.Ct. 2162. Finally, there is no basis in the record for concluding that ADC officials put MacCool in harm\u2019s way such that the principles of <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 832, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994), would be offended.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b690-8\">As no exceptional circumstances are shown, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying MacCool\u2019s request for counsel. <em>Wilborn v. Escalderon, </em>789 F.2d 1328, 1331 (9th Cir.1986). Likewise, the court had discretion to decline oral argument. <em>Jasinski v. Showboat Operating Co., </em>644 F.2d 1277, 1281 n. 4 (9th Cir.1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b689-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-6\">. MacCool\u2019s retaliation claim is barred because his ineligibility for a compassionate transfer back to Arizona is the result of his validation. <em>See </em>Ariz. Dep\u2019t of Corr. Order 1004.04, para. 1.2.2 (June 21, 2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
