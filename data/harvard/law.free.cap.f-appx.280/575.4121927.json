Stewart was convicted of the murder of his mother, her husband, and their roommate. Petitioner claims in his appeal that (1) his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance by not presenting purportedly exculpatory out-of-court statements of a third party, Maurice Solvang; and (2) that his trial counsel labored under an impermissible conflict of interest because of his office\u2019s representation of Solvang and of a trial witness, Terry Guillory.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">In reviewing the claim of ineffective assistance, this court \u201cstrongly presume[s] that counsel\u2019s conduct was within the wide range of reasonable assistance, and that he exercised acceptable professional judgment in all significant decisions made.\u201d <em>Hughes v. Borg, </em>898 F.2d 695, 702 (9th Cir.1990). In this case, there are several legitimate tactical reasons which could have been the basis for trial counsel\u2019s decision, including the fact that the statements conflicted with central elements of the defense theory of the case. There was no evidentiary hearing as to the actual reason for the decision and nothing in the record shows that Petitioner requested one. Based on the presumption that counsel exercised acceptable professional judgment and the lack of any evidence to the contrary, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on Petitioner\u2019s first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-14\">Regarding the claim of a conflict of interest, Petitioner must show \u201cthat his counsel actively represented conflicting interests.\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 349-350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980). In this case, Petitioner claims a conflict because his counsel was the named Public Defender for the county and thus the counsel of record for all clients of the Public Defender\u2019s office, including Solvang and Guillory.<footnotemark>***</footnotemark> Because there is no evidence that Petitioner\u2019s counsel ever actively represented Solvang or Guillory, the claim requires this court to apply the ethical rule of \u201cimputed conflict\u201d to the Sixth Amendment context. In the context of habeas review under AEDPA, this court has stated that \u201cthe imputed disqualification rule is not clearly established federal law for the purposes of \u00a7 2254(d)(1).\u201d <em>Lambert v. Blodgett, </em>393 F.3d 943, 986 (9th Cir.2004). The state court denied relief on Petitioner\u2019s \u201cimputed conflict\u201d claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of habeas relief on this claim, based on its determination that the state court\u2019s decision was not contrary to, nor an unrea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>sonable application of, clearly established federal law.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b602-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b602-15\"> Apparently the Public Defender\u2019s office had represented Solvang at least 17 years prior to the petitioner\u2019s trial. As to the witness Guillory, the Public Defender's office withdrew from that representation as soon as the conflict was discovered.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
