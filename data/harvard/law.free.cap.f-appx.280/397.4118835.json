In sentencing Taylor, the district court applied a substantial downward variance from the sentence recommended by the presentence report. Under the United States Sentencing Guidelines (\u201cSentencing Guidelines\u201d), Taylor could have received a sentence of 120 months of imprisonment. The district court, however, sentenced Taylor to sixty months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. The government appealed. After reviewing the sentence for plain error, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">On July 11, 2006, Taylor was arrested for trading child pornography. Responding to an internet advertisement to trade child pornography placed by an undercover government official, Taylor sent the official DVDs containing thousands of sexually explicit images along with countless pornographic movies, most of which involved children. A month later, government agents executed a controlled' mail delivery of videos containing child pornography to Taylor\u2019s residence. After Taylor\u2019s wife accepted the package, the agents exercised a search warrant and seized Taylor\u2019s computer. The computer contained a plethora of child pornographic materials, including hundreds of movies and thousands of images. The computer also showed that Taylor frequented numerous web sites containing child pornography. During, questioning, Taylor confessed to possessing and trading child pornography. Taylor also admitted that he had taken sexually explicit photographs of his brother\u2019s sixteen-year-old girlfriend and that he had cajoled his twelve-year-old sister into letting him take pictures of her breasts for money.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-15\">On December 13, 2006, Taylor was indicted on six counts. The first count charged Taylor with producing sexually explicit images of a minor in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) and (d). The second and third counts alleged that Taylor had distributed pornographic materials involving minors in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(2) and (b)(1). Finally, the fourth, fifth, and sixth counts charged Taylor with possessing child pornographic materials in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b424-16\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, Taylor pleaded guilty to Count Four of the indictment and agreed to the application of various adjustments under the Sentencing Guidelines. In accordance with the plea, Taylor admitted to possessing materials involving a prepubescent minor and distributing the materials with the expectation of receiving a thing of value in return. Moreover, Taylor acknowledged that his offense involved materials that were sadistic or masochistic in' nature, the use of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>computer, and 600 or more images. Given these admissions, the presentence report found that the proper sentencing range under the Sentencing Guidelines was 235-293 months. Because the statutory maximum for a violation of \u00a7 2252(a)(4)(B) and (b)(2) is 120 months, the presentence report recommended a 120-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On June 21, 2007, the district court sentenced Taylor to sixty months of imprisonment followed by three years of supervised release. In explaining its decision, the district court took note of Taylor\u2019s admissions and the seriousness of his offense but found the following factors justified the downward variance from the recommended sentence: (1) the absence of a prior criminal record, (2) Taylor\u2019s youth and \u201cimpressive employment history,\u201d (3) the supportive testimonies of Taylor\u2019s wife, mother, and step-father, and (4) the needs of Taylor\u2019s newborn son. After handing down the sentence, the district court asked, \u201c[I]s there anything else from the government?\u201d The government replied, \u201cNo.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Ordinarily, we review sentences for \u201creasonableness\u201d by applying an abuse-of-discretion standard of review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). Because the government did not object to the downward variance, however, Taylor argues that we should review his sentence for plain error. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-10\">\u201cOne of the most familiar procedural rubrics in the administration of justice is the rule that the failure of a litigant to assert a right in the trial court likely will result in its forfeiture.\u201d <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc), <em>abrogated in part on other grounds by Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 468, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). Therefore, for example, if the defendant failed to object to his sentence at the district court, we review an upward variance from the Sentencing Guidelines for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-13\">The government acknowledges that it did not explicitly object to Taylor\u2019s sentence. It asserts, however, that it properly preserved the error because, before the district court sentenced Taylor, it had argued for the district court to follow the presentence report. But in <em>Peltier, </em>the defendant had also argued his case to the district court before sentencing, and we nonetheless found that the defendant had failed to object. <em>See id. </em>at 390-92. This makes sense because only an explicit objection gives the district court the invaluable opportunity to correct errors before they are appealed, which we have found to serve a \u201ccritical function\u201d by \u201cencourag[ing] informed decisionmaking.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 392. The government does not contend\u2014 nor do we find appropriate \u2014 that the law applies differently when the derelict litigant is the government instead of the criminal defendant.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-14\">In sum, we conclude that, because the government did not properly object to Taylor\u2019s sentence, we must apply the plain-error standard of review in this case. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e may correct the sentencing determination only if (1) there is error (and in light of <em>Booker, </em>an \u2018unreasonable\u2019 sentence equates to a finding of error); (2) it is plain; and (3) it affects <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>substantial rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Moreover, we cannot correct a \u201cforfeited error\u201d unless the error \u201cseriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">The sentencing decision of the district court must be both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cA district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 596. Because it cannot assume that the Sentencing Guidelines range is per se reasonable, the district court must also make an \u201cindividualized assessment\u201d by considering the factors reflected in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553 and the facts presented. <em>See id. </em>\u201cA sentence is unreasonable if it (1) does not account for a factor that should have received significant weight, (2) gives significant weight to an irrelevant or improper factor, or (3) represents a clear error of judgment in balancing the sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Peltier, </em>505 F.3d at 392 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">The government first argues that the district court erred because it failed to consider the Sentencing Guidelines when it sentenced Taylor. This argument lacks merit. In this case, the district court correctly calculated the Sentencing Guidelines range, which was 235-293 months. But because of the statutory maximum, the most that the district court could have sentenced Taylor to under the Sentencing Guidelines was 120 months. Therefore, in deciding to impose a sixty-month, non-Guideline sentence, the district court properly considered whether this was reasonable in light of the 120-month sentence Taylor could have received under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Grossman, </em>513 F.3d 592, 595 (6th Cir.2008) (reviewing a district court\u2019s downward variance for reasonableness in light of the recommended guidelines sentence after accounting for the statutory maximum).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-14\">The government also contends that the district court erred because it failed to consider the factors provided under \u00a7 3553(a)(2) and \u00a7 3553(a)(5). Under \u00a7 3553(a)(2), sentencing courts must consider the need for the sentence imposed.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 3553(a)(5), sentencing courts must consider policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In this case, the government contends that the district court failed to consider the policy statement found in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0(b), which cautions courts against departing from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>Sentencing Guidelines in cases involving \u201c[cjhild crimes and [s]exual offenses,\u201d except in limited circumstances.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">The problem with the government\u2019s argument is that it is pure speculation. The government assumes that the district court did not consider the factors listed under \u00a7 3558(a)(2) and 3553(a)(5) because the district court did not explicitly address them in its analysis. But we have previously found that \u201ca checklist recitation of the section 3553(a) factors is neither necessary nor sufficient for a sentence to be reasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). In this case, the district court gave a long, meticulous explanation for departing from the Sentencing Guidelines. From the district court\u2019s detailed discussion of the facts specific to this case, we find it is clear that the district court considered all the concerns embodied in \u00a7 3553 and simply determined that the variance was nonetheless appropriate. Because we conclude that the district court considered all the \u00a7 3553 factors, the district court did not err.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Finally, the government asserts that Taylor\u2019s sentence was unreasonable because the district court improperly weighed the factors provided under \u00a7 3553(a)(1).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The gravamen of the government\u2019s argument is that Taylor\u2019s crime is too despicable and his \u201cmitigating\u201d circumstances too unexceptional to warrant the variance imposed. But \u201c[w]e may not require district courts to find \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances before they impose sentences outside of the guidelines range.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 811 (5th Cir.2008). In this case, the district court explicitly took note of the \u201cinsidious\u201d nature of Taylor\u2019s crime and the \u201cirreparable harm\u201d he caused, but it nonetheless decided that a sixty-month sentence was appropriate because: (1) Taylor did not have a prior criminal record; (2) Taylor was young and had an \u201cimpressive employment history\u201d; (3) Taylor\u2019s wife, mother, and step-father wholeheartedly supported him; and (4) Taylor had a newborn son. We \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate,\u201d but this \u201cis insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Our review in this case is also limited to plain error. There<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fore, while the extent of the variance in this case was admittedly substantial, we cannot find that the district court so plainly erred as to warrant reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">For the reasons above, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.

Castillo, </em>430 F.3d 230 (5th Cir.2005), does not support its argument. In <em>Castillo, </em>the \u201cunique set of circumstances\u201d of that case deprived the government of any opportunity to object after the district court sentenced the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 234 \u2014 35, 240. In this case, the district court gave the government an opportunity to address the court after it sentenced Taylor, which the government inexplicably declined.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b426-7\">.
