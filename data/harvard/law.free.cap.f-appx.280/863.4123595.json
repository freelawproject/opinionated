Macias-Ortiz argues on appeal that his low-end Guidelines sen-fence is substantively unreasonable. After thorough review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-13\">Generally, we review a sentence a district court imposes for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which \u201cmerely asks whether the trial court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reviewing sentences for reasonableness, we perform two steps. <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1190. First, we must \u201c \u2018ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> If we conclude that the district court did not proeedurally err, we must consider the \u201c \u2018substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed, under an abuse-of-discretion standard,\u2019 \u201d based on the \u201c \u2018totality of the circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597). \u201cThe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both th[e] record and the factors in section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1351 (11th Cir.2006) (internal quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">Macias-Ortiz has not demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> As an initial matter, the district court applied a two-level minor-role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b) based upon its finding that Macias-Ortiz was less culpable than the other co-defendants. Thus, Macias-Ortiz\u2019s contention that the court failed to properly take into account his role in the offense is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-6\">Moreover, the district court said that it had considered the Section 3553(a) factors, and the record reflects that the court was aware of, and applied, those factors. Specifically, the district court considered Macias-Ortiz\u2019s history and characteristics and the nature and circumstances of the offense, noting that: (1) Macias-Ortiz\u2019s participation in the drug transaction was minimal; (2) Macias-Ortiz did not use violence or threats of violence during the drug transaction; (3) Macias-Ortiz had not been truthful regarding his awareness of whether his codefendant was armed during the drug transaction; and (4) Macias-Ortiz had two small children and health issues, and had expressed remorse. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). The court also recognized the advisory Guidelines range. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-7\">Indeed, \u201cthe district court need only acknowledge that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and need not discuss each of these factors in either the sentencing hearing or in the sentencing order.\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 671, 169 L.Ed.2d 526 (2007) (internal quotation and punctuation omitted); <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cnothing in <em>Booker </em>or elsewhere requires the district court to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors or to discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u201d). This is especially true here, where Macias-Ortiz failed to contest a Guidelines-range sentence based upon the \u00a7 3553(a) factors he discusses in his brief, and where Macias-Ortiz\u2019s 63-month sentence was at the low end of the Guidelines range, and well below the 40-year statutory maximum. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(ii); <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1246 (11th Cir.2005) (comparing, as one indication of reasonableness, the actual prison term imposed against the statutory maximum).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">Accordingly, Macias-Ortiz has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable, nor that the district court committed any error, much less plain error, in imposing it. We therefore affirm his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b890-10\">. Though the Government claims plain error review is appropriate where, as here, a defendant raises a reasonableness argument for the first time on appeal, we need not decide whether plain error review is proper, as we reach the same outcome under either standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b890-11\">. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) the pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b891-8\">. In his brief, Macias-Ortiz concedes that the district court correctly calculated his Guidelines range, and thus, does not challenge the procedural reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b891-9\">. <em>See also Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2462 (holding that a court of appeals may afford a presumption of reasonableness to a within-Guidelines sentence); <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1314 n. 8 (11th Cir.2007) (noting that, although we have not normally afforded a within-Guidelines sentence a presumption of reasonableness, the <em>Rita </em>decision calls that policy into question).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
