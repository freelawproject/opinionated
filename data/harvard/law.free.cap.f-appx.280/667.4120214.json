We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>see Prison Legal News v. Lehman, </em>397 F.3d 692, 698 (9th. Cir.2005), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-8\">Reformation of the deed of trust is appropriate here.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> First, the deed of trust may be reformed after the foreclosure sale. <em>See Rogers v. Miller, </em>13 Wash. 82, 42 P. 525, 525-26 (1895) (permitting reformation after a foreclosure sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">Second, the undisputed facts clearly and convincingly show that, at the time the deed of trust was signed, Hallas and Ameriquest shared an identical intent \u2014 namely, for Ameriquest to take a security interest in Hallas\u2019 property and to reflect that interest in the loan documents. <em>See Saterlie v. Lineberry, </em>92 Wash.App. 624, 962 P.2d 863, 865 (1998); <em>Snyder v. Peterson, </em>62 Wash.App. 522, 814 P.2d 1204, 1206-08 (1991); <em>Tenco, Inc. v. Manning, </em>59 Wash.2d 479, 368 P.2d 372, 373-74 (1962); <em>Maxwell v. Maxwell, </em>12 Wash.2d 589, 123 P.2d 335, 337 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-14\">Third, Hallas\u2019 equitable defenses to reformation fail. Insertion of the correct property description into the deed of trust after it was signed does not, under these circumstances, demonstrate the bad faith or unconscionable conduct necessary to support an unclean-hands defense. <em>See Dahlin v. Dahlin, </em>30 Wash.2d 642, 193 P.2d 358, 360 (1948); <em>J.L. Cooper &amp; Co. v. Anchor Secs. Co., </em>9 Wash.2d 45, 113 P.2d 845, 857-58 (1941). And Hallas\u2019 assertion that Ameriquest is equitably estopped from seeking reformation is contrary to Washington law. <em>See Rogers, </em>42 P. at 525-26 (permitting reformation after a foreclosure sale).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-15\">Hallas waived her right to pursue her remaining claims, with the exception of her Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (\u201cFDCPA\u201d) claims, by failing to sue before the foreclosure sale took place. <em>See </em>Wash. Rev.Code \u00a7\u00a7 61.24.130, 61.24.040(l)(f)(IX); <em>see also Koegel v. Prudential Mut. Savs., </em>51 Wash.App. 108, 752 P.2d 385, 386, 389 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-16\">Hallas\u2019 claim that Fidelity\u2019s and Town <em>&amp; </em>Country\u2019s conduct violated 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(6) because Ameriquest did not have a security interest in her property fails because, with reformation of the deed of trust, the existence of a security interest is unarguable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hallas has abandoned her remaining FDCPA claims by failing to specifically and distinctly argue the claims in her opening brief. <em>See Int\u2019l Union of Bricklayers v. Martin Jaska, Inc., </em>752 F.2d 1401, 1404 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b694-17\">The magistrate judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Hallas\u2019 motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>amend her complaint because the proposed amendment would have been futile. <em>See Miller v. Rykoff-Sexton, Inc., </em>845 F.2d 209, 214 (9th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">We have considered and reject Hallas\u2019 other claims raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b694-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b694-11\">. The parties consented to the entry of a final judgment by the assigned magistrate judge. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 73; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b694-12\">. For purposes of this appeal, we assume (as did the magistrate judge) the truth of Hallas' contention that when she signed the deed of trust, it did not contain any legal description of the property.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b694-19\">. We assume, without deciding, that Fidelity and Town &amp; Country were \u201cdebt collectors\u201d for purposes of 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692f(6).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
