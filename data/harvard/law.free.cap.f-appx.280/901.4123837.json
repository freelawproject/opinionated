The terms of the agreement were that Duncan would plead guilty to one count of the indictment against him, cooperate fully with the government, and waive some of his rights to directly appeal or collaterally attack his sentence. In exchange, the government agreed to dismiss the remaining counts in the indictment and make certain recommendations at his sentence hearing. Additionally, the government agreed that, if Duncan\u2019s cooperation was complete at the time of sentencing and constituted \u201csubstantial assistance,\u201d the government would move for a downward departure under United States Sentencing Guidelines \u00a7 5K1.1. If Duncan\u2019s cooperation was not complete until after sentencing and was \u201csubstantial assistance,\u201d then the government agreed to \u201cconsider whether to file a [Rule 35(b) ] motion for reduction of sentence.\u201d The plea agreement specified that \u201cthe determination as to whether [Duncan] ha[d] provided \u2018substantial assistance\u2019 rest[ed] solely with the government.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b928-17\">The district court accepted Duncan\u2019s guilty plea and adopted the plea agreement. At sentencing, the government made the recommendations listed in the plea agreement and moved for a \u00a7 5K1.1 substantial assistance departure, which the court granted. The court then sentenced Duncan to 135 months imprisonment and ten years of supervised release. Duncan did not appeal that sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-18\">On September 6, 2007, Duncan, proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, asking the court to order the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>government to make a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf. He argued that the plea agreement with the government required it to file a Rule 35(b) motion because he had continued cooperating after being sentenced. He also requested, if necessary, an evidentiary hearing on whether his continued cooperation was substantial assistance. The district court denied his petition, and Duncan appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-6\">Duncan first contends that the district court erred in denying his petition for a writ of mandamus because the government violated an enforceable plea agreement by failing to make a Rule 35(b) motion on his behalf.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cMandamus is proper if (1) the Plaintiffs can show a clear right to the relief sought; (2) the Defendants have a clear, non-diseretionary duty to act; and (3) no other remedy is available.\u201d <em>Nyaga v. Ashcroft, </em>323 F.3d 906, 911 (11th Cir.2003). Because Duncan cannot show that the government has \u201ca clear, non-discretionary duty to act,\u201d he is not entitled to a writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The plea agreement between Duncan and the government stated that, if the government determined that Duncan had provided substantial assistance, it would make either a U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 motion or a Rule 35(b) motion, depending on when Duncan\u2019s cooperation was complete. The government considered Duncan\u2019s cooperation to be complete at sentencing and accordingly made a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion at Duncan\u2019s sentence hearing. This is all that the plea agreement required, and the government complied with it. Further, even if Duncan gave substantial assistance after sentencing, the governmnet\u2019s only obligation was to \u201cconsider whether to file\u201d a Rule 35(b) motion. The plea agreement did not impose a \u201cclear, non-discretionary duty\u201d on the government to make a Rule 35(b) motion after it had already made a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on Duncan\u2019s behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-10\">There are some times when it is appropriate for a court to review the government\u2019s decision not to make a Rule 35(b) motion even absent a plea agreement, but those are limited to \u201cwhen there is an allegation and a substantial showing that the prosecution refused to file a substantial assistance motion because of a constitutionally impermissible motivation.\u201d <em>United States v. Forney, </em>9 F.3d 1492, 1502 (11th Cir.1993). Duncan has not even alleged that the government had an unconstitutional motivation, so that exception is inapplicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b929-11\">Duncan also contends that the district court should have at least held an evidentiary hearing to determine if the assistance he gave the government after he was sentenced was \u201csubstantial.\u201d The \u201cdecision to grant an evidentiary hearing [is] generally left to the sound discretion of district courts.\u201d <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 1939, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007). We review that decision only to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number><em>v. Mena, </em>863 F.2d 1522, 1528 (11th Cir.1989). The absence of a clear, non-discretionary duty on the government to make a Rule 35(b) motion on Duncan\u2019s behalf prevents him from obtaining a writ of mandamus, which means that proof of his substantial assistance could not have changed the outcome of his petition. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied him an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">AFFIRMED. \u25a0</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b929-8\">. The government contends that Duncan\u2019s complaint should be considered a motion to vacate, correct, or amend a sentence under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, not a petition for a writ of mandamus. However, \"[t]he plaintiff is the master of the complaint,\u201d and Duncan clearly specified that he was seeking a writ of mandamus. <em>United States v. Jones, </em>125 F.3d 1418, 1428 (11th Cir.1997). While we can \u201csometimes ignore the legal label that a <em>pro se </em>litigant attaches to a motion ... to create a better correspondence between the substance of a <em>pro se </em>motion\u2019s claim and its underlying legal basis,\u201d <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 381-82, 124 S.Ct. 786, 791-92, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003), a writ of mandamus is an established way of enforcing a plea agreement, <em>see, e.g., In re Arnett, </em>804 F.2d 1200 (11th Cir.1986). Therefore, we will treat Duncan\u2019s petition for a writ of mandamus as exactly that.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
