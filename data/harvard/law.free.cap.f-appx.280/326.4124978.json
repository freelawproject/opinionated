Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-19\">The REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub.L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231, amended 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252 to provide that \u201c[njotwithstanding any other provision of law ..., including section 2241 of title 28, ... a petition for review filed with an appropriate court of appeals ... shall be the sole and exclusive means for judicial review of an order of removal entered or issued under any provision of this Act.\u201d 8 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1252(a)(5) (West 2005); <em>see Fernandez v. Keisler, </em>502 F.3d 337, 346 (4th Cir.2007) (finding that REAL ID Act \u201cexpressly eliminated district courts\u2019 habeas jurisdiction over removal orders\u201d); <em>Jahed v. Acri, </em>468 F.3d 230, 233 (4th Cir.2006) (\u201cThe REAL ID Act eliminated access to habeas corpus for purposes of challenging a removal order.\u201d). Accordingly, we find that the district court properly dismissed Campblin\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-20\">In her brief on appeal, Campblin does not dispute the fact that the district court lacked jurisdiction, but instead argues that the district court should have transferred her habeas petition to this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 (2000) for consideration as a petition for review. Because it appears that Campblin\u2019s underlying claim-an equal protection challenge to \u00a7 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act\u2014 lacks merit, we find that a transfer would not have been in the interest of justice and that no abuse of discretion occurred. <em>See Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 506 (5th Cir.2006) (collecting cases rejecting equal protection challenge to \u00a7 212(h)); <em>see also Jones v. Braxton, </em>392 F.3d 683, 691 (4th Cir.2004) (\u201cCongress has explicitly granted the district courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>discretion over transfers under section 1631.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AYW\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"Asa\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
