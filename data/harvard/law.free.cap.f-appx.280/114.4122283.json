Nelson, denying his applications for asylum, withholding of removal and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Quan Cai Lin, </em>No. A96 336 032 (B.I.A. Apr. 26, 2007) <em>affg </em>No. A96 336 032 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 10, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-24\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). However, when the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). In this case, the BIA adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, finding that, although Lin\u2019s excuse for why he did not present a letter from his mother was legitimate, the adverse credibility determination was not clearly erroneous. Thus, we re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>view the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen, </em>417 F.3d at 271; <em>Xue Hong Yang, </em>426 F.3d at 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004) <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">As an initial matter, we disagree with the government\u2019s arguments that Lin has waived any challenge to the denial of his CAT claim. Although intermingled with his argument regarding his eligibility for withholding of removal, Lin does indicate in his brief that he is challenging the agency\u2019s finding that he is not likely to face torture in China. Nevertheless, as to the CAT claim and the asylum and withholding claims, we find the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination to be supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">The IJ reasonably found it inconsistent that Lin testified at one point that he learned his father was sent to a labor camp when he was in hiding at his uncle\u2019s home, but at another point that he learned about his father\u2019s fate only when he arrived in the United States. This is a material inconsistency because Lin\u2019s subjective fear of returning is based on what happened to his father after he was arrested for his Falun Gong practice. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74-75. Additionally, the IJ reasonably found inconsistent Lin\u2019s testimony that his mother told him to go into hiding because the police were looking for him, but the police had not yet gone to his and his parents\u2019 house when his mother allegedly made that statement. This discrepancy is also relevant to Lin\u2019s fear of future persecution in China because it calls into question whether police are indeed searching for Lin. <em>See Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 309. Moreover, the agency reasonably relied on the IJ\u2019s demeanor finding in making its adverse credibility determination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We accord particular deference to such findings, especially, where, as here, the IJ noted multiple times that Lin was evasive, unresponsive, or hesitant in answering questions.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-11\">Because we find that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, we do not reach her alternative finding that, even assuming credibility, Lin failed to meet his burden of proof. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 338 (2d Cir.2006)</p>\n<p id=\"b142-12\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\">. We note that, as the government argues, Lin did not challenge the IJ's demeanor finding. Nonetheless, because that finding is amply supported by the record, we find that it provided further support for the IJ\u2019s credibility determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
