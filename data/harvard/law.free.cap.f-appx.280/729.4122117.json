KELLY, JR., Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant Kameisha Hamilton appeals from the grant of summary judgment in favor of her former employer and certain employees, Defendanh-Appellees Boise Cascade Express (\u201cBoise\u201d), Samantha Mohr (site manager), Robert Harper (district sales manager), and Laurie Johnson (human resources manager), on her race discrimination claims under Title VII and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b756-10\">Plaintiff began her employment with Boise on March 24, 2003. Beginning in late April or early May, Plaintiff had a number of appointments with her physical therapist and physician that required her to miss some of her 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. shift. Although the exact times of the appointments are not found in the record, Plaintiff admitted that she was never at an appointment before 8:00 a.m. or after 5:00 p.m. Aplt.App. at 1365. The offices of her physical therapist and physician are located 40 minutes and one hour from her workplace, respectively. <em>See id. </em>at 1365-66. Plaintiff admitted that, for example, to arrive at a 4:00 p.m. physical therapy appointment, she would have to leave at 3:20 p.m. at the latest to arrive on time. <em>See id. </em>at 1365. Plaintiff attended a number of appointments on days when she was scheduled to work.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-14\">Another associate complained to a supervisor that Plaintiff was not working the whole day, which the supervisor confirmed. <em>See id. </em>at 245. Subsequently, the human resources manager, Laurie Johnson, reviewed Plaintiffs time sheets, phone records, and key fob records (records of when an employee\u2019s badge was swiped to enter the building), and concluded that Plaintiff had inaccurately reported her time on the following dates: May 1, May 22, May 30, June 2, June 11, June 12, June 16, and June 20, 2003. <em>See id. </em>at 251-55. On June 23, 2003, Robert Harper, a sales manager but not a supervisor over Plaintiff, invited Plaintiff to a meeting in Ms. Johnson\u2019s office where Ms. Johnson told Plaintiff the purpose of the meeting was to discuss her excessive absenteeism and time card fraud. Ms. Johnson showed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>Plaintiff her phone records and time sheets saying that she committed time card fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 1353. At the end of the meeting, Ms. Johnson told Plaintiff her employment was being terminated because she committed time card fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 1354.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Plaintiff filed this lawsuit alleging in her complaint that she was fired because of her race.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants filed a motion for summary judgment which the district court granted. <em>Hamilton v. Boise Cascade Express, </em>No. 04-266, 2006 WL 149023 (W.D.Okla. Jan. 19, 2006). On appeal, Plaintiff argues that fact questions regarding Boise\u2019s belief that Plaintiff engaged in time card fraud should have precluded summary judgment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards as the district court. <em>Timmerman v. U.S. Bank, N.A., </em>483 F.3d 1106, 1112 (10th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate only \u201cif the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). Thus, to survive summary judgment a non-moving party must put forth sufficient evidence \u2014 more than a scintilla \u2014 such that a reasonable jury could find in its favor. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 251, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). We view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Scott v. Harris, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 1774, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b757-13\">Where a plaintiff relies on indirect or circumstantial evidence to show discrimination under Title VII, we examine the claim under the burden-shifting framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-04, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Young v. Dillon Cos., Inc., </em>468 F.3d 1243, 1249 (10th Cir.2006). First, the plaintiff must establish a prima facie case of discrimination. <em>See id. </em>If the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, the burden shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the termination. <em>See id. </em>If the defendant meets its burden, the burden shifts back to the plaintiff to show that the defendant\u2019s \u201cproffered justification is pretextual.\u201d <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b757-14\">\u201cIn appropriate circumstances, the trier of fact can reasonably infer from the falsity of the explanation that the employer is dissembling to cover up a discriminatory purpose.\u201d <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 147, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Although we do not require \u201cpretext plus,\u201d specifically that a plaintiff demonstrate that the reason was false <em>and </em>a motive for discrimination, the falsity combined with other circumstances in the case must permit the inference that unlawful discrimination was a motivating factor in the decision. <em>Miller v. Eby Realty Group LLC, </em>396 F.3d 1105, 1111 (10th Cir.2005). In determining whether the proffered reasons were pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>textual, we consider the facts as they appear to the decisionmakers and consider whether they honestly believed those reasons and acted upon them in good faith. <em>See Young, </em>468 F.3d at 1250.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">Assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that Plaintiff has established a prima facie case, Boise\u2019s proffered non-discriminatory reason is that it terminated Plaintiffs employment because she committed time-card fraud. Plaintiff argues that there is a fact question concerning pretext when the facts are viewed collectively. Plaintiff contends that other employees were not disciplined as she was, that her time-card entries were merely erroneous, not fraudulent, and that a statement by Valetta Wright demonstrates that management did not believe that she engaged in time-card fraud. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-5\">Insofar as evidence of pretext is based upon disparate treatment, Plaintiff points to vague testimony that other employees with different supervisors also had unspecified attendance issues but were treated differently. However, this evidence falls far short of showing that new employees with approximately 90 days of employment under the same supervisor with similarly egregious reporting problems received more favorable treatment. <em>See McGowan v. City of Eufala, </em>472 F.3d 736, 745 (10th Cir.2006). No evidence supports this angle. Moreover, Plaintiff maintained that there were no errors on her time cards and has no explanation for the many inconsistencies. Aplt.App. at 545, 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-6\">Plaintiff also relies on a statement by Valetta Wright, a former plaintiff, which she put forward to the district court for the first time in her Surreply in Opposition to Summary Judgment, to which Boise had no chance to respond before summary judgment was rendered seven days later. Ms. Wright testified at her deposition: \u201cI remember that [Mr. Harper] said to me after they investigated that they don\u2019t believe that [Plaintiff] intentionally was fraudulent on her time card.... And [Ms. Johnson] was right there.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1665. Mr. Harper was not one of the decisionmakers \u2014 the decision was made by Ms. Johnson, Ms. Mohr, and Diane Wiley, the area human resources manager. <em>See id. </em>at 238. Plaintiff does not contest this and testified that he did not speak during the meeting. <em>See id. </em>at 1353. We have doubts whether this statement would be admissible, but even if it were admissible, the outcome is the same. Ms. Wright testified' that Mr. Harper made this statement the day following Plaintiffs termination, but she also testified that the day of Plaintiffs termination Ms. Johnson and Mr. Harper stated that Plaintiff had committed time-card fraud. <em>See id. </em>at 1679-80. Further, the decisionmakers Ms. Mohr and Ms. Johnson testified that they believed that the evidence showed, and Plaintiff admitted, that she recorded substantial time that she did not work, and the record evidence fully corroborates this determination. Boise maintains that Plaintiff missed 64 hours of unscheduled work during her first three months and that her absences should have been reported as unpaid, as Plaintiff lacked any paid time off. Even giving Plaintiff the benefit of every possible doubt, meaning that Boise gave her credit for working through nearly every lunch hour, there were still 10 hours of unaccounted time for which Plaintiff was paid.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Aplt.App. at 1962. Ms. Mohr specifically testified that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b759-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>It wasn\u2019t necessary for her to admit to, quote, fraud. It was necessary for her to admit that she knew the time sheets were wrong. Whether she equates that with fraud or not, frankly, wasn\u2019t relevant____ What I know is that she had admitted to physically not being at work and the information on the time sheets being incorrect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b759-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 1281. The fact that Boise may have more generously characterized Plaintiffs conduct after the fact does not make a case for pretext especially in light of Ms. Mohr\u2019s testimony that the distinction now used was irrelevant and the overwhelming evidence that Boise\u2019s given justification was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-7\">The importance of the distinction between time-card fraud and time-card mistakes, based on Ms. Wright\u2019s testimony and relied on by the dissent, is based on the assertion that Boise would be able to bypass progressive discipline if Plaintiffs conduct was fraudulent but not if it was merely mistaken. However, Plaintiff has pointed to no evidence in the record supporting this assertion, and the record does not bear it out. Boise had a progressive discipline policy that would be triggered, for example, by attendance or performance issues. <em>Id. </em>at 269, 303. However, a violation of a core value of the company, which includes integrity, safety, and quality improvement, <em>id. </em>at 280, is an exception to the progressive discipline policy and may result in immediate termination, <em>id. </em>at 269, 303. Integrity issues include \u201cwhen [employees] are paid for hours worked during which they were not at work.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1961. An employer could reasonably conclude that these material deviations resulting in Plaintiff being paid for time she did not work raise an issue of integrity making progressive discipline unwarranted. The record clearly shows that Boise terminated Plaintiff for integrity issues and not for absenteeism. <em>Id. </em>at 1961-62. Thus, Ms. Mohr testified that it did not matter how Plaintiffs conduct was characterized because no one doubted that the conduct implicated integrity concerns. <em>See id. </em>at 1231. Neither Plaintiff nor the dissent has pointed to any evidence in the record supporting even the slightest inference that Boise characterized Plaintiffs conduct as time-card fraud to deprive her of progressive discipline. Boise\u2019s characterization of Plaintiffs conduct is certainly reasonable, and hardly a \u201cdisturbing procedural irregularity\u201d sufficient to prove pretext. <em>See Riggs v. AirTran Airways, Inc., </em>497 F.3d 1108, 1119 (10th Cir.2007) (quotations omitted). Our role is \u201cnot to act as a \u2018super personnel department,\u2019 second guessing employers\u2019 honestly held (even if erroneous) business judgments.\u201d <em>Dillon, </em>468 F.3d at 1250 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">The dissent argues that the fact that Boise disciplined three African-American women around the same time supports an inference of unlawful discrimination. While evidence of a statistical correlation may create an inference of discrimination, here the evidence is too flawed to raise a jury question because it fails to compare similarly situated individuals or eliminate nondiscriminatory explanations for the disparate treatment. <em>See Furr v. Seagate Tech., Inc., </em>82 F.3d 980, 986-87 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Although this circuit has rejected a \u201cpretext plus\u201d standard, there are cases where it simply would not be permissible to infer discrimination from the evidence the plaintiff has mustered to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason was false. <em>See Reeves, </em>530 U.S. at 148, 120 S.Ct. 2097. We believe that this is one of those cases. Mr. Harper\u2019s opinion (if it were admissible), and Ms. Johnson\u2019s presence when he expressed it, may provide a scintilla of evidence that Boise\u2019s explanation for terminating Plaintiff was false. But we conclude that on this thin basis \u2014 and in the face of overwhelming evidence that Plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>tiff was terminated because of unexplained, inaccurate time-keeping \u2014 no reasonable jury could find in Plaintiffs favor. <em>See Swackhammer v. Sprint/United Mgmt. Co., </em>493 F.3d 1160, 1168 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">Finally, contrary to Plaintiffs suggestion, <em>Plotke v. White, </em>405 F.3d 1092 (10th Cir.2005), is not almost directly on point here. It is true that we are skeptical of \u201csubjective evaluations in making termination decisions,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1106, but Boise relied on documentary evidence to conclude that Plaintiff could not have worked all the time she recorded on her time sheets, even assuming she worked through her lunches, Aplt.App. at 545. In addition, none of the other evidence supporting our conclusion in <em>Plotke </em>is present here. <em>See </em>405 F.3d at 1103-08 (relying on, for example, the proffered reason for termination was generated only after the termination, and the defendant likely fabricated evidence relating to the termination).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-6\">AFFIRMED. Plaintiffs motion to amend the caption to omit Plaintiff Danielle Callaghan as a party due to settlement is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b756-11\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b756-12\">. Defendants argue that the notice of appeal filed on July 14, 2006, is untimely to appeal the district court\u2019s judgment against the Plaintiff entered on January 19, 2006. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A) (notice of appeal must be filed within 30 days after judgment). This contention is meritless given that a joint stipulation of dismissal of the remaining parties and their claims was not entered until June 19, 2006, well after the January 19, 2006 judgment. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Defendants argue that because they modified the caption in their pleadings to delete the settling plaintiffs, and the district court followed entering judgment with a similar caption, the January 19, 2006 judgment was final. We disagree. Nothing suggests that the caption had ever been properly amended, or that a final judgment over all the parties was entered prior to the stipulation of dismissal of the remaining parties. <em>See Beugler v. Burlington N. &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>490 F.3d 1224, 1227 n. 1 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b757-8\">. Originally, the lawsuit involved four other plaintiffs who have all settled their claims with Defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b757-9\">. We note that Plaintiff\u2019s briefs fail to conform to the requirements of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(a)(7) and (e) in the statement of facts and citations to the record. It is inappropriate to reproduce verbatim the voluminous facts from summary judgment pleadings and not pinpoint cite to the appendix. See 10th Cir. R. 28.4; <em>Doeblers\u2019 Pa. Hybrids, Inc. v. Doebler, </em>442 F.3d 812, 820 n. 8 (3d Cir.2006). Despite these deficiencies, we will still address the merits of Plaintiff\u2019s appeal. See <em>MacArthur v. San Juan County, </em>495 F.3d 1157, 1161 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b758-7\">. Ms. Mohr testified that Plaintiff \"was <em>not </em>terminated for filling out her timesheet incorrectly on a daily basis. For example, recording 8 hours when she only worked 7 or really worked 9. Had her total hours worked added up to the right amount at the end of the week, she would not have been disciplined.\u201d Aplt. App. at 1962 (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b760-7\">EBEL, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AvKV\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Plaintiff-Appellant Kameisha Hamilton claims Defendants fired her because of her race. Defendants \u2014 Boise Cascade Express and three of its managerial employees \u2014 assert that they, instead, terminated Hamilton\u2019s employment because they believed, in good faith, that Hamilton had committed time card fraud. The district court granted Defendants summary judgment. The specific question before this court now on appeal, therefore, is whether Hamilton presented evidence calling into doubt Defendants\u2019 good-faith belief that she committed time card fraud sufficient to survive summary judgment. Because I conclude she has, I would reverse summary judgment entered for Defendants.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>The evidence in the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hamilton, as the nonmoving party, <em>see Moore v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>507 F.3d 1257, 1258 (10th Cir.2007), indicates the following: Hamilton was fired during a meeting with Defendants Laurie Johnson, the office human resources manager, and Robert Harper, a mid-level manager. Johnson told Hamilton, during this meeting, that she was fired because Hamilton had committed time card fraud. Nevertheless, the next day Harper stated to Hamilton\u2019s immediate supervisor, in front of Johnson, that \u201c[w]e do agree with you that Kameisha did not purposefully falsify her timecard.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">The majority, like the district court, discounts Harper\u2019s statement because he was not one of the people who made the decision to fire Hamilton. While that appears to be true, it is not dispositive in this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The district court determined that the decision to fire Hamilton was made by three people: 1) the general manager of Boise\u2019s Norman, Oklahoma, office, Defendant Samantha Mohr; 2) Johnson, the human resources manager for that office; and 3) Boise\u2019s regional human resources manager, Diane Wiley. The majority agrees. The evidence supports this conclusion and Defendants have never disputed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-7\">But the evidence in the record, viewed in the light most favorable to Hamilton, <em>see Moore, </em>507 F.3d at 1258, further indicates that Haiper, a mid-level manager, was actively involved in the investigation of Hamilton\u2019s time records. Harper was one of only three district sales managers in Boise\u2019s Norman office. Each of these three managers supervised several \u201cteams\u201d of sales representatives, such as Hamilton; each sales team was, in turn, directly supervised by a team leader who reported to one of the three district sales managers.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-10\">Although Harper was not Hamilton\u2019s second-level supervisor, he had been watching her attendance for several weeks, apparently because Hamilton had missed a number of days of work. On one occasion while Harper was checking to see if Hamilton was at work, another of Hamilton\u2019s team members complained to Harper that Hamilton had been leaving work early. Harper informed Hamilton\u2019s district sales manager, Larry Woods.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-11\">Mohr, Woods and Johnson met over a weekend to review Hamilton\u2019s time records, finding discrepancies. Because Mohr and Woods were scheduled to be out of town on business the following week, Mohr asked Johnson and Harper to meet with both Hamilton and Hamilton\u2019s direct supervisor, Valetta Wright.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-12\">Harper and Johnson first met with Wright. It was Harper who took the lead in talking to Wright, questioning her about Hamilton\u2019s time records and informing her that \u201cwe\u201d had been investigating the matter for a week or two.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>Harper and Johnson next met with Hamilton. Although Harper escorted Hamilton to Johnson\u2019s office and stayed during their meeting, he did not speak. During this meeting, Johnson fired Hamilton. Later that day, Hamilton telephoned her direct supervisor, Wright, to apologize, telling Wright that she had not done anything intentionally.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">That afternoon, Harper and Johnson again met with Wright. Wright told Harper and Johnson about the call she had received from Hamilton. At the conclusion of that meeting, Harper and Johnson suspended Wright with pay and sent her home while they investigated further. Johnson and Harper then \u201ccontinued to look through all the documents we had as well as other time sheets on Ms. [Wright\u2019s] team to verify, to research, to ensure no other time card fraud was taking place.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AJp\">The next day, Harper and Johnson called Wright back into work to meet with them again. It was Harper who opened the meeting by informing Wright that \u201c[w]e do agree with you that Kameisha didn\u2019t purposely falsify her timecard.\u201d Wright understood Harper\u2019s reference to \u201cwe\u201d to mean Harper and Johnson, who was also present at this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">This evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to Hamilton, indicates that Harper was actively involved in investigating Hamilton\u2019s time records, both before and after her termination, and was in a position to observe Boise\u2019s decisionmakers and to know on what evidence they relied to fire her. In light of that, Harper\u2019s assertion, made in front of one of the decision-makers, that \u201c[w]e agree with you that Kameisha didn\u2019t purposely falsify her timecard,\u201d calls into doubt Defendants\u2019 good-faith belief that Hamilton committed time card fraud. This lingering doubt enables Hamilton to survive summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-8\">The majority further discounts Harper\u2019s statement to Wright by blurring the distinction between time card fraud and time card mistakes. It has been Boise\u2019s theory throughout this litigation that it fired Hamilton for time card fraud, rather than for simply making mistakes in reporting her time. Boise\u2019s managerial employees have consistently stated that Hamilton was fired for fraud. And Hamilton, too, reported that Defendants cited fraud as the reason they terminated her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-9\">Boise has characterized Hamilton\u2019s conduct as fraudulent, rather than mistaken, because under the terms of its personnel manual, Boise could fire Hamilton immediately for fraud, as it did, but would have had to invoke progressive disciplinary measures instead if she had only made mistakes in reporting her time.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This appears true even though Hamilton was still a probationary employee at the time she was fired.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-10\">Moreover, there is evidence in the record from which a jury could conclude that Hamilton had only made mistakes in reporting her time, and had not committed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>fraud. Many Boise employees who were trained at the same time Hamilton received her \u201cnew-hire\u201d training were confused about how to complete them time sheets. During training, new hires were told that if they had to leave work an hour early one day to attend, say, a medical appointment, the employee could make up that time by working through lunch another day during that same week. The employee had to get her supervisor\u2019s approval before doing so, however. The human resources office instructed employees that if they made up missed time in this manner, the employee should simply record'on her time sheets that she worked eight hours on each of these days, even though the employee had actually worked, for example, seven hours one day and nine hours another. In Hamilton\u2019s case, both Wright and another sales representative testified in their depositions that Hamilton had been working through her lunch hours to make up time she had missed, although this would not have been sufficient to make up all the missed time because the make-up time had to occur during the same week that the hours were lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Finally, the majority concludes that, even if there is evidence suggesting that Defendants\u2019 proffered reason for terminating Hamilton \u2014 their good-faith belief that Hamilton committed time card fraud \u2014 is false, \u201cthis is one of those cases\u201d \u201cwhere it simply would not be permissible to infer <em>discrimination </em>from the evidence [Hamilton] has mustered to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reason\u201d for terminating Hamilton \u201cwas false.\u201d The majority explains that, despite the fact that Harper\u2019s statement to Wright, made in front of Johnson, \u201cmay provide a scintilla of evidence that Boise\u2019s explanation for terminating [Hamilton] was false[,] ... on this thin basis \u2014 and in the face of overwhelming evidence that [Hamilton] was terminated because of unexplained, inaccurate time-keeping \u2014 no reasonable jury could find in [her] favor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b763-7\">In addition to evidence creating a disputed issue of fact as to whether Defendants\u2019 proffered reason for terminating Hamilton was false, however, the record contains other evidence that supports Hamilton\u2019s allegation that Defendants were acting with a racially discriminatory animus when they fired her. Johnson met with three employees on June 23, 2003, the day she fired Hamilton. By the end of that day, Johnson had fired one employee (Hamilton) and suspended the other two before eventually disciplining them. All three of these employees are African-American women. The adverse employment actions taken against these three women, on a single day, caused several other sales representatives, both black and white, to complain to the human resources department that there was at least an appearance of racial discrimination stemming from these and other disciplinary actions. This evidence supports Hamilton\u2019s assertion that there was a racially discriminatory atmosphere at Boise\u2019s Norman office. This, coupled with evidence from which a jury could find that Defendants\u2019 asserted reason for firing Hamilton \u2014 time card fraud \u2014 was false, would \u201cpermit the inference that unlawful discrimination was a motivating factor\u201d in Defendants\u2019 decision to fire Hamilton.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">For these reasons, I would reverse summary judgment entered for Defendants. I would do so reluctantly because the evidence suggesting that Hamilton did in fact commit time card fraud is quite strong. It is likely that, in the face of that evidence, a jury considering the merits of Hamilton\u2019s discrimination claims would conclude that she had in fact committed fraud in recording the time she worked. But at this stage of the litigation, our review is governed by summary judgment principles. <em>See </em>Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>R.Civ.P. 56(c). And those principles require that, because Harper\u2019s statement is sufficient to create a genuinely disputed issue as to whether Defendants had a good-faith belief that Hamilton committed time card fraud at the time they fired here, Hamilton is entitled to have a jury decide her race discrimination claims.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-5\">. I agree with the majority that we have appellate jurisdiction because Hamilton filed a timely notice of appeal following the district court\u2019s June 19, 2006, decision dismissing with prejudice the remaining claims and plaintiffs involved in this litigation. Although neither party argues it, there is another jurisdictional question lurking here, however, because the district court's otherwise final June 19 decision retained jurisdiction to enforce settlement agreements involving Defendants and several other plaintiffs. This court has never considered whether such an order is sufficiently final to provide appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. I would conclude it is, so long as the order is otherwise final and retains jurisdiction only to enforce a settlement agreement. <em>See Futemick v. Sumpter Twp., </em>207 F.3d 305, 310 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that the \u201cdistrict court's retention of jurisdiction to enforce the terms of a settlement agreement\u201d did <em>not </em>\"render[] an otherwise final judgment non-final\u201d because the judgment in essence \"resolved all issues on the merits and effectively ended the litigation\u201d); <em>see also Bourg v. Cont\u2019l Oil Co., </em>No. 98-30572, 1999 WL 684161, at *2 &amp; n. 3 (5th Cir. Aug. 13, 1999) (unpublished); <em>cf. Brandner Corp. v. V-Formation, Inc., </em>98 Fed.Appx. 35, 37 (2d Cir.2004) (unpublished) (referring to district court's order resolving all remaining claims as a \u201cfinal\u201d order, despite its retention of jurisdiction to enforce settlement, without specifically addressing whether that order was in fact final for 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 purposes). <em>See generally Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp., </em>162 F.3d 708, 710, 712 (1st Cir.1998) (noting \u201c[i]t is settled law that a court\u2019s retention of jurisdiction in order to facilitate tire consideration of possible future relief does not undermine the finality of an otherwise appealable order\u201d); 15B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 3915.3 (2008) (noting many district court \"[rjeservations or conditions are compatible with finality;\u201d for instance, \"[a] judgment that expressly retains jurisdiction to enter merely ministerial orders ... can be final\u201d); 36 C.J.S. <em>Federal Courts </em>\u00a7 424 (noting that \"[t]he fact that a judgment is subject to reservations or conditions does not automatically deprive the judgment of finality\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b761-8\">. The majority, without further explanation, \"doubts whether [Harper\u2019s] statement would be admissible.\u201d I harbor no such doubts at this stage of the litigation. First and foremost, Defendants have never objected to this statement's admissibility. While they admittedly had a limited opportunity to object to this evidence in the district court, because Hamilton submitted this evidence in her surreply opposing summary judgment, Defendants could have challenged its admissibility on appeal, but did not. Because there is no specific objection to this evidence, it is difficult to address its admissibility in such a vacuum. But, if the majority is concerned that Harper\u2019s statement might be hearsay, Hamilton has all along argued that Harper\u2019s statement is not hearsay, but instead is admissible as a statement of a party opponent, made by Boise\u2019s agent, Harper. As such, it arguably would be admissible. <em>See Fischer v. Forestwood Co., </em>525 F.3d 972, 983-85 (10th Cir.2008) (applying Fed.R.Evid. 801).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\">. Boise's progressive discipline policy provided that it would fire an employee for integrity issues, such as fraud. The majority asserts that Boise \u201ccould reasonably conclude that these material deviations resulting from being paid for time she did not work raise an issue of integrity making progressive discipline unwarranted.\u201d It might be true that Boise <em>could </em>have deemed mistakes made in completing time cards to rise to the level of an integrity issue. But Boise never made that argument here. Rather, Boise has, all along, indicated that it fired Hamilton for fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b762-12\">The majority asserts that \u201cMohr testified that it did not matter how [Hamilton's] conduct was characterized because no one doubted that the conduct implicated integrity concerns.\u201d But what Mohr said was, it did not matter how <em>Hamilton </em>characterized her reporting errors, because Boise considered those errors to be fraudulent.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
