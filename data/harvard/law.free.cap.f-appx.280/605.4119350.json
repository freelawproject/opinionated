Diaz argues that the district court erred in (1) calculating the market value of the smuggled wildlife and (2) applying a two-level increase for commercial purpose, which amounted to double-counting. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>review the district court\u2019s application of the Guidelines to the facts for abuse of discretion, and the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error. <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1279 (9th Cir.2006). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion valuing the wildlife at issue by reference to the sales value of live birds, discounted by an optimum hatch rate.' When the fair market retail price is difficult to ascertain, the district court is to \u201cmake a reasonable estimate using any reliable information.\u201d United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual, \u00a7 2Q2.1 comment (n. 4) (U.S.S.G.).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">The district court did not engage in impermissible double-counting. Diaz failed to object to the district court\u2019s two-level enhancement for commercial purpose, thus we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Randall, </em>162 F.3d 557, 561 (9th Cir.1998). The Guidelines seek to punish a defendant for \u201call harm that resulted from the acts and omissions.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3(a)(3). The market value adjustments punishes a different kind of harm than does the commercial purpose, therefore it is not impermissible double-counting. <em>See United States v. Reese, </em>2 F.3d 870, 895 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
