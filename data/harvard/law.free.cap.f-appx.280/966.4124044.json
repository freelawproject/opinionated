Dept. of the Treasury, </em>No. AT-0752-07-0416-I-1 (M.S.P.B. June 14, 2007). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b992-22\">Wesley was an information technology specialist with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in Memphis, Tennessee. When it was discovered that he had failed to properly file income tax returns in 2001, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"967\">*967</page-number>2002, 2003, and 2004 as well as failing to timely pay his tax liability in 2001, 2002, and 2003, the IRS removed him from employment, claiming that his conduct violated \u201cSection 1203(b)(9) of the Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998\u201d (RRA) and/or \u201cother laws rules or regulations including Section 2635.809 of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE) Standards of Conduct.\u201d The board affirmed, finding that the agency proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Wesley had violated section 1203(b)(9) of the RRA, and therefore removal was mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-5\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the board is limited. Generally, we must affirm the decision unless we find it to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). The record contains substantial evidence to support the board\u2019s finding. It reached its decision based on the testimony of the tax specialist that conducted Wesley\u2019s tax audits for the tax years at issue in this case. It found that in each year, Wesley and his wife claimed business losses of over $30,000, and received extremely large tax refunds that a reasonable person would have investigated. Further, the board found that he consented to the accuracy of the audits and agreed they were liable for increased taxes plus penalties and interest. The board therefore found that Wesley\u2019s violation of the IRS code was willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">The board found that section 1203(b)(9) involves \u201cwillful understatement of Federal tax liability, unless such understatement is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.\u201d It also found that Wesley was aware of section 1203 and its importance. Applying the facts to this legal standard, which Wesley does not challenge, the board reasonably determined that Wesley had violated section 1203(b)(9).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
