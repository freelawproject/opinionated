Summary judgment was granted to Defendants in this case. Briefly stated, the district court determined that the doctrine of collateral estoppel barred litigation of Plaintiffs contention that Defendants lacked the \u201cspecial authority\u201d Georgia law requires that lawyers must have to settle their clients\u2019 claims. We conclude that collateral estoppel does not apply. We vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-15\">The relationship between lawyer and client is regulated by particular rules and laws; see, for example O.C.G.A. \u00a7 15-19-6 (\u201cWithout special authority, attorneys cannot receive anything in discharge of a client\u2019s claim but the full amount in cash.\u201d). As we understand Georgia law, it is strict when it comes to limiting lawyers\u2019 authority to settle clients\u2019 claims. <em>See Lewis v. Uselton, </em>202 Ga.App. 875, 416 S.E.2d 94, 96-98 (1992). Therefore, circumstances that might establish actual authority for an agent, such as a lawyer, to act for his principal can still be inadequate to establish the \u201cspecial authority\u201d for one kind of transaction: a lawyer\u2019s compromise and settlement of a client\u2019s claim. In Georgia, actual authority and the \u201cspecial authority\u201d to compromise and settle a client\u2019s claim are not necessarily the same thing: we believe that special authority is actual authority plus meeting some technical formalities that must be observed before settling.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\">In the earlier case, Judge Thrash\u2019s orders, addressing a motion to enforce the settlement agreement, decide apparent authority and actual authority. But Judge Thrash\u2019s orders do not mention or actually decide the question of the lawyers\u2019 \u201cspecial authority\u201d as that idea is construed in Georgia\u2019s law: the power, given by the client, to settle on the basis of the specific terms \u2014 including the amount of money\u2014 that the lawyers accepted. Looking at this record, we cannot say that Georgia\u2019s \u201cspecial authority\u201d rule was litigated before Judge Thrash and in Judge Thrash\u2019s mind and, thus, actually decided in the earlier <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>case. We have assumed, for argument, that Plaintiff, in the earlier action before Judge Thrash, had a full and fair opportunity to litigate the issue of his lawyers\u2019 power to settle even though he was represented then by the very lawyers against whom he now claims malpractice: we decide nothing today about conflict of interest in the earlier litigation and its impact, if any, on collateral estoppel being asserted by the lawyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">We agree that Defendants\u2019 continued representation of Plaintiff in the earlier civil action constitutes adequate consideration for the revised fee agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
