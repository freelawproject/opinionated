Blanco testified before the IJ that he feared returning to Colombia because of his past experiences with FARC guerillas. Blanco also testified that he feared returning to Colombia because he would be persecuted for his past political activities. The IJ, finding that Blanco\u2019s experiences did not constitute persecution, denied Petitioners\u2019 application.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The BIA affirmed and adopted the IJ\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). We uphold the BIA\u2019s determinations if they are supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. <em>Yusupov v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>518 F.3d 185, 197 (3d Cir.2008). Where the BIA substantially adopts the findings of the IJ, we review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA. <em>He Chun Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-17\">To obtain withholding of removal, the Petitioners must demonstrate a clear probability that their lives or freedom would be threatened in Colombia on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A); <em>Romanishyn v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>455 F.3d 175, 178 n. 1 (3d Cir.2006). The Petitioners can be eligible for withholding of removal under the CAT if they show that it is more likely than not that they would be tortured upon return to their country. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>We agree with the IJ and the BIA that Petitioners failed to establish past persecution; thus they are not entitled to a rebut-table presumption of future persecution. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b); <em>Gabuniya v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 316, 321 (3d Cir.2006). Blanco testified that in 1985, while he was a teacher in a village in Colombia, his assistant teacher was killed by FARC guerillas.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The family then moved to Filandia in the province of Quindio, where Blanco became active in the now defunct Patriotic Union political party and unsuccessfully ran for mayor. Blanco claimed that he received threats from members of the victorious Conservative political party after the election. One year later, in 1991, unidentified assailants fired gunshots at his house. Shortly thereafter, Blanco immigrated to the United States. Blanco claimed that the shooting was motivated by his activities on behalf of the Patriotic Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">We agree with the IJ and the BIA that these incidents do not rise to the level of persecution. As we have previously stated, persecution is limited to \u201cthreats to life, confinement, torture, and economic restrictions so severe that they constitute a threat to life or freedom.\u201d <em>Fatin v. INS, </em>12 F.3d 1233, 1240 (3d Cir.1993). Blanco acknowledged that he was not harmed, or even present when his co-worker was killed. The death of Blanco\u2019s co-worker is a tragic event; however, we fail to see how it constituted a threat to Blanco\u2019s life or freedom. Moreover, while Blanco resigned his teaching position after his coworker\u2019s death, he was able to maintain his membership in the teachers\u2019 union and he obtained a position working for his father. Finally, Petitioners\u2019 fear of future persecution based on this incident is dubious since they remained in Colombia for six years following the incident without any further encounters with the FARC. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B) (stating that the Government can rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear arising from a showing of past persecution by proving that \u201c[t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">Substantial evidence also supports the IJ\u2019s determination that the 1991 shooting was an isolated incident of random violence that falls short of persecution. <em>See, e.g., Abdille v. Ashcroft, </em>242 F.3d 477, 494 (3d Cir.2001). Blanco alleged that the shooting was perpetrated by government forces dressed in civilian clothing. Blanco, however, did not see the shooters, presented no evidence to substantiate his belief that the perpetrators were government agents and acknowledged that the police never determined who was responsible for the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">We also agree with the IJ that Blanco\u2019s 15 year old unsuccessful mayoral candidacy is insufficient to show that Petitioners would \u201cmore likely than not\u201d be tortured if they returned to Colombia. Further, the IJ properly determined that Petitioners\u2019 fear of torture is undercut by the fact that Lopez and the children returned to Quindio for six weeks in 1995 without suffering any harm. Therefore, the IJ and BIA also justifiably denied Petitioners\u2019 application for protection under CAT. <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">For the above-stated reasons, we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b186-12\">. Lopez\u2019s and the children\u2019s applications are based on Blanco\u2019s claims of past persecution.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b187-6\">. According to Blanco, the FARC believed that teachers were spies for the Colombian government.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
