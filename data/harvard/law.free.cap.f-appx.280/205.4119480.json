SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b231-17\">In October of 2004, Andre J. Higgs sold several bricks of heroin to a confidential informant. In July of 2005, Higgs was charged in a multi-defendant, multi-count indictment with one count each of possession with intent to distribute less than 100 grams of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute 100 grams or more of heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. Pursuant to a plea agreement, containing a waiver of his right to file a direct appeal, Higgs pleaded guilty to the conspiracy count and agreed that the amount of heroin at issue was \u201cmore than 100 grams but less than 400 grams.\u201d At sentencing, Higgs argued that a state drug conviction for distributing heroin, for which he was incarcerated, should be considered as relevant conduct. Such a ruling could be advantageous to Higgs because if the prior state conviction increased his offense level under the sentencing guidelines, he would then be able under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(b) to obtain credit on his federal sentence for the time already served on his undischarged state sentence and to have his federal sentence run concurrent to the remainder of that undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-21\">The District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania agreed that Higgs\u2019 state offense was relevant conduct. The Court, however, rejected the argument that Higgs\u2019 state offense increased his offense level. It explained that Higgs\u2019 offense level had been calculated on the basis of the stipulation in the plea agreement that the quantity of heroin was more than 100 grams but less than 400 grams. As a result, the District Court refused to give Higgs credit for all of his time in state custody. The Court sentenced Higgs to 70 months of imprisonment. Consistent with U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), the District Court exercised its discretion and imposed Higgs\u2019 70 month sentence to run partially concurrent with his undischarged state sentence from the date of his guilty plea, thereby giving Higgs credit for four months of imprisonment already served on his undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-22\">Despite Higgs\u2019 waiver of his right to appeal, this appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He concedes that his appellate waiver was knowing and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>voluntary. Nonetheless, Higgs argues that the waiver should be set aside because the District Court erred by failing to give him full credit for the time already served on his undischarged state sentence and this error resulted in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">In <em>United States v. Khattak, </em>273 F.3d 557, 562 (3d Cir.2001), we held that \u201cwaivers of appeals, if entered into knowingly and voluntarily, are valid.\u201d We acknowledged that \u201cthere may be an unusual circumstance where an error amounting to a miscarriage of justice may invalidate the waiver.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 563. We fail to see any error by the District Court, however, which would warrant setting aside Higgs\u2019 sentence. In our view, the District Court properly applied U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3. The District Court also gave Higgs a not insignificant \u201cbreak\u201d by according him partial credit for the period of imprisonment already served on his undischarged state sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b231-18\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. Appellate jurisdiction exists under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327-28 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
