We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence and will uphold the agency\u2019s decision unless the evidence compels a contrary conclusion. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of withholding of removal because Eusebio Esteban has failed to demonstrate a likelihood of persecution. He has failed to show that he suffered harm rising to the level of past persecution. <em>See Prasad v. INS, </em>47 F.3d 336, 338 (9th Cir. 1995). He has relatives who continue to live in his Guatemala without incident, which undermines his claim. <em>See Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 816-17 (9th Cir.2001). Finally, substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Eusebio Esteban could avoid future harm by relocating to another part of Guatemala. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(l)(i)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">Substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s denial of CAT protection. Eusebio Esteban has failed to demonstrate that it is more likely than not that he will be tortured by or with the acquiescence of the government if removed to Guatemala. <em>See Zheng v. Ashcroft, </em>332 F.3d 1186, 1194-95 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">The Clerk shall amend the docket to reflect that, in accordance with our order of April 23, 2007, the petitioner is proceeding <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b658-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
