The defendants executed their scheme by using false documents and presenting lending institutions false information to induce them to make loans to the buyers, many of whom were straw buyers. Parker used his position as a loan officer with a mortgage company located in metropolitan Atlanta to make the scheme work.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-15\">On April 13, 2007, Parker, having entered into a plea agreement with the Government, pled guilty to the Count Three conspiracy offense and the Counts Five and Thirteen wire fraud offenses. The district court sentenced Parker on August 24, 2007, to prison terms of 60 months on Count Three, 55 months on Count Five, to run consecutively to the Count Three term, and 55 months on Count Thirteen, to run concurrently with the Count Five term.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-16\">Parker now appeals his sentences, claiming that the Government breached the plea agreement at sentencing by recommending that the court impose sentences above the bottom of the Guidelines sentence range. The breach occurred in two ways: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>Government improperly informed the court that it was not bound by the plea agreement because Parker had breached the agreement, and (2) the Government recommended a sentence at the \u201clow end\u201d of the Guidelines sentence range, rather than the \u201clowest end\u201d as provided in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">Parker did not bring these points to the district court\u2019s attention at sentencing. Therefore, absent plain error, we will not disturb his sentences. <em>United States v. De La Garza, </em>516 F.3d 1266, 1269 (11th Cir.2008). To establish plain error, Parker must convince us that (1) error occurred, (2) that was plain, (3) that affected his substantial rights, and (4) that seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceeding. In most cases, for an error to affect the defendant\u2019s substantial rights, the error had to have been prejudicial. That is, the error must have affected the outcome of the sentencing proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">\u201cThe government is bound by any material promises it makes to a defendant as part of a plea agreement that induces the defendant to plead guilty. Furthermore, whether the government violated the agreement is judged according to the defendant\u2019s reasonable understanding at the time he entered his plea.\u201d <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>77 F.3d 368, 370 (11th Cir.1996) (citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-7\">Where we conclude that the government breached the plea agreement by making an improper recommendation at sentencing, we can \u201cleave the guilty plea intact and remand the case for resentencing before a different judge,\u201d or permit the defendant to withdraw the plea. <em>Taylor, </em>77 F.3d at 371-72.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The Government did not breach the plea agreement in this case; hence, no error, much less plain error, occurred. The agreement did not forbid the Government from informing the district court that, in the Government\u2019s view, Parker had violated the terms of the agreement and consequently had released the Government from its obligation as to make the sentencing recommendation Parker says the agreement called for. Moreover, a sentence package at the \u201clow end\u201d of the Guidelines sentence range is synonymous with one at the \u201clowest end\u201d of the range, or the \u201cbottom\u201d of the range. Put another way, the \u201clow end\u201d of the Guidelines sentence range is simply the lowest possible sentence within that range. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Agbai, </em>497 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Orisnord, </em>483 F.3d 1169, 1183 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 673, 169 L.Ed.2d 527 (2007); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1356 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">Parker\u2019s sentences are, accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b926-12\">.
