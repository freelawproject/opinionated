We affirm in part and dismiss as moot in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-25\">1. The Banayans sought to revoke Mesbahi\u2019s discharge. The bankruptcy court found that the Banayans failed to prove either that \u201csuch discharge was obtained through the fraud of the debtor, and the requesting party did not know of such fraud until after the granting of such discharge,\u201d or that Mesbahi \u201cknowingly and fraudulently failed to report the acquisition of or entitlement to\u201d estate property. 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(d)(l)-(2). The BAP held this finding was not clearly erroneous, setting out in detail its reasons for so holding. We agree with the BAP\u2019s reasoning and uphold the bankruptcy court\u2019s factual findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-26\">2. During the revocation proceedings, the Banayans moved to compel discovery. The bankruptcy court denied the motion to compel because it failed to comply with a local rule designed to streamline and facilitate such motions. Central District Bankr. Local Rule 9013-l(c). The Banayans did not, as required, formulate a stipulation with Mesbahi, nor did they submit a declaration explaining the reason for such failure. As the local rule expressly permits a motion to be denied for failure to comply, the denial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>3. Because we affirm the judgment for Mesbahi, we dismiss the Banayans\u2019 appeal with respect to Katie Mesbahi as moot. <em>See Mujahid v. Daniels, </em>413 F.3d 991, 994 (9th Cir.2005). Katie Mesbahi was not a party to the underlying discharge. We note further that the Banayans could have sought any relevant discovery from Katie even if she was not a party.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">AFFIRMED in part, DISMISSED AS MOOT in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b619-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
