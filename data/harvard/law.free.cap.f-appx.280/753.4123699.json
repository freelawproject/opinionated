BALDOCK, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"AtFP\">Petitioner Pedro Miguel Carranza-Quinones is a native and citizen of Peru. He challenges the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA\u2019s) decision affirming an immigration judge\u2019s (IJ\u2019s) order that denied his asylum application. We deny the petition.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">In Peru, Carranza-Quinones worked as an accountant, and was \u201cwell-positioned economically.\u201d Admin. R. at 300. In February 2000, eight police officers entered Carranza-Quinones\u2019 home without judicial authorization and planted cocaine inside. They hit Carranza-Quinones on the head once with a pistol, causing a bump, and demanded $2,000 to destroy a document indicating that the drugs were his. According to Carranza-Quinones, \u201cthe police do this to people that make a good living, people that have a job.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">Carranza-Quinones\u2019 wife gave the officers $1,000, and they took Carranza-Quinones to a jail to secure payment of the remainder. Three days later, his wife contacted Carranza-Quinones\u2019 brother, a Peruvian diplomat, who in turn notified the Peruvian police\u2019s anti-corruption unit. The eight officers were arrested, and ultimately, seven were convicted in a \u201cpolice trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 280-81. During the ordeal, Carranza-Quinones spent twelve days in custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Afterward, he received frequent \u2014 apparently anonymous \u2014 telephone calls threatening \u201cthat if [he] kept talking, they were going to kill [him].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 286. As a result of the threats, Carranza-Quinones received police protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">One day in 2003, he saw one of the officers who had been involved in the extortion plot and who now worked for the Peruvian immigration department. That person said that if he (Carranza-Quinones) did not stop talking, \u201csomething bad\u201d would happen that would \u201cmake it impossible for [Carranza-Quinones] to renew [his] passport.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 293. CarranzaQuinones left Peru several weeks later, entered the United States on a non-immigrant visa, and applied for asylum, restriction on removal, and protection under the CAT. After his visa expired, the Department of Homeland Security commenced removal proceedings and ordered him to appear for a hearing before an IJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-12\">At the hearing, Carranza-Quinones testified that he feared returning to Peru because he had brought down several police officers. Carranza-Quinones also testified that in Peru he organized meetings for \u201cPeru Possible,\u201d a political party that opposed government corruption and President Alberto Fujimori. <em>Id. </em>According to Carranza-Quinones, the officers in the extortion plot were aligned with President Fujimori.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-13\">The IJ ordered Carranza-Quinones removed to Peru, finding that the extortion incident was not connected to his political opinion or any other ground sufficient to qualify for relief. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision, stating that Carranza-Quinones failed to support his claim that the harm and fear he experienced was \u201cinflicted on account of [his] political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30. Carranza-Quinones then filed in this court the instant petition for judicial review.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b780-15\">I. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">Where, as here, the BIA issues a brief, one-member order, our review focuses on the BIA\u2019s order, rather than the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Sarr v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 783, 790 (10th Cir.2007). But \u201cwhen seeking to understand the grounds provided by the BIA, we are not precluded from consulting the IJ\u2019s more complete explanation of those same grounds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). We will not disturb the BIA\u2019s deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>mination if it is supported by \u201creasonable, substantial and probative evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 788 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">II. Asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">\u201cTo qualify for asylum, an alien must show that he has suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations and alteration omitted). CarranzaQuinones focuses on the last category\u2014 political opinion. He seems to argue that he was extorted because of his association with Peru Possible. But there is absolutely no evidence in the record of a nexus between Carranza-Quinones\u2019 political association and the extortion plot. Indeed, Carranza-Quinones testified that he thought Peruvian police extorted people because they were financially well off. <em>See </em>Admin. R. at 293. And while the officers who extoi'ted Carranza-Quinones may have been aligned with Peru Possible\u2019s opponent, President Fujimori, that fact alone is insufficient to show that there was persecution \u201con account of\u201d political opinion. <em>See Saugha v. INS, </em>103 F.3d 1482, 1487 (9th Cir.1997) (observing that persecution on account of political opinion requires \u201csomething more than violence plus disparity of views\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">Carranza-Quinones also contends that the death threats he received for exposing the extortion plot qualify as persecution on account of political opinion. Our circuit has not yet addressed the circumstances under which retaliation for exposing government corruption can be treated as persecution \u201con account of ... political opinion.\u201d <em>Sarr, </em>474 F.3d at 788.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Other \u201ccourts have held that whistleblowing against corrupt government officials may constitute political activity sufficient to form the basis of persecution \u2018on account of political opinion,\u2019 as can the refusal to accede to government corruption.\u201d <em>Bu v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 424, 431 (6th Cir.2007) (collecting cases). Even in those cases, however, \u201cthe salient question is whether [the whistleblower\u2019s] actions were directed toward a governing institution, or only against individuals whose corruption was aberrational.\u201d <em>Grava v. INS, </em>205 F.3d 1177, 1181 (9th Cir.2000). When the corruption is aberrational, it tends to indicate that the reprisals against the whistleblower are intended \u201cto shut [the whistleblower] up for purely self-protective reasons,\u201d rather than to punish the whistleblower for voicing a political opinion about government misconduct. <em>See Marquez v. INS, </em>105 F.3d 374, 381 (7th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Here, Carranza-Quinones exposed the extortion plot of eight officers of the Peruvian police force. That institution was not involved in the plot, and in fact, its anti-corruption unit intervened on CarranzaQuinones\u2019 behalf and arrested the officers, convicted seven of them, and later provided protection when Carranza-Quinones began receiving death threats. No evidence in the record compels the conclusion that the criminal acts of those officers were typical of Peruvian police officers or that the anti-corruption unit\u2019s intervention was an anomaly. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (identifying the quantum of evidence necessary to overturn the BIA\u2019s asylum-eligibility determination). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Consequently, we conclude that Carranza- ' Quinones was threatened for purely self-protective reasons, and not because of his political opinion against corruption. <em>See Marquez, </em>105 F.3d at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-4\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">The BIA did not err in concluding that Carranza-Quinones failed to establish his eligibility for asylum. Accordingly, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b779-19\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b779-27\">. It does not appear that Carranza-Quinones is challenging the adverse administrative determinations on his claims for restriction on removal and withholding of removal under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). In any event, because Carranza-Quinones cannot establish that he was persecuted for purposes of obtaining asylum, he \u201cnecessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>fail[s] to meet the higher standards required for restriction on removal ... or withholding of removal under the [CAT].\u201d <em>Solomon v. Gonzales, </em>454 F.3d 1160, 1163 (10th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\">. We assume, without deciding, that the death threats against Carranza-Quinones are of sufficient magnitude to constitute persecution. <em>See Sidabutar v. Gonzales, </em>503 F.3d 1116, 1124 (10th Cir.2007) (stating that persecution requires \"more than just ... threats to life and liberty\u201d (quotation omitted)); <em>Yuk v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1222, 1234 (10th Cir.2004) (stating that threats alone may constitute persecution \"when they are so immediate and menacing as to cause significant suffering or harm in themselves\u201d (quotation omitted)).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
