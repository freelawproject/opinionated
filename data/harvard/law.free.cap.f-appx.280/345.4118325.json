Ramirez was sentenced to 63 months in prison and a three-year term of supervised release. Ramirez argues that his prior California robbery conviction did not constitute a crime of violence within the meaning of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(ii). As he concedes, however, this court has determined that a conviction pursuant to CalPenal Code \u00a7 211 is a crime of violence because the statutory definition of the offense \u201cfalls within the generic or contemporary meaning of robbery.\u201d <em>United States v. Tellez-Martinez, </em>517 F.3d 813, 815 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">Ramirez also asserts that his sentence is unreasonable. This court reviews a sentencing decision for \u201creasonableness,\u201d which is the equivalent of abuse-of-diseretion review. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). When the district court imposes a sentence within a properly calculated guideline range and gives proper weight to the Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, this court \u201cwill give great deference to that sentence\u201d and \u201cwill infer that the judge has considered all the factors for a fair sentence set forth in the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 519\u201420 (5th Cir.2005). Moreover, a discretionary sentence imposed within a properly calculated guideline range, as occurred here, is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2466-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). The district court did not treat the Guidelines as mandatory and stated its belief that the sentence satisfied the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">Ramirez argues that the sentence should nevertheless be vacated and the case summarily remanded on the basis of the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decisions in <em>Gall </em>and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which, he urges, \u201chave drastically altered the legal landscape of federal sentencing.\u201d The argument is not well-taken. Neither case overturned <em>Rita. </em>To the contrary, <em>Gall </em>reiterated that appellate courts may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence within the pertinent guideline range. 128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-21\">Ramirez contends that <em>Kimbrough </em>applies because the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the discretion to disagree with the policy behind prior-felony enhancement mandated under the Guidelines, in light of this court\u2019s precedent in <em>United States v. Tzep-Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 522, 527 (5th Cir.2006). Even prior to <em>Kimbrough, </em>this court\u2019s precedent offered district courts the opportunity to impose a sentence outside the guideline range. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 558 n. 1 (5th Cir.2008). The district court\u2019s comments at sentencing do not indicate that it would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>been inclined not to apply the 16-level enhancement because of Ramirez\u2019s individual circumstances but believed it lacked the authority to do so. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED as to the sentence imposed.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Ramirez also contends that the written judgment incorrectly reflects that he was convicted of being found present in the United States rather than attempted illegal reentry, and he asks that the district court amend the written judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. The record reflects that the district court in fact found Ramirez guilty of attempted illegal reentry. Accordingly, the judgment is corrected to state under the nature of offense that \u201cAlien unlawfully attempted illegal reentry into the United States after deportation, having previously been convicted of an aggravated felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Judgment AFFIRMED as corrected.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b372-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
