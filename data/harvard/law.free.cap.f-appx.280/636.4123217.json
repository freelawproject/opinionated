We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-24\">Bruno-Nava contends that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court placed undue weight on the benefits that he received under the fast-track program, and failed to consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>whether the factors contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) justified a lesser sentence. He further contends that the district court failed to provide sufficient reasoning in imposing his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The record reflects, however, that in imposing a sentence at the bottom of the applicable Guidelines range, the district court conducted a thorough and careful sentencing analysis, in which it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors without giving undue weight to any factor. In addition, the court stated the reasons for the sentence imposed in enough detail to demonstrate that it had \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments and ha[d] a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>see also United States v.
