Lemons appeals, contending that his predicate state convictions were not crimes \u201cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,\u201d as required by \u00a7 922(g)(1). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-19\">The district court relied on a 2005 conviction for possession of cocaine with intent to sell and deliver, a Class H felony under North Carolina law. Lemons asserts that the maximum sentence for the crime based on his individual criminal history and North Carolina\u2019s structured sentencing scheme did not exceed twelve months. However, as Lemons concedes, his argument is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Harp, </em>406 F.3d 242, 246-47 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 919, 126 S.Ct. 297, 163 L.Ed.2d 259 (2005). Thus, because it is undisputed that a sentence of over twelve months could be imposed on a defendant convicted of possession with the intent to sell and deliver cocaine in North Carolina, the district court properly considered Lemons\u2019 prior conviction as a predicate felony for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1). Lemons urges us to reexamine <em>Harp </em>in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Cunningham v. California, </em>549 U.S. 270, 127 S.Ct. 856, 860, 166 L.Ed.2d 856 (2007) (holding that California\u2019s determinate sentencing law violated Sixth Amendment by \u201cassign[ing] to the trial judge, not to the jury, authority to find the facts that expose a defendant to an elevated \u2018upper term\u2019 sentence\u201d). However, \u201ca panel of this court cannot overrule, explicitly or implicitly, the precedent set by a prior panel of this court. Only the Supreme Court or this court sitting en banc can do that.\u201d <em>Scotts Co. v. United Indus. Corp., </em>315 F.3d 264, 271-72 n. 2 (4th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Moreover, our decision in <em>Harp </em>was not called into question by <em>Cunningham, </em>as <em>Harp </em>involved the determination of a maximum sentence without regard to the find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ings made by a sentencing judge as to the particular defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">We find similarly meritless Lemons\u2019 related arguments predicated on the rule of lenity, the principle of constitutional doubt, and an unpublished opinion addressing the application of the Assimilative Crimes Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 13 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Lemons\u2019 conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
