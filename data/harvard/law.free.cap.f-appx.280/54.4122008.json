Konstantin was sentenced principally to concurrent terms of incarceration of 63 months\u2019 imprisonment and to one concurrent term of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, to three years of supervised release, and to $1.15 million in restitution and $6,100 special assessment. The jury also returned a verdict of forfeiture in the amount of $11.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-21\">First, defendant Konstantin argues that he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to choice of counsel. In doing so, defendant misapprehends the rule that the Supreme Court announced in <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565-2566, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006). In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court made clear that if a defendant is found to have been erroneously deprived of his right to choice of counsel, that is a struc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>tural error that is not subject to harmless-error review. However, even under the rule of Gonzalez-Lopez, we must first determine if Konstantin was erroneously deprived of his right to choice of counsel. Here, defendant Konstantin asked the district court for an adjournment a week before the start of trial, because he was displeased with his current counsel and because his purported counsel of choice was unavailable for trial. \u201cWe are particularly solicitous of a district court\u2019s ruling on a motion to adjourn the scheduled start of a trial proceeding. Such a ruling will not be disturbed unless clear abuse is shown; to make that showing, the complaining party must establish both that the denial of the adjournment was arbitrary, and that it substantially impaired the presentation of his case.\u201d <em>Sequa Corp. v. GBJ Corp., </em>156 F.3d 136, 147-148 (2d Cir.1998); <em>see also Morris v. Slappy, </em>461 U.S. 1, 11-12, 103 S.Ct. 1610, 75 L.Ed.2d 610 (1983) (stating that trial judges receive broad discretion on matters of continuances because they require a great deal of latitude in scheduling trials, assembling witnesses, lawyers, and jurors).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>the Supreme Court preserved \u201ca trial court\u2019s wide latitude in balancing the right to counsel of choice against the demands of its calendar.\u201d <em>Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>126 S.Ct. at 2565-66. In this case, defendant presents no compelling evidence that Judge Dearie failed to balance the right to counsel of choice against the demands of his calendar. The defendant asked for the adjournment one week prior to trial, despite the fact that the trial date had been set for eight months; it was well within Judge Dearie\u2019s discretion to deny his request. We further agree with Judge Dearie that there is no evidence that the denial of an adjournment substantially impaired the presentation of defendant Konstantin\u2019s case. While a forensic accountant may have provided some additional insight into the case, it was a reasonable trial strategy not to use such an expert witness, and there is no evidence that this decision \u201csubstantially impaired the presentation of his case.\u201d Thus, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision and find that defendant Konstantin was not denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">Second, Konstantin appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his Rule 36 motion, arguing that we should remand the case to the district court to correct its recommendation as to Konstantin\u2019s physical location of incarceration. Rule 36 provides: \u201cAfter giving any notice it considers appropriate, the court may at any time correct a clerical error in a judgment, order, or other part of the record, or correct an error in the record arising from oversight or omission.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. While the district court is normally in the best position to determine whether its judgment included a clerical mistake that resulted from oversight or omission, the record strongly suggests that one such mistake may be present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">It is undisputed that Judge Dearie intended to recommend that Konstantin be incarcerated as close as possible to Memphis, Tennessee, where his family is located. The judgment, however, recommends that he be placed \u201cas close to the Tennessee Southeast Region as possible.\u201d Because Tennessee lies within the Bureau of Prison\u2019s Mid-Atlantic Region, not its Southeast Region, the Bureau of Prisons may have interpreted Judge Dearie\u2019s words as a recommendation that Konstantin be placed as near to Tennessee as possible <em>within </em>the Bureau\u2019s Southeast Region. Had the regional constraint not been in Judge Dearie\u2019s recommendation, the Bureau may have placed Konstantin directly in the Memphis Federal Correctional Institution. Because Judge Dearie did not discuss this potential source of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>confusion when denying the Rule 36 motion, we cannot tell from the record if he considered it. We therefore remand to the district court for the sole purpose of allowing it to look at this issue again, and if Judge Dearie is so inclined, to clarify his intent in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the decision of the district court. We REMAND to the district court for clarification of its determination of defendant\u2019s Rule 36 motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
