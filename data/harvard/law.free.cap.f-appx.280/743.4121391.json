PORFILIO, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b771-10\">Richard G. Kirby appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion for a mandatory injunction in district court docket number 257 and its dismissal of his claims against certain defendants in district court docket number 258. We note that Mr. Kirby brought claims against numerous defendants in this action, and that the district court has yet to dispose of many of his claims. Consequently, this appeal is an interlocutory appeal.. Defendant First New Mexico Bank of Silver City has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-12\">We have jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of district court docket number 257 because that order is an express denial of injunctive relief. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a) (providing jurisdiction to review \u201c[\u00a1Interlocutory orders of the district courts ... or of the judges thereof ... refusing ... injunctions\u201d). The district court correctly construed the motion as one for a preliminary injunction, and we review the denial of a preliminary injunction for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Utah Licensed Beverage Ass\u2019n v. Leavitt, </em>256 F.3d 1061, 1065 (10th Cir.2001). \u201cAn abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial court bases its decision on an erroneous conclusion of law or where there is no rational basis in the evidence for the ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation omitted). The distinct court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Kirby\u2019s motion for a mandatory injunction. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision for substantially the reasons stated in district court docket number 257.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-13\">In contrast, we lack jurisdiction over the interlocutory appeal of district court docket number 258. With some exceptions, such as \u00a7 1292(a), this court generally has jurisdiction to review only \u201cfinal decisions\u201d of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. An order that disposes of \u201cfewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities of fewer than all the parties does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties\u201d unless the district court \u201cexpressly determines that there is no just reason for delay\u201d and \u201cdireet[s] entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Thus, \u201c[i]n the absence of [a Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>54(b) ] determination, any order, however designated, which adjudicates fewer than all of the claims or the liabilities of all of the parties, is not a final appealable order.\u201d <em>Atiya v. Salt Lake County, </em>988 F.2d 1013, 1016 (10th Cir.1993). This is so even if the order may seem \u201cfinal\u201d as far as the particular defendants and/or claims addressed therein are concerned. Our review of the district court\u2019s docket indicates that, to date, claims against more than thirty defendants remain pending in the district court. Moreover, district court docket number 258 does not contain a Rule 54(b) determination. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction over the appeal of district court docket number 258.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\">The denial of Mr. Kirby\u2019s motion for a mandatory injunction in district court docket number 257 is AFFIRMED. First New Mexico Bank of Silver City\u2019s motion to dismiss the appeal is GRANTED in part, and the portion of this appeal that concerns district court docket number 258 is DISMISSED for lack of appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b771-11\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
