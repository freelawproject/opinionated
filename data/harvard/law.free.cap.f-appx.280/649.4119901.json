We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-26\">Christenot contends that the district court erred in applying a two-level en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>hancement for obstruction of justice under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 BC1.1. He contends that the district court based the enhancement on unreliable hearsay in an affidavit from Lisa Emmett, the daughter of his co-defendant, that alleged that he had attempted to influence her testimony at trial. He contends that Emmett\u2019s subsequent recantation of the affidavit renders it unreliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that there were minimal indicia supporting the affidavit\u2019s reliability. <em>See United States v. Littlesun, </em>444 F.3d 1196 (9th Cir.2006). Among other things, the district court properly deferred to the credibility determination of the judge who had observed Emmett\u2019s in-court testimony. In addition, the fact that the recantation itself appeared to have been coached supports the court\u2019s finding that Christenot sought to influence Emmett\u2019s testimony. <em>See United States v. Fernandez-Vidana, </em>857 F.2d 673, 675 (9th Cir.1988) (\u201cOnly when the hearsay is so inadequately supported that the \u2018factual basis for believing [it is] almost nil\u2019 can it be argued that the evidence should not have been considered\u201d in sentencing); <em>see also United States v. Berry, </em>258 F.3d 971, 975 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that an appellate court may review the entire record to determine whether hearsay statements are sufficiently reliable).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b675-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
