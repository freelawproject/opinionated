The district court sentenced Clowers to 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum. On appeal, Clowers argues that the district court erred in its assessment of criminal history points and that his sentence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>substantively unreasonable. For the reasons that follow, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">On January 17, 2004, Ashley Bennett (\u201cBennett\u201d), then a seventeen-year-old minor female, was reported missing from her residence in E still Springs, Tennessee. Tennessee authorities pursued an investigation, and soon came to believe that Clowers, a friend and business associate of Bennett\u2019s father, was residing with Bennett in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">On January 30, 2004, local authorities in South Carolina arrested Clowers on statutory rape charges pursuant to a Tennessee arrest warrant. Upon arrest, Clowers indicated that Bennett was at a local shopping mall, where she was found without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">On February 2, 2004, local authorities searched Clowers\u2019s residence, and seized numerous videotapes and photographs of suspected child pornography. One videotape contained footage of Clowers engaging in sexual activity with Bennett. A portion of this tape depicted <em>Bennett </em>bound in handcuffs and a rope, blindfolded and nude, while Clowers fondled her; another portion of the video depicted Bennett performing oral sex on Clowers. Authorities also seized a videotape containing footage of Clowers digitally manipulating the vagina of a ten-year-old girl during a bath while forcing the girl to hold his penis; the video also showed Clowers\u2019s penis positioned near the mouth of the same girl while she was sleeping in a chair.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">On February 4, 2004, Clowers was interviewed by a local investigator. During the interview, Clowers admitted that he had broadcasted video over the internet of Bennett performing oral sex on him. Clowers also identified the ten-year-old girl from the seized videotape as his niece.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-9\">On March 5, 2004, Bennett was interviewed by investigators. Investigators showed her a still photograph taken from a seized videotape, and she identified herself, Clowers, and the location depicted in the videotape. She stated that she and Clowers became intimately involved during the summer of 2003 when she was seventeen years old. She told investigators that her father was a business associate of Clowers, who frequently instructed her to accompany Clowers on various business errands because he was encouraging her to form a relationship with Clowers. She also stated that she ran away from home because her father had been inappropriately touching her. She called Clowers asking for help in leaving Tennessee, and in January of 2004, Clowers drove her to his apartment in Columbia, South Carolina.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-11\">Bennett told investigators that on one occasion, Clowers blindfolded her while she was naked, tied her hands above her head, and videotaped her while fondling her. On another occasion, Clowers set up a web camera and broadcasted video in an internet chat room of Bennett performing oral sex on Clowers. Clowers also videotaped Bennett and himself engaging in sexual intercourse and oral sex on two other occasions during the summer of 2003. Although she never viewed any of the videotapes of herself, Bennett told investigators that Clowers showed her videos of individuals engaging in group sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-12\">Three computers seized during the search of Clowers\u2019s apartment were examined in a computer laboratory. A computer program recovered 1,017 deleted images from one of the computers. Through this technique investigators recovered hundreds of deleted images depicting nude minor children in various non-sexual poses, four images depicting minor females engaged in sexual acts, and eleven videos depicting minors engaged in sexual acts. On another computer, investigators located <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>a large number of images and videos depicting minors engaged in sexual acts.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Investigators interviewed Angela Mangrum, Clowers\u2019s sister and the mother of Clowers\u2019s niece who was depicted in the seized videotape. Mangrum told investigators that her daughter informed her of the incident depicted on the videotape two years after its occurrence. She also told investigators that she and her younger brother were abused by Clowers as children. She stated that Clowers had threatened to kill her and her brother, while displaying guns and martial arts weapons, if either of them told their parents about Clowers\u2019s abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Investigators also interviewed Kendra Sebastian, a former girlfriend of Clowers. Sebastian stated that she began seeing Clowers when she was fourteen years old, when Clowers was ten years her senior, and was involved in a sexual relationship with Clowers for about one to one and a half years. She told authorities that on various occasions she was forced to have sex with Clowers and other men under threats of violence. She also stated that on one occasion, Clowers performed oral sex on her younger sister, who was twelve or thirteen years old at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">On July 22, 2004, Clowers pleaded guilty in South Carolina state court to two counts of Sexual Exploitation of a Minor in the Second Degree, in violation of S.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 16-3-655. He was sentenced to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment on each charge, with the sentences to run concurrently. On August 28, 2006, Clowers was released to federal authorities pursuant to a federal detainer.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">On April 25, 2006, Clowers was indicted in federal court on two counts of enticing a minor to engage in sexually explicit conduct in order to produce a visual depiction, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On October 18, 2006, Clowers pleaded guilty to the first count pursuant to a plea agreement with the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-11\">On February 4, 2007, the parties appeared for sentencing. Clowers raised various arguments concerning the computation of his criminal history score, which were rejected by the district court. Clowers also raised an objection as to whether he committed certain conduct described in the section of the PSR entitled \u201cOffense Behavior Not Part of Relevant Conduct.\u201d The district court allowed him to file a brief outlining those objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">On February 28, 2007, Clowers filed his brief with the court. He disputed that he had \u201cforced or used threats to accomplish the sexual acts\u201d described by Angela Mangrum in her statement to authorities, and emphasized that the sexual activities \u201ctook place approximately thirty years [prior] when [Clowers] was approximately eleven years old.\u201d Clowers further denied \u201call allegations of force or the threat of force\u201d by his former girlfriend, Kendra Sebastian, denied arranging for her to have sex with other men, and denied the sexual incident regarding Sebastian\u2019s sister. Clowers admitted that child pornography was on his computers, but stated that he did not know the number of the images, and that they most likely were \u201cuploaded by various third-party internet users\u201d onto his \u201cserver which he owned for his internet service company.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">On March 7, 2007, the sentencing hearing resumed, and the district court took up Clowers\u2019s factual objections. The district court informed Clowers that he was entitled to have a jury resolve the disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>information in the PSR, which Clowers waived. The Government presented testimony by Angela Mangrum and Kendra Sebastian. Upon the conclusion of their testimony, the district court made factual findings crediting their testimony. The district court computed Clowers\u2019s offense level as 24, which, together with a criminal history category of IV, resulted in a Guidelines range of 76-96 months. The district court found, however, that the advisory Guidelines sentence is \u201cembodied\u201d in the statutory mandatory minimum sentence, which is 180 months under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e). After applying the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court found that a sentence higher than the Guidelines sentence was warranted. Clowers received a sentence of 360 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum, to be followed by a life term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Aaj\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In our review of sentences on appeal, we first determine whether the sentence was procedurally reasonable, and then whether it was substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>516 F.3d 473, 476 (6th <em>Cir.2008). </em>We review sentences for an abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. \u201cA sentence may be procedurally unreasonable if the district court did not appreciate the non-mandatory nature of the guidelines, did not correctly calculate the sentencing range under the guidelines, or did not consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d 511, 514 (6th Cir.2008) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cA sentence may be considered substantively unreasonable when the district court selects the sentence arbitrarily, bases the sentence on impermissible factors, fails to consider pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors or gives an unreasonable amount of weight to any pertinent factor.\u201d <em>United States v. Keller, </em>498 F.3d 316, 322 (6th Cir.2007) (internal quotations and citation omitted). \u201cIn reviewing a challenge to the length of an outside-guidelines sentence, we may \u2018take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>516 F.3d at 477 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 595). \u201cBut in applying abuse-of-discretion review, we \u2018must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors ... justify the extent of the variance.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>516 F.3d at 477-78 (quoting <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">B. Procedural Reasonableness</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">Clowers challenges the district court\u2019s assessment of six criminal 'history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), as well as the district court\u2019s assessment of two criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(d). We need not address any alleged error in the district court\u2019s calculation of Clowers\u2019s criminal history points, however, because the district court determined the correct Guidelines sentence. A violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) requires a mandatory minimum sentence of 180 months, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(e), and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b) provides that \u201c[wjhere a statutorily required minimum sentence is greater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum will be the guideline sentence.\u201d Thus, the applicable Guidelines sentence was 180 months, the statutory mandatory minimum. The district court was correct when it noted that the Guidelines sentence was \u201cembodied\u201d in the statutory mandatory minimum. <em>See United States v. Barnes, </em>49 F.3d 1144, 1150 (6th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Washington, </em>112 Fed.Appx. 501, 505 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201c[T]his Court will not address an alleged error in the offense level if the mandatory minimum penalty trumps the guideline range.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>The record indicates that Clowers\u2019s sentence was free of procedural error, given the district court considered several relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the appropriateness of a variance. The district court considered the applicable 180-month advisory Guidelines sentence, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(3)(5) (\u201cI have to consider the Guidelines, which, of course, in this case are embodied in the statutory minimum, mandatory-minimum sentence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>521 F.3d 636, 652 (6th Cir.2008) (\u201cThe district court [] satisfied \u00a7 3553(a)(3)-(5) by correctly calculating the recommended guidelines range.\u201d). The district court also considered providing needed correctional treatment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) (\u201cIt\u2019s recommended that the defendant be designated to FCI Butner, North Carolina, so that he may participate in the Bureau of Prisons sex offender treatment program.\u201d). The district court considered Clowers\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(1) (\u201cThe defendant\u2019s history can be summed up in one word, reprehensible. And I think that may not be strong enough. There were other victims here, I\u2019ve determined here, besides Ashley Bennett. And these are the defendant\u2019s siblings, and as well as others. The defendant has left some badly damaged young people in his wake.\u201d). The district court considered just punishment, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) (\u201c[TJhere is a crying need here to provide just punishment____ [Clowersj\u2019s computer contained ... over 1,000 images actually of child pornography in addition to 11[ ] videos. And, of course, this was not just a downloading case. He was going to transmit these images on the internet. The offense of conviction and the Guidelines do not themselves reflect the heinousness of what the defendant did.\u201d). Finally, the district court considered protecting the public, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (\u201cThe multiple sexual activity with Ms. Sebastian demonstrates that the defendant used violence and threats. These facts demonstrate that the public needs protection from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">Given that the district court calculated the correct Guidelines sentence, and demonstrated its detailed consideration of several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, we find no procedural error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">C. Substantive Reasonableness of 360-Month Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">Clowers argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable on three grounds: (1) the district court gave too much weight to the evidence of Clowers\u2019s sexual abuse of his siblings and Kendra Sebastian; (2) the district court did not adequately consider the benefits of treatment; and (3) the sentence is disproportionate to other offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">We first dismiss Clowers\u2019s blanket contention that his sentence was unreasonable because \u201cit is undisputed that the underlying offense did not involve violence.\u201d Clowers\u2019s characterization of his offense conduct is inaccurate, because his conduct included the production of a videotape of Bennett in which she was \u201cbound in handcuffs and a rope, blindfolded and nude while Clowers fondled her.\u201d Furthermore, the district court never relied on any finding or assumption that the underlying offense involved violence in fashioning its sentence. Instead, the district court considered Clowers\u2019s past history of violence in weighing the sentencing factor concerning the need \u201cto protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C). Although a district court need only find facts used to sentence a defendant at sentencing on a \u201cpreponderance of the evidence\u201d standard, <em>see United States v. Klups, </em>514 F.3d 532, 537-38 (6th Cir.2008), the district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d several facts that justified its weighing of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The district court heard Angela Mangrum\u2019s testimony that Clowers regularly threatened her and her brother with physical harm, even using a drill at one point on her younger brother\u2019s arm, and that she feared Clowers would physically harm her if she did not engage in sexual acts with her younger brother, with Clowers, and with Clowers\u2019s friends. After hearing Mangrum\u2019s testimony, the district court found beyond a reasonable doubt that Clowers threatened Mangrum with violence and used force to compel sexual activity with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">The district court also heard Kendra Sebastian\u2019s testimony that when she was fifteen yeai-s old, Clowers threatened her at gunpoint when she told him that she wanted to end their relationship. She testified that Clowers forced her to have sex hundreds of times, and would cut her with razor blades if she would not have sex with other men in Clowers\u2019s presence \u2014 which she was forced to do on ten to fifteen occasions. She also testified that Clowers performed oral sex on her then twelve-year-old sister, and had her sister perform oral sex on the defendant. After hearing Sebastian\u2019s testimony, the district court found that Clowers \u201cuse[d] force and threats, at least part of the time, to compel [sexual] activity.... [Clowers] used such things as razor blades, knives and guns to make those threats. Mrs. Sebastian at this time was only fourteen or fifteen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">The district court essentially found that Clowers had a decades-long history of committing violent or otherwise deviant sexual acts against several victims. Accordingly, the district court was justified in weighing \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) in favor of a sentence significantly longer than that provided by the Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Clowers\u2019s contends that the district court failed to adequately consider the benefits of treatment, a contention which we reject. Clowers states in his brief that \u201cthe evidence suggests that [Clowers], contrary to the district court\u2019s assumptions, had made significant progress in reforming the most serious aspects of his alleged behavior and that any violent tendencies or temptations had been eliminated.\u201d At oral argument, however, counsel for Clowers conceded that no evidence in the record supports this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">The only evidence regarding Clowers\u2019s potential treatment response is the psychological assessment report referenced in the PSR. The report concluded that Clowers \u201cis in a group that is considered potentially treatable,\u201d but also that Clowers was highly likely to recidivate. According to one measure for risk for reoffending, the testing clinician assessed a recidivism rate of twenty-six to thirty-six percent. The report contradicts Clowers\u2019s belief that treatment would necessarily be beneficial. In any event, the district court considered \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D) when it recommended that Clowers participate in the Bureau of Prisons sex offender treatment program. Accordingly, we find no merit to Clowers\u2019s argument concerning \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(D). <em>Cf. United States v. Allman, </em>119 Fed.Appx. 751, 755 (6th Cir.2005) (stating that \u201c[o]nly exceptional rehabilitation can support a downward departure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Clowers also argues that his \u201csentence of 360 months was disproportionate to his offense and factually similar offenses.\u201d However, Clowers provided no argument to support the contention that his sentence resulted in an \u201cunwarranted sentence disparity] among defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\u201d \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Furthermore, this Court has explained that in applying this sentencing factor, <em>\u201cunwarranted </em>disparities in sentencing is what should be avoided, <em>not </em>those that are warranted.\u201d <em>United States v. Phinazee, </em>515 F.3d 511, 520 (6th Cir.2008) (emphasis in original). As we explained above, the district court appropriately weighed \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(C) (concerning the need to protect the public) in favor of a longer sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">We note that Clowers would have been subject to a higher offense level under the 2004 Amendments to the Guidelines. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1 now provides for a base offense level of 32, and Clowers would have received an additional eight-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(2)(A) (\u201cIf the offense involved ... the commission of a sexual act or sexual contact, increase by 2 levels.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(3) (\u201cIf the offense involved distribution, increase by 2 levels.\u201d); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2G2.1(b)(4) (\u201cIf the offense involved material that portrays sadistic or masochistic conduct or other depictions of violence, increase by 4 levels.\u201d). Clowers\u2019s total offense level would have been 37 (after a three-point reduction for acceptance of responsibility), resulting in an advisory Guideline range of 292 to 365 months. His 360-month sentence would be squarely within that range, and presumptively reasonable under <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2463, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Thus, Clowers\u2019s sentence would not be disproportionate to defendants charged with the same offense conduct under the current version of the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Springer, </em>28 F.3d 236, 238 (1st Cir.1994) (\u201cWhat matters is that [the defendant] will be treated the same as <em>all </em>those convicted of the same offense at the same time, regardless of when they are sentenced. This is consistent with the concerns of Congress and the Guidelines\u2019 goal of uniformity.\u201d) (emphasis in original) (citing \u00a7 3553(a)(6)).</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">Because the district court adequately considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and did not accord any undue weight to any one factor, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Clowers.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">For the reasons stated above, we AFFIRM Clowers\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\">.
