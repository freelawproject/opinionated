Defonzo denying Li\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Rong Fang Li, </em>No. A 99 083 363 (B.I.A. June 29, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A 99 083 363 (Immig.Ct.N.Y.City, Jan. 4, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision. See, <em>e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-15\">Title 8, Section 1158(a)(3) of the United States Code provides that no court shall have jurisdiction to review the agency\u2019s finding that an asylum application was untimely under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B), or its finding of neither changed nor extraordinary circumstances excusing the untimeliness under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(D). Notwithstanding that provision, however, this Court retains jurisdiction to review constitutional claims and \u201cquestions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). \u201cQuestions of law\u201d encompass the same issues traditionally re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>viewed by courts in habeas petitions challenging Executive detentions. <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 326-27 (2d Cir.2006). Li asserts that she should not have been subjected to the one year bar because the intensification of the Chinese family planning policy in recent years \u201camounts to an ongoing case of changed country conditions\u201d and \u201cthe threat is an ongoing policy.\u201d However, this argument fails to identify any error in the Id\u2019s decision. As such, we construe Li\u2019s assertions as a challenge only to \u201cthe correctness of the [IJ\u2019s] factual findings\u201d with respect to whether she established extraordinary circumstances excusing the delay in filing her asylum application. <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 329. Accordingly, as the Government correctly asserts, we are without jurisdiction to review Li\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s pretermission of her asylum claim and dismiss the petition for review to that extent. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">We also find that the denial of withholding of removal was proper. The IJ acknowledged that village committee officials forced Li to attend a pregnancy check up, detained her at the village committee office for an afternoon, compelled her to review family planning pamphlets, criticized her, and fined her 500 yuan. The IJ accurately noted, however, that Li was never subjected to an abortion or sterilization procedure, or compelled to wear an intrauterine device. Further, the IJ appropriately noted that, although Li submitted a letter from her mother in support of her claim, her mother made no reference to Li\u2019s arrest by the village committee in March 1998. Under these circumstances, the IJ reasonably found that Li failed to demonstrate past persecution. <em>See Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 341 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that to constitute persecution, the harm must rise above \u201cmere harassment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Because Li failed to establish that she had been subjected to past persecution, she was not entitled to a presumption that she would likely be subjected to future persecution in China. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1). In that regard, the record supports the agency\u2019s finding that Li did not demonstrate a clear probability of persecution. In contrast to this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>there is no indication that the IJ or BIA failed to consider the documents Li submitted in support of her motion to reopen. 463 F.3d 109, 115 (2d Cir.2006). Indeed, the agency was not required to address specifically each of Li\u2019s documents when the record does not \u201ccompellingly suggest\u201d that it did not \u201ctake into account all of the evidence before [it].\u201d <em>Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 337, n. 17. <em>But see Zhi Yun Gao v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 86, 88 (2d Cir.2007) (remanding where the BIA\u2019s decision did not indicate that it paid any attention to documents \u201cquite similar\u201d to the <em>Shou Yung Guo </em>documents). In any event, it is clear that the IJ and BIA considered and rejected Li\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Taken as a whole, the agency\u2019s denial of Li\u2019s application for withholding of removal was not in error. Because Li was unable to show the objective likelihood of a threat to her life or freedom needed to make out a claim for withholding of removal, she was necessarily unable to succeed on her claim for relief under the CAT, which rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DISMISSED, in part, and DENIED, in part. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
