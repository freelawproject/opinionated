On appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the Government did not abuse its discretion in denying him a second opportunity to provide substantial assistance following violation of the conditions of his bond, the district court\u2019s grant of the Government\u2019s motion to quash White\u2019s subpoenas, and the district court\u2019s denial of White\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>Nine months after being released to cooperate, and following his involvement in two controlled buys and assistance which led to the arrest of an individual on drug trafficking charges, White violated his plea agreement and the law. White was arrested on July 18, 2005, for possession and possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, clear violations of several conditions of his pretrial release. In addition, White failed to immediately advise authorities of any change in his address or telephone number, and was considered by the probation office to have been an absconder from supervision from June 2005 until August 22, 2005, in further violation of his pretrial release. Finally, he violated his pretrial release conditions because he failed to report to his supervising U.S. Pretrial Services Officer as instructed on two separate occasions. Despite his arrest warrant, White did not turn himself in; he was taken into custody in January 2006 when he was rearrested on another charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>The record reflects that White recognized explicitly in the plea agreement, as well as during his Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 proceeding, that he was subject to a mandatory life sentence for his crime. His plea agreement contained several terms relating to his desire to cooperate with the Government, in exchange for a reduced sentence in the form of a government motion for downward departure for substantial assistance under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 (2006) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) (2000). Specifically, he agreed to cooperate and provide truthful information. He represented that he would \u201cnot violate any federal, state, or local law, or any order of any court, including any conditions of pretrial, pre-sentence, or post-sentence release.\u201d White further represented that he \u201cunderst[ood] that any breach of [the] agreement ... [would] allow the government, <em>in its sole discretion, </em>to withdraw from its obligations under [the] Plea Agreement.\u201d (emphasis added). White also specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>waived his right to attack or appeal the United States\u2019 exercise of its discretion, as well as his right to withdraw his guilty plea. White argues no error with regard to his Rule 11 proceeding and the acceptance of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Following his rearrest, White\u2019s lawyer arranged a meeting with non-federal law enforcement officers to offer potential assistance. White and his attorney assert the officers were receptive. The United States Attorney declined to give White a \u201csecond chance\u201d at avoiding a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">At this juncture, White moved to withdraw his guilty plea on the grounds that he was \u201cunreasonably deprivfed] of his ability to continue providing substantial assistance.\u201d At the hearing, White testified that he had essentially been \u201cset up\u201d by a dealer who became aware that he was cooperating with authorities. He admitted that he had violated his bond, and that he had made a mistake, but again promised to cooperate, claiming to have \u201clearned [his] lesson.\u201d White put on evidence that he had moved in with his father, and did not have a telephone. At the hearing on the motion, White\u2019s attorney reaffirmed that the plea itself was \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d Following the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation to deny the motion to withdraw, White\u2019s counsel subpoenaed the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and the probation office for comprehensive records pertaining to other bond violators, in an effort to establish that the Government\u2019s decision to deny White a second chance at cooperation was irrational. The Government moved to quash the subpoenas.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">The district court conducted a hearing on both the subpoena issue and White\u2019s request for a <em>de novo </em>hearing on his motion to withdraw his plea. Following White\u2019s attorney\u2019s acknowledgment that the records he sought by subpoena were public but that the subpoena would save him money and time in researching the information, the district court granted the Government\u2019s motion to quash. The district court then considered White\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. While White claimed to have found eight instances of disparate treatment in the information he had found relative to bond violators being given a second chance at cooperating to achieve a \u00a7 5K1.1 reduction, he did agree with the district court that the majority of defendants who violate bond are sentenced, as he ultimately was, to their statutorily imposed sentences. White\u2019s position was that any inconsistent treatment among defendants deprived him of his rights and constituted grounds to support the withdrawal of his plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">In denying White\u2019s motion to withdraw, the district court addressed each of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number><em>Moore</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>factors, and found that White\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, that WTite had not credibly asserted his innocence, and expressly adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s uncontested report as to the other factors. The district court found no bad faith, unconstitutional motive, or irrational act by the Government, and determined that WThite indisputably had violated and ignored the procedure for cooperation. White timely appealed from the imposition of the statutorily mandated life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">White first challenges the district court\u2019s finding that the Government did not abuse its discretion in denying White a second opportunity to provide substantial assistance following his violation of the conditions of his bond. He contends both that the Government abused its discretion, and that the district court erred in failing to shift the burden to the Government to demonstrate any rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose in denying White a second opportunity to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">The decision to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion rests solely within the government\u2019s discretion. <em>United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 686 (4th Cir.2001). Therefore, unless the government has obligated itself in a plea agreement to file a substantial assistance motion, its refusal to do so is not renewable unless it was based on an unconstitutional motive such as race or religious animus, or not rationally related to a legitimate government end. <em>Wade v. United States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992); <em>Butler, </em>272 F.3d at 686.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">Here, White\u2019s plea agreement reflects unequivocally that the Government retained sole discretion in the determination of whether to file a \u00a7 5K1.1 motion on White\u2019s behalf, and this discretion included the right not to seek a sentence reduction for White\u2019s failure to cooperate. The Government never relinquished this discretion. The ample evidence of White\u2019s breaches of his agreement as to cooperation, including White\u2019s admissions of his failures, provides a sufficient basis for the Government\u2019s refusal to allow further opportunities for White to cooperate.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">Moreover, we find White\u2019s argument of Governmental irrationality or caprice to be unpersuasive. There is no evidence that the Government acted in bad faith or with an improper motive. The Government simply concluded that White had breached one too many provisions of his agreement. While White asserts that the eight examples allegedly supporting his position are sufficient to establish irrationality, the district court properly held that, even assuming that White\u2019s examples illustrated that eight individuals were treated differently by the Government, his evidence failed to establish irrationality. First, as White stipulated, he was treated just as the majority of violating cooperators in his own examples were treated; that is, that no substantial assistance adjustment was proffered by the government and they were not given further opportunities for cooperation. Second, there is no case law supporting White\u2019s proposition.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Deter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>ring criminal conduct is a rational governmental interest that sufficiently supports the government\u2019s refusal to make a substantial assistance motion. <em>See United States v. Butler, </em>272 F.3d 683, 687 (4th Cir.2001). Moreover, \u201cmere allegations of unconstitutional motive on behalf of the prosecutor are not enough to carry [the defendant\u2019s] burden.\u201d <em>United States v. LeRose, </em>219 F.3d 335, 342 (4th Cir.2000), and White has not provided evidence sufficient to support his claim of governmental irrationality.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We also find to be without merit White\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s action in quashing White\u2019s subpoenas, through which he sought to obtain evidence that the Government\u2019s refusal to allow White a second opportunity to provide substantial assistance was arbitrary. We review for abuse of discretion the denial of requests for discovery. <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>932 F.2d 306, 311 (4th Cir.1991). To require productions, courts have required that subpoenas cover (1) relevant evidentiary materials or documents; (2) that are not otherwise procurable by exercise of due diligence; (3) which the party cannot properly prepare for trial without; and (4) which is not intended as a fishing expedition. <em>United States v. Nixon, </em>418 U.S. 683, 699-700, 94 S.Ct. 3090, 41 L.Ed.2d 1039 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">As the district court recognized in quashing the subpoenas, White stated on more than one occasion that the information he sought was publicly available. He admitted that the purpose of the subpoenas was to save him time and money in retrieving the desired information. Moreover, the record reflects that the offices White subpoenaed did not keep the records he sought in the format in which he sought them, and that they would have had to devote the same financial and man-hour expenditures to compile the information in the same fashion as White would have had to do. Accordingly, White was unable to establish, under the <em>Nixon </em>standards, that the information he sought was not otherwise procurable by exercise of due diligence. <em>Nixon, </em>418 U.S. at 699, 94 S.Ct. 3090. On these facts, we find no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in granting the Government\u2019s motion to quash.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Nor do we find abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in its denial of White\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. <em>See United States v. Ubakanma, </em>215 F.3d 421, 424 (4th Cir.2000). A defendant bears the burden of demonstrating that a \u201cfair and just reason\u201d supports his request to withdraw his plea. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245, 248 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">White received an adequate Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, which creates a strong presumption that his guilty plea was final and binding. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>61 F.3d 1092, 1099 (4th Cir.1995). White argues, however, that despite that his plea was entered into knowingly and voluntarily, the Government\u2019s refusal to allow him a second chance at cooperating somehow vitiates the knowing and voluntary nature of his plea. It does not. Moreover, there is no question that it was completely within the Government\u2019s discretion whether to move for a downward departure, <em>Butler, </em>272 F.3d at 686, and it is clear that White understood the Government\u2019s sole discretion in all issues relating to cooperation and his plea-agreement obligation not to violate the law. White violated numerous terms of both his plea agreement and his pretrial ser<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>vice/bond requirements, violations to which he admits. There is no case law supporting his position that the courts can force the government to provide to a defendant a second chance at cooperating, absent a finding that such refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive such as race or religion, neither of which have been established in this case. Plus, White does not claim he was innocent of the charges on which the plea agreement was based, nor does he claim that he was subject to incompetent counsel during the relevant proceedings. <em>See Moore, </em>931 F.2d at 248. Contrary to White\u2019s claim, the record amply reflects that the district court thoroughly considered White\u2019s claim of unfairness and unjustness, in holding him to his plea. White has not established a fair and just reason to withdraw his guilty plea, and there is no abuse of the district court\u2019s discretion in denying his motion to do so. Finally, we decline White\u2019s invitation to supplement the standard set forth by this court in <em>Moore.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">Accordingly, we affirm White\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-6\">. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>931 F.2d 245 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\">. While White relies on <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>390 F.3d 1003 (7th Cir.2004), the Government in <em>Wilson </em>admitted at sentencing that the defendant cooperated and that his assistance was substantial enough to qualify for a downward departure. Here, in contrast, White cooperated only partially before breaching his obligations, his promises of future helpfulness were self-serving and vague, and the United States Attorney has indicated that his assistance was not substantial. Plus, the defendant in <em>Wilson </em>did not commit a crime while attempting to cooperate, as White did in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">. White\u2019s mere mention of race as a possible issue implicating the \"unconstitutional motive\u201d test, and his contention that his subpoenas could have revealed a disproportionate racial impact, are wholly conclusory and without any evidentiary support.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
