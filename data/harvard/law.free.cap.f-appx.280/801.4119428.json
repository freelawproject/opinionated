Exercising jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, we affirm.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-17\">The EAJA provides, in pertinent part, Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses ... incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b827-20\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A). The question presented in this appeal is whether the district court erred in refusing to order payment of the EAJA fee award directly to Mr. Husband\u2019s attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-21\">On the Commissioner\u2019s motion, we stayed this appeal pending our decision in <em>Manning v. Astrue, </em>510 F.3d 1246 (10th Cir.2007), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>\u2014 U.S.L.W. - (U.S. May 22, 2008) (No. 07-1468). In <em>Manning </em>we held that the EAJA \u201cstatutory language clearly provides that the prevailing party, who incurred the attorney\u2019s fees, and not that party\u2019s attorney, is eligible for an award of attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249-50. We concluded that the legislative history and uncodified portions of the EAJA also supported our interpretation. <em>Id. </em>at 1251-52. And we rejected further arguments to the contrary, based upon an alleged \u201cchilling effect\u201d of our decision on claimants\u2019 attempts to obtain representation and the claimed inconsistency of not awarding EAJA fees to pro se claimants. <em>Id. </em>at 1254, 1253. We acknowledged ordering payment of EAJA fees directly to counsel in <em>Weakley v. Bowen, </em>803 F.2d 575, 580 (10th Cir.1986), but we noted that case did not address whether the claimant or the claimant\u2019s attorney was entitled to recover the fees. <em>Manning, </em>510 F.3d at 1253. Finally, we recognized the Commissioner\u2019s previous practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>of paying EAJA fees directly to claimants\u2019 attorneys, but emphasized that \u201cwe are bound by the statutory language, legislative history, and case law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1255.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-4\">We addressed each of Mr. Husband\u2019s appeal arguments in <em>Manning </em>and our decision in that case is controlling. We therefore conclude that the district court correctly ordered payment of the EAJA fees award to Mr. Husband, rather than to his attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b827-18\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
