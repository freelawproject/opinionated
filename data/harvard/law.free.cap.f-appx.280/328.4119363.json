Smith appeal the district court s order denying relief on their complaint under 42 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1988 (West 2003 &amp; Supp.2007). Appellants, both former deputy sheriffs with the Dorchester County, South Carolina Sheriffs Department, contend that Dorchester County Sheriff Ray Nash and county staff members William French, John Barney Barnes, and Tim Stephenson (collectively \u201cAppellees\u201d) violated their First Amendment rights by engaging in a pattern of harassment and intimidation because Appellants supported Nash\u2019s opponent in the sheriffs election. Applying the two-step framework set forth m <em>Saucier v. Katz, </em>533 U.S. 194, 200,121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), the district court first concluded that Appellants had properly alleged a violation of a constitutional right to be free from harassment based on their support of Sheriff Nash\u2019s opponent in the election but then also concluded that such right was not clearly established at the time of Appellees\u2019 alleged actions.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court granted Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss on the basis of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ALv\">We haTO reviewed, record, the distnd courts thoroufh \u00b0Pmion\u2019 a\u201cd bfard oral ^ <em>^ </em>T\u2019, ^ n\u00b0 f verflb\u00ed error' ^dmgly, we affirm based substantia% on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Thompson v. Dorchester County Sheriffs Dep\u2019t, </em>No. 2:06-cv-00968-DCN (D.S.C. May 4, 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"AEr\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"AGY\">. To be clear, the district court <em>did not </em>find a constitutional violation to the extent that Appellants' claims were predicated on job termination. <em>See Jenkins v. Medford, </em>119 F.3d 1156 (4th Cir.1997) (en banc) (holding that sheriff's patronage dismissals of deputy sheriffs did not violate the First Amendment because deputy sheriffs were policymakers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ATT\">. Appellants also allege a claim based on their right to a \"secret ballot.\u201d As the district court recognized, however, the Supreme Court has never recognized secrecy in voting as a constitutionally-guaranteed right,</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
