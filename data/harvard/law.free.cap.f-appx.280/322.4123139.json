On appeal, Porter and CJC allege that the Agreement is too ambiguous to be enforced and therefore the court erred by granting NLJC\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">In North Carolina covenants not to compete are enforceable. <em>A.E.P. Indus., Inc. v. McClure, </em>808 N.C. 393, 302 S.E.2d 754, 761 (1983); <em>Kennedy v. Kennedy, </em>160 N.C.App. 1, 584 S.E.2d 328, 333-34 (2003). Construing the contract as a whole, <em>State v. Corl, </em>58 N.C.App. 107, 293 S.E.2d 264, 267 (1982), and giving the language at issue its normal and common usage, <em>Mar-coin, Inc. v. McDaniel, </em>70 N.C.App. 498, 320 S.E.2d 892, 897 (1984), we find the district court\u2019s interpretation of the non-compete clause supportable. Thus, we find no abuse of discretion in the district court\u2019s decision to grant the preliminary injunction in light of the likely breach of the Agreement. <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. v. Bradley, </em>756 F.2d 1048, 1055 (4th Cir.1985) (providing review standard for preliminary injunction); <em>see Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., </em>952 F.2d 802, 812-14 (4th Cir.1991) (discussing factors to consider when ruling on motion for preliminary injunction).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Accordingly, we affirm. We grant NLJC\u2019s motion to submit on briefs and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process. We deny as moot NLJC\u2019s motion for summary disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
