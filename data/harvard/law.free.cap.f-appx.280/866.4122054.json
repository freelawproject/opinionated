After Carpenter pled guilty, the district court sentenced him to 180 months\u2019 imprisonment and lifetime supervised release, and imposed, <em>inter alia, </em>the following special terms of supervised release: (1) prior written permission of the court before entering into any self-employment; (2) no unsupervised contact with minors; and (3) no possession of \u201cvisual depictions of minors or adults engaged in sexually explicit conduct.\u201d Carpenter challenges various issues related to his lifetime term of supervised release, and we address them in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-18\">I. LIFETIME SUPERVISED RELEASE</p>\n<p id=\"b893-19\">Carpenter first challenges his lifetime term of supervised release, asserting (1) it violates the Eighth Amendment, (2) it creates an unwarranted sentencing disparity among codefendants, and (3) the district court made no factual findings to support a lifetime term of supervised release. According to the U.S. Code, the district court may impose a term of supervised release for offenses under \u00a7\u00a7 1591 and 2422 of any term of years not less than five, or life. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8583(k). Pursuant to the Guidelines, a life term of supervised release may be imposed for sex offenses, which include <em>inter alia, </em>violations of \u00a7\u00a7 1591 and 2422. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2(b)(2) &amp; comment, (n. 1). The policy statement recommends a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>statutory maximum term of supervised release for sex offense convictions. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Carpenter\u2019s assertion, raised for the first time on appeal, that his life term of supervised release violates the Eighth Amendment is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d 1012, 1018 (11th Cir.2005) (reviewing constitutional objection not raised before the district court for plain error). \u201cWhen neither the Supreme Court nor this Court has resolved an issue ... there can be no plain error in regard to that issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1019. In <em>Moriarty, </em>we rejected the argument, by a defendant who had pled guilty to several child pornography offenses, that a term of lifetime supervised release constituted cruel and unusual punishment. <em>Id. </em>at 1023-25. Because neither this Court nor the Supreme Court have held a life term of supervised release for sex trafficking of a minor or enticing a minor into prostitution violates the Eighth Amendment, and this Court has affirmed a life term of supervised release for a similar sex offenses, Carpenter cannot demonstrate any constitutional error that is plain.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Additionally, Carpenter\u2019s argument his codefendants\u2019 lesser terms of supervised release create sentence disparities is meritless, as Carpenter\u2019s offense conduct, culpability, and convictions were significantly different than those of his codefendants. Carpenter (1) had sex with J.B. and first forced her to work as a prostitute in 2003, when she was 14 years old; (2) recruited J.B., forced her into prostitution, and directly controlled her during the instant offense conduct; and (3) pled guilty to all four counts, including one count with which his codefendants were not charged, one count of which his codefendants were acquitted, and two counts for which the jury found his codefendants did not use force.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">We also reject Carpenter\u2019s contention the lifetime term of supervised release was unreasonable because the district court made no factual findings to support a lifetime term of supervised release. The district court imposed Carpenter\u2019s term of lifetime supervised release after stating it had considered the Guidelines and other \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (explaining a district court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must correctly calculate the sentencing range under the Guidelines and then consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). Because he violated \u00a7\u00a7 1591 and 2422, Carpenter was statutorily eligible for a life term of supervised release. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k). The Guidelines recommend a life term of supervised release, and the policy statement recommends the statutory maximum term, <em>i.e., </em>life, for sex offenses. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2, p.s.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-7\">Additionally, after his term of lifetime supervised release was imposed, rather than requesting the court\u2019s reasoning for imposing a lifetime term of supervised release, Carpenter requested the district court include in his written judgment that supervised release could be revisited depending upon the defendant\u2019s performance while under supervision. The district court did exactly what Carpenter requested, and the Judgment reads: \u201cThe defendant may petition the Court for early termination of supervised release.\u201d Accordingly, Carpenter has not met his burden in demonstrating the life term of supervised release, which was statutorily permissible, recommended by the Guidelines policy statement, imposed after consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and is expressly allowed to be revisited depending on Carpenter\u2019s performance while under supervision, is unreasonable. <em>See Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[T]he party who challenges the sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>tence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">II. SPECIAL CONDITIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">Carpenter next contends the district court failed to make factual findings justifying the: (1) \u201cbroad ban\u201d on sexually explicit materials extending to material involving adults; (2) the ban on unsupervised contact with any minor; and (3) restriction on self-employment. He asserts the \u201cbroad ban\u201d on sexually explicit materials extending to material involving adults violates the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">A district court\u2019s imposition of a special condition of supervised release ordinarily is reviewed for an abuse of discretion, but where, as here, objections were not preserved for appeal, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Zinn, </em>321 F.3d 1084, 1087-88 (11th Cir.2003) (noting objections to sentence of supervised release not clearly stated in the district court are deemed waived, and review is for plain error). The U.S. Code allows the district court to impose any condition of supervised release it deems appropriate, so long as it comports with the factors enumerated in \u00a7 3553(a). 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). The Sentencing Guidelines permit the sentencing court to impose any conditions of supervised release that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-8\">(1) are reasonably related to (A) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (B) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant with ... correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and (2) involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth above and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-11\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(b). While the Guidelines recognize \u201ca condition of supervised release should not unduly restrict a defendant\u2019s liberty, a condition is not invalid simply because it affects a probationer\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights.\u201d <em>Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1089 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-12\">With regard to the ban on possessing sexually explicit materials, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court have held a lifetime condition prohibiting a similarly situated sex offender from possessing any sexually explicit materials is overly broad. Accordingly, the district court did not plainly err in prohibiting Carpenter from possessing sexually explicit materials. <em>See Moriarty, </em>429 F.3d at 1019. Moreover, a special condition of supervised release is not invalid simply because it affects an appellant\u2019s ability to exercise constitutionally protected rights. <em>See Zinn, </em>321 F.3d at 1089.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-13\">Carpenter only challenges the condition prohibiting <em>unswpervised </em>contact with minors, but does not challenge the broader ban on any contact with minors. Accordingly, he has abandoned any objection to the broader condition. <em>See United States v. Ford, </em>270 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2001) (noting issues and contentions not timely raised in briefs are deemed abandoned). To the extent his claim survives, the district court did not commit plain error by imposing the prohibition on unsupervised contact because the condition was reasonably related to the \u00a7 5D1.3(b) factors and involved no greater deprivation of liberty than reasonably necessary to meet the purposes of the factors. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.3(b). Carpenter\u2019s offense conduct involved an intimate relationship with a minor, taking provocative pictures of her, and forcing her into prostitution at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>two different times. Accordingly, prohibiting Carpenter from having unsupervised contact with minors was reasonably related to the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant, the need to afford deterrence, the need to protect the public, and his correctional treatment. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Dl.S(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">Finally, the district court did not commit plain error by requiring Carpenter to obtain the court\u2019s approval before entering into any self-employment, as he has exhibited a pattern of \u201cself employment\u201d consisting of forcing women into prostitution, and he admitted to not having formal employment for at least 20 years prior to the offenses. Moreover, this condition involves no great deprivation of liberty because he may obtain court approval for legitimate self-employment. Accordingly, we affirm Carpenter\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
