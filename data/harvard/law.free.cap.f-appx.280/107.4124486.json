We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, procedural history of the case, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-23\">According to the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, <em>see D.C. Court of Appeals v. Feldman, </em>460 U.S. 462, 103 S.Ct. 1303, 75 L.Ed.2d 206 (1983); <em>Rooker v. Fid. Trust Co., </em>263 U.S. 413, 44 S.Ct. 149, 68 L.Ed. 362 (1923), district courts lack jurisdiction \u201cto review final judgments of a state court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>in judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Feldman, </em>460 U.S. at 482, 108 S.Ct. 1303. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>bar applies when four elements exist:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">First, the federal-court plaintiff must have lost in state court. Second, the plaintiff must \u201ccomplain[] of injuries caused by [a] state-court judgment!.]\u201d Third, the plaintiff must \u201cinvitfe] district court review and rejection of [that] judgment!].\u201d Fourth, the state-court judgment must have been \u201crendered before the district court proceedings commenced\u201d ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><em>Hoblock v. Albany County Bd. of Elections, </em>422 F.3d 77, 85 (2d Cir.2005) (alterations in original) (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005)). Contrary to the district court\u2019s decision in this case, <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>does not apply merely because a federal-court plaintiff\u2019s constitutional claims are \u201cinextricably intertwined\u201d with a state-court decision. To the extent that our cases reflect this standard, <em>see, e.g., Kropelnicki v. Siegel, </em>290 F.3d 118, 128 (2d Cir.2002); <em>Moccio v. N.Y. State Office of Court Admin., </em>95 F.3d 195, 199-200 (2d Cir.1996), they did not survive the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Exxon Mobil. See Hoblock, </em>422 F.3d at 84-85.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">' The present lawsuit meets neither the first requirement set forth in <em>Hoblock </em>nor the second. First, McLamb sought to vacate his 1987 sentence so that, when he was resentenced, he would be able to challenge the validity of his 1975 conviction, which was used to enhance his sentence in connection with his 1990 conviction. He prevailed on his motion to vacate his 1987 sentence and therefore did not lose in state court. That he was resentenced to a longer term of imprisonment and was ultimately unable to challenge his 1975 conviction or his 1990 sentence do not change that determination. Second, a federal-court plaintiff does not complain of injuries \u201ccaused by\u201d a state-court judgment when \u201cthe exact injury of which the party complains in federal court existed <em>prior </em>in time to the state-court proceedings, and so could not have been \u2018caused by\u2019 those proceedings.\u201d <em>McKithen v. Brown, </em>481 F.3d 89, 98 (2d Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 1218, 170 L.Ed.2d 59-(2008). The injuries of which McLamb complains in his \u00a7 1983 suit existed before he sought to vacate his conviction, so they were not .caused by his post-conviction proceeding. The County concedes as much in its brief, stating that McLamb \u201chas no injuries to complain of.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">We recognize that the rules of preclusion may have some applicability to this case, but we.decline to address them here even though the County has argued in its brief that preclusion provides a basis for our affirmance. Because preclusion is an affirmative defense that should be addressed in view of a complete record of the allegedly preclusive proceedings, we leave it for the district court to address this issue should the County choose to interpose an answer and seek summary judgment on the basis of preclusion. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(c)(1) (estoppel and res judicata are affirmative defenses); <em>Exxon Mobil, </em>544 U.S. at 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517 <em>(\u201cRooker-Feldman </em>does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine .... \u201d); <em>id. </em>at 293, 125 S.Ct. 1517 (\u201cPreclusion, of course, is not a jurisdictional matter.\u201d); <em>McKithen, </em>481 F.3d at 104 (\u201c[S]ua sponte application of claim preclusion is \u2018not always desirable.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Scherer v. Equitable Life Assurance Soc\u2019y, </em>347 F.3d 394, 398 n. 4 (2d Cir.2003))). Neither do we address the contention, asserted by the County in its motion to dismiss, that the district court should have abstained under <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), because the County <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>concedes on appeal that the <em>Younger </em>doctrine does not apply. <em>See Brown v. Hotel &amp; Rest. Employees &amp; Bartenders Int\u2019l Union Local 5k, </em>468 U.S. 491, 500 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 3179, 82 L.Ed.2d 373 (1984) <em>(Younger </em>abstention can be waived). Finally, we express no opinion regarding whether McLamb\u2019s complaint states a claim upon which relief can be granted, <em>see </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), or whether McLamb\u2019s claims are cognizable under \u00a7 1983, <em>see McKithen, </em>481 F.3d at 101 (citing <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 481-82, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings in accordance with this Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
