Lamb, denying her application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Zhuhua Li, </em>No. A98 287 515 (B.I.A. Aug. 15, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 287 515 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Jul. 15, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-12\">When the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the decision of the IJ as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). Further, we review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b139-14\">We find no error in the agency\u2019s conclusion that Li failed to provide sufficient evidence to establish her eligibility for relief. As to Li\u2019s family planning claim, the IJ found that \u201c[s]he has not been persecuted in the past and any future persecution is speculative,\u201d inasmuch as she had not demonstrated that she was in violation of the family planning policy or that she would be in the future. We have held that if a petitioner claims that she faces sterilization, but has only one child or no children, such claim may appropriately be considered \u201cspeculative.\u201d <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 128-29 (2d Cir.2005) (holding that, absent solid support in the record for the petitioner\u2019s assertion that he would be subjected to forced sterilization, his fear was \u201cspeculative at best.\u201d) Therefore, the IJ properly found that Li\u2019s claim was \u201cspeculative\u201d where she only had one child. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b139-15\">With respect to Li\u2019s claim that she would be persecuted on account of her illegal departure, the IJ found that Li had only demonstrated that \u201c[s]he may in fact be fined,\u201d and that \u201cfining or having to pay money because of an illegal exit from one\u2019s country is not grounds for political asylum here in the United States.\u201d Because Li points to no evidence in the record that demonstrates that her fear of persecution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>on account of her illegal departure from China is objectively reasonable, the agency\u2019s denial of asylum and withholding of removal on this ground was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 129.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\">With respect to Li\u2019s application for CAT relief, the IJ found that \u201cthere is nothing in the record that would allow [her] to believe that [Li] would be tortured as defined by statue were she to be returned to [] China.\u201d Li argues that the background materials \u201cprovide ample documentation of the horrific conditions in Chinese prisons and detention facilities, and the pervasive use of brutal and often lethal methods of torture.\u201d However, we have expressly held that the agency does not err in finding that a particular petitioner is not \u201centitled to CAT protection based solely on the fact that she is part of the large class of persons who have illegally departed China.\u201d <em>Mu Xiang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>432 F.3d 156, 159-60 (2d Cir.2005). For that reason, we find that the agency\u2019s denial of CAT relief was also proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Finally, the BIA construed Li\u2019s \u201cevidence reflecting that she gave birth to her first child in December 2005\u201d as a motion to remand, but found that such evidence did not demonstrate that her subjective fear was objectively reasonable. We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to remand for abuse of discretion, and a motion to remand that relies on newly available evidence must meet the substantive requirements of a motion to reopen. <em>See Li Yong Cao v. U.S. Dept. Of Justice, </em>421 F.3d 149 (2d Cir.2005). A movant\u2019s failure to establish a prima facie case for the underlying substantive relief sought is a proper ground on which the BIA may deny a motion to reopen. <em>See INS v. Abudu, </em>485 U.S. 94, 104-05, 108 S.Ct. 904, 99 L.Ed.2d 90 (1988). Because Li\u2019s evidence that she has one child does not affect the agency\u2019s determination that her claim is speculative, we find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
