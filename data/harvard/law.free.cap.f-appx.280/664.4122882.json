After she sought reimbursement from Medicare, her insurance carrier audited her to ensure that she had properly billed the work she had done. The auditor, Dr. John G. Rosten, had examined a random sample of her patients and found that Baba had submitted improper billing codes, inadequately maintained records, failed to document the medical necessity of some services, and failed to obtain authorization for optometric services from an attending physician in some cases. He concluded that Baba departed from the standard of care, and that her actions constituted unprofessional conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-20\">Rosten\u2019s report led to concurrent investigations by the California Department of Consumer Affairs, Board of Optometry, and Medicare officials. The Board of Optometry issued an Accusation to Baba, charging her with (1) using \u201ccappers\u201d and \u201csteerers\u201d in violation of Business and Professions Code sections 3090, 3100, and 3103, and (2) obtaining fees by fraud and misrepresentation because she improperly used Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) billing code 99303<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in seeking re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>imbursement for optometric services. The Accusation followed a thorough investigation and report by a Department of Consumer Affairs Senior Investigator. Ultimately, Baba settled the case \u201cfor economic reasons\u201d without admitting any wrongdoing. She suffered penalties but retained her license.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-4\">A Medicare Hearing Officer investigated Baba and found her liable for $47,377.08. The Officer based her report on evidence offered by Baba\u2019s insurance carrier, on Rosten\u2019s report, and on Baba\u2019s hearing testimony. The Officer concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Av9\">the evaluation and management services were not medically necessary and reasonable, and were rendered by Dr. Baba out of the scope of her licensure. Because procedure code 99303 represents comprehensive nursing facility assessment usually performed by an attending physician requiring at least a detailed history, a comprehensive physical examination and medical decision making of high complexity, I concur with the Carrier and [Rosten] that this code is not within the scope of practice of an optometrist to perform, and therefore, not payable by Medicare.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b692-5\">After receiving the Officer\u2019s decision, Baba requested a hearing before an Administrate Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). Baba appeared at the hearing without counsel and was the sole witness. The ALJ listened to her testimony, reviewed her evidence, and later upheld the decision of the Hearing Officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">In her decision, the ALJ explained that Baba had improperly billed her services using the 99303 code, when in fact she had only been performing \u201croutine optometric examinations.\u201d By billing under the 99303 code, Baba \u201cbilled for and received payment for services which she did not perform and was not licensed or medically qualified to perform as an optometrist under California law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b692-9\">Additionally, the ALJ reiterated the California Board of Optometry\u2019s findings that Baba violated certain state laws regarding cappers and steerers, and concluded that \u201cbecause the services in question were performed by the appellant in violation of California law, they are excluded from Medicare coverage under section 1861(r)(4) of the Act and HCFA Regulation 42 CFR 410.23.\u201d Finally, the ALJ found that Baba\u2019s services were excluded from coverage by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(7) and 42 C.F.R. section 411.15(c) because Baba\u2019s consultation notes established that she performed services that were statutorily excluded from payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-10\">Baba\u2019s subsequent appeals were denied by the Medicare Appeals Council and United States District Court for the Northern District of California. She appeals the decision of the district court. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Baba raises a limited number of arguments before this court. She contends:</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">(1) that 99303 was a proper billing code because it \u201cincludes a comprehensive examination by an M.D. or a doctor of optometry\u201d;</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">(2) the confusion surrounding 99303 in 1997 demonstrates that Baba\u2019s position was reasonable, and to force her to pay back the money she billed is an unconstitutional violation of due process;</p>\n<p id=\"b692-14\">(3) if 99303 was improper, the case should be remanded to determine a proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>level of reimbursement because the services were undisputedly rendered;</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">(4) the ALJ erred by relying on Rosten\u2019s report and the investigative report of the Board of Optometry because those reports fail to meet the standard of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.950(e);</p>\n<p id=\"b693-6\">(5) the ALJ conflated Rosten\u2019s legal conclusions regarding 99303 with his factual findings, substituting Rosten\u2019s legal analysis for her own independent efforts.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-7\">Even if we were to assume that 99303 can apply to optometrists\u2019 examinations of nursing home patients, and that Rosten\u2019s report and the Board of Optometry report were somehow improperly admitted, the district court\u2019s decision must be affirmed because of Baba\u2019s failure to challenge a determinative finding by the ALJ. Specifically, Baba does not contest that her own consultation notes establish she was performing services not covered by Medicare.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-8\">Congress has enumerated items and services that are excluded from coverage under Medicare. These exclusions include \u201ceyeglasses ... or eye examinations for the purpose of prescribing, fitting, or changing eyeglasses, [and] procedures performed (during the course of any eye examination) to determine the refractive state of the eyes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395y(a)(7). The ALJ found that Baba\u2019s</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AUf\">notes clearly describe general eye examinations in which the individual\u2019s refractive state is being determined for the purpose of prescribing, fitting or changing eyewear. There is no indication that any new diagnosis is being made or that any specific symptom, complaint or injury is being treated. Although the appellant has contended that the individuals she treated were referred to her by them treating physicians and/or the nursing facilities where they resided, the undersigned emphasizes that these circumstances have no bearing on whether the services provided by the appellant satisfy the relevant criteria for Medicare coverage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">Citing this portion of the ALJ\u2019s decision, the district court declined to remand for reimbursement under a separate billing code because Baba \u201cpresented] no argument that the ALJ\u2019s conclusions are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d On appeal, Baba continues to leave the ALJ\u2019s conclusions unchallenged, and has therefore waived any attack on them. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Marsh, </em>194 F.3d 1045, 1052 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201c[0]n appeal, arguments not raised by a party in its opening brief are deemed waived.\u201d). Because this appears to be an independent ground for denying Baba\u2019s claim, we affirm the rulings of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b691-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b691-15\">.
