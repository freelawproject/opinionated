We affirm the decision of the district court that the Secretary\u2019s determination to deny St. Joseph\u2019s request for an exception to its prospective reimbursement rate was neither arbitrary nor capricious and was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">To qualify for an exception to its prospective payment rate on the ground that it provided atypically intense services, see 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 413.182(a), 413.184(a) (2001), St. Joseph was required, inter alia, to \u201c[sjubmit documentation on costs of nursing personnel ... showing [the][a]mount each employee was paid.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 413.184(b)(2)(i)(A). As St. Joseph conceded at the hearing before the PRRB, and as the PRRB concluded in its final determination, St. Joseph failed to specify in its exception request the amount that each nursing employee was paid in accordance with \u00a7 413.184(b)(2)(i)(A). [SER 17; 30] The PRRB\u2019s decision to deny St. Joseph\u2019s exception request on this ground was supported by substantial evidence, and its refusal to infer or derive the required information from other data submitted by St. Joseph was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <em>See- </em>\u00a7 706(2); 42 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 413.180(f)-(g), (Z), 413.184(b)(2)\u00a9 (2001) (regulations conditioning eligibility for exception request on submission of specified documentation).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-11\">We also reject St. Joseph\u2019s argument that it was deprived of due process because the Secretary failed to provide the necessary notice that St. Joseph\u2019s documentation was faulty. The regulations clearly establish the duty of an applicant for an exception request to provide specific documentary information, including \u201cdocumentation on costs of nursing personnel ... showing ... [the][a]mount each employee was paid,\u201d \u00a7 413.184(b)(2)(i)(A); <em>see also id. </em>\u00a7 413.180(f)-(g), (l). Moreover, St. Joseph does not dispute that the fiscal intermediary in this case recommended that St. Joseph\u2019s exception request be denied because it \u201cfailed to provide a breakdown of what each employee was paid.\u201d [ER 92] Although St. Joseph argues that the fiscal intermediary\u2019s decision was superceded by the decision of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the statute providing for PRRB review of a decision rejecting an exception request provides that the PRRB shall review the \u201cdetermination of the fiscal intermediary.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395oo(d). Moreover, the PRRB may also reach issues that were \u201cnot considered by the intermediary.\u201d <em>Id.;see also Loma Linda Univ. Med. Ctr. v. Leavitt, </em>492 F.3d 1065, 1068 &amp; n. 4, 1071 (9th Cir.2007). Thus, St. Joseph was on notice both that the PRRB review related to the decision of the fiscal intermediary, and that the fiscal intermediary had placed St. Joseph\u2019s failure to provide employee cost information at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-12\">Because this ground is sufficient to uphold the decision of the PRRB, we need <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>not reach the other bases for rejecting St. Joseph\u2019s appeal identified by the district court and the PRRB.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b614-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
