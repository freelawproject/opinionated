HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Defendant-Appellant Knowlington 0. Burbage, a federal prisoner appearing pro se, seeks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) to challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 habeas petition and denial of his motion to amend his petition. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing Mr. Burbage\u2019s filings liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we hold that no reasonable jurist could conclude that the district court erred. Accordingly, we DENY Mr. Burbage\u2019s application for a COA and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">Mr. Burbage was arrested in Albuquerque, New Mexico, when he was found in possession of cocaine on an Amtrak train traveling from Los Angeles to Chicago.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Prior to departing from Los Angeles, Mr. Burbage displayed suspicious behavior consistent with drug trafficking, which prompted Drug Enforcement Agency (\u201cDEA\u201d) agents to board the train in Albuquerque. Once on board, DEA agents noticed a backpack in the overhead compartment near Mr. Burbage\u2019s seat. Mr. Burbage and the other passengers denied ownership of the bag, which was later found to contain cocaine. At the suppression hearing, Mr. Burbage admitted to owning the bag and claimed it was not abandoned when the agents took possession of it. The bag and its contents were ultimately admitted into evidence over Mr. Burbage\u2019s objection. Mr. Burbage was convicted by a jury and sentenced to 130 months in prison. He filed a timely appeal to this court. We upheld Mr. Burbage\u2019s conviction and sentence, specifically rejecting his challenge to the court\u2019s ruling on his motion to suppress. <em>See United States v. Burbage, </em>365 F.3d 1174, 1180 (10th Cir.2004). His request for rehearing en banc was denied, as was his request for a writ for certiorari. <em>Burbage v. United States, </em>543 U.S. 993, 125 S.Ct. 510, 160 L.Ed.2d 381 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">Mr. Burbage filed a timely petition for habeas corpus relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, essentially asserting two claims: (1) that the government\u2019s seizure and subsequent search of his backpack in which the drugs were ultimately found violated the Fourth Amendment because he never abandoned the backpack; and (2) that the prosecutor violated his Fifth Amendment due process rights by knowingly presenting false testimony and inconsistent evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">After the government filed its response, Mr. Burbage filed a motion to amend his habeas corpus petition to \u201chelp and clarify more points,\u201d as well as to address some issues that \u201cmust be raised\u201d in the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>ceeding. R., Doc. 6, at 1 (Motion to Amend, dated Feb. 21, 2006). The district court granted Mr. Burbage leave to amend, and he filed his first amended \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The magistrate judge recommended that the petition be denied and the case dismissed with prejudice because all the claims were procedurally barred. The Fourth Amendment claims could not be raised because Mr. Burbage had received a full and fair opportunity to litigate those claims and they had, in fact, been presented to the Tenth Circuit and rejected. The claims of prosecutorial misconduct should have been raised on direct appeal, and Mr. Burbage could not overcome the procedural bar created by that failure because there was no evidence that actual prejudice or a miscarriage of justice would result from the court\u2019s refusal to consider the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">Mr. Burbage filed no objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations during the ten day period for such filings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a) (\u201cA party may serve and file objections to the order within 10 days after being served with a copy. A party may not assign as error a defect in the order not timely objected to.\u201d). Instead, twenty-six days after the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations were filed, Mr. Burbage filed a document called a \u201cMotion for Leave to Submit Supplemental Amended Petition,\u201d seeking \u201cto raise claims and arguments which have not heretofore been treated by the Court.\u201d R., Doc. 11, at 1 (dated July 24, 2006). His attached affidavit asserted that various disabilities, including lack of resources and litigating from memory, caused him either to fail to raise claims that \u201cshould\u201d have been raised in the initial petition or to \u201cerroneously raise[] issues which are now foreclosed from litigation in my habeas corpus petition.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Affidavit at 3. The only additional claim to which he alluded was an allegation of Sixth Amendment ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The district court denied Mr. Burbage\u2019s motion for leave to amend and adopted the recommendations of the magistrate judge, dismissing the case with prejudice. Mr. Burbage filed a notice of appeal, requesting that the district court issue a COA and grant him leave to proceed on appeal in forma pauperis. The district court denied both requests. On appeal, Mr. Burbage has renewed his request for a COA and for leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We sought and received briefing on whether appellate review had been waived by Mr. Burbage\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-10\">Mr. Burbage\u2019s petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d). Under AEDPA, issuance of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to appealing the dismissal of a habeas petition. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 335-36, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). In order to obtain a COA, Mr. Burbage must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). The Supreme Court has clarified that, where as here the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of the underlying constitutional claims, a petitioner must show that reasonable jurists would find debatable both (1) whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right, and (2) whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling. <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000). The Supreme Court also has instructed courts to resolve the procedural issue first. <em>Id. </em>at 485, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (citing <em>Ashwander v. TVA, </em>297 U.S. 288, 347, 56 S.Ct. 466, 80 L.Ed. 688 (1936)).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>On appeal, Mr. Burbage argues that his second motion to amend was sufficient to avoid waiver of any objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and that the district court erred in denying his second motion to amend his \u00a7 2255 motion. We will first address the issue of whether appellate review has been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-4\">We have adopted a firm waiver rule under which \u201ca party who fails to make a timely objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions.\u201d <em>Morales-Fernandez v. INS, </em>418 F.3d 1116, 1119 (10th Cir.2005). Mr. Burbage argues that he did not fail to timely object because we should construe his second motion to amend as sufficient to preserve his objections, citing <em>Fottler v. United States, </em>73 F.3d 1064 (10th Cir.1996). However, unlike the pleading in <em>Fottler </em>which contained an objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation of dismissal with prejudice, <em>see id. </em>at 1065, Mr. Burbage\u2019s motion to amend contains nothing which could be liberally construed as an objection to any of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations. Instead, Mr. Burbage asserted that he would \u201cconcomitantly excise from any amended petition any claim and/or argument which has previously been litigated and adjudicated before this Court.\u201d R., Doc. 11, at 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-7\">We therefore turn to the two exceptions to the firm waiver rule\u2019s procedural bar and conclude that Mr. Burbage does not qualify under either of them. One applies where the pro se litigant \u201chas not been informed of the time period for objecting and the consequences of failing to object.\u201d <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1119. The magistrate judge here included proper warnings on the first page of the recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">The second exception applies when the \u201cinterests of justice\u201d mandate review. <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1119. In deciding whether review is in the \u201cinterests of justice,\u201d we consider several factors, including \u201ca pro se litigant\u2019s effort to comply, the force and plausibility of the explanation for his failure to comply, and the importance of the issues raised.\u201d Id. at 1120. To meet the standard, it is enough for a petitioner to show that his unobjected-to claim satisfies plain error analysis.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Id. at 1122.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>Initially, we note that <em>Wirsching v. Colorado, </em>360 F.3d 1191 (10th Cir.2004) \u2014 relied upon by Mr. Burbage \u2014 is inapposite. Mr. Burbage does not allege, like the litigant in <em>Wirsching, </em>that he failed to receive the magistrate judge\u2019s report. Moreover, we need not conduct a plain error analysis because Mr. Burbage does not point to any error in the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations that the district court could be deemed to have plainly erred in adopting. Instead, Mr. Burbage suggests only that the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions would have been different if he had added the claim he would have raised in the second amended petition \u2014 namely, ineffective assistance of counsel \u2014 and that his failure to raise that issue was excusable because of the district court\u2019s plain error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In any event, under the factors enumerated in <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>we do not think that Mr. Burbage made sufficient effort to raise the ineffective assistance aspect of his claims before the district court, and we are unpersuaded that any error by the district court creates a plausible explanation for his failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">Therefore, we will apply the waiver rule\u2019s procedural bar to appellate review of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and the district court\u2019s adoption of them. We also note that, even if the bar on appellate review were not applicable, we would conclude that Mr. Burbage has not presented anything that suggests that rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>sonable minds could differ over the propriety of the district court\u2019s rejection of the claims before it. In fact, Mr. Burbage appears to concede that the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations were correct. <em>See </em>Supp. Br. at 16 (stating that objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report \u201cwould have been fruitless as well as frivolous\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">The second issue for which Mr. Burbage seeks a COA is whether the district court erred in denying his second motion to amend his petition. We will assume for purposes of this disposition that this issue is distinct from the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and therefore not controlled by our firm waiver ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">We review the district court\u2019s decision to deny Mr. Burbage\u2019s motion to amend his habeas petition for abuse of discretion. <em>Stafford v. Saffle, </em>34 F.3d 1557, 1560 (10th Cir.1994). The district court \u201cshould freely grant leave to amend when justice so requires, and [w]hen a court refuses leave to amend, it must state its reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotation marks omitted). Applying Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(a), a district court may deny a motion to amend because of \u201cundue delay, bad faith or dilatory motive on the part of the movant, repeated failure to cure deficiencies by amendments previously allowed, undue prejudice to the opposing party by virtue of allowance of the amendment, futility of the amendment, etc.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1560 (quoting <em>Foman v. Davis, </em>371 U.S. 178, 182, 83 S.Ct. 227, 9 L.Ed.2d 222 (1962)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">The district court construed the motion to amend as an \u201cattemptf ] to start over and present an entirely new set of allegations.\u201d R., Doc. 12, at 2. The district court concluded that the reasons Mr. Burbage provided were insufficient grounds for filing a second amended petition \u201cwith entirely new allegations, at this late date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, it noted that Mr. Burbage \u201chas had ample opportunity to present his case to the Court, and he cannot simply raise new claims as they occur to him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We find the district court\u2019s reasons adequate and conclude that it did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">The district court relied in part on the fact that Mr. Burbage appeared to be asserting an entirely new claim. He already had received a previous opportunity to amend his petition. On appeal, Mr. Burbage has intimated that he did not intend for the ineffective assistance of counsel claim to be an independent claim, but rather grounds for overcoming the procedural bars pointed out by the magistrate judge \u2014 asserting that ineffective assistance prevented him from having a full and fair opportunity to litigate his Fourth Amendment claims on direct appeal and that it also constitutes good cause for his failure to present his prosecutorial misconduct claims on direct appeal. <em>See </em>Aplt. Op. Br. at 18-19 (\u201cPetitioner avers he can show that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and thus can show cause why he failed to raise his perjury and inconsistent theories issue on direct appeal. Moreover, due to ineffective assistance of counsel Petitioner was denied a \u2018full and fair\u2019 opportunity to litigate his issues on Direct Appeal.\u201d (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">However, even construing Mr. Burbage\u2019s pro se filings liberally, we cannot see where the district court was ever apprised of such an argument. <em>See </em>R., Doe., 11 at 1 (stating only that the amended petition would \u201cseek to raise claims and arguments which have not heretofore been treated by the Court\u201d); <em>id., </em>Affidavit at 3 (mentioning \u201ca Sixth Amendment claim of ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d as a claim that \u201cshould have [been] raised in my initial petition,\u201d and which, presumably, would be raised in the amended petition). We will review the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion only by looking to the contents of the motion that the court had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>before it, not to the substance of Mr. Burbage\u2019s late-blooming, more nuanced argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">Furthermore, the district court\u2019s second reason for denying the motion is adequate standing alone. The motion to amend was filed nearly a month after the magistrate judge issued his findings and recommendations; three months after Mr. Burbage\u2019s first amended petition was filed, and more than eight months after his \u00a7 2255 action was commenced. The district court reasonably declined to permit amendment \u201cat this late date.\u201d R., Doc. 12, at 2. \u201cWe have often found untimeliness alone a sufficient reason to deny leave to amend, especially when the party filing the motion has no adequate explanation for the delay.\u201d <em>Pallottino v. City of Rio Rancho, </em>31 F.3d 1023, 1027 (10th Cir.1994) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">Moreover, in <em>Viernow v. Euripides Development Corp., </em>157 F.3d 785 (10th Cir.1998), we affirmed denial of a motion for leave to amend where \u201cthe case was essentially over\u201d because the trial judge had orally granted summary judgment to defendants but had not yet entered judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 800. In particular, we stated: \u201c[W]e do not favor permitting a party to attempt to salvage a lost case by untimely suggestion of new theories of recovery, especially after the trial judge has already expressed adverse rulings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">This case is similarly postured to <em>Viernow </em>because Mr. Burbage\u2019s motion came long after the expiration of the time for objections to the magistrate judge\u2019s report. All that remained was for the district court to accept the unobjected-to recommendations and dismiss the case. Mr. Burbage\u2019s explanation for the delay is inadequate. Consequently, no reasonable jurist could find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Mr. Burbage\u2019s motion to file a second amended \u00a7 2255 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Mr. Burbage has failed to show that he can overcome the waiver of appellate review regarding the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations and failed to make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), as to the denial of his motion to amend his petition. Therefore, we DENY his request for a COA, GRANT his request to proceed in forma pauperis, and DISMISS his appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b804-7\"> This Order and Judgement is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-11\">. Because Mr. Burbage is proceeding pro se, we review his pleadings and filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>487 F.3d 808, 815 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b804-12\">. Our factual summary is derived from the facts outlined in the opinion regarding Mr. Burbage\u2019s direct appeal. <em>See United States v. Burbage, </em>365 F.3d 1174, 1176 (10th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b806-5\">. Plain error analysis involves showing: \"(1) an error, (2) that is plain, which means clear or obvious under current law, and (3) that affects substantial rights. If he [the proponent of the error] satisfies these criteria, this Court may exercise discretion to correct the error if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Goode, </em>483 F.3d 676, 681 (10th Cir.2007). In <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>we indicated the plain error inquiry was a component of the \"interests of justice\" analysis, stating: \"At a minimum, [] our \u2018interest of justice' standard for determining whether we should excuse a defendant's failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation <em>includes </em>plain error.\u201d 418 F.3d at 1119 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>(\"In evaluating whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred, we apply the plain error test....\u201d). More recently, although citing <em>Morales-Fernandez, </em>we seemed to suggest in <em>Warded v. Duncan, </em>470 F.3d 954 (10th Cir.2006), that the plain error test forms the basis for a separate exception to the firm waiver rule (i.e., the rule may be avoided if a petitioner establishes plain error, apart from an interest-of-justice showing). In <em>Wardell, </em>we commented: \u201cThe waiver rule may be suspended when the 'interests of justice' warrant, <em>or </em>when the aggrieved party makes the onerous showing required to demonstrate plain error.\" <em>Id. </em>at 958 (emphasis added and citations omitted) (citing, <em>inter alia, Morales-Fernandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1120.). We need not endeavor, however, to determine whether these two cases in fact contemplate different roles for plain error review in the assessment of whether to suspend the firm waiver rule. If they were in conflict, we ordinarily would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>be obliged to follow the earlier decision\u2014 <em>Morales-Fernandez. See, e.g., King of the Mountain Sports, Inc. v. Chrysler Corp., </em>185 F.3d 1084, 1089 n. 1 (10th Cir.1999). But the conflict inquiry is unnecessary because (as noted in the text infra) Mr. Burbage did not make any germane allegations of plain error. Therefore, no plain error analysis is appropriate.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b807-6\">. Mr. Burbage asserts that the reason he failed to initially argue ineffective assistance of counsel was that a statement by the district court made him think that it was futile. While the complete trial transcript is not included in the record, an excerpt shows that the district court told the jury after it voted to convict him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-7\">What he's going to do next, he will appeal whatever I do, and I\u2019ll get affirmed on that. It\u2019s pretty much out of the question that I was going to get reversed. But then what he will do, he will raise ineffective assistance of counsel, and the circuit won't pay any attention to that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-8\">When I sentence him, I'm going to make a statement that [Mr. Burbage\u2019s counsel] represented him as best as he possibly could and there is no ineffective assistance of counsel whatsoever. I don\u2019t know whether the circuit will pay any attention to me or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b807-9\">But the next thing he will do, when he gets to the penitentiary, is file what is called a 2255, where he is going to say all of these errors were committed by me and Mr. Lopez. And that\u2019s not going to do any good either.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b807-13\">Supp. Br., Ex. D (Trial Tr. at 223-24). The district court\u2019s post-trial comments, while undeniably imprudent, do not excuse defendant\u2019s delay in following the procedural requirements for \u00a7 2255 petitions. The district court's comments highlighted its apparent predisposition against granting Mr. Burbage any form of \u00a7 2255 relief based upon its belief in the error-free nature of his trial and the quality of his representation. However, the comments in no way precluded Mr. Burbage from filing a \u00a7 2255 petition or from raising his ineffective assistance of counsel claims in his original or amended \u00a7 2255 petitions. In fact, it is telling that the comments did not deter Mr. Burbage in the first instance from filing a \u00a7 2255 petition. It stands to reason that if he believed the district court would have refused to grant him \u00a7 2255 relief, Mr. Burbage should have sought recusal or should have raised <em>all </em>of his claims at the first opportunity and then filed an immediate appeal. Indeed, by his own description, Mr. Burbage is a \"a fairly tenacious pro se litigant.\u201d Supp. Br. at 11 (quotation marks and alterations omitted). Mr. Burbage's observations in his supplemental jurisdictional briefing suggest the inexcusability of his delay, agreeing that he \u201cfloundered about, ignorantly opting to revisit issues already decided against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 16.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
