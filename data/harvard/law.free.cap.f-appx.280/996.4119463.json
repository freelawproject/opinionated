Harrison appeals an initial decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d), <em>Harrison v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DC844E070720-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Oct.2, 2007), which became final after the Board denied Ms. Harrison\u2019s petition for review, <em>Harrison v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>No. DC844E070720-I-1, 108 M.S.P.R. 184 (M.S.P.B. Jan.29, 2008). Because we perceive no error \u201cgoing to the heart of the administrative process,\u201d <em>Lindahl v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>470 U.S. 768, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>791, 105 S.Ct. 1620, 84 L.Ed.2d 674 (1985), we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1023-5\">Ms. Harrison was employed by the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d) as a Mail Handler. In April 2006, she filed an application for disability retirement benefits with the Office of Personnel Management (\u201cOPM\u201d). After reviewing the application and the evidence Ms. Harrison submitted in support, OPM disallowed Ms. Harrison\u2019s application because it found \u201cno medical basis for any claimed inability to regularly attend work and perform [her] duties.\u201d After OPM rejected Ms. Harrison\u2019s motion for reconsideration, she appealed to the Board. In an initial decision, the administrative judge affirmed OPM\u2019s decision, finding that Ms. Harrison presented insufficient medical evidence to establish that she is entitled to disability retirement benefits. Ms. Harrison then petitioned for review of the initial decision. The Board, finding no significant new evidence or error in interpreting a law or regulation, denied Ms. Harrison\u2019s petition and made the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision the final decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-6\">Our jurisdiction to review a final decision by the Board is limited by statute\u2014 we must affirm that decision unless it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Our scope of review is even more limited in cases involving a decision concerning disability retirement under the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System. In this case, therefore, we do not revisit any of the factual questions related to Ms. Harrison\u2019s medical situation. Rather, we review the record to determine \u201cwhether there has been a substantial departure from important procedural rights, a misconstruction of the governing legislation, or some like error going to the heart of the administrative process.\u201d <em>Gooden v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>471 F.3d 1275, 1278 (Fed.Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-8\">In her petition for review, Ms. Harrison does not allege any violation of her procedural rights, misconstruction of legislation, or like error. In fact, Ms. Harrison declines to provide any reason why she believes the Board erred. Instead, she simply states that she wants this court to \u201c[a]pprove of [disability [r]etirement.\u201d We lack jurisdiction to give Ms. Harrison this relief and are even \u201cwithout authority to review the substantive merits of disability determinations, or the factual underpinnings of such determinations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Lindahl, </em>470 U.S. at 791, 105 S.Ct. 1620).</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-9\">Moreover, our own review of the record reveals no departure from procedural rights, misconstruction of governing legislation, or like error going to the heart of the administrative determination. Accordingly, as we perceive no error within our scope of review, we must affirm the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-10\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b1023-11\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
