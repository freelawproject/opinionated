We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-14\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Goldblatt\u2019s claim in this receivership action brought by the City of Kansas City, Missouri (City), against Housing &amp; Economic Development Financial Corporation (HEDFC). On appeal, Goldblatt challenges the district court\u2019s factual findings, credibility determinations, and application of Missouri law to his allegations that HEDFC tortiously interfered with his contractual relationship with a third party mortgagee of HEDFC.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-15\">Without a transcript of the hearing, we cannot review the district court\u2019s factual findings or any issues involving witness credibility or evidentiary rulings. <em>See Van Treese v. Blome, </em>7 F.3d 729, 729 (8th Cir.1993) (per curiam); <em>Schmid v. United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Am., </em>827 F.2d 384, 385-86 (8th Cir.1987) (per curiam). Accepting as true the district court\u2019s factual findings, we conclude the court did not err in determining that Goldblatt failed to establish a tortious-interference claim under Missouri law. <em>See Bockelman v. MCI Worldcom, Inc., </em>403 F.3d 528, 531 (8th Cir.2005) (de novo review of district court\u2019s interpretation of state law); <em>Healthcare Servs. of the Ozarks, Inc. v. Copeland, </em>198 S.W.3d 604, 614 (Mo.2006) (elements of tortious interference under Missouri law).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-20\">Accordingly, we affirm the final order of the district court denying Goldblatt\u2019s claim, and we decline to address Goldblatt\u2019s new claims on appeal, <em>see Poolman v. City of Grafton, </em>487 F.3d 1098, 1101 (8th Cir.2007) (declining to consider claim raised for first time on appeal).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b588-16\">. The Honorable Gary A. Fenner, United States District Judge for the Western District of Missouri, adopting the report and recommendations of the Honorable John T. Maughmer, United States Magistrate Judge for the Western District of Missouri.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
