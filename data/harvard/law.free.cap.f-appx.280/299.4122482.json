He seeks an order from this court directing the district court to act. Our review of the district court docket sheet reveals that Brown has since been provided with new counsel. Accordingly, because the district court has provided Brown with the relief requested in his coram nobis petition, we deny the mandamus petition as moot. We grant leave to proceed in forma pauperis. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
