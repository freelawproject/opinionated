On appeal, he argues that: (1) there was an insufficient factual basis to sustain his guilty plea and he did not sufficiently understand the knowledge element of the offense when pleading guilty; (2) the district court plainly erred at the plea colloquy by comparing the sentence he would receive if he went to trial with the sentence he would receive if he pled guilty; and (3) his 180-month sentence, imposed as the mandatory statutory minimum, constituted cruel and unusual punishment, in violation of the Eighth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>Amendment. After thorough review, we vacate and remand as to Issue (2), and therefore, need not address McCray\u2019s alternative arguments attacking his guilty plea or his argument that his sentence violated the Eighth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-4\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1) provides, in part, that \u201c[a]n attorney for the government and the defendant\u2019s attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may discuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions.\u201d Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(c)(1). \u201cThe primary concern of those who would dissociate the judge from the plea bargaining process has been that judicial intervention may coerce the defendant into an involuntary plea that he would not otherwise enter.\u201d <em>United States v. Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d 1132, 1134 (11th Cir.1993). We have interpreted Rule 11(c)(1) \u201cas a bright line rule prohibiting the participation of the judge in plea negotiations under any circumstances: it is a rule that, as we have noted, admits of no exceptions.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>89 F.3d 778, 783 (11th Cir.1996) (quotations and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b972-5\">McCray did not object to this Rule 11 issue at the plea hearing, and thus, we review the issue for plain error. <em>United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002); <em>United States v. Monroe, </em>353 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2003). Instead of conducting the normal four-prong plain-error analysis, however, we have stated that \u201c[jjudieial participation [in plea negotiations] is plain error, and the defendant need not show actual prejudice.\u201d <em>Corbitt, </em>996 F.2d at 1135.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">In <em>United States v. Casallas, </em>59 F.3d 1173, 1178 (11th Cir.1995), we held that the prohibition on judicial participation in plea negotiations had been violated and remanded the case to allow the defendant to withdraw his guilty plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">As Casallas stood before the district court ready to return to Texas for trial, the district court judge contrasted the fifteen-year minimum mandatory that Casallas faced by going to trial in Texas with the ten-year minimum mandatory that Casallas faced by pleading to the conspiracy count. The judge stated: \u201cif he pleads this afternoon he would get a minimum mandatory of ten, apparently which is a lot better than fifteen.\u201d The judge followed this statement with additional advice that Casallas \u201ctalk to his lawyer some and see if that is really what he wants to do.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 1177 (alteration omitted). Although we stated that the court\u2019s comments were \u201cintended only to insure that Casallas was making an informed decision,\u201d we concluded that the statements \u201cnonetheless crossed the line into the realm of participation\u201d and required reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 1177-78. In <em>Corbitt, </em>we held that there was a violation of the prohibition on judicial participation in plea negotiations where the court gave the defendants until the following day to file plea agreements, and told them that if they went to trial and were convicted, they would receive a \u201cfair sentence, fairly high.\u201d 996 F.2d at 1133-35. We have subsequently stated that <em>\u201cCasallas </em>and <em>Corbitt </em>indicate that discussion of the penal consequences of a guilty plea as compared to going to trial is inherently coercive, no matter how well-intentioned.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 783.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-9\">In this case, as in <em>Casallas, </em>the district court compared \u201cthe penal consequences of a guilty plea as compared to going to trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court repeatedly explained to McCray that the low-end of his applicable guideline range would be 210 months\u2019 imprisonment if he proceeded to trial, which would require the court to conduct a downward variance in order for him to receive the statutory minimum sentence, but that, if he pled guilty, no such variance <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>would be required for him to receive the statutory minimum. Furthermore, as in <em>Casallas, </em>McCray\u2019s ultimate decision to plead guilty \u2014 after he had previously indicated an intent to proceed to trial \u2014 came on the heels of the court\u2019s participatory comments regarding the higher sentence he might receive if he went to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">Thus, although we recognize that the district court was merely attempting to ensure that McCray understood the consequences of his guilty plea, reversal is required. <em>Johnson, </em>89 F.3d at 783; <em>Casallas, </em>59 F.3d at 1177-78. We therefore conclude that the district court impermissibly participated in plea negotiations by repeatedly comparing the higher sentence that McCray would likely receive if he went to trial with the sentence that he would otherwise receive if he pled guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">Accordingly, we vacate McCray\u2019s guilty plea and remand to the district court to allow him to re-plead or proceed to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-7\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
