We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">This case arises out of a verbal altercation between the appellant, Robert N. McIntosh (\u201cMcIntosh\u201d), a medical technician at a Department Hospital, and a patient whose hospital room he entered to take the patient\u2019s vital signs. The Department credited the patient\u2019s version of what happened, and removed McIntosh for \u201cpatient abuse and using intimidating language towards a patient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-21\">After a hearing, the Board\u2019s administrative judge affirmed the removal in her initial decision, which became final when the Board refused to review it. We affirm that decision, primarily for the reasons given in that opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-22\">The administrative judge stated that the issue was \u201cone of credibility.\u201d There was a sharp disagreement among the witnesses over what happened. The patient described improper and threatening statements McIntosh allegedly made to him. The patient\u2019s teenage brother, who was present in the room, corroborated the patient\u2019s testimony. McIntosh denied making the statements attributed to him and gave a quite different version of what happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-23\">The administrative judge determined that the patient\u2019s version of the events was \u201cmore credible than the appellant\u2019s based on the inherent improbability of the appellant\u2019s version, [the patient\u2019s] lack of motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"991\">*991</page-number>to invent the complaint, [the patient\u2019s] version painting himself in an unflattering light, and [the patient\u2019s] version having been corroborated by his brother who was present at the scene.\u201d We have no reason to reject that credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">We also affirm the administrative judge\u2019s sustaining of the penalty of removal as reasonable. After reviewing the relevant Douglas factors, <em>Douglas v. Veterans Administration, </em>5 MSPB 313, 5 M.S.P.R. 280, 305-06 (1981), she found that McIntosh\u2019s \u201cbrief tenure and the seriousness of his offense in connection with his position outweigh[ed] the mitigating circumstances [ (provocation) ] surrounding this event.\u201d She, therefore, properly concluded that the agency did not abuse its discretion in removing McIntosh.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">We have considered McIntosh\u2019s other contentions, but deem them unpersuasive. The decision of the Board affirming McIntosh\u2019s removal is</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
