California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Lunares has not filed a response. Our independent review of the record and counsel\u2019s brief discloses no nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The record does reveal a clerical error in the judgment. The judgment reflects the offense of conviction for Count 1 of the indictment as importing 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. However, Lunares was charged in Count 1 of the indictment and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, violations of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1), and (b)(l)(B)(vii).</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Accordingly, counsel\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities herein, and the APPEAL IS DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2. This matter is REMANDED for correction of the clerical error pursuant to Fed.R.CrimP. 36.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b450-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
