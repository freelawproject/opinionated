On October 27, 2005, the District Court ordered him to, within thirty days, set forth in writing any reasons why his \u00a7 2255 motion should not be dismissed as untimely. Taveras filed a motion for an extension on December 2, 2005. On January 4, 2008, when over two years had passed without any action in his case, Taveras filed the present petition for writ of mandamus seeking to compel the District Court to rule upon his \u00a7 2255 motion and his motion for an extension.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-13\">By order entered April 7, 2008, the District Court dismissed Taveras\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion as untimely and denied his motion for an extension. Because Taveras has now received the relief he sought in filing his mandamus petition \u2014 namely, a ruling on his pending motions \u2014 we will deny the petition as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
