Rauch appeals the final decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) that affirmed the December 14, 2004 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying Mr. Rauch\u2019s claim to service connection for respiratory disease. <em>Rauch v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-816, 2007 WL 716106 (Vet.App. Feb. 22, 2007). We <em>dismiss </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b975-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-24\">The relevant facts are set forth in the decisions of the Board and Veterans Court. Briefly, Mr. Rauch served on active duty in the United States Army from November of 1971 to April of 1972, and from November of 1990 to May of 1991. In December of 1997, Mr. Rauch filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) seeking service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease allegedly caused by exposure to toxins diming the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>First Gulf War. In October of 1998, a VA regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) denied service connection for chronic obstructive pulmonary-disease on the ground that the diagnosis was too far removed from service. Mr. Rauch appealed the decision, and in October of 2002, the Board remanded the case to the RO for further development. Eventually, the RO again denied service connection. It did so largely on the basis of the opinion of Dr. C. Paul Loehnen, a private physician to whom the RO had referred Mr. Rauch\u2019s case. Dr. Loehnen opined that Mr. Rauch\u2019s \u201cdifficulties\u201d were \u201cin large part secondary to his morbid obesity\u201d and commented that he did not find \u201canything in the record that would lead [him] to conclude [that] there is a service-related disability regarding [Mr. Rauch\u2019s] pulmonary status.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">Mr. Rauch again appealed to the Board, which this time denied his claim. Reviewing the evidence before it, the Board credited the opinion of Dr. Loehnen over that of another doctor who had examined Mr. Rauch. The Board noted that Dr. Loehnen had explained that exposure to toxins would typically lead to acute problems during service and that Mr. Rauch\u2019s records reflected no lung problems during his time in service.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">Following the Board\u2019s decision, Mr. Rauch appealed to the Veterans Court. As noted above, the court affirmed the Board\u2019s denial of Mr. Rauch\u2019s claim. In its decision the court rejected the two contentions raised by Mr. Rauch on appeal. The first contention was that the VA\u2019s further development of the claim (asking Dr. Loehnen for an opinion) was improper in view of the fact that a 1998 VA medical examination by Dr. Rick A. Lamb reflected a diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and noted that Mr. Rauch had been \u201cin an area of Saudi Arabia that was dense with oil smoke after oil fires were lit in Kuwait.\u201d According to Mr. Rauch, under these circumstances, the further development of the claim was improper because it was for the purpose of obtaining evidence to deny the claim. Mr. Rauch\u2019s second contention was that RO personnel \u201cwere biased against [his] claim in violation of due process of law.\u201d In Mr. Rauch\u2019s view, this was evidenced by the fact that information that tended to detract from a finding of service connection was presented to Dr. Loehnen and that communications at the RO unduly \u201csuggested] an answer or limit[ed] the field of inquiry by the expert\u201d (Dr. Loehnen). The Veterans Court rejected both contentions. As far as the issue of further development of Mr. Rauch\u2019s claim was concerned, the court determined, the VA had discretion to develop additional evidence because of the conflicting and unclear nature of the evidence before the VA on the issue of service connection. Addressing Mr. Rauch\u2019s claim of bias, the court stated that it did not agree that the RO documents presented to Dr. Loehnen suggested a predetermined answer with respect to Mr. Rauch\u2019s claim. In addition, the court noted that Mr. Rauch did not challenge the accuracy of the information that was given to Dr. Loehnen. The court also noted that the questions which were posed to Dr. Loehnen were asked in an unbiased fashion. Following the Veterans Court\u2019s decision, Mr. Rauch timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">Our authority to review decisions of the Veterans Court is governed by statute. Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), we have \u201cexclusive jurisdiction to review and decide any challenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof brought under [that] section, and to interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d However, \u201c[e]xcept to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>the extent that an appeal under ... chapter [72] presents a constitutional issue, [we] may not review (A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d) (2) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On appeal, as he did before the Veterans Court, Mr. Rauch contends that personnel at the RO were biased against his claim. He argues that we have jurisdiction over his appeal because, by making this argument, he is asserting a free-standing constitutional claim based upon a violation of due process. <em>See In re Bailey, </em>182 F.3d 860, 865 (Fed.Cir.1999) (establishing this court\u2019s jurisdiction over free-standing constitutional issues in appeals from the Veterans Court). While it is true that we have held that we have jurisdiction over free-standing constitutional claims, <em>see id., </em>Mr. Rauch has not asserted such a claim. Rather, in the face of factual determinations that he does not challenge and that demonstrate the absence of impropriety on the part of the individuals involved, Mr. Rauch simply makes bald, unsupported assertions of bias on the part of the RO. Such assertions are insufficient to make out a true constitutional claim. Thus, Mr. Rauch has not presented a claim within our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we must dismiss Mr. Rauch\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
