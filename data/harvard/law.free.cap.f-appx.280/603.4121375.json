The facts and prior proceedings are known to the parties and are repeated herein only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-21\">We reject Fernandez\u2019s argument that the government\u2019s wiretap applications failed to demonstrate the necessity of the requested surveillance. <em>See United States </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number><em>v. Decoud, </em>456 F.3d 996, 1006 (9th Cir.2006). Fernandez fails to point to any portion of the applications that constitute \u201cgeneralized statements that would be true of any narcotics investigation,\u201d <em>United States v. Blackmon, </em>273 F.3d 1204, 1208 (9th Cir.2001), nor does he cite to any portion of the record supporting his assertion that any confidential sources were available to the government when it filed the wiretap applications. Moreover, while the government did not inform the district court of its belief that a target suspect had adopted a new alias, such omission was immaterial because its inclusion would serve only to <em>bolster </em>the applications; the district court separately found probable . cause supporting the government\u2019s targeting of the suspect under both names. <em>See United States v. Canales Gomez, </em>358 F.3d 1221, 1225 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">Fernandez\u2019s contention that the investigation had already \u201cproduced seizures\u201d nullifying the need for further wiretap surveillance also is unvailing. <em>See id. </em>(\u201c[T]he mere attainment of some degree of success during law enforcement\u2019s use of traditional investigative methods does not alone serve to extinguish the need for a wiretap.\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>219 F.3d 1117, 1122 (9th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Lastly, as Fernandez concedes, the wiretap order properly authorized the targeting of \u201cothers unknown.\u201d <em>See United States v. Kahn, </em>415 U.S. 143, 151, 94 S.Ct. 977, 39 L.Ed.2d 225 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">Accordingly, Fernandez\u2019s conviction is</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b630-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b631-10\">. In a concurrently filed opinion, we address Fernandez\u2019s other arguments concerning his conviction and sentence. <em>See U.S. </em>v. <em>Fernandez, </em>526 F.3d 1247 (9 Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
