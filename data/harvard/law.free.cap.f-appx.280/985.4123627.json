Johnson appeals the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, which affirmed the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision dismissing her claims that prior board decisions dated November 1982, February 1986, and December 1986 should be revised due to clear and unmistakable error. <em>Johnson v. Mansfield, </em>No. 06-1947 (Vet. App. Nov. 28, 2007). Johnson disagrees with how factual evidence related to the onset of her deceased husband\u2019s multiple sclerosis was weighed by the Veterans Court and the board. Because we lack authority to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d absent a constitutional issue, 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2), we <em>dismiss </em>the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
