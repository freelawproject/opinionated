The Honorable J.

S. en C., <em>et al. </em>(collectively \u201cplaintiffs\u201d) appeal from a February 28, 2007 decision and order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Rakoff, <em>J.) </em>granting defendants-appellees\u2019 (\u201cdefendants\u201d) motion for summary judgment and dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 claims brought under SEC Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5, and Section 18(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78r(a). The district court found that plaintiffs\u2019 claims were barred by the Colombian Arbitration Tribunal\u2019s May 16, 2006 Award. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">On appeal, plaintiffs argue that although they \u201cclearly raised [the] 1934 Act Claims\u201d before the Tribunal, \u201cthe Panel refused to address them,\u201d thereby violating the \u201cduties\u201d imposed on foreign arbitral panels by <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., </em>473 U.S. 614, 636-37, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985). Plaintiffs insist that defendants\u2019 \u201ccontention that the controlling factor for <em>res judicata </em>is whether the claims \u201cwere raised, or could have been raised\u2019 (Def. Brief at 13) fails to take into account that \u2018raised\u2019 or \u2018could have been raised\u2019 is logically premised on the capability and willingness of the Panel to determine the claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-16\">\u201cIt is well settled that <em>[res judicata] </em>serves to bar certain claims in federal court based on the binding effect of past determinations in arbitral proceedings.\u201d <em>Pike v. Freeman, </em>266 F.3d 78, 90 (2d Cir.2001). \u201cTo prove that a claim is precluded\u201d under the doctrine of <em>res judicata, </em>\u201ca party must show that (1) the previous action involved an adjudication on the merits; (2) the previous action involved the [parties] or those in privity with them; [and] (3) the claims asserted in the subsequent action were, or could have been, raised in the prior action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 91 (citation omitted) (alterations in original); <em>accord Federated Dep\u2019t Stores, Inc. v. Moitie, </em>452 U.S. 394, 398, 101 S.Ct. 2424, 69 L.Ed.2d 103 (1981). \u201cEven claims based upon different legal theories are barred provided they arise from the same transaction or occurrence.\u201d <em>Cieszkowska v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number><em>Gray Line New York, </em>295 F.3d 204, 205 (2d Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Courts give preclusive effect to arbitral awards that fail to provide the reasoning underlying the decision. <em>See Boguslavsky v. Kaplan, </em>159 F.3d 715, 718-22 (2d Cir.1998) (observing that the \u201cpanel did not explain its decision\u201d but holding that plaintiffs\u2019 federal securities claims were barred in part by the collateral estoppel effect of the award).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">The Colombian Tribunal, after an extensive discussion of the facts underlying the dispute, deemed itself \u201ccompetent to hear and resolve the claims\u201d before it. As noted by the district court, \u201c[n]either party objected to the tribunal\u2019s competence to hear and decide all of plaintiffs\u2019 claims\u201d and \u201cthe tribunal decided all of the claims listed in the Demand\u201d \u201c[o]n the merits.\u201d <em>Bancol Y CIA. S. En C. v. Bancolombia S.A., </em>No. 99 Civ. 2216, 2007 WL 640654, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 1, 2007). Importantly, the Tribunal rejected the factual predicate for plaintiffs\u2019 1934 Act Claims, specifically finding that (1) Bancolombia had not manipulated the price of ADRs on the New York Stock Exchange; (2) the failure to raise $150 million in new equity was neither a breach of the parties\u2019 agreement nor fraudulent or willful misconduct; and (3) defendants did not engage in transactions or conduct in violation of Colombian law and sound banking practices. <em>Id. </em>After plaintiffs requested that the Tribunal supplement the Award to address plaintiffs\u2019 1934 Act claims, the Tribunal responded that \u201call the claims were studied and decided upon with maximum care and discipline by the Tribunal. This is reflected not only in the methodical form in which the claims in the complaint were presented, but also in the detailed analysis of them.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at *5. The parties do not dispute that the Award constituted an adjudication on the merits or that the instant case involves the same parties as the arbitration. And, as outlined above, the undisputed facts show that plaintiffs\u2019 1934 Act claims were, in fact, raised in the arbitration. Thus, the district court properly found plaintiffs\u2019 claims to be barred by <em>res judicata. See Pike, </em>266 F.3d at 91.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">Plaintiffs\u2019 argument that the Tribunal violated its <em>Mitsubishi </em>\u201cduties\u201d is merit-less. At issue in <em>Mitsubishi </em>was \u201cwhether an American court should enforce an agreement to resolve antitrust claims by arbitration when that agreement arises from an international transaction.\u201d 473 U.S. at 624, 105 S.Ct. 3346. The Court found that the agreement should be enforced because \u201cthe tribunal ... [is] bound to decide [the] dispute in accord with the national law giving rise to the claim. And so long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 636-37, 105 S.Ct. 3346 (internal citation omitted). Although <em>Mitsubishi </em>certainly supports the premise that an international Tribunal should decide the disputes before it in accordance with the law to which the parties have agreed, the Court did not impose any \u201cduty\u201d on international tribunals, let alone a duty to fully explain each legal \u201cbasis\u201d upon which its decision relied.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b113-6\">. Plaintiffs argue that, in denying their request, the Tribunal engaged in \"word play\u201d by referring to the Colombian law concept of \"claims\u201d (the relief requested), as opposed to the Colombian law concept of \"grounds\u201d (the legal theory or statutory basis for the relief requested). We note that, under federal <em>res judicata </em>principles, preclusion is not dictated by the particular \"legal theory\u201d or \"ground\u201d that a party chooses to invoke (or not to invoke) in support of its claims, but rather by the factual predicate, or \"transaction,\u201d giving rise to the claim. <em>See Cieszkowska, </em>295 F.3d at 205. The Tribunal's response does nothing to alter the undisputed fact that plaintiffs\u2019 U.S. law claims were raised before the Tribunal. In addition, the fact that each of plaintiffs' \"claims\u201d received a specific and detailed response from the Tribunal further undermines their position: plaintiffs chose to plead a \u201cgeneral\u201d fraud claim that made no reference to plaintiffs' U.S. theories or the underlying U.S. statutes, which were relegated to an unsorted list of \"Legal Basis.\u201d Thus, any alleged deficiency in the Tribunal's explication of plaintiffs\u2019 U.S. law claims is the result of plaintiffs\u2019 tactical choices before the Tribunal, not a lack of \"capability or willingness\" by the Tribunal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
