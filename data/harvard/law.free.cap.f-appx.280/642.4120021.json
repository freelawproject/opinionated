R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b669-6\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Sarabjit Singh, a native and citizen of India, petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (\u201cBIA\u201d) order dismissing his appeal from an Immigration Judge\u2019s (\u201cIJ\u201d) decision denying Singh\u2019s applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence the IJ\u2019s and BIA\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s claims on the basis of an adverse credibility finding, and we grant the petition for review, and remand. <em>See Malhi v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 989, 992 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. The IJ and BIA failed to adequately consider whether Singh, who had previously found been credible during an asylum interview, suffered from translation difficulties during his merits hearing. <em>See He v. Ashcroft, </em>328 F.3d 593, 598 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cEven where there is no due process violation, faulty or unreliable translations can undermine the evidence on which an adverse credibility determination is based\u201d); <em>see also Turcios v. INS, </em>821 F.2d 1396, 1400 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Paredes-Urrestarazu v. INS, </em>36 F.3d 801, 818 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">In addition, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum on a discretionary basis is not supported by substantial evidence. The IJ failed to consider positive equities that weighed in Singh\u2019s favor. <em>See Kalubi v. Ashcroft, </em>364 F.3d 1134, 1140 (9th Cir.2004) (requiring that the IJ consider both positive and negative equities in making this determination.).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-12\">Furthermore, the BIA failed to conduct an individualized analysis of country conditions as to Singh\u2019s CAT claim. <em>See Nuru v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 1207, 1217-18 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-13\">Accordingly, we grant the petition, and remand to the agency for further consideration consistent with these proceedings. <em>See INS v. Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED, REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b669-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
