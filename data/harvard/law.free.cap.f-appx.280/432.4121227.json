The district court instead sentenced Nazerzadeh to the statutory minimum of five years, as well as a lifetime term of supervised release. The government appealed that sentence, and we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-19\">As the government acknowledged at oral argument, appeals of this kind are likely to be rare in the light of recent Supreme Court jurisprudence, particularly <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">Under <em>Gall, </em>we first evaluate the sentence imposed by the district court for procedural error and then for substantive reasonableness. 128 S.Ct. at 596-97. Here, there was no procedural error: the district court properly calculated the Guidelines range and gave reasons for its downward departure from that range in a sentencing colloquy and an accompanying statement of reasons. Though both are somewhat limited in their actual exposition of the district court\u2019s reasoning, they do provide sufficient basis for review of the district court\u2019s sentencing. <em>See id. </em>at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-24\">We review a sentence for reasonableness under a deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 598. The district court\u2019s sentence was substantially motivated by its perception of Nazerzadeh\u2019s psychological problems; its departure on this basis reflected a disagreement with the Guidelines. And such disagreement is permissible so long as an adequate explanation is given. <em>See Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. at 575. The district court took a significant amount of testimony relating to Naz<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>erzadeh\u2019s particular psychological maladies, and we cannot say its crediting of this testimony was unreasonable. Nor can we say that five years of imprisonment followed by a lifetime term of supervised release does not comport with the mandates of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b459-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
