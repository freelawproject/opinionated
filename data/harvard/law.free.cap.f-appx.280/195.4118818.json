Upon marrying a U.S. citizen, he became a permanent resident in February 1991. Subsequently, Adopley was placed in removal proceedings and ordered removed on August 3, 1998, because he adjusted his immigration status based on a willful misrepresentation of a material fact. The Immigration Judge found that Adopley did not divorce his first spouse until several years after entering into a second marriage, contrary to his representation in the application for adjustment of status.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-26\">At the initial proceedings in 1998, the Immigration Judge found Adopley statutorily ineligible for relief because he lacked good moral character due to the misrepresentation on his application. The BIA reversed on the grounds that a false statement on an application does not constitute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>false testimony that automatically prohibits relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">Upon remand, the IJ, in a comprehensive opinion which thoroughly analyzed the record, again denied Adopley\u2019s applications for cancellation of removal, voluntary departure, and waiver of inadmissability. While there were certain factors in Adopley\u2019s favor, such as 22 years of residency in the United States, educational and occupational experiences, contributions to science, and a commitment to the community, the Immigration Judge found they were outweighed by negative factors, such as Adopley\u2019s demeanor in the court, his accusations of outrage toward judges, his lack of involvement in his daughter\u2019s life, unpaid traffic tickets, and refusal to comply with a family court order.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">Therefore, the IJ found that Adopley did not deserve a favorable exercise of discretion and on July 26, 2005 issued a deportation order, which the BIA subsequently affirmed on March 8, 2007. Adopley filed a timely petition for review from this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1) provides for judicial review of final orders of removal. <em>See Romanishyn v. Atty. Gen., </em>455 F.3d 175, 180 (3d Cir.2006). Where, as here, the Board adopts the immigration judge\u2019s decision and adds its own reasons, this Court reviews both decisions. <em>Fadiga v. Atty. Gen., </em>488 F.3d 142, 153, n. 16 (3d Cir.2007). The standard of review for questions of law is <em>de novo. Id. </em>at 153-54. Findings of fact are reviewed for substantial evidence and, therefore, may not be set aside unless a reasonable fact-finder would be compelled to find to the contrary. <em>Gabuniya v. Atty. Gen., </em>463 F.3d 316, 321 (3d Cir.2006). Finally, we have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction. <em>Biskupski v. Atty. Gen., </em>503 F.3d 274, 278 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-9\">Adopley argues that his due process rights were violated because the IJ admitted hearsay evidence at the removal hearing, viz., letters from Adopley\u2019s daughter and ex-spouse testifying to his character. The Government responds that this Court lacks jurisdiction to review the petition because Adopley failed to exhaust his administrative remedies with respect to this claim. In the alternative, the Government argues that Adopley\u2019s claim lacks merit because the Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in immigration proceedings and hearsay evidence may be used if it is probative and fundamentally fair. It argues that the IJ\u2019s admission of the two letters into evidence was consistent with due process because both the daughter and the ex-spouse were present in the courtroom and available to testify to the letters\u2019 veracity. App. at 48.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-10\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1), a \u201ccourt may review of a final order of removal only if ... the alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right.\u201d It is well-established that a failure to exhaust administrative remedies results in a lack of jurisdiction in the Court of Appeals. <em>See Bonhometre v. Gonzales, </em>414 F.3d 442, 448 (3d Cir.2005); <em>Duvall v. Elwood, </em>336 F.3d 228, 234 (3d Cir.2003). Here, the Petitioner did not raise before the BIA the issue of the alleged due process violation through the admission of hearsay evidence. Therefore, we lack jurisdiction to review the petition, and dismiss Adopley\u2019s appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
