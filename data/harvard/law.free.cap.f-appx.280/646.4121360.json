Jones appeals pro se from the district court\u2019s judgment denying his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition, challenging his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>commitment as a sexually violent predator. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2258, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Jones\u2019s February 2, 2008, and April 28, 2008, motions for judicial notice are granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">Jones contends that the state court lacked jurisdiction under California Welfare and Institutions Code \u00a7 6601 because the commitment proceedings were initiated when he was neither serving a determinate sentence nor in custody following the revocation of parole. Whether the court lacked jurisdiction is a matter of state law that has been resolved against Jones in state court. This court is bound by a state court\u2019s interpretation of state law. <em>See Hubbart v. Knapp, </em>379 F.3d 773, 779-80 (9th Cir.2004). Although Jones contends that his due process rights were violated by the alleged lack of jurisdiction, he cannot \u201ctransform a state-law issue into a federal one merely by asserting a violation of due process.\u201d <em>See Langford v. Day, </em>110 F.3d 1380, 1389 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">Jones also contends that his first attorney was constitutionally ineffective because the attorney misrepresented Jones\u2019s parole status. To prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, Jones must prove both deficient performance and prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 690, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Because Jones\u2019s second attorney corrected the misrepresentation, and it is clear from the record that the trial court was aware of the correct information, Jones cannot show prejudice and is not entitled to habeas relief. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Accordingly, we conclude that the state court\u2019s decision was neither contrary to nor an unreasonable application of clearly established federal law. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-30\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
