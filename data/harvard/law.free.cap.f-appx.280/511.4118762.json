Plaintiff was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>driving a car with two passengers qn August . 27, 2002, when defendant officers Matthew Baeppler and Robert Taylor gave chase:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">When the vehicle was completely stopped, Defendants Baeppler and Taylor approached the vehicle on foot in an attempt to arrest all the occupants of the vehicle, when without warning or justification Defendant Baeppler shot and wounded Plaintiff Malcolm Hoyle and Defendant Taylor shot [passenger] Ricardo Mason in the back causing fatal wounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-5\">While the Plaintiffs . injuries were caused by Defendant Baeppler\u2019s shooting, Defendant Taylor played a significant role in setting into motion the shooting by falsely claiming he was being pinned by the vehicle and that he was in danger, thereby aiding and abetting the excessive use of force and by using excessive force himself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">Plaintiff Malcolm Hoyle suffered serious and permanent injuries to his head and face, requiring extensive surgery and hospitalization. He has suffered loss of eyesight and hearing and is permanently disfigured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">Complaint at UK 8-9,11.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">On October 15, 2004, plaintiff filed suit against Baeppler, Taylor, three other individuals, and the City of Cleveland. The parties agree that this complaint was filed within the statute of limitations. Pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 41(a), on April 3, 2006, the parties signed a Voluntary Stipulation dismissing defendants Baeppler, Taylor, and the City of Cleveland without prejudice. This document, which was not signed by the district judge, was filed by the parties and entered on the court\u2019s docket sheet on April 3, 2006. On April 18, 2006, the docket sheet bears the following entry: \u201cDismissal without prejudice as to Defendants Matthew Baeppler, Robert Taylor, and the City of Cleveland. Entered by Judge Solomon Oliver Jr. on 4/18/2006.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b538-10\">On April 13, 2007, plaintiff refiled a complaint naming Taylor and Baeppler as the only defendants. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as untimely under the Ohio Savings Statute, which requires cases that have failed \u201cotherwise than upon the merits\u201d to be re-filed \u201cwithin one year after the date of ... the plaintiffs failure otherwise than upon the merits____\u201d Ohio Rev.Code \u00a7 2305.19(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The district court answered the sole question on appeal\u2014Did the one-year period for refiling under the Ohio Savings Statute begin to run on the date the parties executed and filed the dismissal or from the date that the dismissal was entered by the district court?\u2014as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AF3_\">Defendants argue that a voluntary dismissal is unilateral and self-executing. They contend that this makes the date of filing the critical date from which to calculate the one-year limitation. Plaintiff argues that the court speaks through its docket, and therefore, the date of the court\u2019s entry should apply. For the following reasons, the court concludes that the date a voluntary dismissal is filed must serve as the operative date of termination and the date from which any applicable statute of limitations is measured, regardless of subsequent court entries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-13\">Order, July 6, 2007 at 5-6 (citations omitted). As the district court noted, substantial authority supports this conclusion. <em>See, e.g., Green v. Nevers, </em>111 F.3d 1295, 1301 (6th Cir.1997) (noting that \u201ca properly stipulated dismissal under Rule 41(a)(l)(ii) is self-executing and does not require judicial approval\u201d); <em>Hawkins v. Innovative Property Mgmt., </em>2006 WL 3373158 (Ohio Ct.App. Nov. 22, 2006) (\u201c[T]he date of the filing of the notice, not the journalization date of a separate and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>unrequired court entry, [was] the controlling date.\u201d) (quoting <em>Goble v. Univ. Hosp. of Cleveland, </em>119 Ohio App.3d 555, 695 N.E.2d 1171, 1172 (1997)); <em>Payton v. Rehberg, </em>119 Ohio App.3d 183, 694 N.E.2d 1379, 1385 (1997) (\u201cDismissals pursuant to Civ. R. 41(A)(1) are fully and completely effectuated upon filing of the notice of voluntary dismissal by the plaintiff. In other words, the mere filing of the notice of dismissal by the plaintiff automatically terminates the case without intervention by the court.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">While this case arises from tragic circumstances\u2014one teenager was killed and another seriously injured\u2014the merits of the \u00a7 1983 action are not before us. Having carefully reviewed the record below and the briefs submitted by the parties, we are persuaded that the district court properly analyzed the effect of Ohio law on this litigation. Rather than issue a detailed opinion, which would serve no useful purpose, we adopt the reasoning of the district court set forth in its Order dated July 6, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
