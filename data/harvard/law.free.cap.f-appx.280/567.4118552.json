The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> sentenced him to a total of 211 months in prison and 5 years of supervised release. On appeal, Aragon-Hernandez argues that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict on the section 924(c)(1)(A) firearm count, and that, under the plain meaning of the statute, the government was required to prove an overt act in order to establish his possession of the firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, as we must, we cannot say that a reasonable juror must have harbored a reasonable doubt regarding an essential element of the offense. <em>See United States v. Birdine, </em>515 F.3d 842, 844 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Sanchez-Garcia, </em>461 F.3d 939, 946-47 (8th Cir.2006) (to secure conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A), government must present evidence from which reasonable juror could find nexus between defendant\u2019s possession of charged firearm and drug crime, such that this possession had effect of furthering, advancing, or helping forward drug crime).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">We also find no merit to Aragon-Hernandez\u2019s argument that section 924(c)(1)(A) requires proof of an overt act. <em>See United States v. Alaniz, </em>235 F.3d 386, 389 (8th Cir.2000) (possession-in-furtherance-of-a-crime language in \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) does not require active employment of firearm in relation to predicate offense).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-10\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-8\">. The Honorable Mark W. Bennett, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
