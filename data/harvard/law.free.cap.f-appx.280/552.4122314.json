Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 868, 872 (8th Cir.2006) (standard of review). The IJ gave specific and eonvinc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>ing reasons for disbelieving Tereero\u2019s testimony regarding past and likely future persecution on account of his Mayan ethnicity. <em>See Mamana v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 966, 968-69 (8th Cir.2006). Further, the then current Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Guatemala indicated that the Guatemalan government had taken steps to curb discrimination and to protect the rights of the indigenous population. <em>Cf. Pascual v. Mukasey, </em>514 F.3d 483, 488 (6th Cir.2007) (rejecting asylum claim based on Mayan ethnicity).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-14\">. Tercero does not challenge the denial of his request for asylum or relief under the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
