HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Randy Eugene Keyes pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). He was sentenced on January 20, 2006, to a term of 70 months\u2019 imprisonment, and judgment was entered on January 30. On April 26, 2007, Mr. Keyes filed a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. Relying on <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), he asserted that the district court erroneously considered his conviction in Nevada as the predicate offense for his \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction. The district court dismissed the motion as time-barred. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1). Mr. Keyes now seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c) (requiring COA to appeal denial of \u00a7 2255 motion). We deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-10\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2), a COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d This standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, the prisoner must show that the district court\u2019s resolution of the constitutional claim was either \u201cdebatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the \u00a7 2255 motion was denied on procedural grounds, the movant faces a double hurdle. Not only must the movant make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, but he must also show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable ... whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of a case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the [motion] or that the [movant] should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">The district court was clearly correct in ruling that Mr. Keyes\u2019s motion was time-barred. The statute of limitations for motions under \u00a7 2255 states, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-13\">(f) A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under [\u00a7 2255]. The limitation period shall run from the latest of\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-14\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final; [or]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-15\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AuRb\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255(f)(1) &amp; (3). Mr. Keyes does not contest that his motion was filed more than one year after his judgment of conviction became final. Judgment was entered on January 30, 2006, and became final on February 13, the end of the period when he could have appealed his conviction. <em>See Kapral v. United States, </em>166 F.3d 565, 577 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cIf a defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>dant does not pursue a timely direct appeal to the court of appeals, his or her conviction and sentence become final, and the statute of limitation begins to run, on the date on which the time for filing such an appeal expired.\u201d); Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1) (notice of appeal must be filed within 10 days of the entry of the judgment of conviction). His \u00a7 2255 motion was filed more than a year later, on April 26, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">Therefore, Mr. Keyes\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was untimely unless he can rely on \u00a7 2255(f)(3). He contends that his case is governed by the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Lopez, </em>which was handed down less than a year before he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion. But <em>Lopez </em>does not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 2255(f)(3). To begin with, the Supreme Court has not ruled that <em>Lopez </em>applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, <em>Lopez </em>provides Mr. Keyes with no new right. The statute under which Mr. Keyes was convicted does not use the term <em>felony, </em>but simply prohibits possession of a firearm by a person \u201cwho has been convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1); see <em>United States v. Norris, </em>319 F.3d 1278, 1283 (10th Cir.2003) (\u201cWhat ... matter[s] is that under the law of the jurisdiction where the proceedings were held, at the time of those proceedings, [the defendant] had committed an offense punishable by more than one year.\u201d). <em>Lopez, </em>however, concerned different language in a different statute. It construed the term \u201cfelony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act\u201d in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). <em>See Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at 627-628. Thus, the holding in <em>Lopez </em>is irrelevant to Mr. Keyes\u2019s conviction. Because \u00a7 2255(f)(3) has no application to Mr. Keyes\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion,' his motion was properly dismissed as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s denial of relief and DISMISS this appeal. We also DENY Mr. Keyes\u2019s pending motions for clarification and limited remand.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
