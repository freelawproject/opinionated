We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">Barnett challenges his sentence on two grounds. First, he argues that he was a \u201cminor participant\u201d in the conspiracy, and the District Court erred by denying Barnett\u2019s application to reduce his Guidelines offense level on that basis. \u201cWe review for clear error a sentencing court\u2019s finding that a defendant did not play a minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000). The District Court rejected Barnett\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment because of Barnett\u2019s (1) eight-year membership in the conspiracy, (2) gun possession, (3) drug dealing at various levels, (4) involvement in acts of violence, and (5) various other indicia of status within the organization. Barnett urges that he never committed an act of violence and, indeed, never even used the firearms in his possession except for an accidental discharge that resulted in his hospitalization for a self-inflicted gunshot wound. Even if Barnett\u2019s representations are credited, however, they do not make him \u201csubstantially less culpable than the average participant\u201d in the conspiracy, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2 cmt. n. 3(a), in light of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>his long-standing involvement with the organization in multiple capacities. As for his self-inflicted gunshot wound, incompetence does not provide a basis for a minor role adjustment. Accordingly, there was no error, much less clear error, in the District Court\u2019s denial of Barnett\u2019s request for a minor role adjustment. Second, Barnett requests a remand so that he may \u201cargue that the Guidelines sentence resulting from application of the \u2018craek/powder disparity1 was unreasonable.\u201d The government concedes that Barnett is entitled to a remand for the limited purpose of determining whether he should be resentenced in light of the new sentencing regime set forth in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), including the fact that \u201cthe cocaine Guidelines, like all other Guidelines, are advisory only,\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 564, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). We agree and therefore remand the sentence to the District Court, pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008), for further proceedings consistent with <em>Booker </em>and <em>Kimbrough.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">Christian Williams seeks the vacatur of his conviction because of the government\u2019s alleged breach of a plea agreement. In the alternative, he argues that his sentence should be vacated because the District Court (1) penalized him for not testifying at a co-defendant\u2019s trial, (2) considered his Guidelines range to be mandatory, and (3) failed to consider the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). None of these challenges have any merit. First, the government did not breach the plea agreement when it recommended a sentence sixty months greater than the minimum of Williams\u2019s Guidelines range. Although the government agreed to \u201cnot oppose the imposition of the least severe sentence permitted within the applicable Sentencing Guidelines range determined by the Court\u201d in Williams\u2019s plea agreement, the government was relieved from that obligation when Williams refused to testify at a codefendant\u2019s trial. Pursuant to a cooperation agreement between Williams and the government, Williams agreed to testify at \u201cany trial or other proceeding\u201d upon the government\u2019s request. His refusal to testify at a co-defendant\u2019s trial breached that agreement, and under the terms of the cooperation agreement, Williams\u2019s breach authorized the government to void both that agreement and the plea agreement. Accordingly, the government did not breach the plea agreement by pressing for a more severe sentence, and Williams\u2019s conviction will not be vacated on that basis. Second, Williams\u2019s assertion that the District Court penalized him for not testifying is contradicted by the Court\u2019s statement at sentencing that it would not \u201cuse the fact that [Williams] chose not to cooperate with the government against him,\u201d and nothing in the record suggests that the Court did otherwise. Finally, Williams\u2019s argument that the District Court erroneously construed the Guidelines range as mandatory and failed to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors finds no support whatsoever in the record. Williams was sentenced on March 4, 2005, two months after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United. States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), established that the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. There is no doubt that the District Court was aware of this development, as it stated at the sentencing hearing that the Guidelines were \u201cadvisory.\u201d In addition, the Court indicated that it considered the \u201cfactors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d before imposing sentence. Williams points to nothing in the record to the contrary, and \u201cwe presume, in the absence of record evidence suggest<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>ing otherwise, that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged [his] duty to consider the statutory [sentencing] factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006). For these reasons, we reject all of Williams\u2019s challenges to his conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgments of the District Court in all respects, except that we REMAND the sentence of Rasue Barnett (04-6661-cr) pursuant to the procedures set forth in <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir.2005), and <em>United States v. Regalado, </em>518 F.3d 143 (2d Cir.2008), for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
