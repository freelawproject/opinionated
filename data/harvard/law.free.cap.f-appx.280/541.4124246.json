EASTERBROOK, Chief Judge, JOHN L. COFFEY, Circuit Judge, MICHAEL S. KANNE, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b567-16\"> This successive appeal has been submitted to the original panel under Operating Procedure 6(b). After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b567-21\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b567-22\">Almost a decade after we affirmed his conviction on direct appeal, 79 F.3d 74 (7th Cir.1996), Rafael Guereca filed in the criminal case what he styled a motion for relief from judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b). The district court denied this motion, and Guereca has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-23\">If this is indeed a motion in the criminal case, then the appeal is untimely, because the defendant had only 10 days to appeal in a criminal proceeding, see Fed. R.App. P. 4(b), and Guereca took more than 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-24\">Guereca appears to have confused criminal with civil proceedings. Civil Rule 60(b) applies only to civil cases; it has no operation in criminal prosecutions. If Guereca had filed a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, a proceeding classified as civil, then he might have been able to use Civil Rule 60(b) to reopen the judgment. (We say \u201cmight\u201d because many motions nominally under Rule 60(b) are properly classified as successive collateral attacks, which district judges may not entertain without prior approval by this court. See <em>Gonzalez v. Crosby, </em>545 U.S. 524, 125 S.Ct. 2641, 162 L.Ed.2d 480 (2005).) But Guereca has not commenced a proceeding under \u00a7 2255, so this motion must have been in the criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>The \u201cRule 60(b) motion\u201d probably should have been treated as a motion under \u00a7 2255, see <em>Melton v. United States, </em>359 F.3d 855 (7th Cir.2004), but the district judge did not give Guereca the warning required by <em>Castro v. United States, </em>540 U.S. 375, 124 S.Ct. 786, 157 L.Ed.2d 778 (2003). Because the motion thus remained one in the criminal case, the appeal must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. The appeal would be dismissed even if we were to apply the 90-day civil period, because if this proceeding were deemed a collateral attack Guereca would need a certificate of appealability, see <em>West v. Sehneiter, </em>485 F.3d 393 (7th Cir.2007), and he does not meet the statutory standards for one. Guereca should understand, moreover, that the time limit for a proper \u00a7 2255 motion has long since expired, and that there is no point in filing such a motion in the district court unless the criteria of \u00a7 2255(f) are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">Appeal Dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
