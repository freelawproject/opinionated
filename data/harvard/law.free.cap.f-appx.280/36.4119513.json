Claimant alleges that the funds were illegally taken from him and that the Government has no right to the funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding forfeiture <em>de novo </em>and factual conclusions for plain error. <em>United States v. Gaskin, </em>364 F.3d 438, 462 (2d Cir.2004). Pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 881(a)(6),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b63-5\">[a]ll moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance ..., all proceeds traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, and securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">of federal narcotics law are \u201csubject to forfeiture to the United States.\u201d The cause of action is <em>in rem </em>and therefore \u201cagainst\u201d the money, not Escobar. \u201cIt is the property which is proceeded against, and, by resort to a legal fiction, held guilty and condemned as though it were conscious instead of inanimate and insentient.\u201d <em>Waterloo Distilling Corp. v. United States, </em>282 U.S. 577, 581, 51 S.Ct. 282, 75 L.Ed. 558 (1931) (distinguishing an <em>in rem </em>civil forfeiture proceeding from an <em>in personam </em>criminal proceeding against a defendant person).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Under the Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act of 2000 (\u201cCAFRA\u201d), the Government need only prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the money is linked to a criminal offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 981(b)(2). For the purpose of satisfying its burden of proof, \u201cthe [Government may rely upon any evidence it has lawfully obtained up to the time of the forfeiture trial.\u201d <em>United States v. $557,933.89, </em>287 F.3d 66, 89 (2d Cir.2002). We have held that even where the initial seizure of the property was illegal, the property is not immunized from forfeiture. <em>United States v. $37,780, </em>920 F.2d 159, 163 (2d Cir.1990). In the case of an illegal seizure, while the exclusionary rule may \u201cresult in the suppression of evidence in later proceedings, ... the defendant property itself cannot be suppressed from the forfeiture action.\u201d <em>United States v. Daccarett, </em>6 F.3d 37, 46 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">In this case, the Government presented evidence that Escobar had no documented means of making money in the amounts he was carrying; he admitted to police officers that the money was not his and that he was being paid $2000 to deliver it; he had been stopped two other times carrying similarly large amounts of money which canine sniffs indicated carried the odor of narcotics; and significantly, he had confessed to law enforcement officials in Florida that he had been hired as a money courier in New York for a drug cartel in Colombia. <em>See, e.g., United States v. $22,474.00, </em>246 F.3d 1212, 1217 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe sophisticated dog sniff, and more important, [claimant\u2019s] admission \u2022that he had a prior conviction for cocaine trafficking provide the necessary link.\u201d). Moreover, Escobar has provided no countervailing evidence to indicate that he has a legal interest in the money.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-10\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-11\">We have considered all of plaintiffs arguments on appeal and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, and substantially for the reasons stated by Judge Vitaliano in his September 29, 2006 Memorandum and Order, <em>United States v. $ 185,000, </em>455 F.Supp.2d 145 (E.D.N.Y.2006), we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
