Woodson was sentenced to 360 months on each count, with the sentences to run concurrently. Judgment was entered on October 30,1998. In March 2008 Woodson filed a motion to reduce his sentence pursuant to Amendment 706 and for appointment of counsel. The district court denied the motion and Woodson appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Woodson\u2019s sentence was based on a finding that his relevant conduct involved more than 4.5 kilograms of crack, and the new amendment does not apply where more than 4.5 kilograms of crack is involved. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); see <em>also United States v. Chucky L. Wanton, </em>525 F.3d 621, 622 (8th Cir.2008). Because of the amount of drugs Woodson was involved with, his offense level would not change, his guideline range would not be lowered, and his original sentence is unaffected by the amendments. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B); <em>see also Wanton, </em>525 F.3d at 622. The district court also properly denied Woodson\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying relief pursuant to the guideline amendments is summarily affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b594-25\">. The Honorable James M.
