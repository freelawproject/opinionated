The Notice of Intent charged Sharma with being removable based on prior aggravated felony convictions. Sharma argues that his state convictions for identity theft in the first degree, in violation of N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 190.80, do not qualify as aggravated felonies for immigration purposes. Respondent contends that this court lacks jurisdiction over the petition for review because it does not seek review of a final order of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-20\">This court examines questions related to its own jurisdiction de novo. <em>See Balogun v. Ashcroft, </em>270 F.3d 274, 277 (5th Cir.2001). By statute, this court has jurisdiction to review only final orders of removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a); <em>cf. Moreira v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 709, 712-14 (5th Cir.2007). By its very terms, the Notice of Intent from which Sharma seeks review is not a final order of removal. Thus, this court is without jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-21\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b449-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
