The standard of review from a district court\u2019s denial of summary judgment is <em>de novo. Kingsland v. City of Miami, </em>382 F.3d 1220, 1225 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b924-20\">The district court found that Appellants were not entitled to assert the defense of qualified immunity, and therefore were not entitled summary judgment on any of Appellee George Mark Tuggle\u2019s claims. Appellee\u2019s complaint asserted three claims against Appellants: false arrest in violation of the Fourth Amendment, malicious prosecution in violation of the Fourth Amendment, and retaliatory prosecution in violation of the First Amendment. The only issue before this Court is the district court\u2019s decision denying Appellants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the Fourth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>Amendment claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The facts of this case, viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party (here, Appellee George Mark Tuggle), show that Appellee made two short phone calls within a three minute period, and in each requested a meeting with Appellant Sheriff Victor Hill. In one phone call, Appellee used the term \u201cscum,\u201d and in the other used the phrase \u201cshort lil\u2019 bastard\u201d in reference to Appellant Sheriff Victor Hill. The district court correctly found that no reasonable police officer could have believed that these facts established arguable probable cause to arrest the Appellee for violating Georgia\u2019s harassing phone calls statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision that Appellants are not entitled to summary judgment on the Appellee\u2019s Fourth Amendment claims for false arrest and malicious prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"AIs\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
