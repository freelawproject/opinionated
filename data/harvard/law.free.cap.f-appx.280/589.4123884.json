A district court does, however, have \u201cdiscretion to reject a guilty plea ... [if it believes] the plea has failed to meet the Rule 11(b) requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 700 n. 9.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">There is no dispute that the change of plea colloquy, insofar as it was completed, met all the other requirements of Rule 11(b); the only question is whether there was a factual basis for the plea. Mendoza indicated that he was prepared to admit that he was \u201ca voluntary participant in [the] crime,\u201d and had stipulated to the factual circumstances of the crime. There was, therefore, a factual basis for the plea. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 11(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">The district court abused its discretion by nonetheless rejecting Mendoza\u2019s plea on the ground that he could not admit he was predisposed to commit the crime. Predisposition is not an element of the crime to which Mendoza pleaded. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846. It could have been relevant only if Mendoza had asserted an entrapment defense at the change of plea hearing. Mendoza explicitly did not do so, instead making clear through counsel that although the confidential informant, Faustino Lopez, provided the opportunity to commit the crime, \u201cthe conduct and the instigation of Mr. Faustino [does not] rise [ ] to the level of legal entrapment.\u201d Mendoza thus indicated that he could not satisfy one of the two elements needed to make out a defense of entrapment \u2014 inducement \u2014 whether or not he could satisfy the other one \u2014 predisposition. <em>See United States v. McClelland, </em>72 F.3d 717, 722 (9th Cir.1995) (\u201cA defense of entrapment has <em>two </em>elements: government inducement of the crime and the absence of predisposition on the part of the defendant.\u201d) (quotation marks in original omitted, emphasis added). Nor did defense counsel ever state that he planned to argue \u201centrapment,\u201d imperfect or otherwise, at sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">In sum, Mendoza\u2019s failure to admit to predisposition was fully consistent with the assertion that he could not prove a legally viable entrapment defense. The district court\u2019s reliance on a contrary premise in rejecting the guilty plea was therefore legally erroneous, and therefore an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">The result of the district court\u2019s error was that although Mendoza attempted to plead guilty and thereby provide consideration for the government\u2019s reciprocal obligations in the plea agreement, he was prevented from doing so. <em>Cf. United States v. Hyde, </em>520 U.S. 670, 677-78, 117 S.Ct. 1630, 137 L.Ed.2d 935 (1997). We will therefore restore Mendoza to the position he would have been in had his plea not' been erroneously rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">We do so through the remedy proposed by the government and agreed to by Mendoza\u2019s counsel at argument: Mendoza\u2019s conviction at trial for violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(1)(B), is vacated, along with the corresponding sentence. We do not disturb the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 conviction, as Mendoza was prepared to plead guilty to that count, but we vacate the sentence for that offense. We remand for resentencing in accordance with Mendoza\u2019s original plea agreement, including that agreement\u2019s acceptance of responsibility provisions. That Mendoza went to trial rather than pleading guilty should not be considered in the sentencing, because, among other reasons, that occurred only because of the district court\u2019s erroneous rejection of the guilty plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b615-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
