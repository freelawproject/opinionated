In the plea agreement, Oliver waived his right to appeal the reasonableness of any sentence imposed within the properly calculated Sentencing Guidelines range of imprisonment. Oliver was sentenced within the Guidelines range of imprisonment. On appeal, he claims the district court erred by not considering the crack cocaine/powder cocaine sentencing disparity. He further argues a remand is appropriate for resentencing consistent with Guidelines Amendment 706, which was retroactive as of March 3, 2008, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(c). Because we find the appeal waiver enforceable, we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">We find Oliver\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and should not be disturbed. We note Oliver does not challenge the validity of the appeal waiver. He argues, however, that his claim that the district court erred by not considering a downward departure based on the crack cocaine/powder cocaine sentencing disparity is not foreclosed by his appeal waiver. The Supreme Court held in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), that the crack cocaine Guidelines are advisory and a district court may impose a lower sentence because of the crack/powder disparity. However, Oliver\u2019s sentence was within the Guidelines and his appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary. Thus, this court may not review the district court\u2019s decision to deny a downward departure based on the sentencing disparity despite a change to the law. <em>United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 170-71 (4th Cir.2005) (holding that waiver of right to appeal in a plea agreement accepted before decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), was not invalidated by change in law); <em>see also United States v. Lee, </em>523 F.3d 104 (2d Cir.2008) (appeal waiver was enforceable despite the fact that <em>Kimbrough </em>would have permitted court to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">We decline to remand the case to the district court for resentencing for the purpose of allowing the court to consider Guidelines Amendment 706, which was retroactive as of March 3, 2008, <em>see </em>USSG \u00a7 lB1.10(e). Oliver may file a motion for a sentence reduction based on.the amendment. <em>See United States v. Brewer, </em>520 F.3d 367, 373 (4th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Accordingly, because of Oliver\u2019s appeal waiver, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-17\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
