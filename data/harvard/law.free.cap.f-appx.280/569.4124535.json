That amendment reduced certain offense levels in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(e), based on the quantity of cocaine base (crack).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-24\">Based on Adrow\u2019s total offense level and criminal history category, his originally calculated guideline range was 108 to 135 months. Because the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for his offense was ten years, however, the court was required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>sentence him to at least 120 months and that was the sentence imposed. The new drug quantity guidelines do not affect the mandatory minimum sentence applied to Adrow\u2019s crime under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 and 841(b), so he is not entitled to a sentence reduction. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c); <em>see also United States v. Shamico Peters, </em>524 F.3d 905, 907 (8th Cir.2008). The district court also properly refused to reconsider Adrow\u2019s criminal history score or grant safety valve relief. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10(c); <em>see also Peters, </em>524 F.3d at 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\">Accordingly, the order of the district court is summarily affirmed. <em>See </em>8th Cr. R. 47A(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b595-9\">. The Honorable James M. Moody, United States District Judge for the Eastern District of Arkansas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
