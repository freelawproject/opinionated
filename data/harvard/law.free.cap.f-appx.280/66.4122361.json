McAvoy of the United States District Court for the Northern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b93-17\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b93-18\">David and Donna Streck appeal from an order of the District Court for the Northern District of New York (Sharpe, <em>J.) </em>granting judgment in their favor for compensatory education under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400 <em>et seq., </em>and dismissing the remainder of them claims under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (\u201c \u00a7 504\u201d); the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 <em>et seq.; </em>and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-19\">David and Donna Streck argue that the district court erred in dismissing their claims under [1] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985; [2] the ADA and \u00a7 504; and [3] 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. They further contend that [4] there was no evidentiary basis for the court\u2019s determination that the value of compensatory education for violations of the IDEA is no more than $4,700 (plus reimbursement for an independent evaluation). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss de novo.\u201d <em>Rweyemamu v. Cote, </em>520 F.3d 198, 201 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b93-20\">[1] Plaintiffs argue that the district court erred in dismissing their \u00a7 1985 claim; however, the complaint does not allege a denial of equal protection or invidious animus. <em>See United Bhd. of Carpenters &amp; Joiners of Amer. v. Scott, </em>463 U.S. 825, 828-29, 103 S.Ct. 3352, 77 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>1049 (1988) (explaining that a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985(8) claim requires proof of, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201ca conspiracy ... for the purpose of depriving ... any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws\u201d); <em>Mian v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Sec. Corp., </em>7 F.3d 1085, 1087-88 (2d Cir.1993) (per curiam) (\u201c[A \u00a7 1985(3) ] conspiracy must also be motivated by some racial or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidious discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\u2019 action.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-4\">[2] Under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, a demand for \u201creasonable accommodations to assure access to an existing program\u201d is cognizable; but a demand for \u201cadditional or different substantive benefits\u201d is not. <em>Wright v. Giuliani, </em>230 F.3d 543, 548 (2d Cir.2000) (per curiam). The complaint concedes that David was identified as a student with a disability and was so classified until his high school graduation. Moreover, an Individualized Education Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d) was created and implemented. Thus, David was afforded \u201caccess to an existing program.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The complaint challenges the content and sufficiency of the IEP. Thus, the complaint demands \u201cadditional or different substantive benefits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court therefore properly dismissed plaintiffs\u2019 ADA and \u00a7 504 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">[3] Plaintiffs contest the district court\u2019s dismissal of their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim, citing <em>Polera v. Bd. of Educ. of the Newburgh Enlarged City Sch. Dist., </em>288 F.3d 478 (2d Cir.2002) for the proposition that although monetary damages are unavailable under the IDEA, <em>id. </em>at 486, such damages are available in a \u00a7 1983 action alleging violations of the IDEA, <em>id. </em>at 483.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">Plaintiffs fail to allege a denial of procedural safeguards or administrative remedies: they were afforded a hearing before an impartial hearing officer and review by a state review officer (\u201cSRO\u201d). Therefore, plaintiffs may not rely on \u00a7 1983 to pursue monetary damages for violations of the IDEA. <em>See Quackenbush v. Johnson City Sch. Dist., </em>716 F.2d 141, 148 (2d Cir.1983) (affirming district court\u2019s refusal to dismiss a complaint that \u201cset[ ] forth a cause of action against the school district under \u00a7 1983 for compensatory damages based upon its alleged policy ... [of] preventing handicapped children from gaining access to the procedural safeguards guaranteed by [a predecessor statute to the IDEA]\u201d); <em>id. </em>(Section 1983 \u201csupplies] the right of action to a plaintiff who has been <em>denied procedural safeguards </em>.... \u201d (emphasis added)); <em>see also Taylor v. Vermont Dept. of Educ., </em>313 F.3d 768, 790 (2d Cir.2002) (\u201c[I]f plaintiffs can demonstrate that there is no relief available to them through the administrative process, they may [seek monetary damages for IDEA violations pursuant to \u00a7 1983].\u201d); <em>Mrs. W. v. Tirozzi, </em>832 F.2d 748, 755-57 (2d Cir.1987) (affirming district court\u2019s denial of a motion to dismiss a \u00a7 1983 claim where plaintiffs alleged \u201ca pattern and practice of systematic ... violations <em>unable to be addressed at the due process hearings </em>provided [by the State]\u201d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-8\">Plaintiffs argue that the district court lacked an evidentiary basis for deciding that the just value of compensatory education is no more than the $4,700 awarded (plus reimbursement for an independent evaluation).</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">Defendants contest neither the SRO\u2019s determination that David was deprived of a free appropriate public education nor the district court\u2019s ruling that defendants must pay for up to three years of compensatory reading education. Furthermore, defense counsel conceded at oral argument that there was insufficient evidence to support the district court\u2019s determination of the just value of the compensatory reading <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>education. (The $4,700 figure apparently originated in a settlement offer.) Although the district court stated that it \u201cconsidered the parties\u2019 arguments, the relevant law, and the equitable considerations, as outlined by the parties in their motion papers\u201d in arriving at this award, the court failed to accept and consider evidence of the value of the reading program as it is implemented at Landmark College. We are unable to affirm the district court\u2019s award on this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Consequently, we vacate and remand for a redetermination of the just value of the compensatory reading education awarded by the SRO. The district court\u2019s task on remand is complicated by the fact that the SRO awarded plaintiffs up to three years of compensatory reading education as it is implemented at Landmark College: David spent only a year there (perhaps due to his family\u2019s financial constraints). Our disposition in no way limits the nature or scope of evidence that the district court may receive or consider in determining the just value of the compensatory reading education awarded by the SRO.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">For the reasons set forth above, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED in part, VACATED in part, and REMANDED for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
