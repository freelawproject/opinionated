We have reviewed the record and find that Giannone failed to show that his appeal will raise a substantial question of law or fact likely to result in either reversal, an order for a new trial, a sentence that does not include a term of imprisonment, or a reduced sentence to a term of imprisonment less than the total of time already served plus the expected duration of the appeal process. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3143(b)(1)(B); <em>United States v. Steinhom, </em>927 F.2d 195, 196 (4th Cir.1991). Accordingly, we affirm.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> We also deny his motion for appointment of counsel, and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b273-19\"> Because Giannone's direct appeal is not yet ripe, our affirmance of the district court\u2019s denial of Giannone\u2019s motion for bail pending appeal should not be construed as forecasting our disposition of the direct appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
