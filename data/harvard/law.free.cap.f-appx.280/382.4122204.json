The district court dismissed Baxter\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint, holding that Baxter\u2019s disagreement with the course of treatment followed by the prison medical staff was insufficient to state a claim under \u00a7 1983. The district court additionally determined that Eleventh Amendment immunity shielded from monetary damages defendants Carmona, Talley, Seidel, and Livingston in their official capacities and that qualified immunity shielded all five defendants in their individual capacities as Baxter failed to state a cognizable claim for deliberate indifference to medical needs under the Eighth Amendment. The district court denied Moore\u2019s motion for leave to proceed IFP on appeal and certified that the appeal was not taken in good faith finding that Baxter had presented no arguable or nonfrivolous issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-19\">Baxter now moves this court for leave to proceed IFP on appeal. In doing so, Baxter is challenging the district court\u2019s certification. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997). Baxter argues that the district court wrongfully denied him leave to proceed IFP because the district court judge was biased in favor of the defendant. The adverse ruling itself is insufficient to support Baxter\u2019s allegation of bias and Baxter\u2019s conclusory allegations of the district court judge\u2019s friendship with Talley is also insufficient. <em>See Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-20\">Liberally construed, Baxter\u2019s brief additionally argues that the defendants violated the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment when they failed to provide surgery and appropriate medication for his orthopedic issues, and confiscated his walking cane. Baxter has failed to show that the defendants exhibited deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of the Eighth Amendment. <em>See Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 101, 104-05, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976); <em>Farmer v. Brennan, </em>511 U.S. 825, 847, 114 S.Ct. 1970, 128 L.Ed.2d 811 (1994); <em>see Reeves v. Collins, </em>27 F.3d 174, 176-77 (5th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>1994) (applying the <em>Farmer </em>standard in the context of a denial-of-medical-care claim). Baxter\u2019s arguments demonstrate only a disagreement about his medical treatment or negligence, which is insufficient to establish an unconstitutional denial of medical care. <em>Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991). Baxter has not shown that the district court\u2019s certification that an appeal would not be taken in good faith was incorrect. The instant appeal is without arguable merit and is thus frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983). Accordingly, Baxter\u2019s request for IFP is denied and his appeal is dismissed. <em>See Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202, n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Baxter is cautioned that our dismissal of this appeal as frivolous and the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to state a claim each count as a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 387-88 (5th Cir.1996). Baxter is also cautioned that if he accumulates three strikes under \u00a7 1915(g), he may not proceed IFP in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">MOTION DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b408-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
