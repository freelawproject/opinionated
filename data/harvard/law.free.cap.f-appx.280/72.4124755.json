Carathers and Adams were both convicted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Adams was also convicted of conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute five or more grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846 &amp; 841(b)(1)(B), and of that underlying substantive offense, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">Both Adams and Carathers raised the defense of entrapment at trial. Because the government conceded that the drug transactions at issue were initiated by government agents, much of the evidence and arguments at trial focused on whether the defendants were predisposed to commit the charged crimes. <em>See United States v. Brand, </em>467 F.3d 179, 189 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]he government can ... defeat the defense of entrapment if it can show that a defendant was predisposed to commit the crime.\u201d). On appeal, Adams (but not Carathers) claims that the trial evidence was insufficient to establish Adams\u2019 predisposition. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">A defendant bears a heavy burden in challenging the sufficiency of evidence: we review all of the evidence \u201cin the light most favorable to the government,\u201d and we must sustain the jury\u2019s verdict if \u201cany rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>191 F.3d 326, 333 (2d Cir.1999) (quotation marks and emphasis omitted). Predisposition to commit a crime may be established by evidence of: (1) an existing course of criminal conduct similar to the crime for which the defendant is charged; (2) an already formed design on the part of the accused to commit the crime for which he is charged; or (3) a willingness to commit the crime for which he is charged as evidenced by the accused\u2019s ready response to the inducement. <em>Brand, </em>467 F.3d at 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">In this case, reasonable jurors could have found that Adams was predisposed to commit the crimes for which he was convicted. Although Adams testified that he was not involved in the drug trade prior to being approached by the government\u2019s agent, reasonable jurors could conclude otherwise based, in part, on tape-recorded conversations in which Adams evinced a keen understanding of the narcotics trade and referred to \u201c[his] people\u201d selling \u201cbricks,\u201d i.e., kilograms, of cocaine. Moreover, based on the expediency and manner in which the transactions were completed, the jury could reasonably conclude that Adams was perfectly willing to avail himself of the government-initiated opportunity to sell both cocaine and crack. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Salerno, </em>66 F.3d 544, 547 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Defendants also claim that the district court erred \u2014 both procedurally and substantively \u2014 in its supplemental jury instructions in response to oral questions by the jury on the issues of entrapment and the burden of proof.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Ronder, </em>639 F.2d 931, 934 (2d Cir.1981), we outlined a four-step procedure for responding to jury messages: (1) The jury\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>question should be submitted in writing; (2) the question should be marked as a court exhibit and read into the record; (3) counsel should be given an opportunity to request appropriate responses; and (4) once the jurors are recalled, the question, if substantive, should be read into the record in them presence. <em>Id. </em>We have since recognized, however, that \u201csome latitude in determining how best to handle jury inquiries\u201d must be left to the district court, and have held that vacatur is not required when a judge\u2019s responses to oral jury questioning does not prejudice the parties. <em>See United States v. Ulloa, </em>882 F.2d 41, 45 (2d Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">As an initial matter, we need not determine whether defendants waived them procedural challenge, or whether the procedure employed by the district court was erroneous under the circumstances, because defendants fail to demonstrate any prejudice resulting from the substance of the court\u2019s supplemental instructions. <em>See Ulloa, </em>882 F.2d at 45.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, defendants claim that the district court\u2019s use of the word \u201ccajole\u201d in the supplemental instructions concerning entrapment impermissibly operated to shift the jurors\u2019 attention to the government actor\u2019s conduct rather than to the defendants\u2019 state of mind.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, when read in the context of the entire supplemental instructions, as well as the original jury charge, the jury was clearly instructed that the government bore the burden of proving that defendants were ready and willing to commit the drug-crimes at issue, and that the defendants\u2019 frame of mind prior to being approached by the government agent was what the jury had to decide. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Tillem, </em>906 F.2d 814, 826 (2d Cir.1990) (explaining that we review the \u201clegal sufficiency of supplemental instructions ... in light of the jury instructions as a whole\u201d). The district court\u2019s use of the word \u201ccajole\u201d was simply offered as a contra-example of what would <em>not </em>satisfy the government\u2019s burden of overcoming the entrapment defense. We thus find no legal error or prejudice in the district court\u2019s supplemental entrapment instructions. Cf<em>. e.g., United States v. Hulett, </em>22 F.3d 779, 781 (8th Cir.1994) (finding sufficiency of evidence that defendant was \u201cdisposed to commit the crimes for which he was convicted,\u201d where he was \u201cnot cajoled into the transaction\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">Nor do we find any substantive error or prejudice stemming from the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>trict court\u2019s supplemental instructions concerning the government\u2019s burden of proof. In particular, Carathers objects to the district court\u2019s supplemental instruction that the words \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d is \u201cnot a question of speculation or gut feeling or shrugging of one\u2019s shoulders or anything else.\u201d This instruction appears to have been intended as a reminder that a \u201cdoubt\u201d based on mere conjecture is not a \u201creasonable doubt.\u201d Even if the district court\u2019s instruction might be read to suggest that the jurors be able to articulate a reason for a doubt, we have refused to find such a suggestion erroneous. <em>See, e.g., Vargas v. Keane, </em>86 F.3d 1273, 1276-78 (2d Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>328 F.2d 864, 867-68 (2d Cir.1964). Moreover, we find no merit to Carathers\u2019 related claim that the district court\u2019s use of the term \u201cgut feeling\u201d was intended to reference his counsel\u2019s summation, whose opening line was \u201cLadies and Gentlemen, what does your gut tell you.\u201d There is no evidence that the district court had that intent. In any event, as counsel for Carathers himself concedes, the thrust of his argument \u2014 reflected in his later statements to the jury \u2014 was to appeal to the jurors\u2019 common sense. Nothing in the district court\u2019s supplemental instruction, especially when considered in combination with the original instruction, impermissibly undermined counsel\u2019s effort.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Finally, we review the district court\u2019s denial of Adams\u2019 motion for a new court-appointed counsel for abuse of discretion, <em>see United States v. Simeonov, </em>252 F.3d 238, 241 (2d Cir.2001), and we find none here. In general, we examine four factors in reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a request for new counsel: (1) whether the defendant\u2019s motion was timely; (2) whether the trial court adequately inquired into the matter; (3) whether the conflict between the defendant and his attorney was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense; and (4) whether the defendant substantially and unjustifiably contributed to the breakdown in communication. <em>See United States v. John Doe No. 1, </em>272 F.3d 116, 122-23 (2d Cir.2001). Here, Adams\u2019 request for new counsel\u2014 raised for the first time near the close of the sentencing proceeding \u2014 was not timely. Moreover, the court\u2019s inquiry into the matter revealed no indication that communications had broken down between Adams and his counsel, and any rift in the attorney-client relationship was at least partially Adams\u2019 fault. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Adams\u2019 request for new counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court\u2019s order is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b100-6\">. After the jury had been deliberating for more than a day, it sent a note to the district court asking it to \"explain entrapment\u201d and \"explain conspiracy charges,\u201d among other things. Because the note was vague, the court indicated that it would bring the jury in to ask whether the jury could clarify its questions. The court instructed counsel, in the event of a question that was not \"boilerplate\u201d regarding either entrapment or conspiracy, it would consult with counsel prior to responding, and that even if the jury asks \"conventional\u201d questions, the court would respond immediately and give counsel an opportunity to be heard at the sidebar before excusing the jury.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b101-6\">. Although we do not decide whether the district court\u2019s procedure was appropriate under the circumstances of this case, we pause to emphasize that the preferred approach for addressing jury questions remains the one we carefully outlined in <em>Ronder. </em>To the extent circumstances may counsel a district court to engage in an oral colloquy with the jury, it becomes all the more important for the court to hear from the parties prior to deviating from any pre-approved jury charge language. What a district court may believe to be an innocuous deviation in language might not be so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. The district court instructed, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-8\">So there is really no dispute that the government, in the form of the confidential informant, initiated the situation. The dispute is over whether the government has proven beyond a reasonable doubt that once he did that, one or both defendants said, in effect, sure, we are ready and willing to go or, rather, said no, no, no or, short of that, simply were cajoled into the situation that they ultimately agreed. Those are the kinds of, if you will, analogies that are applicable here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">The curt further instructed, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-12\">The question is ... was the defendant previously, before any of that [referring to their inducement] happened, was the defendant, in effect, predisposed to say, yes, I will go along with this or, conversely, was the defendant not so predisposed and he had to be completely \u2014 \"completely\u201d is the wrong word-he had to be cajoled into doing it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
