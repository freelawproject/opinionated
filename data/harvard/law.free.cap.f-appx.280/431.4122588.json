He argues that the district court erred in increasing his offense level pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.2, and he asks that the two-level increase be set aside as not proved. He asks in the alternative that he be resentenced under the \u201cnew standard\u201d of law set out by <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), and <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-31\">We review the procedural soundness and substantive reasonableness of Mor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>ante\u2019s sentence under the abuse-of-diseretion standard of review. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. Whether a defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes reckless endangerment during his flight from law enforcement under \u00a7 3C1.2 is a factual finding reviewed for clear error. <em>See United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Lugman, </em>130 F.3d 113, 115-16 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">To the extent that Morante challenged the facts stated in the presentence report (PSR) to support the \u00a7 3C1.2 enhancement, he bore the burden to demonstrate that such facts were \u201cmaterially untrue.\u201d <em>Lugman, </em>130 F.3d at 116. Although, in his written objections to the PSR, Morante presented a different version from the PSR regarding what happened when he fled law enforcement, he failed to offer any evidence at sentencing to show that the PSR\u2019s statements were \u201cmaterially untrue.\u201d Accordingly, as the PSR provided that Morante\u2019s car was traveling at a \u201chigh rate of speed,\u201d that his car \u201cspun out of control,\u201d that he hit a parked car belonging to a resident, and that, as a result of the chase, the passenger in his car was killed, the district court did not clearly err in finding sufficient evidence of reckless endangerment during flight to support an increase under \u00a7 3C1.2. <em>See United States v. Jimenez, </em>323 F.3d 320, 321-24 (5th Cir.2003). Moreover, because the district court imposed a sentence within the properly calculated guidelines range, it is presumptively reasonable. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Finally, there is nothing in either <em>Gall </em>or <em>Kimbrough </em>that mandates a new sentencing hearing in this case. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. 586; <em>Kimbrough, </em>128 S.Ct. 558. Accordingly, as Morante has not demonstrated any abuse of discretion by the district court in imposing his sentence, <em>see Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594, his sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
