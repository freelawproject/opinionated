After Barnes pleaded guilty, the district court determined that his prior state conviction for first degree marijuana possession qualified as a controlled substance offense and applied a base offense level of 24 pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) and 4B1.2(b) of the sentencing guidelines. The district court also concluded that the marijuana conviction qualified as a third serious drug offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act and enhanced Barnes\u2019 offense level to 33 pursuant to \u00a7 4B1.4, resulting in a total offense level of 30 after a reduction for acceptance of responsibility. With a criminal history category of IV, Barnes\u2019 guideline range was 135-165 months. Because this range fell below the mandatory fifteen year minimum term of imprisonment set by the ACCA, however, the district court sentenced Barnes to 180 months in prison. Barnes contends on appeal that his prior conviction for first degree marijuana possession under Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(1) does not qualify as a third predicate \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under the ACCA.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>whether a prior conviction is a serious drug offense within the meaning of the ACCA. <em>United States v. James, </em>430 F.3d 1150, 1153 (11th Cir.2005), aff<em>'d on other grounds, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-16\">Section 922(g) of Title 18 of the United States Code prohibits any person who has previously been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year from possessing any firearm. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). Pursuant to \u00a7 924(e)(1), any person who violates \u00a7 922(g) and has three prior convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both, committed on occasions different from one another\u201d shall be imprisoned for not less than fifteen years. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). Section 924(e) defines the term \u201cserious drug offense\u201d as including, among other things, \u201can offense under State law, involving manufacturing, distributing, or possessing with intent to manufacture or distribute, a controlled substance ..., for which a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years or more is prescribed by law.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2) (A) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-17\">Under Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213, a person commits the crime of first degree marijuana possession if: (1) he possesses marijuana for other than personal use; or (2) he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>possesses marijuana only for his personal use after having previously been convicted of unlawful possession of marijuana in the second degree or unlawful possession of marijuana for personal use. Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a). Barnes concedes that he was convicted under the first subsection for possessing marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use,\u201d which resulted in a sentence of one year and one day in prison. The determinative issue in this case, therefore, is whether the district court properly concluded that a prior conviction for possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d qualifies as a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d under \u00a7 924(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">When determining whether a particular conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e), courts are generally limited to a formal categorical approach, which looks \u201conly to the fact of conviction and the statutory definition of the prior offense,\u201d instead of the actual facts underlying the defendant\u2019s prior conviction. <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 602, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 2160, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>see also Shepard v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 15, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 1257, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005); <em>James, </em>430 F.3d at 1154; <em>United States v. Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d 1249, 1254 (11th Cir.2004). The purpose of limiting sentencing courts to this categorical approach is that it avoids the \u201cpractical difficulties and potential unfairness of a factual approach.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 601, 110 S.Ct. at 2159; <em>see also Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d at 1254 (\u201cThe danger of having to conduct \u2018mini-trials\u2019 on a defendant\u2019s prior conviction counsels against looking beyond the statute of conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">However, there are some narrow exceptions to this general rule, and Barnes contends that his prior marijuana conviction under Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213(a)(l) falls within the ambiguity exception to the categorical approach. In explaining the ambiguity exception, we have recognized that a district court may look to the facts underlying a prior conviction \u201cwhere the judgment of conviction and statute are ambiguous, i.e., the determination whether a prior conviction is a qualifying offense from the face of the judgment itself is impossible.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d 1271, 1273 (11th Cir.2006) (remanding for resentencing where a factual inquiry was required to determine whether the defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) of the sentencing guidelines).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-7\">An ambiguity occurs, for example, \u201cwhere the statutory language of the prior conviction \u2018encompasse[s] some offenses that would satisfy the enhancement statute and others that would not.\u2019 \u201d <em>Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d at 1255 (quoting <em>United States v. Fulford, </em>267 F.3d 1241, 1249 (11th Cir.2001)). Even in instances where we have recognized that a sentencing court is permitted to go beyond the categorical approach, however, we have held that the court may rely on only a limited set of materials \u2014 including the charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of the plea colloquy, and any explicit factual findings of the trial judge to which the defendant assented. <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1273-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">In arguing that the look-behind approach is appropriate in this case, Barnes principally relies upon the <em>Aguilar-Ortiz </em>case. The decision in that case, however, does not support Barnes\u2019 contention. In <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>we determined that a Florida statute prohibiting the solicitation of the delivery of drugs was ambiguous and required the district court to go beyond the formal categorical approach to determine if the defendant\u2019s prior conviction qualified as a \u201cdrug trafficking offense\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) of the sentencing guidelines. 450 F.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>1276. In reaching this conclusion, we noted that defendants could be found guilty of the Florida solicitation crime \u201con the basis of a wide range of conduct,\u201d including the solicitation of large quantities of narcotics for redistribution or the solicitation of only a minuscule amount of narcotics solely for personal use. <em>Id. </em>at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">The Florida statute in <em>Aguilar-Ortiz </em>was so ambiguous that we were unable to say as a categorical matter that all solicitation convictions under it either did or did not qualify as drug trafficking offenses under the sentencing guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 1276; <em>see also United States v. Greer, </em>440 F.3d 1267, 1273 (11th Cir.2006) (noting that the defendant\u2019s convictions for making terroristic threats under a Georgia statute did \u201cnot, without more, prove that he had been convicted of a violent felony for ACCA purposes\u201d because the state statute prohibits both violent and nonviolent conduct); <em>Breitweiser, </em>357 F.3d at 1255 (determining that the district court had properly looked past the defendant\u2019s conviction under a New Jersey statute prohibiting the endangerment of child welfare, because it was impossible to determine from the face of the statute whether it qualified as a \u201cprior sex offense conviction\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2247 since a defendant, who may or may not have had sexual contact with a minor, could be convicted under the statute); <em>United States v. Spell, </em>44 F.3d 936, 939 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam) (finding that the district court had properly looked behind a previous conviction under a Florida burglary statute in determining whether it constituted a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 4B1.1 of the sentencing guidelines because the state statute \u201cencompasses some conduct which constitutes a crime of violence and some which does not\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Unlike the Florida statute in <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>the language of the Alabama statute prohibiting the possession of marijuana \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d in this case is not ambiguous. The phrase \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d means that a defendant does more than merely possess marijuana for his own use \u2014 that is, he intends to distribute it or to possess it with the intent to distribute. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-214 (making the possession of marijuana for \u201cpersonal use only\u201d a Class A misdemean- or); <em>Watley v. State, </em>568 So.2d 852, 854 (Ala.Cr.App.1989) (noting that there \u201cis no offense outlined in ... \u00a7 13A-12-213 ... whose enacting clause defines the proscribed conduct merely in terms of \u2018possession of marijuana\u2019 \u201d and determining that the phrase \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d is an \u201cinseparable ingredient[ ] of the offense\u201d). Indeed, when asked by the district court, Barnes\u2019 attorney could not provide an alternative interpretation of the statute that would permit the inference that he did not intend to distribute the marijuana. Nor can we. Unlike in <em>Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>therefore, a conviction under the statute at issue in this case cannot be based on possession solely for personal use. <em>See Aguilar-Ortiz, </em>450 F.3d at 1275.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">Because first degree marijuana possession in violation of Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-12-213 is a Class C felony, it carries with it a maximum term of imprisonment of ten years, <em>see </em>Ala.Code \u00a7\u00a7 13A-12-213(b) &amp; 13A-5-6(a)(3), which meets the requirements of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(A)(ii)\u2019s definition of a \u201cserious drug offense.\u201d Furthermore, as we discussed earlier, \u00a7 13A-12-213\u2019s description of the offense as possession \u201cfor other than personal use\u201d necessarily implies that a defendant possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute it and thereby committed a serious drug offense. Because the plain language of the statute, read against the judgment, compels this conclusion, we cannot refer to any other material to determine whether Barnes\u2019 conviction qualifies as a serious drug offense. The district court, therefore, properly treated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>Barnes\u2019 conviction for first degree marijuana possession as a serious drug offense and applied the mandatory fifteen year statutory minimum sentence under the ACCA. Accordingly, we affirm Barnes\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-11\">. The government contends that Barnes waived any arguments relating to the application of the ACCA because his brief to this Court argues only that his prior Alabama state court conviction for first degree marijuana possession is not a \"controlled substance offense\u201d under \u00a7 4B 1.2(b) of the sentencing guidelines. Because it does not affect our decision, we will assume without deciding that Barnes\u2019 \u00a7 4B1.2 argument does raise the ACCA issues.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
