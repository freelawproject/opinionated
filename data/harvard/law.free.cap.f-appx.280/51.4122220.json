Aug. 30, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A79 327 543 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Mar. 8, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-23\">As a preliminary matter, because Dong failed to challenge the IJ\u2019s denial of his CAT claim in his appeal to the BIA, we are without jurisdiction to consider Dong\u2019s arguments concerning the denial of that relief. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Karaj v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 113, 119 (2d Cir.2006). And because Dong failed to raise his argument that the IJ was not impartial, we may not consider his challenge to the IJ\u2019s conduct raised in this Court in the first instance. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1); <em>see also Valbrun v. Hogan, </em>439 F.3d 136, 137 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>Because Dong failed to raise before the BIA his argument that he engaged in \u201cother resistance,\u201d or that the IJ erred by failing to consider any of the documents he submitted, and because the Government has raised this failure to exhaust in its brief to this Court, we decline to consider those unexhausted issues, too. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007). And because Dong has failed to argue sufficiently before this Court that the BIA erred in finding that he did not have a well-founded fear of persecution in China because he has two children, and because addressing this argument does not appear to be necessary to avoid manifest injustice, we conclude that Dong has waived that argument. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). We therefore proceed to consider Dong\u2019s challenge to the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Where the BIA issues a separate opinion after this Court \u201cso orders\u201d a joint stipulation by the parties, the BIA\u2019s \u201copinion becomes the basis for judicial review of the decision of which the alien is complaining.\u201d <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). However, where the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See, e.g., Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the BIA issued a new decision on remand from this Court, but found that its June 2006 decision affirming the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination \u201cremains the law of the case.\u201d Accordingly, we consider both the IJ\u2019s and the BIA\u2019s opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">We review the IJ\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, overturning them only if any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Manzur v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 289 (2d Cir.2007). We conclude that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">The IJ did not err in finding that Dong\u2019s testimony was \u201cextremely vague, evasive and nonresponsive.\u201d Indeed, the IJ identified specific instances in Dong\u2019s testimony where he hesitated or paused apparently in order to have time to get his story straight. Particular deference is given to such assessments of an applicant\u2019s demeanor. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 81 n. 1 (2d Cir.2005). The IJ also properly based her adverse credibility determination on several inconsistencies in Dong\u2019s testimony. For example, Dong testified inconsistently regarding the number of times his wife had been pregnant, where his children lived, and whether they went to school. These inconsistencies are material to Dong\u2019s application for relief and substantial when measured against the record as a whole because they undermine his claim that his wife undeiwent an abortion. As the IJ noted, it raises \u201cdoubts even about the existence of the children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Dong fails to challenge several of the IJ\u2019s other credibility findings, including her observation that while some of the documents Petitioner submitted were dated 2001, they arrived in an envelope postmarked 2000. These unchallenged findings stand as a proper basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See Yueqing Zhang, </em>426 F.3d at 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">Whether or not we agree with all of the IJ\u2019s credibility findings, remand would not be required because we can \u201cconfidently predict\u201d that the agency would adhere to its decision on remand given the numerous and substantial inconsistencies we have identified. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339-342 (2d Cir.2006). Because the only evidence of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>threat to Dong\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case precluded success on Dong\u2019s claims for both asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. Having completed our review, the Petitioner\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
