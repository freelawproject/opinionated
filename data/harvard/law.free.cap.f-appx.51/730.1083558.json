Arnold, Senior Circuit Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b766-18\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-19\">The district court, ruling without benefit of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent ruling in <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002), clearly erred in granting Surjit Singh\u2019s (\u201cSingh\u201d) motion to suppress. Given the absence of coercive behavior by the investigating law enforcement officer, Singh voluntarily opened the door to his roomette. <em>See United States v. Cormier, </em>220 F.3d 1103, 1109 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b766-22\">Similarly, the Fourth Amendment was not implicated by Agent Delaney\u2019s questioning of Singh. <em>See Drayton, </em>122 S.Ct. at 2110. Agent Delaney did not threaten force, speak in an authoritative tone, block the roomette\u2019s doorway, or order Singh to answer his questions. Agent Delaney\u2019s conduct in no way transformed the consensual encounter in the sleeping car into a Fourth Amendment seizure. <em>See id. </em>at 2111-13. Singh and his co-defendant, Steven Pineda, therefore, voluntarily consented to Agent Delaney\u2019s request to search their roomette and their backpacks. <em>See id. </em>at 2113.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-23\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b766-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b766-24\">B. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"avh-dedup-0\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-25\">I concur in the majority\u2019s disposition. I write separately to commend the district court for its thoughtful analysis of the factors that led to its conclusion that the evidence should be suppressed because Singh had not consented to the search. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>The district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>United States v. Drayton, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 2105, 153 L.Ed.2d 242 (2002), that was decided a few months after its ruling and that compels our reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">At a common-sense level, I note that the precedents force us to indulge in fictions as we determine the answers to such questions as, \u201cDid the defendant feel free to leave or to refuse consent?\u201d Were we to present the facts to one hundred psychologists, I venture that one hundred would answer \u201cno\u201d to both questions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
