He was sentenced as a career offender to a term of 280 months imprisonment. <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4B1.1 (2001). In Bolar\u2019s first appeal, we vacated his sentence in part and remanded for resentencing under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). On remand, the district court determined that the stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>utory maximum sentence was 240 months and granted the government\u2019s motion to reduce the sentence for substantial assistance under Rule 35(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The court reduced Bolar\u2019s sentence by the equivalent of three offense levels and imposed a sentence of 151 months, the bottom of the resulting guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">Bolar\u2019s attorney has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising three issues, but asserting that in her view there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Bolar\u2019s appellate counsel questions (1) the career offender sentence, (2) the district court\u2019s decision to depart downward by no more than three levels, and (3) the prior attorney\u2019s failure to argue that the extent and quality of his cooperation and assistance to the government merited a greater sentence reduction. Bolar has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but he has not filed a brief. We affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">With respect to the career offender sentence, Bolar has not previously disputed his career offender status and the issue was not within the scope of our remand. <em>United States v. Bell, </em>5 F.3d 64, 66-67 (4th Cir.1993) (mandate rule forecloses litigation foregone on appeal or otherwise waived). We find no error in the district court\u2019s failure to reconsider this aspect of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">A defendant may not appeal the extent of a downward departure unless the departure decision resulted in a sentence imposed in violation of law or resulted in an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324-25 (4th Cir.1995). We discern no such error in the district court\u2019s departure in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-7\">Finally, Bolar claims, in effect, that his attorney was ineffective. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel generally should be raised in a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000), unless the record demonstrates conclusively that counsel provided ineffective representation. <em>United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). Here, the nature of Bolar\u2019s assistance was explained by both the government and his prior attorney at resen-tencing. The record does not conclusively establish that Bolar\u2019s attorney rendered ineffective assistance in this respect or any other.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>this court has reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm the conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform her client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
