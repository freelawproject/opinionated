He asserted that he had been confined in \u201cthe hole\u201d for over a year for behavior he cannot control, and that he had suffered hallucinations, devious thoughts, and fear. The district court dismissed the action without prejudice pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), and Mr. Dudley appeals. We grant his request to proceed in forma pauperis, leaving the fee-collection details to the district court. <em>See Henderson v. Norris, </em>129 F.3d 481, 484r-85 (8th Cir.1997) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-19\">Having carefully reviewed the record, we agree with the district court that Mr. Dudley did not state a due process claim with respect to his prison classification or his segregated confinement. We believe, however, that Mr. Dudley alleged sufficient facts to state a claim for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. <em>See Sandin v. Conner, </em>515 U.S. 472, 487-88 n. 11, 115 S.Ct. 2293, 132 L.Ed.2d 418 (1995) (beyond due process, prisoners retain Eighth Amendment protections from arbitrary state action); <em>Beck v. Skon, </em>253 F.3d 330, 333 (8th Cir.2001) (failure to supply medical care can constitute Eighth Amendment violation); <em>Riddle v. Mondra-gon, </em>83 F.3d 1197, 1202 (10th Cir.1996) (states have constitutional duty to provide necessary psychological care to inmates). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Accordingly, we reverse the judgment in part and remand for further proceedings on this claim. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47A(a).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
