Mothershed appeals pro se the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his action against United States Bankruptcy Judge Sarah Sharer Curley, and the district court\u2019s order denying his motions for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>reconsideration. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s dismissal de novo. <em>Moore v. Brewster, </em>96 F.3d 1240, 1243 (9th Cir. 1996). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">Mothershed\u2019s contention that Judge Curley acted in complete absence of jurisdiction when she enforced an injunction issued by another bankruptcy judge lacks merit. <em>See Tanner Motor Livery, Ltd. v. Avis, Inc., </em>316 F.2d 804, 809 (9th Cir.1963) (\u201cEach judge of a multi-judge district court has the same power and authority as each other judge\u201d). Thus, the district court properly held that Judge Curley is absolutely immune from suit. <em>See Stump v. Sparkman, </em>435 U.S. 349, 356, 98 S.Ct. 1099, 55 L.Ed.2d 331 (1978). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mothershed\u2019s motion for reconsideration because he failed to demonstrate any basis for relief from judgment. <em>See Kona Enter. Inc. v. Estate of Bishop, </em>229 F.3d at 883, 890-91 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">We find Mothershed\u2019s remaining contentions unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b300-28\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
