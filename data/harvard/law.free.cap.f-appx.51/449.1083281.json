The Defendants removed the action to federal court, which denied Perez\u2019s motion to remand and dismissed the complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) for the reasons stated from the bench. Perez appeals. We have reviewed the record, the district court\u2019s statements from the bench, and the parties\u2019 briefs. The district court properly found, first, that Perez failed to state a claim under \u00a7 1983 and that, in any event, the Defendants would be entitled to qualified immunity. <em>See Harlow v. Fitzgerald, 457 </em>U.S. 800, 818, 102 S.Ct. 2727, 73 L.Ed.2d 396 (1982). The district court also properly found that none of the statements underlying Perez\u2019s claims were defamatory under Maryland state law. <em>See Bagwell v. Peninsula Reg\u2019l Med. Ctr., </em>106 Md.App. 470, 665 A.2d 297, 317 (1995). Finally, because the district court had jurisdiction at the time it rendered final judgment, we will not disturb its decision to deny Perez\u2019s motion to remand to state court. <em>Aqualon v. MAC Equip., </em>149 F.3d 262, 264 (4th Cir.1998); <em>see also Caterpillar, Inc. v. Lewis, </em>519 U.S. 61, 64, 117 S.Ct. 467, 136 L.Ed.2d 437 (1996) (\u201c[A] district court\u2019s error in failing to remand a case improperly removed is not fatal to the ensuing adjudication if federal jurisdictional requirements are met at the time judgment is entered\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">Accordingly, we affirm. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
