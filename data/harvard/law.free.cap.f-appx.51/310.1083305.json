(collectively Coil\u2019s). Leoutsakos also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike two affidavits supporting Coil\u2019s summary judgment motion. This court <em>affirms </em>the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">The \u2019450 patent relates to a bed rail device for assisting individuals with impaired mobility into and out of bed. Claim 1, the only independent claim, recites:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-11\">1. A manual support apparatus for use with a bed having a mattress portion, comprising:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_2\">a planar plate member;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACi\">a support tube having at least one leg;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-13\">at least one detachable tubular member having an internal bore for slidable receipt of said support tube leg; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVE\">\n<em>detachable means to attach said tubular member to said plate member,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Azh\">wherein said plate member is placed under said mattress portion such that said tubular member is adjacent and substantially perpendicular to said mattress portion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-14\">\u2019450 patent, col. 6, II. 13-25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-15\">On July 27, 2000, Leoutsakos, the owner and named inventor of the \u2019450 patent, filed suit alleging that a bed rail made by Coil\u2019s, known as the Smart-Rail, infringed the \u2019450 patent. Coil\u2019s counterclaimed alleging that the \u2019450 patent was invalid as obvious.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-16\">On January 17, 2002, the district court issued an order construing the meaning of \u201cdetachable means to attach\u201d and granting summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Coil\u2019s.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, the district court found that Coil\u2019s Smart&gt;-Rail device did not infringe the \u2019450 patent because it used welding rather than a \u201cdetachable means to attach.\u201d The district court also denied Leoutsakos\u2019 motion to strike two affidavits in support of Coil\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The district court determined that the affidavit of John O\u2019Brien, Vice-President of HealthCraft Products, Inc., did not contain objectionable hearsay and the affidavit of Steven Kot, a consultant to HealthCraft, was not irrelevant due to Mr. Kot\u2019s status as a Canadian patent attorney as Leoutsakos alleged. On appeal, Leoutsakos argues that the district court incorrectly construed the meaning of the \u201cdetachable means\u201d limitation, failed to hold a Mark-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>man hearing, and improperly denied his motion to strike the affidavits of Steven Kot and John O\u2019Brien.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">This court reviews without deference a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>See Cortland Line Co., v. Orvis Co., </em>203 F.3d 1351, 1355 (Fed.Cir.2000). Whether the accused device contains each claim element exactly, as properly construed, or its equivalent, is a question of fact. <em>See Southwall Techs., Inc. v. Cardinal IG Co., </em>54 F.3d 1570, 1575, 34 USPQ2d 1673, 1676 (Fed.Cir.1995). In reviewing the district court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of Coil\u2019s, this court draws all reasonable inferences from the evidence in favor of non-movant Leoutsakos. <em>See Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). In reviewing non-patent evidentiary issues, this court applies the law of the circuit court in which the district court sits, in this case, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The First Circuit reviews evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion. <em>Cavallaro v. United States, </em>284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">The district court held that the meaning of \u201cdetachable means to attach\u201d is the ordinary meaning of detachable attachment as opposed to permanent attachment. Both the written description and prosecution history support that interpretation. According to the written description, \u201cdetachable means to attach\u201d such as bolts, pins, and clips allow removable attachment. \u2019450 patent, col. 3, II. 47-50. In contrast, the written description teaches that welding is a fixed or permanent means of attachment. <em>Id. </em>at II. 53-55. Nothing in the prosecution history supports deviating from the ordinary meaning of detachable. Thus, this court holds that the district court correctly construed \u201cdetachable means to attach.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">With regard to infringement under the doctrine of equivalents, the district court found that there is no genuine issue as to the substantial dissimilarity between detachably attaching parts, for example by bolts, pins, or clips, compared to permanently attaching parts by welding. Furthermore, the district court determined that prosecution history estoppel barred Leoutsakos\u2019 argument that permanent means of attachment, such as welding, are equivalent to detachable means of attachment. This court agrees. Claim 1 as originally filed included only \u201cmeans to attach.\u201d In response to an obviousness rejection, Leoutsakos amended the claim by incorporating the \u201cdetachable\u201d limitation from dependent application claim 7 into claim 1. Moreover, Leoutsakos argued that the prior art failed to teach or suggest detachable means for attaching. Because Leoutsakos narrowed claim 1 to recite \u201cdetachable means to attach\u201d to overcome the prior art, the district court correctly held that Leoutsakos disclaimed permanent attaching means, such as welding, as equivalent to detachable attachment means. <em>See Festo Corp. v. Shoketsu Kinzoku Kogyo Kabushiki Co., </em>535 U.S. 722, 122 S.Ct. 1831, 152 L.Ed.2d 944 (2002). This court further holds that any failure by the district court to consider whether the \u201cdetachable means\u201d limitation invoked 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 112, \u00b6 6 (2000), is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">Leoutsakos also argues that the district court failed to hold a Markman hearing. Because this court has held that a district court may approach claim construction in any way it deems best, <em>see Ballard Med. Prods. v. Allegiance Healthcare Corp., </em>268 F.3d 1352, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2001), and Leoutsakos raised the issue for the first time on appeal, this court holds that the district court did not commit reversible error. Finally, regarding the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to strike the affidavits of Steven Kot and John O\u2019Brien, this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>has considered Leoutsakos\u2019 arguments and have found them unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">For the above reasons, the district court\u2019s decision granting Coil\u2019s motion for summary judgment of non-infringement and denying Leoutsakos\u2019s motion to strike the affidavits in support of Coil\u2019s motion for summary judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b347-12\">. The district court found that \u201cdefendants\u2019 counterclaim of patent invalidity is moot\u201d apparently because the counterclaim was effectively abandoned by the defendant (appellee). Appellee agrees that the district court\u2019s Order disposed of all claims and \u201dclose[d] the case.\u201d (Appellee\u2019s Br. at 1.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
