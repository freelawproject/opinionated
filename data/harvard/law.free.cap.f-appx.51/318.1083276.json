Cir. R. 27(f) and to dismiss Roy Evans appeal for lack of jurisdiction. Evans has not responded. The court considers whether the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment dismissing Evans\u2019 appeal should be summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">On April 4, 2001, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (BVA) mailed its decision to Evans in which it determined that no new and material evidence had been presented to reopen certain claims. On June 18, 2001, the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims received a letter from Evans requesting that he be sent a notice of appeal (NOA) form, which was sent to him the following day. On August 30, 2001, the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims received Evans\u2019 NOA. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims dismissed Evans\u2019 appeal as untimely because he had failed to file his NOA within 120 days after the date the BVA final decision was mailed. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7266(a)(1). Evans appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-9\">Summary affirmance of a case \u201cis appropriate, <em>inter alia, </em>when the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir.1994) (summarily affirming the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 dismissal of a complaint). The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims correctly determined that Evans\u2019 NOA was untimely and, therefore, properly dismissed his appeal. Thus, because no substantial question exists regarding the outcome of Evans\u2019 appeal, the court summarily affirms the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b355-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b355-13\">(1) The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 judgment is summarily affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-14\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to waive the requirements of Fed. Cir. R. 27(f) moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-15\">(3) The Secretary\u2019s motion to dismiss is moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-16\">(4) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
