Jimerson appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment for the Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>missioner in Jimerson\u2019s action seeking review of the denial of his application for disability insurance benefits and supplemental security income. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo a district court\u2019s order upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits, and we review for substantial evidence and legal error the Commissioner\u2019s decision. <em>Sandgathe v. Chater, </em>108 F.3d 978, 980 (9th Cir.1997) (per curiam). We reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">There is an objective medical basis for Jimerson\u2019s pain testimony, and the administrative law judge\u2019s (ALJ\u2019s) reasons for discrediting the extent of Jimerson\u2019s pain are not \u201cclear and convincing.\u201d <em>See Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 834 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-5\">\u2022 The ALJ relied first on Jimerson\u2019s rating of his shoulder pain at 7 (on a scale of 1 to 10) without medication and at 5 with Vicodin and reasoned that this level of pain was not sufficient to support the claimed extent of interference with the ability to work. However, such \u201cranking ... is of only marginal assistance to a decisionmaker whose own subjective one-to-ten scale may differ significantly.\u201d <em>Fair v. Bowen, </em>885 F.2d 597, 601-02 (9th Cir. 1989).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-6\">\u2022 The ALJ also cited Jimerson\u2019s daily activities, which included personal grooming, reading, watching television, doing laundry infrequently, cooking very little, helping with grocery shopping once a week, riding in a car (once for three days), and driving occasionally. Although a claimant\u2019s level of activity is a proper factor to consider, Jimerson\u2019s activities were so limited as not to be incompatible with his particular claims of excessive pain. <em>See Smolen v. Chater, </em>80 F.3d 1273, 1284 (9th Cir.1996).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-10\">\u2022 The ALJ noted that Jimerson traveled to look for work in mid-1998. On this record it is not possible to say, however, that this effort was extensive enough to be inconsistent with Jimer-son\u2019s claims of excessive pain.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-11\">\u2022 The ALJ faulted Jimerson for his \u201cfailure to thoroughly report his daily activities when he testified,\u201d specifically, his \u201cuse of a computer on a regular basis.\u201d No evidence in the record supports a finding that Jimerson used a computer on a regular basis. The only relevant evidence is that Jimerson met his girlfriend on the Internet; there is no evidence of the duration or frequency of his computer use.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b246-12\">\u2022 Lastly, the ALJ impugned Jimerson for failing to seek regular medical treatment for pain. However, the un-rebutted evidence was that he had not obtained regular treatment because he lacked insurance and lacked the funds to obtain treatment until he learned of SMSP coverage.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">Additionally, the ALJ discounted the testimony of Jimerson\u2019s girlfriend without providing any reasons. That was error. <em>See Smolen, </em>80 F.3d at 1288-89. Indeed, the ALJ acknowledged that the witness, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>\u201cto some extent, corroborated\u201d Jimerson\u2019s testimony about the severity of his symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Finally, the hypothetical presented to the vocational expert to determine Jimerson\u2019s residual functional capacity was flawed because it did not include disabling pain or its effects on sleep and concentration. <em>See Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 793 (9th Cir.1997). Because the ALJ\u2019s denial of benefits is based on a vocational expert\u2019s opinion derived from an incomplete hypothetical, the denial of benefits is not supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 956 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">There are no unresolved issues in the record, and it is clear that the ALJ would be required to award benefits if Jimerson\u2019s excess pain testimony were credited. The ALJ already found that Jimerson was not presently engaged in a substantial gainful activity, that his shoulder disability is severe, that his medically documented disorders reasonably could be expected to produce the symptoms alleged, and that Jimerson is not able to perform past work; the only question in dispute is residual functional capacity, which in turn depends on the extent of Jimerson\u2019s pain. Therefore, remand for further proceedings is unnecessary. <em>Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 <em>F.Sd </em>715, 728-30 (9th Cir.1998). We reverse the judgment of the district court and remand with instructions to remand to the ALJ for an award of benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">REVERSED and REMANDED for award of benefits.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b245-29\"> This panel unanimously finds this case suit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>able for decision without oral argument.

The Commissioner additionally argues that objective medical evidence was lacking and that Jimerson's complaints were inconsistent with medical evidence. The ALJ found, however, based on the medical evidence, that \"[tjhere are medically documented disorders that could reasonably be expected to produce the symptoms alleged.\u201d The disorders included a left hemi-colectomy for gastrointestinal bleeding due to diverticulosis (nonsevere); a history of a myocardial infarction (nonsevere); and osteoarthritis and various degenerative and other changes in both shoulders, which in combination are \"severe.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
