Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>I. <em>Denial of Motion to Suppress Butte County Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">Law argues that the district court erred<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in refusing to suppress the evidence seized from his vehicle in Butte County, Idaho. Collins testified that he smelled marijuana in Law\u2019s vehicle. The district court found his testimony credible. Although the earlier suspicious circumstances may not have risen to the level of probable cause, the officers had probable cause to search after Collins smelled marijuana.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s credibility determination was proper and was certainly not clearly erroneous. Thus, the district court\u2019s refusal to suppress the evidence was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-6\">II. <em>Denial of Motion to Suppress Chubbuck Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">Law contends that the district court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence seized as a result of the stop in Chubbuck, Idaho. Even assuming that the stop was not a consensual encounter and a reasonable person in Law\u2019s circumstances would not have felt free to leave,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the brief time that the officers detained Law to complete the canine sweep did not transform the investigatory stop into a de facto arrest.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">The officers involved in the investigation of Law had reasonable suspicion that Law was involved in criminal activity; therefore, they could conduct an investigatory stop to dispel their suspicions.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Officers told Law that the canine sweep would take only a minute and then he could be on his way. Even including Law\u2019s attempt to distract the dog, the total time of the sweep was about two minutes. There were only two officers and one police dog present. The only force that the officers used was an instruction to Law to remain in the car during the canine sweep. A reasonable person in Law\u2019s circumstances would not have believed himself to be under arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Because the officers had reasonable suspicion to support the investigatory stop, and because it did not rise to the level of an arrest, the district court properly refused to suppress the evidence seized from the vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b737-16\">III. <em>Denial of Motions for Judgment of Acquittal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-17\">Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, we conclude that a rational jury could have found that Law possessed more than fifty grams of methamphetamine with the intent to distribute it.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The evidence at trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>showed that Law was an average methamphetamine user, not a heavy user. Even using Law\u2019s assumptions about quantity based upon the low end of the quantity range, a rational jury could have concluded that Law was carrying only a ten-day supply for his own use. Therefore, the district court properly allowed this case to go to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">IV. <em>Law\u2019s Eighth Amendment Claim</em></p>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Law argues that we should apply <em>Andrade v. Attorney General of the State of </em>California,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> rather than <em>Harmelin v. </em>Michigan,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> to his case. We conclude that, even under the <em>Andrade </em>standard, the district court properly imposed a life sentence. Law\u2019s sentence, although harsh, does not raise an inference of disproportionality sufficient, under <em>Andrade, </em>to trigger application of <em>Solem v. </em>Helm\u2019s<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> three-part test.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Law was convicted of a serious drug offense that the Supreme Court has characterized as violent,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and he has prior felony drug convictions.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Thus, Law\u2019s case differs substantially from <em>Andrade </em>and even under <em>Andrade\u2019s </em>test, it fails. The district court properly imposed the mandatory life sentence without possibility of parole pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 841.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b736-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b737-8\">.
