R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Miller\u2019s request for oral argument is denied, as are all other pending motions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b811-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-16\">John E. Miller, a federal prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his pro se \u201cmotion for temporary restraining order\u201d requesting that the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) be enjoined from collecting the restitution he owes out of his prison earnings. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>Bowen v. Hood, </em>202 F.3d 1211, 1218 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1111, 121 S.Ct. 854, 148 L.Ed.2d 769 (2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-17\">Because Miller challenges the execution of his sentence and seeks relief against prison officials, his action must be brought as a habeas petition pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and, notwithstanding his request to the contrary, we construe it as such. <em>See Tucker v. Carlson, </em>925 F.2d 330, 331 (9th Cir.1990) (stating that a challenge to the execution of a sentence is \u201cmaintainable only in a petition for habeas corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241\u201d); <em>Montano-Figueroa v. Crabtree, </em>162 F.3d 548, 549 (9th Cir.1998) (per curiam) (allowing a federal prisoner to use \u00a7 2241 to challenge the BOP\u2019s restitution policies).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-21\">The district court lacked jurisdiction to consider Miller\u2019s claims because it is located in the district of sentencing, not the district of incarceration. <em>See United States v. Giddings, </em>740 F.2d 770, 772 (9th Cir.1984). Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s denial and remand with instructions for the court to dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction or transfer it to the proper district pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. <em>See Miller v. Hambrick, </em>905 F.2d 259, 262-63 (9th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b811-22\">VACATED AND REMANDED WITH INSTRUCTIONS.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b811-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
