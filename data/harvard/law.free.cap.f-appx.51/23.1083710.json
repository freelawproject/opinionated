It is</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">ORDERED and ADJUDGED that the order of the Federal Communications Commission appealed from in this cause is hereby affirmed for the reasons stated in <em>In re Carlos J. Lastra et al, </em>16 FCC Red 17268 (2001). Accordingly, appellant does not have standing to pursue its claim. Even if the Court were to rule in its favor, Aerco\u2019s alleged injury could not be redressed as there is not an active license left to assign. While the Commission did take an inordinate amount of time to address the assignment application, this delay did not impact the trustee\u2019s ability to return the station to the air. The subject license was automatically forfeited as a result of WTRA-TV\u2019s inactivity over a 12-month period ending February 9, 1997. <em>See </em>47 U.S.C. \u00a7 312(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C.Cir. Rule 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
