After he was attacked by a fellow inmate, Boyd filed a grievance asking that the other inmate be locked down pending investigation. When the grievance was denied, Boyd commenced this action, seeking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>relief for failure to protect him from the assault, inadequate medical care for the resulting injuries, failure to prosecute the other inmate, overcrowding and under-staffing in the prison, retaliatory transfer, and \u201cnumerous violations\u201d of federal and state law. Before dismissing, the district court ordered Boyd to submit proof that he had exhausted all claims. In response, Boyd referred to his expanded description of the incident in appealing the denial of his initial grievance. In these circumstances, the district court properly dismissed the entire complaint without prejudice. <em>See Graves v. Norris, </em>218 F.3d 884, 885 (8th Cir.2000) (per curiam) (\u00a7 1997e(a) requires exhaustion of all available prison grievance remedies as to all claims). Accordingly, we affirm, <em>see </em>8th Cir. R. 47B, and we also deny Boyd\u2019s pending motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">A true copy.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-8\">.
