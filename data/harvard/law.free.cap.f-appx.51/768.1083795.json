He challenges his Califorma convictions for assault with a semiautomatic weapon, evading an officer with reckless driving, and involuntary manslaughter. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-22\">Regarding the assault charge, Harris contends that his due process rights were violated by the trial court\u2019s refusal to give his proposed jury instruction which explained that an intent to frighten or distract was not equivalent to an intent to apply physical force. We are unpersuaded. Harris must show that the omission of his proposed instruction \u201cso infected the entire trial that the resulting conviction violates due process.\u201d <em>Henderson v. Kibbe, </em>431 U.S. 145, 154, 97 S.Ct. 1730, 52 L.Ed.2d 203 (1977) (quotations omitted). In light of all the evidence m the case, because the other jury instructions, taken as a whole, adequately covered the defense theory, the failure to give the proposed mstruetion did not render the trial fundamentally unfair. <em>See Duckett v. Godinez, </em>67 F.3d 734, 743, 746 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-23\">Harris also contends that his due process rights were violated because the trial court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction reduced the government\u2019s burden of proof because an \u201cabiding conviction\u201d implies something less than reasonable doubt. This contention is foreclosed by our decision in <em>Lisenbee v. Henry, </em>166 F.3d 997, 999-1000 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b804-24\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b804-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-27\">.
