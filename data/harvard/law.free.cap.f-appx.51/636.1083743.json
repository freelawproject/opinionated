He appeals, contending that his gateway claim of actual innocence pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>ents an exception to <em>the </em>statute of limitation. This circuit has not heretofore decided the issue raised by Holiday and we see no need to do so in this case. <em>See Majoy v. Roe, </em>296 F.3d 770, 777 (9th Cir.2002). To establish a gateway claim of actual innocence, Holiday \u201cmust show that in light of all the evidence ... \u2018it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have found petitioner guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Carriger v. Stewart, </em>132 F.3d 463, 478 (9th Cir.1997) (en banc) (quoting <em>Schlup v. Delo, </em>513 U.S. 298, 327, 115 S.Ct. 851, 130 L.Ed.2d 808 (1995)). Holiday\u2019s argument that the evidence against him was \u201cthin,\u201d in that it showed only that Holiday and two other men approached the victim, that a ten-year-old girl saw a \u201cshine\u201d pass among the three men, that the victim raised his right hand holding a bottle and that a shot was fired, and further that defense counsel had conducted an inadequate investigation, does not satisfy the requisite showing.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b672-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
