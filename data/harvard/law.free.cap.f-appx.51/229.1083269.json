Royce contends that the district court erred in holding that there was no potential for coverage in the underlying dispute in which Entercom Corporation (\u201cEntercom\u201d) sued Royce for failing to follow through with the sale of a radio station. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-25\">Royce contends that the property damage in this case could have occurred <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>without intent to cause any harm, but recent cases make clear that in determining whether conduct is \u201caccidental\u201d it is irrelevant whether the insured expected or intended the conduct to cause harm. <em>See Quan v. Truck Ins. Exch., </em>67 Cal.App.4th 583, 79 Cal.Rptr.2d 134, 141 (Ct.App.1998) (\u201c[T]he insured\u2019s [purposeful sexual] conduct alleged to have given rise to claimant\u2019s injuries is necessarily nonaccidental, not because any \u2018harm\u2019 was intended, but simply because the conduct could not be engaged in by \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d). Similar to voluntary sexual conduct with unintended consequences, the negotiations for the sale of a radio station at issue here \u201ccould not be engaged in by \u2018accident.\u2019 \u201d Id; see <em>also Stein-Brief Group, Inc. v. Home Indem. Co., </em>65 Cal.App.4th 364, 76 Cal.Rptr.2d 3, 8 (Ct.App.1998) (\u201c[N]onaccidental acts arising out of a breach of contract do not constitute an \u2018occurrence\u2019 within the meaning of a CGL policy.\u201d). Because Royce is unable to meet its burden of establishing that the property damage arose out of an \u201coccurrence\u201d as defined by the Vigilant policy, the district court properly granted summary judgment in favor of defendant on Royce\u2019s property damage claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Royce also contends that Vigilant had a duty to defend it in the Entercom action because the facts extrinsic to Enter-com\u2019s complaint potentially give rise to a covered cause of action for slander or libel under the \u201cpersonal injury\u201d provision of the Vigilant policy. In California, however, once the plaintiff in the underlying action knowingly foregoes the opportunity to plead a particular claim, the underlying claim no longer raises a potential for liability covered by the policy. <em>See Microtec Research, Inc. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>40 F.3d 968, 971-72 (9th Cir.1994); <em>Simply Fresh Fruit, Inc. v. Continental Ins. Co., </em>94 F.3d 1219, 1222 (9th Cir.1996). Although Royce could have been sued for slander or libel, no potential liability flowed from the press release because Entercom elected not to make that claim. Entercom filed its first amended complaint in December 1999, three months after the filing of the press release. Thus, the amended complaint \u201cconspicuously and carefully omits to allege any wrongdoing\u201d with respect to Royce\u2019s press release. <em>Microtec, </em>40 F.3d at 971. Moreover, Royce\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Microtec </em>on the ground that here Entercom specifically said it was going to bring a defamation claim is unavailing. The Ninth Circuit cases construing California law turn on whether the underlying plaintiff <em>could </em>have made the claim but did not do so. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cGreen Hills <em>elected </em>not to make that claim.... Green Hills <em>chose </em>not to sue Microtec for the advertisements.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Royce\u2019s final contention is that because the policy required Vigilant to defend \u201cclaims\u201d as well as \u201csuits,\u201d Vigilant had a duty to defend Royce regardless of whether the underlying complaint was actually amended to include a cause of action for defamation because Entercom\u2019s own statement to the press threatening to sue Royce was a claim. California courts, however, limit the term \u201cclaim\u201d to \u201cdemand[s] for something as a right, or as due.\u201d <em>Phoenix Ins. Co. v. Sukut Constr. Co., Inc., </em>136 Cal.App.3d 673, 186 Cal.Rptr. 513, 515 (Ct.App.1982); <em>see also Safeco Surplus Lines Co. v. Employer\u2019s Reinsurance Corp., </em>11 Cal.App.4th 1403, 15 Cal.Rptr.2d 58, 60 (Ct.App.1992). Royce provides no evidence that Entercom demanded payment or services for Royce\u2019s alleged \u201cdefamatory\u201d remarks, or that it submitted a written claim for libel or slander.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">Because there is no potential for coverage under the Vigilant policy, the district court did not err in granting summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>judgment in favor of Vigilant. The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b265-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
