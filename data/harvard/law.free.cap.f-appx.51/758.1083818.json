We lack jurisdiction and dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-19\">Stewart contends that his appeal waiver should not be enforced because the government breached the plea agreement by failing to file a motion pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e) and because the government\u2019s decision not to file the \u00a7 3553(e) motion was arbitrary and based on gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-20\">The plain language of the plea agreement and testimony from the evidentiary hearing supports the district court\u2019s finding that there was no breach of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Johnson, </em>187 F.3d 1129, 1134 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cPlea agreements are contracts, and the government is held to the literal terms of the agreement.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Khoury, </em>62 F.3d 1138, 1140 (9th Cir.1995) (stating that the government is entitled to negotiate a plea agreement in which a defendant is eligible for a downward departure motion without obligating itself to filing said motion in every instance in which a defendant cooperates).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-21\">Likewise, the record supports the district court\u2019s finding that the government\u2019s actions were neither arbitrary nor based on gender discrimination. <em>See United States v. Burrows, </em>36 F.3d 875, 884 (9th Cir.1994) (\u201cWe review for clear error factual questions concerning the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>ment\u2019s motive and foundation for its refusal to request a departure.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AaP\">Because we find no breach of the plea agreement or unconstitutional motive, we enforce the appeal waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>143 F.3d 1266, 1270-72 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b795-12\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"agu-dedup-0\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
