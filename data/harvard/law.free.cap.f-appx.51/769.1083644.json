The immigration judge denied Peral-ta-Salas\u2019 motions to reopen and reconsider. Peralta-Salas now petitions pro se for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals order dismissing his appeal from the order denying his motion to reconsider. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Although Peralta-Salas argued to the immigration judge that he did not receive a notice to appear before an immigration judge, he now concedes that he signed and acknowledged receipt of the order to show cause to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-6\">Peralta-Salas\u2019 assertions in this petition for review regarding his representation by an \u201cattorney impos[t]er\u201d do not appear to be the same assertions regarding ineffective assistance of counsel raised before the Board of Immigration Appeals. However, to the extent Peralta-Salas does raise in this petition for review exhausted claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, the Board did not abuse its discretion in concluding that Peralta-Salas did not make a sufficient showing to reopen his case. <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518, 525-26 (9th Cir.2000) (BIA does not abuse its discretion by denying motion to reopen based on ineffective assistance of counsel where petitioner does not comply with requirements set forth in <em>Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 637 (BIA 1988), and ineffective assistance of counsel is not plain on the face of the administrative record).</p>\n<p id=\"b806-10\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b806-7\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
