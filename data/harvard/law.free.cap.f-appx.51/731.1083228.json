Reavley, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Fifth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b768-4\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-5\">The Social Security Administration employs a five-step inquiry to determine disability. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 404.1520, 416.920. H\u2019Oar alleges that the ALJ erred at step four by concluding that H\u2019Oar could perform his past job as a laundry worker and erred at step five by concluding that H\u2019Oar could work as a housekeeper or janitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination. The ALJ made specific findings that explained his rationale for why he disbelieved some of H\u2019Oar\u2019s subjective testimony. <em>See Osenbrock v. Apfel, </em>240 F.Sd 1157, 1165 (9th Cir.2001). The record indicates enough material inconsistencies in H\u2019Oar\u2019s own statements to support a finding that his testimony was not wholly credible. <em>See Light v. Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>119 F.3d 789, 792 (9th Cir.1997). Similarly, the record supports the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Dr. Rawlins\u2019s report. Dr. Rawlins used the term \u201cunskilled work\u201d in the generic sense, not in the technical sense found in the Dictionary of Occupational Titles (\u201cDOT\u201d). Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s findings supported the work restrictions included in the hypothetical. <em>See Osenbrock, </em>240 F.3d at 1164-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-7\">At step four, substantial evidence supports the determination that H\u2019Oar could perform his past work as Laundry Worker II (as defined in the DOT). The hypothetical excluded jobs \u201csuch as soldering or circuit board making or precision work such as ... watchmaking.\u201d The vocational expert did not exceed the bounds of the hypothetical by testifying that Laundry Worker II, which requires frequent fingering, was a suitable job. Once the ALJ made a determination at step four, he did not need to reach step five. However, substantial evidence supports at least the finding at step five that the job of housekeeper was suitable.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-11\">The ALJ\u2019s duty to develop the medical record \u201cis triggered only when there is ambiguous evidence or when the record is inadequate to allow for proper evaluation of the evidence.\u201d <em>Mayes v. Massanari, </em>276 F.3d 453, 459-60 (9th Cir.2001). The record included medical reports from eight different health care professionals and physicians at the Oregon Disability Determination Services. It was neither confusing nor ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b768-12\">The judgment of the district court is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b768-22\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
