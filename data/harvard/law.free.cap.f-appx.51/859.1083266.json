(\u201cIntuitive\u201d) and dismissed Brookhill\u2019s complaint. The court ruled in favor of Intuitive after concluding that Intuitive\u2019s accused product does not infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,217,003 (\u201c \u2019003 patent\u201d), owned by Brookhill. <em>Brookhill-Wilk 1, LLC v. Intuitive Surgical, Inc., </em>178 F.Supp.2d 356 (S.D.N.Y.2001). However, in granting summary judgment in favor of Intuitive, the district court did not address or resolve Intuitive\u2019s counterclaim that alleged invalidity of the \u2019003 patent. Rather, in its Memorandum and Order dated November 8, <em>Enercon Ind. Corp. v. Pillar Corp., </em>105 F.3d 1437, 1439, 41 U.S.P.Q.2d 1630, 1631 (Fed. Cir.1997). In this case, Intuitive\u2019s invalidity counterclaim remains unresolved. At the same time, none of the exceptions to the general rule that non-final orders are not appealable, such as when there has been a certification for appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b), is present. We therefore lack jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b895-22\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-23\">1. This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, subject, however, to reinstatement under the same docket number without the payment of an additional filing fee if, within 30 days <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>of the date of this order, a party appeals from the entry of a final judgment on the entire case or obtains a certification for appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b896-4\">2. If the appeal is reinstated, it will be decided by the present panel, based on the briefs already filed and the oral argument heard on October 10, 2002.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b895-18\">. We appreciate that the district court intended its Memorandum and Order to be a final judgment. The fact remains, however, that absent entry of a final judgment that actually does dispose of the entire case, including Intuitive\u2019s counterclaim, we are without jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b896-16\">. We express no opinion as to whether a Rule 54(b) certification should be made, as this is a matter that is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Aleut Tribe v. United States, </em>702 F.2d 1015, 1021 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
