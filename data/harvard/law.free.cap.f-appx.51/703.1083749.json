We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">In California, \u201c[a]n employment, having no specified term, may be terminated at the will of either party on notice to the other.\u201d Cal. Lab.Code \u00a7 2922. Thus, to defeat Lucent\u2019s motion for summary judgment based on California\u2019s statutory presumption of at-will employment, Garcia must adduce admissible evidence of an agreement that he could not be discharged without good cause. <em>See Eisenberg v. Alameda Newspapers, Inc., </em>74 Cal.App.4th 1359, 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 824 (1999). Garcia contends that a triable issue of material fact exists with respect to whether Lu-cent\u2019s code of conduct and progressive discipline policy give rise to an implied contract term that Garcia could be fired only for cause. However, \u201c[a] contract requiring termination only for cause will not be implied if there is an express writing providing to the contrary.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b740-15\">In this case, at least two express writings preclude a contrary implied understanding. First, in 1982, Garcia signed an employment application explicitly stating that he \u201cunderstood\u201d and \u201cagreed\u201d that he could be terminated \u201cwithout any previous notice.\u201d In California, a signed employment application expressly stating that employment is on an at-will basis \u201cprecludefs] the existence of an implied contract requiring good cause for termination.\u201d <em>Camp v. Jeffer, Mangels, Butler &amp; Marmaro, 35 </em>Cal.App.4th 620, 41 Cal.Rptr.2d 329, 334 (1995); see <em>also Tomlinson v. Qualcomm, Inc., </em>97 Cal.App.4th 934, 118 Cal.Rptr.2d 822, 830 (2002) (\u201cThe express term is controlling even if it is not contained in an integrated employment contract.\u201d). Second, in October 1995, Gar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>cia signed a performance appraisal asking \u201cDo you understand and agree to continue to comply -with the Code of Conduct?\u201d The first page of the Code of Conduct stated unequivocally that Garcia\u2019s employer may terminate its employees at any time and for any reason. Like the 1982 employment application, the 1995 performance appraisal constitutes an <em>\u201cexpress written agreement, </em>signed by the employee, [which] <em>cannot </em>be overcome by proof of an implied contrary understanding.\u201d <em>Guz v. Bechtel Nat\u2019l, Inc., </em>24 Cal.4th 317, 100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d 1089, 1103 n. 10 (2000) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">Garcia also claims that, at the time of his termination, he had \u201cprospective and pending sales\u201d for which he received no compensation, although he admits to being paid approximately $300,000 per year for his services. Garcia fails to set forth any specific evidence of work for which he was not compensated. A party opposing a motion for summary judgment cannot rest on conclusory allegations, but must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial. <em>Leer v. Murphy, </em>844 F.2d 628, 631 (9th Cir.1988). Absent specific facts, Garcia\u2019s claim for quantum me-ruit must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">Because the 1982 employment application and 1995 performance appraisal, both of which expressly acknowledge an at-will employment relationship, bar \u201cproof of an implied contrary understanding,\u201d <em>Guz, </em>100 Cal.Rptr.2d 352, 8 P.3d at 1103 n. 10, Garcia\u2019s claim that Lucent breached an implied agreement not to discharge him without good cause fails. Garcia\u2019s claim for quantum meruit is equally deficient. Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b740-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Cir.
