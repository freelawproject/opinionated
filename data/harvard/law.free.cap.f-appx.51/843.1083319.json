R.App. P. 84(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-21\">Michael Ray Warren appeals from his conviction for possession of a firearm after having been convicted of a crime punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)). For the following reasons, we affirm Mr. Warren\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-22\">Prior to entering a plea of guilty, Mr. Warren filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, asserting that 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), the felon-in-possession statute, is unconstitutional under the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in <em>Jones v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). The district court denied Mr. Warren\u2019s motion. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Mr. Warren entered a conditional plea of guilty, and reserved the right to appeal the district court\u2019s dismissal of this motion. Mr. Warren was sentenced to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment and to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-23\">On appeal, Mr. Warren reasserts that his conviction should be reversed because \u00a7 922(g)(1) exceeds Congress\u2019s authority under the Commerce Clause of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number>States Constitution, U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 8. Mr. Warren acknowledges that this argument is \u201cforeclosed\u201d by our decision in <em>United States v. Dorris, </em>236 F.3d 582, 586 (10th Cir.2000) (\u201cThe decisions in <em>Morrison </em>and <em>Jones </em>give no reason beyond what was already present in <em>Lopez </em>to find \u00a7 922(g)(1) beyond Congress\u2019 Commerce Power.\u201d), <em>cert, denied, </em>532 U.S. 986, 121 S.Ct. 1635, 149 L.Ed.2d 495 (2001), which rejected the same argument. Rec. vol. IV, doc. 17, at 6 (Aplt\u2019s Br.). His counsel informs us that he has included the argument to preserve it for further review by the United States Supreme Court. Be that as it may, <em>Dorris </em>nonetheless compels us to AFFIRM Mr. Warren\u2019s conviction and sentence in the instant case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b879-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
