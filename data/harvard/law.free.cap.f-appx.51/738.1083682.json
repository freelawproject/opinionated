Olenzak also contends that O\u2019Keefe falsified his warrant request by omitting such facts, violating Olenzak\u2019s constitutional rights. However, even if the \u201cgap-tooth\u201d description had been included, the affidavit still contained sufficient additional information to support issuance of the warrant. Accordingly, Olenzak fails to meet the standard set forth in <em>United States v. Stanert, </em>762 F.2d 775, 782 (9th Cir.1985). \u201cA defendant challenging an affidavit must also show that the affidavit \u25a0purged of those falsities and supplemented by the omissions would not be sufficient to support a finding of probable cause.\u201d <em>Accord Liston v. County of Riverside, </em>120 F.3d 965, 973 (9th Cir.1997) (citation omitted). Because Olenzak\u2019s threshold constitutional claim fails, there is no need to reach the qualified immunity analysis. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number><em>Butler v. Elle, </em>281 F.3d 1014, 1021 (9th cir.2002) (requiring finding of a constitutional violation before qualified immunity analysis is triggered). Therefore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Officer O\u2019Keefe.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Olenzak\u2019s claim of failure to train and/or supervise also fails, because absent a constitutional violation, no supervisory liability exists. <em>See Lee v. City of Los Angeles, </em>250 F.3d 668, 681 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b774-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
