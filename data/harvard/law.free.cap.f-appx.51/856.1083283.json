Tablerion opposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">The IRS removed Tablerion, a revenue agent, for allegedly threatening to audit a taxpayer (her ex-husband) for the purpose of extracting personal gain or benefit in violation of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998(RRA), Pub.L. No. 105-206, section 1203(b)(10) (now codified as a note to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7804). At issue is a voicemail message Tablerion left for her ex-husband in which she states that if he does not give her certain tax forms relating to their children, she \u201cwill write the IRS and, and, uh inform them to audit your returns.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"auc-dedup-1\">Section 1203(b) provides that, to be actionable, the threat must occur \u201cin the performance of the employee\u2019s official duties.\u201d The arbitrator interpreted this provision to mean \u201cthe Agency must demonstrate that Ms. Tablerion \u2018leveraged\u2019 or misused her official position in order to prove the \u2018performance of official duties\u2019 element.\u201d The arbitrator concluded that the statute at issue was ambiguous and penal in nature and, thus, should be \u201cconstrued most favorably to [Tablerion].\u201d The arbitrator determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-6\">There is nothing about the ... statement that demonstrates a misuse of the Grievant\u2019s position. For example, this is not an instance in which Ms. Tablerion has stated \u201cI will have you audited\u201d or \u201cI will audit you\u201d but rather a circumstance in which she stated \u201cI will write the IRS and ... inform them to audit your returns .... \u201c Indeed, the \u201cI will write\u201d phraseology indicates a lack of control by Ms. Tablerion, inconsistent with leveraging a position. Except for Ms. Tablerion\u2019s status as an IRS employee, there is nothing about her statement that suggests the use of influence or her position and is no different than what might be expected of someone who is not employed by the IRS.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-8\">In sum, I do not find that such a statement \u2014 a statement that could have easily come from a non IRS employee and with no mention or even implication of the use of the position or IRS contacts\u2014 is converted into actionable misconduct within \u201cthe performance of an employee\u2019s official duties\u201d, simply because the employee who made the statement is an IRS employee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b893-9\">The arbitrator further found that Ta-blerion\u2019s statements to her ex-husband were not \u201cthreatening in nature,\u201d relying in part on a subsequent message Tablerion left her husband stating that she \u201cdidn\u2019t threaten to have [him] audited\u201d and that she did not have the \u201cauthority or ability\u201d to do so. The arbitrator applied factors set forth in <em>Metz v. Department of Treasury, </em>780 F.2d, 1001, 1004 (Fed.Cir.1986), a case involving threats of physical harm. One factor the arbitrator considered was whether there was \u201cany conditional nature of [Tablerion\u2019s] statement\u201d to her ex-husband. The arbitrator reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-10\">And, while not dispositive, Ms. Tabler-ion\u2019s statements to her husband were conditional \u2014 the fourth <em>[Metz] </em>factor\u2014 which typically weighs against a finding of threatening conduct.... In that regard, Ms. Tablerion stated only that she would \u201cwrite the IRS\u201d if she did not get back the forms that she had signed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b893-11\">[I]n view of the insubstantial evidence that Mr. Tablerion reacted as if the statement was a threat, or that he was apprehensive that he would be audited because of the charged statement, as well as the evidence reflecting that the statement was conditional ... the Agency has failed to prove that the statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>relied on in its charge was threatening in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">Based on his interpretation of the RRA, the arbitrator ordered Tablerion\u2019s reinstatement with back pay. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) petitioned for reconsideration. The arbitrator denied OPM\u2019s motion and OPM petitioned the court for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">OPM may seek review of an arbitrator\u2019s decision when it determines that the arbitrator\u2019s decision \u201cwill have a substantial impact on a civil service law, rule, regulation or policy directive.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7703(d), 7121(f). This court must independently determine whether an exercise of our jurisdiction is warranted and whether OPM has shown the requisite substantial impact. <em>Devine v. Sutermeister, </em>724 F.2d 1558, 1562 (Fed.Cir.1983). When the interpretation of a statutory or regulatory provision is at issue, it is particularly appropriate to grant an OPM petition for review. <em>See, e.g., King v. Hillen, </em>21 F.3d 1572 (Fed.Cir.1994); <em>Brook v. Corrado, </em>999 F.2d 523 (Fed.Cir.1993); <em>Horner v. Schuck, </em>843 F.2d 1368 (Fed.Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b894-6\">In this case, OPM maintains that because, among other things, it is undisputed that Tablerion\u2019s ex-husband knew she was an IRS agent, the arbitrator\u2019s analysis is faulty and his decision contravenes the plain meaning and purpose of the RRA. OPM states that the arbitrator\u2019s decision will have substantial impact on civil service law, arguing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">First, the arbitrator\u2019s erroneously restrictive reading of the RRA to prohibit statements that threaten audit to extract personal gain only if they also indicate that the speaker exercises control over the audit process deprives the law of its effectiveness. The legislative history indicates Congress\u2019 clear intent to prevent IRS employees from abusing their position and, specifically, to prevent threatening audit to extract personal gain. There can be no doubt that the griev-ant\u2019s statement in this case was of the type that Congress sought to eliminate. Absent reversal of this decision, the civil service law will not be functioning as Congress intended.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-9\">Second, the arbitrator\u2019s application of patently inconsistent standards for analyzing whether a statement constitutes a threat, further weakens the RRA in a way that Congress never envisioned. The clear language of the RRA prohibits statements uttered to extract personal gain. The conditional language of the RRA is clear, yet the arbitrator applied a factor from the <em>Mertz </em>decision analyzing threatening behavior that contradicts the language requiring a quid pro quo in the RRA. The arbitrator\u2019s finding that the grievant\u2019s statement was not threatening based upon the application of a factor that contradicts the RRA\u2019s language substantially impacts the administration of this civil service law because it prevents its application as congress intended.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">Under these circumstances, we agree with OPM that review of the arbitrator\u2019s decision is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b894-13\">(1) OPM\u2019s petition for review is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-14\">(2) The revised official caption is reflected above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
