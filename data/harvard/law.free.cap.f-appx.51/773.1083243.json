Stapleton, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b809-15\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b809-16\">Bao-Hua Dong (\u201cPetitioner\u201d) seeks review of the Board of Immigration Appeals\u2019 (BIA) dismissal of her appeal as untimely and its denial of her consolidated motions to reconsider that decision. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-17\">The Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denied Dong\u2019s petition for asylum on October 4, 1999. Petitioner\u2019s notice of appeal to the BIA was filed on November 29, 2000. The BIA dismissed Petitioner\u2019s appeal because it was untimely and Petitioner had failed to explain adequately the one-year delay. Petitioner filed two motions for reconsideration which were dismissed by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-22\">(1) The time limit for filing a Notice of Appeal with the BIA, like the time limit for filing petitions for review in this court, is mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Da Cruz v. INS, 4 </em>F.3d 721, 722 (9th Cir.1993). Mandatory and jurisdictional time limits are \u201cnot subject to the defenses of waiver, equitable tolling, or equitable estoppel, although there may still be exceptions based on unique circumstances.\u201d <em>Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1188 (9th Cir.2001) (internal quotations omitted). The only circumstances deemed thus far to be \u201cunique\u201d in this or analogous contexts are those in which there has been official misleading. As this court put it in <em>Hernandez-Rivera v. INS, </em>630 F.2d 1352, 1355 (9th Cir.1980), \u201cwhere there has been an official misleading [i.e., by a court or administrative tribunal] as to the time within which to file a notice of appeal, the late notice may be deemed to have been constructively filed within the jurisdictional limits.\u201d Ineffective assistance of counsel has not been recognized as a \u201cunique circumstance.\u201d Cf. <em>Dearinger ex rel. Volkova v. Reno, </em>232 F.3d 1042 (9th Cir.2000). The BIA, accordingly, had no discretion to excuse Petitioner\u2019s untimely appeal from the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>Da Cruz, 4 </em>F.3d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-23\">(2) Moreover, even if the BIA possessed such discretion, its conclusion that Petitioner had not adequately explained a year-long delay was clearly no abuse of that discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-24\">(3) Petitioner\u2019s claim that denying her an appeal based on her counsel\u2019s incompetence would violate due process did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"774\">*774</page-number>confer appellate jurisdiction on the BIA. Such a claim does not justify ignoring a mandatory and jurisdictional time limit on an appellate remedy. Cf. <em>Dearinger. </em>It can be raised, if at all, in a habeas proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b809-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
