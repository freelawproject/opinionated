We recognize that, as in <em>People v. Swain, </em>12 Cal.4th 593, 596, 49 Cal.Rptr.2d 390, 909 P.2d 994 (1996), some possibility of confusion existed with respect to the instructions on conspiracy to commit murder because the jury was not instructed it had to find the specific intent to <em>kill. </em>However, the California Court of Appeal did not unreasonably apply the <em>Brecht </em>harmless error standard to the facts of this case. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (question regarding prejudice is whether error \u201chad substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining jury\u2019s verdict\u201d); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 411, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (\u201c[A] federal habeas court may not issue the writ simply because that court concludes in its independent judgment that the relevant state court decision applied clearly established federal law erroneously or incorrectly. Rather, that application must also be unreasonable.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-11\">Unlike <em>Swain, </em>in which the prosecution repeatedly referred to implied malice to support the murder conviction, in this case the prosecutor argued to the jury that even though it was being instructed on lesser offenses, \u201cwhat this case is about is a willful, deliberate, premeditated murder.\u201d Also, the murder instructions in <em>Swain </em>involved the mental state required for second degree murder, the same crime that was the object of the conspiracy. In this case, the felony murder instructions involved the intent to commit <em>robbery, </em>making it less likely the jury was confused when it deliberated on conspiracy. Furthermore, the jury was told that it had to find Adcock had the specific intent to commit murder, not the specific intent to commit robbery that resulted in a murder. <em>Cf. People v. Avena, </em>13 Cal.4th 394, 417, 53 Cal.Rptr.2d 301, 916 P.2d 1000 (1996) (\u201cthe proper instruction that one can be guilty of <em>murder </em>on the basis of implied malice not involving an intent to kill, did not state or imply that one could be guilty of a crime which requires a specific <em>intent to commit </em>murder without intending to kill\u201d) (quoting <em>People v. Coleman, </em>48 Cal.3d 112, 138, 255 CaLRptr. 813, 768 P.2d 32 (1989)) (emphasis in original); <em>see also People v. Carpenter, </em>15 Cal.4th 312, 391, 63 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 935 P.2d 708 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-12\">We are not persuaded by Adcock\u2019s argument that the potential for confusion was exacerbated in her case by different instructions given with respect to her co-defendant Lockley. We agree with the California Court of Appeal that it is clear from the context of the jury instructions as a whole that the additional instruction was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>given \u201cin connection with the issue of LoeMe/s voluntary intoxication\" and \u201cmerely reinforced the principle that specific intent was an essential element of the offenses,\u201d but did not suggest that a different legal standard of proof applied to Ad-cock.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">Accordingly, we do not believe the California Court of Appeal unreasonably determined that the failure to specifically instruct the jury on \u201cintent to kill\u201d had a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s verdict with respect to the conspiracy charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b671-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
