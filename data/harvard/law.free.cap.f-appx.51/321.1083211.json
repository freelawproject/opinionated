It is</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">Ordered and Adjudged that the petition for review be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 10501, \u201cthe Board has jurisdiction over transportation by rail carrier,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10501(a)(1); moreover, the Board\u2019s jurisdiction over \u201cthe construction ... of spur tracks ... is exclusive,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 10501(b)(2). A \u201crail carrier\u201d is defined as \u201ca person providing common carrier railroad transportation for compensation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10102(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">The Board argues that \u00a7 10501(a) is the only provision granting the Board jurisdiction, and that \u00a7 10501(b) does not expand the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, but only renders the jurisdiction granted in \u00a7 10501(a) exclusive. Under this interpretation, which the Board made explicitly only at oral argument, the Board has jurisdiction only over common carrier track. <em>See Hanson Natural Resources Co., </em>STB Financial Docket No. 32248, 1994 WL 673712 (Nov. 15, 1994). Willis contends that \u00a7 10501(b)(2) confers upon the Board jurisdiction over all track, regardless whether it is used for private or common carriage. This interpretation is implausible on its face, and the Board, in determining that it has no jurisdiction over private tracks, has rejected it. <em>See Oklahoma Natural Gas Co. v. FERC, </em>28 F.3d 1281, 1284 (D.C.Cir.1994). We therefore agree that the Board does not have jurisdiction over this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-17\">Pursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published. The Clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution of any timely petition for rehearing or rehearing en banc. <em>See </em>Fed. RApp. P. 41(b); D.C. Cm. R. 41.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
