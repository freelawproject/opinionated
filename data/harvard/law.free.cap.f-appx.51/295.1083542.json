R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-16\">Petitioner seeks a certificate of appeala-bility (COA) in order to proceed on appeal from the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for writ of habeas corpus brought pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. For us to grant a COA, he must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). When, as here, the claims have been adjudicated on the merits in state court, a habeas petition cannot be granted</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-17\">unless the adjudication of the claim \u2014 (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2254(d). A state court decision is contrary to clearly established federal law-under \u00a7 2254(d)(1) \u201cif the state court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the Supreme] Court on a question of law or if the State court decides a case differently than [the Supreme] Court has on a set of materially indistinguishable facts.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 413, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). A state court decision is an unreasonable application of federal law under \u00a7 2254(d)(2) \u201cif the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from [the Supreme] Court\u2019s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">Petitioner was convicted, on a conditional plea of nolo contendere, of one count of possession of marijuana with intent to distribute in violation of N.M. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 30-31-22(A)(l), reserving the right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress certain evidence obtained as a result of a border checkpoint detention. In state court, as in the federal proceedings, petitioner contended first, that Border Patrol agents lacked reasonable suspicion to justify prolonging his detention at the checkpoint (after determining he was a United States citizen) and second, that the search of the vehicle he was towing exceeded the scope of consent because the agents let air out of the tires, thereby detecting marijuana odor inside those tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">As noted, the state courts addressed petitioner\u2019s claims on the merits, determining that the agents had reasonable suspicion to justify his detention by moving him to a secondary area for further investigation. The state courts further determined that petitioner\u2019s general consent to search both the vehicle he was driving and the one he was towing gave agents the authority to conduct a search broad enough to encompass releasing a small amount of air from the tires.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The district court correctly determined that the state court\u2019s holdings did not meet the strict standards under <em>Williams </em>for granting federal habeas relief. The facts underlying petitioner\u2019s detention clearly complied with the reasonableness test required of an investigative detention under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968), <em>i.e., </em>\u201cwhether the officer\u2019s action was justified at its inception, and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified the interference in the first place.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 20. The circumstances in petitioner\u2019s case included the fact that he did not know who had rented the U-Haul he was driving, nor did he supply documentation for either vehicle in his possession. He also opened the encounter with the agents by immediately using profanity, which the agents thought was suspicious, and he was carrying a small amount of luggage for a relatively long car trip.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The state courts also agreed with the government that petitioner\u2019s general consent to the vehicle search included the right to inspect the tires. This does not constitute an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(2). Moreover, petitioner had a full and fair opportunity to litigate his search and seizure claims in state court, therefore barring him from obtaining habeas relief on this ground under <em>Stone v. Powell, </em>428 U.S. 465, 96 S.Ct. 3037, 49 L.Ed.2d 1067 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Finally, petitioner complains that the district court\u2019s adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s finding and recommendation without a written opinion indicates that \u201cthe district court failed to conduct a thorough de novo review of the state court record.\u201d Aplt. Br. at 8. We disagree. \u201cWe assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>that the district court performed its review function properly in the absence of evidence to the contrary.\u201d <em>Green v. Branson, </em>108 F.3d 1296, 1305 (10th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Accordingly, for these and the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommended disposition filed November 13, 2001, we DENY petitioner\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISS the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-9\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
