Hamilton, United States District Court for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b742-8\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">James Gary Dempsey appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress a firearm as a product of a Fourth Amendment violation. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">Dempsey contends that the officer\u2019s initial seizure of the switchblade was illegal, thus making the subsequent search of Dempsey\u2019s vehicle and seizure of the firearm impermissible. However, based on the circumstances, the officer had an objectively reasonable suspicion that Dempsey was potentially armed and presently dangerous at the time he asked him to exit the vehicle. The patdown was thus legitimate under <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 30-31, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>See Illinois v. Wardlow, </em>528 U.S. 119, 123-24, 120 S.Ct. 673, 145 L.Ed.2d 570 (2000) (noting that for patdowns under <em>Terry, </em>\u201cthe determination of reasonable suspicion must be based on commonsense judgments and inferences about human behavior\u201d) (citing <em>United States v. Cortez, </em>449 U.S. 411, 418, 101 S.Ct. 690, 66 L.Ed.2d 621 (1981)).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">Dempsey also alleges that the officer\u2019s weapons patdown exceeded <em>Terry\u2019s </em>permissible scope. The officer immediately recognized the item as a knife, however, keeping the patdown within the acceptable bounds of <em>Terry. See United States v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 375, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993) (\u201cIf a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">Following the patdown, the officer then lawfully discovered the firearm on the floorboard of Dempsey\u2019s vehicle. <em>See South Dakota v. Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 369, 96 S.Ct. 3092, 49 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1976) (describing the customary practice of securing and inventorying an automobile\u2019s contents when taken into police custody, based in part on the need to protect police from potential danger).</p>\n<p id=\"b742-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b742-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
