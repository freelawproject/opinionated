After many of the claims had been dismissed, including all those under Title IX, defendants moved for summary judgment on the remainder. The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> granted the motion and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. The district court noted that plaintiffs had produced evidence of racial hostility on the part of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>some students in certain incidents, but it concluded that plaintiffs had not made out a case of liability against these defendants. Plaintiffs appeal, arguing that summary judgment was inappropriate because there were genuine issues of material fact. After thoroughly reviewing the record, we conclude the district court committed no error of law and affirm on the basis of its opinion. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b657-25\">.
