R.App. P. 34(f); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is, therefore, ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-17\">Daniel Perez-Rul seeks review of an order of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) dismissing his appeal from the denial of his application for asylum and withholding of deportation. Exercising jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a) (1995), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-18\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b338-19\">Mr. Perez-Rul is a native and citizen of Mexico who seeks review of a final order of deportation issued by the BIA on February 25, 2002. On April 20, 1989, Mr. Perez-Rul entered the United States as a visitor. Because he stayed longer than the six months authorized by his visa, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) instituted deportation proceedings against him, after which Mr. Perez-Rul applied for asylum and withholding of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-20\">On January 10, 1997, an immigration judge (IJ) found petitioner to be deporta-ble, denied his applications for asylum, withholding of deportation, and suspension of deportation, and granted him voluntary departure. Mr. Perez-Rul appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s decisions and dismissed the appeal. Mr. Perez-Rul filed a timely petition for review of this final order of deportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-21\">In his brief in support of the petition for review, petitioner maintains the Board erred (1) when it denied his application for suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(a)(1)(1994) (repealed by Pub.L. No. 104-208 (1996)); and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>(2) when it found that Mr. Perez-Rule failed to establish past persecution and a well-founded fear of political persecution in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">A. Denial of application for suspension of deportation</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">Mr. Perez-Rul applied for a suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244 of the Act. Mr. Perez-Rul now contends that the IJ failed to consider the extensive evidence of the extreme hardship that Mr. Perez-Rul would endure should he be deported. Mr. Perez-Rul maintains that we review the BIA\u2019s determination for an abuse of discretion. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-208 (1996) (IIRIRA) \u201caltered the availability, scope, and nature of judicial review in INS cases.\u201d <em>Rivera-Jimenez v. INS, </em>214 F.3d 1213, 1215 n. 1 (10th Cir.2000). Because Mr. Perez-Rul\u2019s deportation proceedings began before April 1, 1997, and the BIA\u2019s decision was entered more than thirty days after IIRIRA\u2019s enactment date of September 30, 1996, IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules apply. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4); <em>Berehe v. INS, </em>114 F.3d 159, 161 (10th Cir.1997). The transitional rules provide that \u201cthere shall be no appeal of any discretionary decision under section 212(c), 212(h), 212(i), 244 or 245 of the Immigration and Nationality Act (as in effect as of the date of the enactment of this Act).\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(4)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The BIA upheld the IJ\u2019s denial of petitioner\u2019s application for suspension of deportation on the ground that petitioner failed to show he would suffer extreme hardship if he returned to Mexico. \u201c[A] determination by the BIA that one seeking suspension of a deportation order has not shown extreme hardship is a discretionary decision.\u201d <em>Escalera v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 753, 755 (10th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (dismissing petition for review for lack of jurisdiction). Therefore, we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s denial of suspension of deportation under \u00a7 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">B. Denial of asylum</p>\n<p id=\"b339-12\">In seeking asylum, Mr. Perez-Rul maintains that he has demonstrated past persecution and a well-founded fear of persecution by the Mexican government should he return there. To be granted asylum, an asylum applicant must first prove \u201cstatutory eligibility by establishing refugee status.\u201d <em>Woldemeskel v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1185, 1188 (10th Cir.2001). The applicant can demonstrate eligibility by establishing \u201ceither past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,\u201d as manifested by an infliction of suffering or harm which is regarded as offensive and involves \u201cmore than just restrictions or threats to life and liberty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal brackets, quotation marks, and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b339-13\">Our \u201c[ajnalysis of a claim specifically based on a well-founded fear of future persecution includes both a subjective and an objective component.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-14\">The applicant must first prove an objective basis by credible, direct, and specific evidence in the record, of facts that would support a reasonable fear that the petitioner faces persecution. If an objective basis exists, the applicant must show her subjective fear is genuine.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 1188-89 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-16\">We apply a substantial evidence standard to the BIA\u2019s resolution of the first step of an asylum claim.... The BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>determination that the applicant is not eligible for asylum must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole. It can be reversed only if the evidence presented ... was such that a reasonable factfin-der would have to conclude that the requisite fear of persecution existed. We will not, therefore, weigh the evidence or ... evaluate the witnesses\u2019 credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1189 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The BIA weighed the IJ\u2019s evaluation of Mr. Perez-Rul\u2019s allegations. Mr. Perez-Rul, a member of the National Action Party, had received threats from members of the majority party in Mexico, the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI). During a demonstration with about 300 people in June 1988, he had been involved in physical confrontation that required medical treatment. Later in 1988, he received other threats and was \u201cpushed\u201d around by PRI members and told that \u201che should leave\u201d while walking down the street. Rec. at 84 (Oral Decision of the Immigration judge, dated Jan. 10, 1997). He later came to the United States.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">The IJ found Mr. Perez-Rul credible and determined that a physical confrontation during a demonstration where a person is injured is not persecution, nor are the numerous threats he received considered persecution.... There\u2019s no suggestion that he was ever jailed or otherwise abused by the government officials. This simply is not political persecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 85. The IJ also noted that Mr. Perez-Rul was not a party leader and he was never jailed. The IJ rejected Mr. Perez-Rul\u2019s claims of a well-founded fear of persecution. After reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s rejection of Mr. Perez-Rul\u2019s claim. <em>See Woldemeskel, </em>257 F.3d at 1190 (rejecting claim of wellfounded fear of persecution based upon imprisonment that occurred several years earlier and which was followed by several years that were \u201cfree from harassment or discrimination\u201d); <em>INS v. Elias Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (holding that evidence of a guerrilla organization\u2019s attempt to conscript a person into its military forces did not necessarily constitute persecution on account of political opinion); <em>cf. Sotelo-Aquije v. Slattery, </em>17 F.3d 33, 36-37 (2d Cir.1994) (holding that the petitioner had demonstrated political persecution by showing that a guerrilla organization threatened the petitioner on account of his active, ideological opposition).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">C. Withholding of deportation</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">Because Mr. Perez-Rul cannot establish that he is entitled to asylum, he cannot satisfy the more stringent standard required for withholding of deportation. <em>See Woldemeskel, </em>257 F.3d at 1193 (\u201cThe burden of proof for withholding of deportation is, however, significantly higher than that for asylum.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">For the reasons stated above, we DISMISS Mr. Perez-Rul\u2019s application for suspension of deportation for lack of jurisdiction and we DENY his petition for review.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b338-13\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
