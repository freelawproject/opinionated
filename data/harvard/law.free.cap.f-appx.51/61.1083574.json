On appeal, Cramer\u2019s sole challenge is to a special condition of supervised release, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-19\">The defendant shall not possess or use any computer or computer services, unless at work and solely in relation to the performance [of] that job. Any employment which results in the defendant having access to a computer must be preapproved by the U.S. Probation Office including notification to the employer of any third party risks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b97-20\">Our opinion in <em>United States v. Sofsky, </em>287 F.3d 122 (2d Cir.2002), which was decided two days after Cramer\u2019s sentence was announced orally, has likely bearing on the issue presented in this appeal. <em>See also United States v. Peterson, </em>248 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.2001). In order to afford the district court an opportunity in the first instance to consider the bearing of <em>Sofsky </em>(and <em>Peterson), </em>we remand for the district court\u2019s reconsideration of Cramer\u2019s sentence. We make no intimation as to what decisions would be justified upon such reconsideration, and we note that Cramer\u2019s sentence may be entirely reconsidered.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-21\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the sentence imposed by the district court and REMAND for the district court\u2019s reconsideration of the sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
