California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Christopher Lee Moody contests his conviction and 169-month custodial sentence following his guilty plea to brandishing a firearm during a drug trafficking offense (Count Three), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A) (2000), and being a felon in possession of a firearm (Count Four), <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). Moody also noted appeals from the revocation of two separate terms of supervised release. Although Moody was apprised of his right to file pro se supplemental briefs in each appeal, he failed to do so. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">In No. 02-4480, Moody appeals the revocation of his supervised release for his conviction in the Southern District of Florida for conspiring to distribute LSD in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 (2000) and 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) (2000). Because Moody admitted violating the terms of his supervised release and does not challenge the revocation of his supervised release or the imposition of an 18-month sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">In No. 02-4498, Moody appeals the revocation of a term of supervised release relating to his conviction for escape, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 751(a) (2000), imposed in the Eastern District of North Carolina. Because Moody admitted to violating the terms of his supervised release and does not challenge its revocation or the 24-month sentence imposed, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-12\">In No. 02-4500, Moody appeals his 169-month sentence following his guilty plea to the foregoing firearms charges.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, we find no error in the district court\u2019s determination that the base offense level for this offense was twenty-four based on Moody\u2019s criminal history. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2) (2000); <em>see also United States v. Brandon, </em>247 F.3d 186, 188-89 (4th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-13\">We have reviewed the record for meritorious issues and found none. Accordingly, we affirm Moody\u2019s sentence in each appeal. This Court requires that counsel for each defendant inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, counsel may then move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\"> Moody's plea agreement contains a waiver of his right to appeal \"the conviction and whatever sentence is imposed,\u201d by appeal pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(2000), or collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). Because it appears the district court did not specifically review the waiver with Moody in accepting his plea, we have reviewed the merits of his claims on appeal. <em>See United States v. Wessells, </em>936 F.2d 165, 167-68 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
