Because we find no legal error in the District Court\u2019s interpretation of the parties\u2019 contract, and hence no abuse of discretion in its denial of injunctive relief, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-17\">Tasty Fries developed a patented vending machine that prepares, cooks, and dispenses french-fifes. On February 1, 2002, Tasty Fries and Silver Leaf signed a \u201cMaster Sales and Marketing Agreement\u201d (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) granting Silver Leaf an exclusive license to sell, market, and distribute these machines. In return, the Agreement required Silver Leaf to purchase up to 10,000 machines per year. Tasty Fries estimated its manufacturing costs for each machine at approximately $6,500.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-18\">Section 19.6 of the Agreement contains a \u201cLimitation of Liability\u201d wherein both parties waived their rights to seek damages for any breach of the Agreement through lawsuit, arbitration, or any other \u201cformal resolution.\u201d The Agreement provides that Section 19.6 is not applicable to Sections 6.1 (Tasty Fries\u2019 indemnification of Silver Leaf for machine defects), 6.2 (Silver Leafs indemnification of Tasty Fries for any claim that Silver Leaf infringes any third party\u2019s intellectual property rights), and Article 15 (the terms of the exclusive license). The Agreement also states that Section 19.6 is not applicable to \u201cany unauthorized use of the other party\u2019s intellectu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>al property rights,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> but limits the remedy for any use of such rights to injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">Article 17 of the Agreement specifies a two-step process for addressing disputes within the waiver clause of Section 19.6. Section 17.1 states that both parties must use \u201ccommercially reasonable efforts\u201d to \u201cpromptly\u201d resolve any dispute. If a resolution is not reached within ten days, the dispute must be submitted to a \u201cManagement Committee\u201d consisting of a senior executive from each company. Once submitted, the Management Committee is granted an additional ten days to resolve the dispute, after which the matter must be referred to an arbitrator selected by the parties or the American Arbitration Association. However, the arbitration remains subject to the limitation of Section 19.6, precluding an award of damages of any kind. Section 17.3 makes the decision of the arbitrator final, and non-appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">On February 22, 2002, the parties executed a \u201cMilestone Schedule\u201d for Silver Leafs first purchase order in the amount of 10,000 vending machines. Shortly after the Schedule was executed, Silver Leaf allegedly became embroiled in an internal dispute regarding control of the company. On April 1, 2002, Tasty Fries demanded that Silver Leaf provide a letter of credit or equivalent bank financing in the amount of one hundred million dollars as evidence of Silver Leafs ability to pay for the first 10,000 unit purchase order. Silver Leaf refused, stating that Tasty Fries lacked any authority in the Agreement to insist on additional assurances. In response, on April 11, 2002, Tasty Fries sent Silver Leaf written notice of its intent to terminate the Agreement within thirty days unless Silver Leaf complied with the financing demand. On May 6, 2002, Silver Leaf requested a meeting to discuss the financing guaranty, which Tasty Fries declined in writing the same day. On May 10, 2002, Tasty Fries sent Silver Leaf a notice of termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-10\">On the same day as Tasty Fries\u2019 termination, Silver Leaf commenced suit in the Superior Court of the State of New Jersey, and obtained an order to show cause with temporary restraints preventing Tasty Fries from cancelling the contract. The case was removed to the District Court where a hearing on Silver Leafs application for a preliminary injunction was held on May 31, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-11\">The District Court denied the application for a preliminary injunction finding no likelihood of success on the merits because Silver Leaf had waived its right to sue for damages under Section 19.6 of the Agreement. In so ruling, the District Court found that Silver Leafs license did not constitute an \u201cintellectual property right\u201d outside the scope of Section 19.6. In addition, the District Court found that Silver Leaf had not shown a threat of irreparable harm, concluding that damages would remedy any breach of the Agreement. Finally, the District Court found that Silver Leaf, as a newly formed entity without any goodwill, could not rely on the loss of its business as a source of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-12\">The District Court had jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>We have jurisdiction to review the denial of an application for a preliminary injunction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), and on July 15, 2002, granted the Appellant\u2019s motion for an expedited appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">We begin with the well-established framework guiding the issuance of a preliminary injunction. Four factors must be balanced when determining whether a preliminary injunction is warranted: 1) whether the movant has demonstrated a reasonable probability of success on the merits; 2) whether the movant will be irreparably harmed by the denial of injunctive relief; 3) whether the injunctive relief sought will result in greater harm to the non-movant; and 4) whether the injunctive relief sought is in the public interest. <em>Swartzwelder v. McNeilly, </em>297 F.3d 228, 234 (3d Cir.2002); <em>Allegheny Energy, Inc. v. DQE, Inc., </em>171 F.3d 153, 158 (3d Cir.1999). We review the District Court\u2019s balancing of these factors for an abuse of discretion. <em>Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co. v. Winback and Conserve Program, Inc., </em>42 F.3d 1421, 1427 (3d Cir.1994). The factual findings of the District Court supporting each factor are evaluated for clear error, and its findings of law are reviewed de novo. <em>Nutrasweet Co. v. Vit-Mar Enters., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 151, 153 (3d Cir.1999). In this appeal, Silver Leaf challenges the District Court\u2019s conclusions regarding its likelihood of success on its breach of contract claim, and the irreparable harm resulting from Tasty Fries\u2019 termination of the Agreement. We discuss each issue separately below.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-11\">We first address Silver Leafs argument that Section 19.6 is inapplicable to the parties\u2019 dispute because Tasty Fries\u2019 demand for adequate assurances was asserted in bad faith. Silver Leaf cites three actions by Tasty Fries that it argues constitute bad faith: 1) the demand for an irrevocable letter of credit or similar guaranty;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2) the refusal to meet to discuss the demand for assurances; and 3) press announcements and public filings stating that companies other than Silver Leaf would be responsible for marketing the vending machines. At the time of its application for an injunction, Silver Leafs complaint did not allege that Tasty Fries breached the Agreement in bad faith.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-12\">We have \u201cconsistently held\u201d that we will not consider issues that are raised for the first time on appeal. <em>Harris v. City of Philadelphia, </em>35 F.3d 840, 845 (3d Cir.1994). This rule is intended to allow both parties a full and fair opportunity to present evidence relevant to the disputed issues, and avoid surprising one side with new arguments. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Hormel v. Helvering, </em>312 U.S. 552, 556, 61 S.Ct. 719, 85 L.Ed. 1037 (1941)). The rule thus \u201capplies with added force where the timely raising of the issue would have permitted the parties to develop a factual record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Am. Biomaterials Corp., </em>954 F.2d 919, 927-28 (3d Cir.1992)); <em>see also Bollman Hat Co. v. Root, </em>112 F.3d 113, 117 n. 2 (3d Cir.1997) (declining to address new contention that a disputed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>agreement was an unconscionable contract of adhesion).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Nonetheless, we have noted that the rule limiting appellate consideration to issues raised before the District Court \u201cis one of discretion rather than jurisdiction,\u201d and that \u201cwe have heard issues not raised in the District Court when prompted by exceptional circumstances\u201d or where warranted by \u201cthe public interest or justice.\u201d <em>Appalachian States Low-Level Radioactive Waste Comm\u2019n v. Pena, </em>126 F.3d 193, 196 (3d Cir.1997). However, the cases invoking these exceptions involved matters of strong public policy, social interest, or unsettled circuit law. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>(involving payments for the disposal of low-level radioactive waster under inter-state compacts); <em>Selected Risks Insur. Co. v. Bruno, </em>718 F.2d 67, 69-70 (3d Cir.1983) (involving interpretation of state law that \u201caffects every inhabitant of Pennsylvania and the insurance companies that serve them\u201d); <em>see also Wagner v. Pennwest Farm Credit, </em>109 F.3d 909 (3d Cir.1997) (reviewing District Court\u2019s allowance of a private right of action in opposition to numerous decisions from other Circuit Courts). More commonly, therefore, we have found no cause to exercise our discretion to address claims not raised before the District Court. <em>See, e.g., Walton v. Mental Health Ass\u2019n of Southeastern Penn., </em>168 F.3d 661, 670 n. 9 (3d Cir.1999); <em>Cont\u2019l Cas. Co. v. Dominick D\u2019Andrea, Inc., </em>150 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">In the present case, the facts cited by Silver Leaf to support its bad faith claim\u2014 the requested letter of credit, the refusal to meet to discuss the demand, and the public announcements \u2014 were all argued during the preliminary injunction hearing. However, Silver Leafs arguments regarding these factual allegations were directed towards Tasty Fries\u2019 breach of the Agreement, not the invalidity of the exculpatory clause. Based on this limitation, the District Court noted that whether the exculpatory clause is contrary to public policy \u201cmay or may not be clear at this point,\u201d because Silver Leaf \u201cis not attacking [Section] 19.6 as a whole,\u201d as \u201cthere are no assertions for fraud or overreaching, or any assertion of adhesion.... \u201d App. at 17; 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-7\">Finally, the bad faith exception to the general validity of exculpatory contract clauses under New York law is a matter of some complexity. Relevant authorities hold that the question of bad faith is particularly fact sensitive, essentially requiring a finding that one party\u2019s actions have so frustrated reasonable expectations that public policy overrides the express terms of the contract. <em>See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Noble Lowndes Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>84 N.Y.2d 430, 436, 618 N.Y.S.2d 882, 643 N.E.2d 504 (1993); <em>Kalisch-Jarcho, Inc. v. City of New York, </em>58 N.Y.2d 377, 384-85, 461 N.Y.S.2d 746, 448 N.E.2d 413 (1983); <em>Elrac, Inc. v. Giordano, </em>676 N.Y.S.2d 889, 177 Misc.2d 545, 546 (N.Y.App.Div.1998). We have held that where intricate legal and factual findings are necessary, and \u201c[p]articularly where important and complex issues of law are presented, a far more detailed exposition of argument is required to preserve an issue.\u201d <em>Frank v. Colt Indus., Inc., </em>910 F.2d 90, 100 (3d Cir.1990); <em>see also Queen City Pizza, Inc. v. Domino\u2019s Pizza, Inc., </em>124 F.3d 430, 443-44 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">Accordingly, Silver Leafs failure to plead bad faith in its original complaint, and failure to argue the exception in support of its injunction application, makes consideration of this fact-sensitive issue on appeal improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Silver Leaf next argues that the District Court erred in denying its application be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>cause Section 19.6 preserves Silver Leafs right to seek injunctive relief to prevent the unauthorized use of its intellectual property rights. It contends that its exclusive license under Section 8.1 is a \u201ccontract or licensing right\u201d within the definition of intellectual property rights in the Agreement. Tasty Fries\u2019 termination of the Agreement, and its public representations that a third party would market the machines infringed, Silver Leaf alleges, upon its exclusive license, and hence violated its intellectual property rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law to be determined from the language of the parties\u2019 agreement. <em>Ark Bryant Corp. v. Bryant Park Restoration Corp., </em>730 N.Y.S.2d 48, 285 A.D.2d 143, 150 (N.Y.App.Div.2001). The District Court concluded that Silver Leafs license did not fall within the definition of intellectual property rights in the Agreement. Rather, it determined that the Agreement distinguished between the intellectual property contained in the components, design, and packaging of the vending machine, and the sale or marketing of goods embodying those intellectual rights. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">Section 9.5 of the Agreement states that Silver Leaf \u201chas no claim to any of the Intellectual Property Rights in or to the Machine.\u201d Tasty Fries argues that because Silver Leaf holds no claim to \u201cintellectual property rights,\u201d its contractual and licensing rights cannot constitute intellectual property. Silver Leaf counters that such a narrow interpretation of Section 9.5 makes the exclusive license granted in Section 8.1 meaningless, leaving Silver Leaf with no remedy for infringement of its sales and marketing rights. Instead, Silver Leaf argues that a \u201cfair reading\u201d of Section 9.5 is that it merely precludes Silver Leaf from claiming the patent rights to the vending machines. Both parties invoke the principle of New York law that a contract should not be interpreted in a manner that renders one part of the agreement ineffectual. <em>Two Guys from Hardson-N.Y., Inc. v. SFR Realty Assoc., </em>63 N.Y.2d 396, 482 N.Y.S.2d 465, 472 N.E.2d 315, 403 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">We agree with Silver Leafs conclusion that \u201cintellectual property rights\u201d in Section 9.5 refer only to Tasty Fries\u2019 patents, given that Section 9.5 applies only to the \u201cIntellectual Property Rights in or to the Machine.\u201d But that construction does not free Silver Leaf from the terms of Section 19.6, which grants permission to seek in-junctive relief only to prevent unauthorized use of \u201cthe other party\u2019s intellectual property rights.\u201d The relevant question remains whether Silver Leafs license under Section 8.1 is an intellectual property right on its own.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-9\">Silver Leafs sole contention is that Section 8.1 must constitute intellectual property appropriate for injunctive relief, because the purpose of its exclusive license is, by definition, the right to exclude others from practicing within the area of its license. But even if that is true, it does not require us to accept Silver Leafs conclusion: that Silver Leaf is without a remedy for an infringement of its license unless Section 8.1 is deemed an intellectual property right outside Section 19.6. As noted above, the Agreement provides that Section 19.6 is not applicable to Article 15, the reciprocal exclusivity and non-compete provisions prohibiting Tasty Fries from licensing, selling, or distributing the machines to Silver Leafs customers. Article 15, therefore, provides Silver Leaf the right to exclude others by virtue of its exclusive license, and the exemption in Section 19.6 permits the issuance of injunc-tive relief against Tasty Fries during the term of the Agreement and, three years after, for any violation of that right. How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>ever, Silver Leaf has not appealed the District Court\u2019s determination that Article 15 was not applicable because Silver Leaf submitted no evidence that Tasty Fries has sold any vending machines, or other products, to any third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\">Accordingly, the District Court did not err in concluding that Silver Leafs exclusive license is not an intellectual property right within the exception stated in Section 19.6 of the Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">The District Court correctly determined that the Agreement prohibited the issuance of an injunction to prevent Tasty Fries\u2019 termination of Silver Leafs exclusive license. Therefore, we find no abuse of discretion in the District Court\u2019s conclu-</p>\n<p id=\"ArD\">sion that Silver Leaf failed to demonstrate a reasonable probability of success on the merits. As Silver Leafs failure to establish this first element is alone sufficient to render a preliminary injunction inappropriate, we need not consider the District Court\u2019s findings regarding irreparable harm. <em>Nutrasweet, </em>176 F.3d at 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. Section 11 of the Agreement defines \"intellectual property rights\u201d as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b404-7\">[a]ny and all rights in and with respect to patents, copyrights, Confidential information, know-how, trade secrets, moral rights, contract or licensing rights, confidential and proprietaiy information protected under contract or otherwise under law, and other similar rights or interests in intellectual property and all registrations an applications for registrations therefor.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b405-8\">. Although the District Court commented that \"it would seem to me to be apparent that defendant made an unreasonable demand,\u201d it did not separately rule on the commercial reasonableness of Tasty Fries\u2019 request under the New York Uniform Commercial Code, finding that the waiver under Section 19.6 of the Agreement prevented a likelihood of success on the merits.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b405-14\">.
