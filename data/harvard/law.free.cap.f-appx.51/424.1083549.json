He also asks this court to direct the Western District to hold his case in abeyance pending resolution of this appeal. Our review of the record and the pertinent district court dockets reveals that Persson\u2019s underlying complaint was dismissed with prejudice in the Western District following a settlement reached by the parties. This action renders Persson\u2019s claim before this court no longer justiciable. Accordingly, we deny Persson\u2019s motion to direct that his case be held in abeyance, and we dismiss the appeal as moot. <em>See Leonard v. Hammond, </em>804 F.2d 838, 842 (4th Cir.1986). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-24\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
