The district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> granted summary judgment to USPS and NALC, and Cochrane appeals. After careful review of the record, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-20\">The evidence before the district court did not create a genuine issue of material fact on whether NALC had breached its duty of fair representation. First, the record fails to show arbitrary conduct by NALC. Instead, the evidence demonstrates that NALC investigated Cochrane\u2019s claim, and concluded, based upon its interpretation of the collective bargaining agreement and the circumstances of Cochrane\u2019s case, that she did not have a grievable complaint. Further, there is no evidence that NALC acted in bad faith or with discriminatory intent. <em>See Schmidt v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Elec. Workers, Local 949, </em>980 F.2d 1167, 1170 (8th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-21\">As Cochrane was required to show a breach of the duty of fair representation to prevail against either defendant, <em>see Scott v. United Auto., Local 879, </em>242 F.3d 837, 840 (8th Cir.2001), summary judgment was also appropriate on her claim against USPS for breach of the collective bargaining agreement, <em>see Buford v. Runyon, </em>160 F.3d 1199, 1203 (8th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-22\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-18\">. The HONORABLE ROBERT W. PRATT, United States District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
