Brown-Bey was convicted, in two separate cases, of kidnapping, criminal threat, aggravated assault, and the sale of cocaine. After his convictions were affirmed on direct appeal, he unsuccessfully sought habeas relief in the district court. He now challenges certain rulings by the district court and underlying rulings by the state appellate court and state trial court in connection with the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas applications, filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. The district court declined to grant Brown-Bey certificates of appealability (COA) to proceed on appeal, as required by provisions of the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act. Brown-Bey moves for COA on both appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b884-24\">In appeal No. 02-3136, Brown-Bey argues: (1) insufficient evidence on the kidnapping charge, (2) prosecutorial misconduct in closing argument and application of an improper harmless error standard on habeas review of this issue, (3) prosecutorial interference with witnesses, and (4) a due process violation based on newly discovered evidence. In appeal No. 02-3164, he asserts: (1) a due process violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"849\">*849</page-number>resulting from the denial of a request for investigative and expert services, and (2) application of the wrong harmless error standard by the district court. After careful consideration of both appellate records, which include complete state court trial records and transcripts, along with Brown-Bey\u2019s briefs and motions for COA, we conclude that Brown-Bey has not demonstrated entitlement to COA; that is, he has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b885-5\">We comment briefly on Brown-Bey\u2019s harmless error argument in appeal No. 02-3136, because the district court did not specify what standard it applied in denying habeas relief on this issue. Brown-Bey contends, correctly, that the proper harmless standard on habeas review comes from <em>Kotteakos v. United States, </em>328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946). This was made clear by the Supreme Court in <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993), where it rejected use of the \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard from <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), in the habeas context. In the underlying criminal case, the state appellate court, on direct review of Brown-Bey\u2019s conviction, properly applied the <em>Chapman </em>\u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt\u201d standard to Brown-Bey\u2019s prosecutorial misconduct issue. However, on habeas review, the district court did not expressly apply the <em>Kotteakos/Brecht </em>standard in reaching its conclusion that the state appellate court\u2019s ruling was not an unreasonable application of the law or facts. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). Brown-Bey argues here that application of the proper standard would entitle him to habeas relief. However, as this court has recently noted, the <em>Kottea-kos/Brecht </em>standard is a less demanding standard than the <em>Chapman </em>standard. <em>Herrera v. Lemaster, </em>301 F.3d 1192, 1197 (10th Cir.2002). Therefore, Brown-Bey has nothing to gain by its application to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b885-7\">Brown-Bey\u2019s requests for COA to proceed on appeal are denied, and these appeals are dismissed. The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b884-17\"> These cases are unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
