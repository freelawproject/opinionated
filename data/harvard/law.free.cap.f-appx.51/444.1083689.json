Simpson seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s order denying relief on his petition filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. An appeal may not be taken in a habeas corpus proceeding unless a circuit justice or judge issues a certificate of appealability. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c)(1) (2000). When, as here, a district court dismisses a \u00a7 2241 petition solely on procedural grounds, a certificate of appealability will not issue unless the petitioner can demonstrate both \u201c(1) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right\u2019 and (2) \u2018that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u2019\u201d <em>Rose v. Lee, </em>252 F.3d 676, 684 (4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000)). We have reviewed the record and conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Simpson has not made the requisite showing. <em>See Simpson v. Rushton, </em>No. CA-01-1637-3-22BC (D.S.C. Aug. 6, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
