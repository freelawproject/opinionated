Ruiz was convicted in California state court of first degree murder in the beating death of Bryson Blackman. During trial, Ruiz testified that on the evening of the beating, he was looking for an individual named DeVon Briddick who owed him money, and wanted only to ask Blackman if he knew where Briddick was. During cross-examination, the prosecutor asked Ruiz about Briddick, who had by then been shot to death in a different incident. Police reports on Briddick\u2019s shooting contained statements from Briddick\u2019s family members suggesting that Briddick had been shot because he had taken money from Ruiz.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-14\">The following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-15\">Q: DeVon Briddick took your money and didn\u2019t give it back to you, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-16\">A: Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-17\">Q: And DeVon Briddick went to L.A. and took Bryson with him, didn\u2019t he?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-18\">A: I don\u2019t know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-19\">Q: DeVon Briddick took Bryson Black-mon [sic] to L.A. and spent your money in L.A. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-20\">A: I don\u2019t know. If that\u2019s what it is, it is. I don\u2019t know;. That\u2019s the first time I hear this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-21\">Q: DeVon Briddick got shot because of that. Isn\u2019t that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-22\">A: Because of what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-23\">Q: Because of taking your money and going to L.A. with Bryson Black-mon [sic] and spending it in L.A.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-24\">A: I don\u2019t think so. The first time I found out about him getting shot because of me was on the reports. That\u2019s my first time ever having knowledge of that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b669-25\">Q: What did you say? The first time you heard that DeVon was shot be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>cause of you was in the police reports?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b670-4\">A: Yes \u2014.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">On appeal, Ruiz argues that the prosecutor\u2019s references to the shooting of Briddick so infected his trial with unfairness as to make his conviction a denial of due process. <em>See Darden v. Wainwrigkt, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986). The misconduct, however, was limited to three improper questions during the course of a lengthy trial. The questions did not directly implicate Ruiz in the shooting of Briddick, and Ruiz consistently denied any personal knowledge of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">In addition, the trial court sustained defense counsel\u2019s objection, specifically admonished the jury that the prosecutor\u2019s questions were improper, and struck the questions. The trial court further asked the jurors if they were able to follow the admonition and requested both counsel to observe the jurors\u2019 reaction during the inquiry so that a follow-up inquiry could be conducted in chambers if necessary. None of the jurors indicated an inability to follow the admonition.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-7\">We place the prosecutor\u2019s questions in the context of the entire trial, <em>see Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987), and also take into account the trial court\u2019s care in avoiding prejudice to the defendant by giving a proper curative instruction. <em>Id. </em>at 766 n. 8 (\u2018We normally presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard inadmissible evidence inadvertently presented to it, unless there is an \u2018overwhelming probability\u2019 that the jury will be unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions, and a strong likelihood that the effect of the evidence would be \u2018devastating\u2019 to the defendant.\u201d) (citations omitted). We conclude that the district court appropriately found no due process violation on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"AyH\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"Ayn\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
