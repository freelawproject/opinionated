Bright, United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b685-7\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>***</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b685-8\">Sanchez-Rodriguez petitions for review of the Board of Immigration Appeal\u2019s (\u201cBIA\u201d) order finding her removable under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRI-RA\u201d). Petitioner asserts that application to her of rules promulgated under the IIRIRA was impermissibly retroactive, and that the statute violates equal protection. Finally, Sanchez-Rodriguez argues that the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act of 1997 (\u201cNA-CARA\u201d) \u00a7 203, which permits certain aliens to apply for special rule cancellation of removal in accordance with the more lenient terms of pre-IIRIRA suspension of deportation law, violates equal protection by making distinctions between nationalities.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-9\">Because <em>Jimenez-Angeles v. Ashcroft, </em>291 F.3d 594 (9th Cir.2002), <em>Hernandez-Mezquita v. Ashcroft, </em>293 F.3d 1161 (9th Cir.2002), and <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001), foreclose Sanchez-Rodriguez\u2019 claims, we deny her petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-10\">In <em>Jimenez-Angeles </em>we conducted a detailed analysis of a similar claim, measured against the Supreme Court\u2019s test under <em>INS v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). The permanent rules under IIRIRA were not imper-missibly retroactive.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-15\">The permanent rules apply to Sanchez-Rodriguez because the INS commenced removal proceedings against her after April 1, 1997. <em>See </em>IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c); <em>Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 597; <em>Hemandez-Mezquita, </em>293 F.3d at 1162-63. Sanchezr-Rodriguez gave up no valuable legal right and did not have any legally cognizable \u201csettled expectation\u201d in the ability to apply for the discretionary relief of suspension of deportation under pre-IIRIRA law. <em>Cf. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-16\">We also reject Sanchez-Rodriguez\u2019 arguments that NACARA and IIRIRA violate equal protection. \u201c \u2018Line drawing decisions\u2019 made by Congress or the President in the context of immigration and naturalization must be upheld if they are rationally related to a legitimate government purpose.\u201d <em>Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 603. To prevail on her equal protection challenge, she \u201cmust show that the classification is \u2018wholly irrational.\u2019\u201d <em>Hernandez-Mezquita, </em>293 F.3d at 1163. \u201cChallengers have the burden to negate \u2018every conceivable basis which might support [a legislative classification] whether or not the basis has a foundation in the record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hernandez-Mezquita, </em>293 F.3d at 1164 (alteration in original) (quoting <em>Heller v. Doe, </em>509 U.S. 312, 320-21, 113 S.Ct. 2637, 125 L.Ed.2d 257 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b685-17\">Sanchez-Rodriguez, a Guatemalan who did not satisfy the requirements under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>NACARA to be eligible for special rule cancellation of removal, claims that NA-CARA violates equal protection because the \u201crequirements for Salvadorans and persons from former Eastern bloc countries are markedly different than for Guatemalans.\u201d But we have held that \u201cNA-CARA easily satisfies the rational basis test.\u201d <em>Jimenez-Angeles, </em>291 F.3d at 602-03 (quoting <em>Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 517); <em>see also Hernandez-Mezquita, </em>293 F.3d at 1164-65 (holding that Congress had a rational basis for providing relief under \u201ccategory II\u201d of NACARA \u00a7 203 only to those Salvadorans who have applied for asylum, as well as with respect to the April 1, 1990 cutoff date for filing asylum).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-4\">Sanchez-Rodriguez also argues that IIRIRA violates equal protection because it makes \u201can irrational distinction between similarly situated persons based solely when their Immigration Court case commenced.\u201d But she fails to \u201cnegate every conceivable basis\u201d which might support this line-drawing. Furthermore, even if the INS had commenced deportation against Sanchez-Rodriguez on or before April 1, 1997, she would still be ineligible for suspension of deportation under the transitional rules because the stop-time rule would prevent her from attaining seven years of continuous physical presence as required to be entitled to that relief under pre-IIRIRA law. <em>See Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 518 (holding that application of the stop-time rule to transitional rule cases generally does not violate equal protection).</p>\n<p id=\"b686-5\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b685-18\"> xhis disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
