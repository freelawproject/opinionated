R.App. P. 34(a)(2). Accordingly, we deny Cushnie's request for oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b787-28\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-29\">Douglas F. Cushnie appeals pro se the judgment of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (\u201cCNMI\u201d) dismissing his claim that his constitutional rights were violated during the contempt proceedings eonduet-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>ed by the CNMI Superior Court. Under 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1824, our jurisdiction over appeals from the CNMI Supreme Court is limited to \u201ccases involving the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States.\u201d We review de novo claims of due process violations, <em>Bird v. Glacier Elec. Coop., Inc., </em>255 F.3d 1136, 1140 (9th Cir.2001), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-4\">The CNMI Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion that it lacked jurisdiction to review the trial court\u2019s original imposition of sanctions was based on local law, so we lack jurisdiction to review that conclusion. <em>See Milne v. Hillblom, </em>165 F.3d 733, 736 (9th Cir.1999) (holding Ninth Circuit will not impose a federal question when valid provisions of local law justify CNMI Supreme Court decision). Moreover, Cushnie may not raise in this court constitutional claims that he did not timely raise before the CNMI Supreme Court. <em>See Charfauros v. Bd. of Elections, </em>249 F.3d 941, 957 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Cushnie\u2019s contention that the original sanctions order and the ensuing contempt proceedings violated his rights under the CNMI Constitution because actions to enforce provisions of the CNMI Constitution do not involve matters of federal law. <em>See Sablan v. Manglona, </em>938 F.2d 970, 971-72 (9th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Cushnie\u2019s contention that the CNMI Superior Court\u2019s contempt proceedings violated his federal due process rights fails because he was given notice and an opportunity to be heard. <em>See Pac. Harbor Capital, Inc. v. Carnival Air Lines, Inc., </em>210 F.3d 1112, 1120 (9th Cir.2000). Cushnie also contends that the CNMI Supreme Court violated his equal protection rights by establishing a different standard of proof in contempt proceedings for attorneys and non-attorneys. The CNMI Supreme Court made no such distinction.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-9\">We deny Appellee\u2019s request for sanctions and costs pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 38 and for attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 39, without prejudice to the filing of such motions in accordance with Fed. R.App. P. 38 and Ninth Circuit Rule 39-1.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b787-31\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to <em>or </em>by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
