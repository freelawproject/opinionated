We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">The principles governing double jeopardy after a mistrial are set out in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982). As a general rule, when a defendant requests a mistrial, there is no double jeopardy. <em>Id. </em>at 673, 102 S.Ct. 2083. However, there is an exception to the rule when the \u201cprosecutor\u2019s actions giving rise to the motion for mistrial were done \u2018in order to goad the [defendant] into requesting a mistrial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Dinitz, </em>424 U.S. 600, 611, 96 S.Ct. 1075, 47 L.Ed.2d 267 (1976)). A mistrial does not bar retrial \u201cunless the defendant can show that the conduct giving rise to the successful motion for a mistrial was intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial.\u201d <em>United States v. McKoy, </em>78 F.3d 446, 449 (9th Cir.1996). When we consider the prosecutor\u2019s intent, we focus on the strength with which the government fought the mistrial and the strength <em>of </em>the government\u2019s case at the time of the mistrial. <em>See id. </em>Here, the government strongly opposed the mistrial, argued vehemently that the court adopted the wrong legal standard when it granted the mistrial, and provided evidence that it had a strong case at the time of the mistrial. We conclude that the government did not goad Castro-Zepeda into calling for a mistrial and that Castro-Zepeda\u2019s double jeopardy claim fads.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-20\">We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of an evidentiary hearing to determine the prosecutor\u2019s intent when Castro-Zepeda\u2019s mistrial motion was granted. The standard \u201cexamines the intent of the prosecutor,\u201d by inferring \u201cthe existence or nonexistence of intent from objective facts and circumstances ... a familiar process in our criminal justice system.\u201d <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. at 675, 102 S.Ct. 2083. Given the prosecution\u2019s strong challenge to the mistrial and the strength of its case, it was beyond doubt that the prosecutor acted in good faith,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and did not improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>\u201cgoad\u201d the defendant into seeking mistrial. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the requested evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b689-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b689-18\">. We decline to accept the government\u2019s invitation that we reexamine and clarify the scope of our decision in <em>United States v. Vega, </em>188 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir.1999), which addresses Rule 404(b) of the Federal Rules of Evidence. The scope of Rule 404(b) is not squarely presented by this case. We comment only that we see no prosecutorial misconduct or inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tional impropriety in the failure to disclose impeachment evidence that was held by the district court to contravene Rule 404(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
