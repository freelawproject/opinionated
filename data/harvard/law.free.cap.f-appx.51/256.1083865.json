He has the burden of showing that a constitutional error had a \u201csubstantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The introduction of juror \u201cexpert\u201d medical opinion bore on a critical issue in the case. However, the weight of the evidence against Akhmad was such that any error was harmless, and did not have a substantial and injurious effect on the jury\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-21\">Akhmad also alleges prejudicial prosecu-torial misconduct. The prosecutor\u2019s remarks to the jury during closing argu-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>merits, however, were fair inferences to be drawn from the record and did not render the trial \u201cso infected ... with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Darden v. Wainmight, </em>477 U.S. 168, 181, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Any references to evidence not presented at trial did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">Nor did Akhmad\u2019s lawyer render ineffective assistance at trial. The defense attorney\u2019s decision not to retain a medical expert was tactical, and therefore did not constitute deficient performance under <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Further, counsel\u2019s failure to uncover evidence that may have impeached a government witness was harmless given the weight of the evidence, and the cumulative nature of the testimony given by the witness in question. <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Finally, Akhmad claims a violation of state-law rules in the process leading to his indictment by a grand jury. However, federal habeas relief is not available for a claim based on state law. <em>Bonillas v. Hill, </em>134 F.3d 1414, 1417 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b292-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
