He contends that the ALJ erred by (1) finding his testimony not credible, and by (2) not considering the lay testimony of Thanh Chu (\u201cChu\u201d) in evaluating his residual functional capacity or giving specific reasons for rejecting Chu\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and therefore vacate the district court\u2019s judgment and remand for further proceedings consistent with this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court order affirming an ALJ\u2019s denial of disability benefits. <em>Thomas v. Barnhart, </em>278 F.3d 947, 954 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-8\">The ALJ concluded that Nguyen\u2019s \u201cstatements concerning his impairment and its impact on his ability to work are not entirely credible.\u201d A review of the administrative record, in particular the transcript of the hearing, suggests, however, that there were language barriers precluding an accurate credibility determination. We conclude that the ALJ\u2019s credibility ruling with respect to Nguyen was erroneous in light of his apparent inability to understand Nguyen\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-9\">Moreover, the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is not supported by substantial evidence. For example, Nguyen\u2019s statements that he had no appetite, thought about suicide, suffered from insomnia, and preferred to be alone most of the time were consistent with both medical reports and Chfi\u2019s testimony regarding Nguyen\u2019s depression and its effect on his ability to work. Similarly, Nguyen\u2019s comment that he could not stand up by himself and that his leg injury was worsening was consistent with medical reports stating that he could stand for only a few hours per day.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-12\">On remand, the ALJ should obtain the assistance of a translator fluent in Vietnamese and reevaluate Nguyen\u2019s testimony in light of the other evidence in the administrative record regarding his various medical conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-14\">Nguyen also argues that it was error for the ALJ to disregard Chu\u2019s lay testimony regarding the extent of his mental impairment. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-15\">\u201c[L]ay witness testimony as to a claimant\u2019s symptoms or how an impairment affects ability to work <em>is </em>competent evidence, and therefore <em>cannot </em>be disregarded without comment.\u201d <em>Nguyen v. Chater, </em>100 F.3d 1462, 1467 (9th Cir.1996) (italics in original and internal citations omitted); <em>see also Regennitter v. Comm\u2019r of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>166 F.3d 1294, 1298-99 (9th Cir.1999) (\u201cEven if contradicted by another doctor, the opinion of an examining doctor can be rejected only for specific and legitimate reasons that are supported by substantial evidence in the record.\u201d); <em>Dodrill v. Shalala, </em>12 F.3d 915, 918-19 (9th Cir,1993) (\u201c[W]e have held that friends and family members in a position to observe a claimant\u2019s symptoms and daily activities are competent to testify as to [his] condition.\u201d). \u201cIf the ALJ wishes to discount the testimony of the lay witnesses, he must give reasons that are ger<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>mane to each witness.\u201d <em>Dodrill, </em>12 F.3d at 919.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Chu submitted a written statement in which he opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b798-5\">I do not think that Quan can work, because of his health, his leg and his mind. He doesn\u2019t remember things. He forgets. He is too sad. He says he wants to die, and that he doesn\u2019t like living. If I was a supervisor, I wouldn\u2019t hire him because of these problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">The ALJ disregarded this testimony without comment. We hold that Chu\u2019s testimony was relevant to a determination of Nguyen\u2019s residual functional capacity and that it was reversible error for the ALJ to disregard this testimony without providing legitimate reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">On remand, the ALJ must reconsider Chu\u2019s testimony that Nguyen was incapable mentally to perform his prior work duties. If the ALJ determines that Chu is not credible, he must state the reasons for this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-9\">We reverse and remand to the district court to remand to the ALJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b797-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b797-16\">. In light of our determination on the credibility issue, we find it unnecessary to reach the other issues Nguyen raises on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
