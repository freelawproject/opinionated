Bartlett (\u201cthe appellant\u201d) seeks review of the initial decision and final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) affirming the decision of the Department of the Interior (\u201cagency\u201d) to deny Bartlett\u2019s request for firefighter retirement benefits under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336 as untimely filed and not excused by circumstances beyond Bartlett\u2019s control. Because the Board\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">The appellant was employed as a firefighter with the Department of the Interi- or between the years of 1963 and 1998. The appellant began his career as a seasonal employee and ended it as a realty specialist at the GG-11 level.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">In 1980, the appellant received a memorandum from the agency notifying him of the existence of retirement benefits under the Civil Service Retirement System (\u201cCSRS\u201d), codified at 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8336. The letter included a worksheet and instructions on how to apply for coverage under the program. In 1994, Billy Stilson, who worked on the appellant\u2019s fire crew in 1971, informed the appellant that he would be retiring and receiving benefits under the retirement system. In March 1999, the appellant became aware of a website maintained by the Firefighter and Law Enforcement Retirement Team, which discussed retirement benefits and the deadline for filing a claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-9\">On May 11, 1999, the appellant filed a claim with the agency requesting retirement benefits for his previous years of employment. The agency denied the appellant\u2019s request for coverage for the years prior to May 11, 1998, as untimely filed, under the deadlines mandated by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.908(e) (1989) and 5 C.F.R \u00a7 831.906(e) (2002). Under the 1989 regulations, applicants were required to request credit for periods of employment served prior to September 30, 1989, on or before that date. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.908(e) (1989). Under the current regulations, applicants are required to request credit for employment within one year of completing the year of employment for which benefits are requested. 5 C.F.R. 831.906(e) (2002). The regulation allows an agency head to extend the time limit for filing, \u201cwhen, in the judgment of such agency head ... the individual shows that he or she was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.908(f) (2002); <em>accord </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.908(e) (1989). The agency denied the appellant\u2019s request for coverage, because he had filed his claim on May 11, 1999, well after the September 30, 1989, deadline for years served prior to that date, and after the one year time limit for years served after 1989. The agency found that the delay in requesting coverage was not caused by circumstances beyond the appellant\u2019s control.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-12\">On April 12, 2000, the appellant appealed the agency\u2019s decision to the Board. In an initial decision, the administrative judge affirmed the agency\u2019s decision. <em>Bartlett v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>No. DE-0831-00-0274-I-1, 91 M.S.P.R. 664 (M.S.P.B. May 15, 2001) (\u201cInitial Decision\u201d). The administrative judge determined that the appellant was aware of his status and of the availability of firefighter retirement benefits \u201cat least since 1994.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. The administrative judge considered the appellant\u2019s contention that he was confused about his eligibility to receive benefits, but determined that due diligence required the appellant to \u201cseek information or make <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>some attempt to clarify his rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The administrative judge held that \u201c[a]l-though good cause for a late filing can be found if an employee is unaware of his status or the benefits,\u201d the appellant\u2019s failure to seek further information meant that he was not prevented by circumstances beyond his control from filing in a timely manner. <em>Id. </em>at 9. The administrative judge therefore affirmed the decision of the agency dismissing the appellant\u2019s application as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">On March 28, 2002, the Board denied review. <em>Bartlett v. Dep\u2019t of the Interior, </em>No. DE-0831-00-0274-I-1, 91 M.S.P.R. 664 (M.S.P.B. March 28, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The appellant timely sought review in this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">We sustain a decision of the Board unless it is found to be \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-9\">There is no question but that the appellant\u2019s request for credit for past service was untimely filed. The only issue is whether the Board\u2019s determination that the appellant was not \u201cprevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making the request within the time limit,\u201d was based on substantial evidence. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 831.906(f) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">Under our precedent, whether the appellant\u2019s late filing is excused by circumstances beyond his control turns on whether he was on \u201cconstructive notice\u201d of the existence of the retirement benefits system and of the necessity to file an application for credit for his prior years of employment. <em>Stearn v. Dep\u2019t of Navy, </em>280 F.3d 1376, 1384-85 (Fed.Cir.2002). The Board found that, based on record and hearing testimony, the appellant was actually aware of the requirements \u201cat least since 1994,\u201d when his former colleague Billy Stilson informed him that he would be retiring that year under the firefighter enhanced benefits system. Initial Decision at 5-7. The record also indicates that the appellant received a memorandum from the agency in 1980, which explained the retirement benefits system and included a worksheet and instructions on how to apply for coverage under the program. Finally, the administrative judge found that the appellant \u201cadmitted that he was aware of his retirement status and was also aware that firefighters could apply for enhanced retirement benefits.\u201d Initial Decision at 6. Because a reasonable person could conclude from this evidence that the appellant was aware of the retirement system and the necessity to file for benefits from at least 1994, the administrative judge\u2019s finding on this issue was based on substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">The appellant also contended before the Board that, despite his awareness of the retirement system and the necessity to file for credit for past years of service, he failed to file in a timely manner because he was confused about his eligibility to receive benefits under the program. The administrative judge concluded that this confusion did not constitute circumstances beyond the appellant\u2019s control, because he did not seek further information to clarify his rights. We have held that lack of knowledge is not a ground for waiver of the time limit under the regulations, when the employee has received notice of the availability of retirement benefits. <em>Stearn, </em>280 F.3d at 1385.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-13\">Finally, the appellant contends that he was misled by the agency in that he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>told falsely that he was being recommended for \u201cspecial fire retirement\u201d and that it \u201cwould be effective in two to three months.\u201d (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 3.) Misleading statements by the agency such as the appellant alleges might well constitute circumstances beyond an applicant\u2019s control that would justify a waiver of the filing deadline. However, the administrative judge did not make any finding with regard to whether the appellant was misled by any person at the agency. Unfortunately, there is no transcript of the hearing. However, the appellant does not claim that he presented any documentary or testimonial evidence at the Board hearing to demonstrate that he was misled. Indeed, the appellant concedes that the \u25a0witness he called at the hearing \u201cconveniently \u2018did not remember\u2019 \u201d making the allegedly misleading statement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Given the Board\u2019s findings that the appellant had been aware of the retirement system since at least 1994 and that he had faded to seek further information to clarify his rights, it was reasonable for the Board to conclude that the appellant\u2019s late filing was not occasioned by circumstances beyond his control.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-6\">For the forgoing reasons, the order of the Board is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b346-8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
