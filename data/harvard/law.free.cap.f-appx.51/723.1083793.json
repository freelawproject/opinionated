Notwithstanding the waiver of his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>appeal, Ayon has appealed on several grounds. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and affirm, except as to his Apprendi-related claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-4\">As the validity of Ayon\u2019s waiver determines whether we can consider his weapons enhancement and downward departure claims of error, we address this issue first. Ayon claims the waiver was impermissibly vague and lacking in consideration because the government and district court failed to adequately explain what appeal rights Ayon waived and because the government\u2019s agreement to recommend dismissal of some counts, as well as a three-level sentence decrease for acceptance of responsibility, was essentially \u201cmeaningless.\u201d We reject those claims. We have repeatedly held that \u201c[t]he sole test of a waiver\u2019s validity is whether it was made knowingly and voluntarily.\u201d <em>United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1182 (9th Cir.2000); <em>see also United States v. Anglin, </em>215 F.3d 1064, 1066 (9th Cir.2000). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary, we consider \u201cthe express language of the waiver and the facts and circumstances surrounding the signing and entry of the plea agreement....\u201d <em>Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d at 1182. Here, the record demonstrates that the express language of Ayon\u2019s plea agreement was clear and unambiguous as to the rights he was giving up and that the district court took care to assure that Ayon understood the terms and implications of both his plea agreement and his appeal waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-5\">As indicated by <em>Nguyen, </em>the validity of Ayon\u2019s appeal waiver also rests upon the validity of the plea agreement itself. <em>Id. </em>Ayon argues for the first time on appeal that the plea agreement itself was invalid because the government misinformed him of the statutory minimum and maximum sentences applicable to him under the agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If Ayon\u2019s contentions are true, such misinformation may have affected the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea. <em>See </em>Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(c)(1). Ayon contends that while the government and district court informed him that the statutory sentencing range for the 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846 conspiracy charge to which he pled was ten years to life imprisonment, the actual sentencing range for the conspiracy charge was five to forty years imprisonment. Ayon fails, however, to note that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B) (governing Ayon\u2019s sentence for the \u00a7 846 charge) provides a sentencing range of ten years to life imprisonment for one who \u201ccommits ... a violation after a prior conviction for a felony drug offense has become final.\u201d Ayon\u2019s record reveals such a prior offense; thus, the government\u2019s information as to the applicable statutory sentencing range was correct, and we find no plain error. Ayon\u2019s plea agreement and waiver of his appeal rights are therefore valid and enforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Given the valid plea agreement and appeal waiver, we uphold all aspects of Ayon\u2019s plea and sentencing except with respect to those issues arising under the later decided <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Ayon asserts, and the government concedes, that Ayon never specifically admitted a quantity of drugs during his plea colloquy. Nor did he admit to the possession of a firearm. These elements thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>were never proven for purposes of conviction and could not properly be used to enhance Ayon\u2019s sentence beyond the maximum possible for the offense actually proven. <em>Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 477; <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 570 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). As the government admits, without the drug quantity element, it only succeeded in establishing Ayon\u2019s guilt with regard to a \u201cdetectible\u201d amount of drugs. Conviction for conspiracy as to a \u201cdetectible\u201d amount of drugs carries a maximum sentence of twenty years imprisonment. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). The district court\u2019s use of the drug quantity and firearm elements to enhance Ayon\u2019s sentence to one of 262 months was thus plain error, and we must remand for re-sentencing pursuant to the dictates of <em>Ap-prendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b759-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b760-6\">. The government asserts that because Ayon failed to indicate that he was also appealing his conviction in the notice of appeal, he should not be allowed to challenge it. Because, however, the government was able to fully brief its responses to Ayon\u2019s conviction appeal arguments, it was not prejudiced by Ayon\u2019s incomplete notice of appeal, and we consider the merits of his claim. <em>See United States v. Yee Soon Shin, </em>953 F.2d 559, 560-61 (9th Cir.1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
