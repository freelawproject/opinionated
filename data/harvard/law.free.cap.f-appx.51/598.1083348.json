Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed.

The district court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, and Hamblin appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-20\">In September 1998 Hamblin pleaded guilty to conspiracy to manufacture and distribute methamphetamine, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1), 846. As part of his plea agreement, Hamblin waived his right to appeal or collaterally attack his sentence if it was within the statutory maximum. Before his March 1999 sentencing, Hamblin cited health problems in moving for a downward departure under \u00a7 5H1.4, but the district court denied this motion and sentenced him to 78 months\u2019 imprisonment. Then in October 2001 Hamblin filed his self-styled \u201cMotion for Downward Departure Pursuant to \u00a7 5H1.4 United States Sentencing Guidelines,\u201d explaining that he suffers from \u201cdegenerate [sic] physical conditions and a number of other factors.\u201d The government opposed the motion on jurisdictional grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-21\">Title 18, United States Code, section 3582(c) permits a sentencing court to modify a prison term only on motion of the Bureau of Prisons, or if authorized by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>statute or Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, or in response to specific revisions in the sentencing guidelines. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c); <em>see United States v. Vega, </em>241 F.3d 910, 911-12 (7th Cir.2001) (per cu-riam); <em>United States v. Tidwell, </em>178 F.3d 946, 949 (7th Cir.1999). None of these triggers applied here, and so the district court lacked jurisdiction even to entertain Hamblin\u2019s motion. Moreover, although Hamblin suggests in his reply brief that his lawyer was ineffective in his handling of the departure issue at sentencing, the motion he filed was not brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 and the district court was not free to recast it as such. <em>See Henderson v. United States, </em>264 F.3d 709, 711 (7th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
