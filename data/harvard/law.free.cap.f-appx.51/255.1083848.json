Mendoza-Valles contends that the district court failed to adequately consider his request for a downward departure based upon his consent to deportation and over-representation of his criminal history score. We reject that contention and dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">The Government did not challenge the district court\u2019s authority to depart on either basis asserted by Mendoza-Valles, and the district court did not state a belief that it lacked discretion to do so. In fact, the court\u2019s statements at sentencing indicate clearly that it was aware of its discretion and that it chose not to make a departure given the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history and the fact that he re-entered this country just one month after his deportation. Accordingly, we cannot conclude that the district court determined that it lacked authority to depart downward on the bases asserted by the defendant. Because we lack jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s discretionary decision not to depart downward from the applicable Sentencing Guideline, <em>see United States v. Romero, </em>293 F.3d 1120, 1126 (9th Cir.2002), we dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b291-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
