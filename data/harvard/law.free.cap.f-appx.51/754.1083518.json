We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>see Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">Siofele contends that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary because the government breached his plea agreement by disregarding the stipulation that it would not argue at sentencing that Siofele did not meet the five criteria for the safety valve specified in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f). This contention lacks merit because the government complied with the plain language of the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Nunez, </em>223 F.3d 956, 958 (9th Cir.2000) (stating that a court looks to and enforces the plain language of a plea agreement), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 272, 151 L.Ed.2d 199 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-8\">Siofele appears to raise four claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on appeal. We do not address Siofele\u2019s contention, that counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate his prior traffic violations and inform him that he would not be eligible for the safety valve, because it was not properly presented to the district court in his section 2255 motion. <em>See Jiminez v. Rice, </em>276 F.3d 478, 481 (9th Cir.2001). As for Siofele\u2019s remaining ineffective assistance of counsel claims, he has failed on appeal to support his conclusory allegations with facts or argument to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (concluding that a defendant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-12\">Siofele\u2019s contention that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841 is unconstitutional is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Buckland, </em>289 F.3d 558, 562 (9th Cir.) (en banc) (holding that section 841 is not facially unconstitutional), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 2314, 152 L.Ed.2d 1067 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b791-14\">Siofele\u2019s claim that the government failed to file an information pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 lacks merit because a section 851 information would have been necessary only if the government had sought enhanced penalties under section 841(b) for a prior felony drug offense. Siofele\u2019s prior traffic violations were not subject to section 851 and were properly considered under the sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 851 and 841(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b791-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b791-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b791-10\">. Because a certificate of appealability was not granted on Siofele\u2019s contention that the district court judge was biased, we decline to consider it. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c); <em>United States v. Kramer, </em>195 F.3d 1129, 1131 (9th Cir.1999). We do not address Siofele\u2019s remaining contentions because they are encompassed by his waiver of the right to collaterally attack his conviction and sentence in the plea agreement. <em>See Nunez, </em>223 F.3d at 958.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
