We conclude that Lopez-Cabrera was denied her due process right to respond to the BIA\u2019s independent credibility findings. We remand for an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) to make a new credibility finding. Because the parties are familiar with the record, we recount facts only as necessary to explain our decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-25\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding was, as the BIA recognized, based only \u201con speculative assumptions not supported by the record.\u201d Aside from speculation, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding consisted of unsupported invective quite beyond the bounds of appropriate professional discourse. Although it correctly recognized that the IJ\u2019s credibility determination was not entitled to deference, the BIA chose to make its own credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-4\">Ordinarily, the BIA can make an adverse credibility finding based on reasons divergent from those advanced by the IJ for disbelieving the petitioner. <em>See Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938-39 (9th Cir.2000). We ruled in <em>Mendoza Manimbao v. Ashcroft, </em>298 F.3d 852 (9th Cir.2002), however, that the IJ must have \u201cpreviously made an <em>explicit </em>adverse credibility determination, thus putting the petitioner on sufficient notice that her credibility was in issue, and giving her the opportunity to address the credibility question before the BIA, in briefing and in argument.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857 (emphasis added). Explicit credibility findings require that the findings be supported by \u201cspecific, cogent reasons that are substantial and bear a legitimate nexus to the determination that the petitioner did not meet [her] burden of establishing eligibility for asylum.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Chebchoub v. INS, </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1043 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Osorio v. INS, </em>99 F.3d 928, 931 (9th Cir.1996)). In the absence of such a finding by the IJ, the BIA</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b678-5\">violate[s] the [petitioner\u2019s] rights to due process by making an independent adverse credibility finding without affording [petitioner] the opportunity to establish [her] credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b678-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 856 (quoting <em>Abovian v. INS, </em>219 F.3d 972, 980 (9th Cir.), <em>amended by </em>228 F.3d 1127 <em>and </em>234 F.3d 492 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Under <em>Manimbao, </em>then, when it is suggested that an IJ has made a credibility determination, \u201cwe must then examine the basis for that determination to ensure it satisfies due process requirements. Thus, a passing reference to insufficiency or disbelief cannot constitute an adequate credi-bilitjr determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 857. That is to say, a credibility determination entirely devoid of specific, cogent reasons \u201cdoes not constitute a credibility finding sufficient for review under the standards we have developed.\u201d <em>Id. Manimbao </em>explains that where credibility is a \u201cdeterminative factor,\u201d and where an IJ\u2019s credibility finding is not \u201clegally sufficient\u201d for review, the BIA should \u201cremand[ ] to the IJ to make a proper determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 858. In short, if the IJ fails entirely to give cogent reasons, the BIA cannot supply them on a cold record.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-9\">A charitable reading of the IJ\u2019s decision in this case could extract three points that were related to credibility: 1) Lopez-Cabrera provided no birth certificate, passport or identity document to prove that she is from El Salvador; 2) Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s three encounters with guerrillas occurred after the government of El Salvador and the leaders of the FMLN guerrilla forces signed United Nations-brokered peace accords; and 3) Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s description of the encounters was \u201cincredible and nonsensical.\u201d None of these findings, however, can be described as \u201cspecific, cogent reasons for disbelief.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 857 (citing <em>Aguilera-Cota v. INS, </em>914 F.2d 1375, 1381 (9th Cir.1990)).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">First, that Lopez-Cabrera did not provide supporting documents to establish her citizenship does not make her testimony inherently incredible. Her testimony alone is sufficient to sustain her burden of proof without corroboration. <em>See Chebchoub, </em>257 F.3d at 1042; <em>see also Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000). Additionally, Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s citizenship was never in dispute, and the INS does not dispute it here. Nor does the IJ\u2019s suggestion that Lopez-Cabrera is not credible because the three alleged incidents occurred after the El Salvador peace accords <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>constitute \u201ca specific, cogent reason\u201d for doubting Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s credibility. As the BIA explained in criticizing the IJ\u2019s credibility finding, \u201c[t]he Immigration Judge found it incredible that guerrillas sought the respondent out in June 1992, because the peace accords had already begun and guerrillas no longer existed. As the record contains no evidence of country conditions or of the peace process to support this assumption, this is not a permissible basis for an adverse credibility finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">Finally, the IJ\u2019s conclusory assertion that Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s description of the incidents was \u201cincredible and nonsensical\u201d was not a specific, cogent reason and did not amount to an \u201cexplicit\u201d or \u201clegally sufficient\u201d credibility determination under <em>Manimbao. </em>Further, the IJ\u2019s speculation as to how the guerrillas would have acted had they meant Lopez-Cabrera harm cannot provide the requisite basis for disbelieving her. This Court has \u201crepeatedly held that it is error to rest a decision denying asylum on speculation and conjecture.\u201d <em>Shah, </em>220 F.3d at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-6\">The IJ\u2019s comments regarding credibility were so transparently inadequate that Lopez-Cabrera was not given the notice required by due process that she needed affirmatively to establish her credibility on appeal. Instead, Lopez-Cabrera\u2019s brief after remand quite understandably contained only a discussion of credibility directed exclusively to demonstrating the inadequate nature of the IJ\u2019s credibility ruling. Petitioner had no opportunity to respond to or explain the asserted inconsistencies in her testimony identified by the INS for the first time in its brief on remand, filed the same day as petitioner\u2019s. The INS\u2019s original briefs to the BIA did not contain any argument at all, but only relied on the IJ\u2019s analysis. The upshot is that Lopez-Cabrera has been afforded no opportunity to respond to the quite specific, detailed purported inconsistencies first perceived by the INS after the remand and relied upon by the BIA in its second opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-8\">Lopez-Cabrera therefore has a due process right to a hearing on credibility. Given the completely inappropriate nature of the IJ\u2019s credibility determination, the BIA should have remanded for a new IJ hearing. As we emphasized in <em>Manimbao, </em>the \u201cIJ is the decisionmaker best equipped to make factual determinations, especially as to credibility.\u201d 298 F.3d at 858. Where, as here, petitioner was never afforded \u201ca legally sufficient credibility determination,\u201d <em>id., </em>by an IJ, <em>Manimbao </em>requires that she be afforded the opportunity to have one.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED and REMANDED for further proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b677-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
