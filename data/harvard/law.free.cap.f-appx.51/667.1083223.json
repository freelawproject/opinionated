Robertson (\u201cRobertson\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s order affirming the bankruptcy court\u2019s final decision (1) finding that Robert L. Ford (\u201cFord\u201d), ap-pellee, had standing to object to the discharge, and (2) denying the discharge under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 727(a)(2) and (4) for making fraudulent transfers and false oaths.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-21\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(d) (\u201cThe courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions, judgments, orders, and decrees entered\u201d by the district court sitting in its appellate capacity over the bankruptcy court). We review de novo the district court\u2019s decision on an appeal from a bankruptcy court. <em>See In re Cardelucci, </em>285 F.3d 1231, 1233 (9th Cir.2002). No deference is given to the district court\u2019s decision. <em>See In re Harmon, </em>250 F.3d 1240, 1245 (9th Cir.2001). We review the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its factual findings for clear error. <em>See In re Su, </em>290 F.3d 1140, 1142 (9th Cir.2002). For the reasons stated by the bankruptcy court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-22\">I Standing</p>\n<p id=\"b703-23\">The bankruptcy court found that Ford had standing as a third-party beneficiary. Because Ford is not specifically mentioned in the contract between Robertson and Rustics of Lindbergh Lake, Inc. (\u201cRLLI\u201d), the bankruptcy court necessari<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>ly turned to extrinsic evidence to determine that he was an intended beneficiary. When a district court uses extrinsic evidence to interpret a contract, the findings of fact themselves are reviewed under the clearly erroneous standard, while the principles of contract law applied to those facts are reviewed de novo. <em>See DP Aviation v. Smiths Indus. Aerospace &amp; Def. Sys., Ltd., </em>268 F.3d 829, 836 (9th Cir.2001). \u201cWe accept the lower court\u2019s findings of fact unless upon review we are left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. Doe, </em>155 F.3d 1070, 1074 (9th Cir.1998) (en banc). The bankruptcy court referred to numerous facts in support of its finding that Ford was an intended beneficiary. Because those facts are sufficient to support the finding, we cannot overturn it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">Robertson argues that even if Ford were an intended beneficiary, Ford still has no claim because Robertson rescinded the contract due to RLLI\u2019s material breach. We agree with the bankruptcy court that Robertson faded properly to rescind the contract under MontCode Ann. \u00a7 28-2-1713. The Bankruptcy Court noted Robertson\u2019s testimony that he offered to restore RLLI\u2019s property on the condition that he be compensated for all payments made toward the IRS lien, property taxes, and other monies he invested.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> However, even if such an offer was made, Robertson\u2019s demands were conditioned upon receiving more from RLLI than he was entitled to under the contract.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Further, Robertson retained the property without paying its full price, and his only other interest in the property was that of a mortgage holder.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">II Denial of Discharge</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">In the main, Robertson does not dispute the facts underlying the bankruptcy court\u2019s conclusions that he made fraudulent transfers and false oaths. Rather he attempts to explain away the transfers as innocently made and the false statements as immaterial. However, whether a debt- or acted with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud creditors is a finding reviewed for clear error. <em>In re Lawson, </em>122 F.3d 1237, 1240 (9th Cir.1997). \u201cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence the fact-finder\u2019s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Duckett v. Godinez, </em>109 F.3d 533, 535 (9th Cir.1997) (per cu-riam) (citation omitted). Further, and importantly, the bankruptcy court found that neither Robertson nor his wife, Beverly, were credible witnesses. It is well established that special deference is paid to a trial court\u2019s credibility findings. <em>See Anderson v. City of Bessemer, </em>470 U.S. 564, 573, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The record as a whole, particularly in light of the credibility finding, supports the bankruptcy court\u2019s inferences and findings that the deposits to Beverly\u2019s business account were transfers made with intent to hinder, delay, or defraud his creditors. <em>See In re Wills, </em>243 B.R. 58, 64 (9th Cir. BAP 1999) (stating that fraudulent intent may be inferred from \u201ca close relationship between the transferor and the transferee\u201d). Likewise, the bankruptcy court\u2019s findings that the false oaths were material as concealing the purpose of the transfers to Beverly\u2019s account are also supported by the record and cannot be overturned. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number><em>id. </em>at 62 (\u201cA false statement is material if it bears a relationship to the debtor\u2019s business transactions or estate, or concerns the discovery of assets, business dealings, or the existence and disposition of the debtor\u2019s property.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b703-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b704-5\">.
