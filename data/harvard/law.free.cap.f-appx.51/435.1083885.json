He contests the 87-month sentence imposed by the district court, arguing that the district court erred in two respects: first, by enhancing his base offense level for an offense committed after two felony drug convictions when only one prior conviction was alleged in the indictment and, second, by making a four-level enhancement for possession of a firearm in connection with another offense when that fact also was not alleged in the indictment. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), (b)(5) (2001). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-23\">Flippin contends that, under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), facts that increase the sentencing guideline range must be charged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. He concedes that we have held that <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated when the sentencing court makes factual findings that increase the sentencing guideline range but the sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum. <em>United States v. Obi, </em>239 F.3d 662, 667 (4th Cir.), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 86, 151 L.Ed.2d 49 (2001); <em>United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-26\">Because neither of the issues raised by Flippin has merit, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
