Defendant-Appellee\u2019s Br. at 52-62.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b77-16\">As we explained in <em>United States v. Elias, </em>285 F.3d 183 (2d Cir.2002), the defendant bears a heavy burden in making such arguments:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-17\">Inappropriate prosecutorial comments, standing alone, would not justify a reviewing court to reverse a criminal conviction obtained in an otherwise fair proceeding. To warrant reversal, the prosecutorial misconduct must cause the defendant substantial prejudice by so infecting the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Remarks of the prosecutor in summation do not amount to a denial of due process unless they constitute egregious misconduct. In assessing whether prosecutorial misconduct caused \u201csubstantial prejudice,\u201d this Court has adopted a three-part test: the severity of the misconduct, the measures adopted to cure the misconduct, and the certainty of conviction absent the misconduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AvL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 190 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted). Moreover, when we review a prosecutor\u2019s closing arguments, it is essential that we consider the entire record, rather than limiting ourselves to the comments challenged by the defendant. <em>United States v. Canniff, </em>521 F.2d 565, 571 (2d Cir.1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">Upon reviewing the record, we conclude that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks did not cause \u201csubstantial prejudice.\u201d While some of these comments were inappropriate, none were severe or egregious. Moreover, the challenged remarks were substantially mitigated by defense counsel\u2019s objections, the trial court\u2019s instructions, and the prosecutor\u2019s clarifications. Finally, there was overwhelming evidence of Abadi\u2019s guilt. If the prosecutor had omitted the questioned remarks, we do not think that the jury\u2019s verdict would possibly have been different.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\n<em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Stipulation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Second, Abadi alleges that trial counsel was ineffective because he stipulated to two facts: (1) that an earlier fire had occurred at Abadi\u2019s clothing boutique and (2) that Abadi\u2019s family had filed insurance claims for damages caused by that earlier fire. As a general matter, a defendant who alleges a Sixth Amendment violation must demonstrate both that counsel\u2019s conduct fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that but for counsel\u2019s deficient conduct, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Abadi has shown neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At trial, Abadi was represented by Gerald Shargel, Esq. In respect to the earlier fire, Shargel twice objected to the introduction of the earlier fire evidence, obtained a limiting instruction from the trial court, and preserved the issue for appeal. After the court ruled that the evidence would be admitted, Shargel took exception. He then agreed, however, to enter into the stipulation. Shargel did so in the apparent belief that a stipulation would be less harmful to his client than testimony elicited by the prosecutor establishing those facts. That entirely rational course of action does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">\n<em>Trial Counsel\u2019s Alleged Conflict of Interest</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Finally, Abadi contends that Shargel was burdened by an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected his performance at trial. The facts underlying the alleged conflict are not disputed. Before Shargel represented Abadi, he represented Fabio Bartolotta. In an earlier indictment, Bartolotta \u2014 along with Abadi\u2019s other co-conspirators \u2014 was charged for the arson of Abadi\u2019s boutique, in addition to several unrelated crimes. On March 26, 1997, Shargel withdrew as Bartolotta\u2019s counsel. Over one year later, Bartolotta pled guilty and implicated Abadi. Several months later, Shargel filed an appearance as Abadi\u2019s counsel. Bartolotta did not testify at Abadi\u2019s trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-11\">On appeal, Abadi argues that this \u201cconflict\u201d rendered Shargel unwilling or unable to: (1) apprise Abadi of the advantages of a guilty plea; (2) call Bartolotta as a witness; (3) cross-examine Sandra Sanchez, another co-conspirator, about the earlier indictment; or (4) cross-examine Sanchez about another arson.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-12\">To prevail, Abadi must demonstrate that there was an \u201cactual\u201d conflict of interest in which Shargel \u201cactively represent[ed] conflicting interests\u201d such that the interests of Shargel and Abadi \u201cdiverge[d] with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action.\u201d <em>United States v. Stantini, </em>85 F.3d 9, 16 (2d Cir.1996) (citations and quotation marks omitted); see <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number><em>also Winkler v. Keane, </em>7 F.3d 304, 307 (2d Cir.1993). Once this is established, Abadi must then show that the conflict \u201cadversely affected counsel\u2019s performance,\u201d <em>Cuyler v. Sullivan, </em>446 U.S. 335, 350, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), causing a \u201clapse in representation\u201d in which Shargel failed to pursue a \u201cplausible alternative defense strategy or tactic,\u201d <em>Winkler, </em>7 F.3d at 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Abadi has not established any of these factors. First, he has not offered any evidence, in his affidavit or elsewhere, to suggest that he would have pled guilty if he had been advised to by counsel. <em>See Stantini, </em>85 F.3d at 16-17. Second, he has not shown that it was \u201cplausible\u201d to call Bartolotta as a defense witness. In fact, the evidence suggests that it was not. When Shargel interviewed Bartolotta, Bar-tolotta refused to answer Shargel\u2019s questions, and stated only that Abadi should enter a guilty plea. There was thus a substantial danger that, if Bartolotta had been called as a witness, he would have implicated Abadi further in the arson. Third and fourth, Abadi has offered no plausible links between Shargel\u2019s alleged \u201cconflict\u201d and his alleged \u201clapses\u201d during his cross-examination of Sanchez.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">On this last point, Abadi argues that he need not demonstrate any causal connections between the \u201cactual conflict\u201d and the \u201clapses in representation.\u201d He is mistaken. To prevail on an \u201cactual conflict\u201d claim, a defendant must prove that the conflict \u201cadversely <em>affected </em>counsel\u2019s performance\u201d \u2014 that counsel\u2019s lapses <em>\u201cresulted </em>from,\u201d or were <em>\u201cdue to,\u201d </em>the conflict of interest itself. <em>Winkler, </em>7 F.3d at 307, 309 (emphasis added and citation and quotation marks omitted). Abadi has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b77-12\">. During summations, defense counsel made a timely objection to the alleged personal \"attacks.\u201d Abadi\u2019s other two objections \u2014 his \"vouching\u201d and \u201ctestimony\u201d objections\u2014 were not made until after summations, when Abadi moved for a mistrial. Under the rule of <em>United States v. Nasta, </em>398 F.2d 283 (2d Cir. 1968), these objections came too late. <em>Id. </em>at 285. Abadi\u2019s \u201cvouching\u201d and \u201ctestimony\u201d arguments, therefore, are subject to plain error review. <em>United States v. Canniff, </em>521 F.2d 565, 572 (2d Cir. 1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
