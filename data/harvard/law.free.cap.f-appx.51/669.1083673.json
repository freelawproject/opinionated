Because the facts are known to the parties, we do not recite them here. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">I. <em>Listing of Impairments Determination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Gollehon argues that the ALJ erred<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in concluding that she did not meet the Listing of Impairments criteria for arthritis of a major weight-bearing joint.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The ALJ\u2019s decision was appropriate because Gollehon failed to show that she had all of the symptoms the Listing requires.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> To qualify for the Listing\u2019s presumption of disability, Gollehon had to show persistent joint pain and stiffness and markedly limited ability to walk.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The ALJ found that Gollehon achieved pain relief with over-the-counter medications and cortisone shots, that she was able to walk without an assistive device, and that she could complete her janitorial duties and housework by sitting down on occasion. Substantial evidence supported these findings.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-17\">II. <em>ALJ\u2019s Decision to Discount Bonfilio\u2019s Opinion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-18\">Gollehon argues that the ALJ erred<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in deciding to discount the opinion of her treating physician, Dr. Bonfilio. However, the ALJ examined the amount of work and activity that Gollehon performed on a daily basis and the conflicting medical opinions, and found that the limitations Bonfilio suggested did not reflect Gollehon\u2019s actual abilities. Substantial evidence, both from the medical records and from the testimony at the hearing, supports the ALJ\u2019s decision to vary the limitations Bonfilio suggested.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-19\">III. <em>Hypothetical Question Posed to the Vocational Expert</em></p>\n<p id=\"b706-20\">Gollehon argues that the ALJ improperly relied upon the vocational ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>pert\u2019s testimony because that testimony was based upon a hypothetical that did not accurately portray Gollehon\u2019s limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the ALJ\u2019s hypothetical was proper: substantial evidence supported the limitations the ALJ included,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and the limitations that Gollehon argues should have been included would not have affected the vocational expert\u2019s conclusion that Gollehon could perform sedentary jobs.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, Gollehon cannot prevail on this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">IV. <em>Denial of Disability Benefits</em></p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">Gollehon argues that the ALJ erred in denying her disability claim. Her argument fails because substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The ALJ based his decision upon appropriate factors: an assessment of Gollehon\u2019s credibility; a determination that her daily activities were inconsistent with her claimed disability; a determination that her course of treatment was inconsistent with disability; and an evaluation of the medical evidence and testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-8\">All of these factors are appropriate considerations in a disability determination, and substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s conclusions regarding all of these factors. First, the ALJ gave clear and convincing reasons for discounting Golle-hon\u2019s testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The ALJ discounted Gollehon\u2019s testimony because it was inconsistent with her level of activity, her conservative medical treatment, and her ability to walk and stand without an assistive device.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Second, the ALJ found that Gollehon\u2019s daily activities were significant. Substantial evidence supported this determination because Gollehon was able to perform medium-level work as a janitor on a daily basis and was also able to do other activities, such as housework. Third, the ALJ relied upon Gollehon\u2019s conservative course of treatment and her failure to seek medical care to determine that she was not disabled.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, the ALJ relied upon the medical opinions of Gollehon\u2019s treating and consulting doctors to conclude that she was not disabled.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Substantial evidence supported this determination because none of the doctors concluded that Gollehon was totally disabled. Even Bonfilio concluded that Gollehon could perform work that was consistent with sedentary work. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision to deny Gollehon\u2019s application for disability benefits was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b706-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b706-11\">.
