Hall, <em>Judge) </em>granting summary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee, Raymond O\u2019Connell, the Superintendent of the Stratford Board of Education, and dismissing their claim that defendant\u2019s threat to file a libel action against them for allegedly defamatory statements violated their rights to free speech. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-19\">This case arose out of the same sequence of events, and involved the same defendant, as another appeal recently decided by a panel of this Court. <em>See Colombo v. O\u2019Connell, </em>310 F.3d 115 (2d Cir.2002). In a <em>per curiam </em>order, the <em>Colombo </em>panel affirmed the district court\u2019s order dismissing plaintiff Colombo\u2019s complaint, on the basis that she had failed to demonstrate that defendant\u2019s threat to file a libel action had an \u201cactual\u201d chilling effect on her right to free speech. <em>See id. </em>at 117-18 (citing <em>Spear v. Town of W. Hartford, </em>954 F.2d 63 (2d Cir.1992)). Because the instant case involves identical factual circumstances, identical applicable law, and nearly identical parties, we affirm for essentially the same reasons stated by the <em>Colombo </em>panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-20\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
