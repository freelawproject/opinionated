We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-22\">Sanders contends that the district court erroneously counted four prior uncoun-selled state misdemeanor convictions, which raised his criminal history score from I to III. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-23\">This court reviews de novo the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s determination that a particular conviction may be used in calculating a defendant\u2019s criminal history score.\u201d <em>United States v. Allen, </em>153 F.3d 1037, 1040 (9th Cir.1998). The defendant bears the burden to prove the invalidity of a prior conviction by a preponderance of the evidence, which must be sufficient to overcome the presumption that there was a valid waiver of counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 1041. A defendant cannot overcome that burden \u201cmerely by pointing to a silent or ambiguous record.\u201d <em>United States v. Mulloy, </em>3 F.3d 1337, 1339 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-24\">Sanders failed to proffer any evidence that he did not voluntarily and knowingly waive representation with respect to any of the prior convictions. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-25\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b810-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9 th Cir.
