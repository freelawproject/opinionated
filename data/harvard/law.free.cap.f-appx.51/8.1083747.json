Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. CH-0752-02-0222-I-1, slip op. at 1 (MSPB May 7, 2002). Because the Board did not err in sustaining the removal, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-19\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b44-20\">Mr. Hubbard worked as a part-time Housekeeping Aid beginning in April 1999. <em>Id. </em>at 1, 3. In August 1999, Hubbard sustained an injury to his lower back, and the Department thereafter assigned him to perform only light janitorial duties. <em>Id. </em>at 3. Hubbard continued to perform those duties until May 2000, when he complained that the walking entailed by those duties was too bothersome to his back condition. <em>Id. </em>At that time, the Department temporarily assigned him to a desk job, performing computer data entry, which he performed until June 2000, at which time he requested and took leave without pay. <em>Id. </em>On July 17, 2000, he submitted a letter to the Department explaining that he was unable to work because a doctor had placed him on permanent disability. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. The doctor referred to in that letter was Dr. Jasper Williams, who reported to the Department, \u201cIt is my considered medical opinion that [Hubbard] is and has been completely disabled and incapable of effective gainful employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4. The Department then removed Hubbard on the ground that he was physically disqualified from duty. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b44-21\">Hubbard filed an equal employment opportunity complaint in the Department\u2019s Office of Resolution Management (\u201cORM\u201d), which concluded that he had not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>been discriminated against on the basis of race, color, or disability. Hubbard then appealed to the MSPB, which affirmed his removal. The administrative judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) assigned to the case, whose decision became the Board\u2019s final decision pursuant to 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.118 (2001), determined that accommodation was not possible, <em>id. </em>at 5, and that Hubbard\u2019s removal promoted the efficiency <em>of </em>the department, <em>id. </em>at 6. The AJ also held that Hubbard\u2019s complete and unaccommodatable disability was fatal to his claim of discrimination on the basis of disability because Hubbard could not make the requisite showing that he was \u201cqualified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>6-7. Finally, the AJ concluded that the penalty of removal met the legal test for reasonableness. <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. Hubbard timely appealed to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a decision of the Board is limited. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>Jennings v. MSPB, </em>59 F.3d 159, 160 (Fed.Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">On appeal, Hubbard principally argues that the AJ failed to take into account evidence of irregularities in the ORM\u2019s investigation of his discrimination claims as well as evidence of perjury by Department officials. He also contends that the AJ refused to interview his witnesses and did not take into account his doctor\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Hubbard\u2019s arguments do not persuade us to reverse the Board\u2019s decision. First, his general allegations of irregularities in the ORM\u2019s investigation are neither specific nor particularized enough for us to evaluate them. Secondly and similarly, his allegations of perjury do not identify who allegedly committed perjury or what was said that was untruthful. In any event, the AJ is in the best position to evaluate credibility; accordingly, the AJ\u2019s credibility determinations are \u201cvirtually unreviewable\u201d on appeal, <em>Hambsch v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>796 F.2d 430, 436 (Fed.Cir. 1986), and will not be disturbed unless inherently improbable, discredited by undisputed evidence, or contrary to physical facts, <em>Hanratty v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>819 F.2d 286, 288 (Fed.Cir.1987). This case presents none of those circumstances, and we find no other basis in the record to justify disturbing the AJ\u2019s credibility determinations. Third and also similarly, Hubbard has not identified which witnesses the AJ failed to interview, demonstrated that he requested their testimony, or identified the substance of what they would testify to. Indeed, the record before us shows only that Hubbard requested that he himself testify on his behalf, and that request was granted. <em>Hubbard v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>No. CH-0752-02-0222-I-1, slip op. at 3 (MSPB March 27, 2002) (\u201cOrder Summarizing Telephonic Prehearing Conference\u201d); <em>see also Hambsch, </em>796 F.2d at 436 (holding that an AJ did not err in excluding witnesses who were either not proffered or whose relevance was not established). Although it is not our duty to scour the record to find support for a petitioner\u2019s allegations or arguments, we have nonetheless reviewed the record before us diligently, and we cannot discern any support for Hubbard\u2019s allegations that proper procedures were not followed. Fourth, it is plainly apparent that the AJ considered Dr. Williams\u2019s report and understood its significance. Indeed, that report itself constitutes substantial evidence supporting the Board\u2019s affirmance of the Department\u2019s decision to remove Hubbard on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>ground that he was disabled to an extent that could not be accommodated. In light of that evidence, his appeal fails, and removal was an appropriate penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">We have considered Hubbard\u2019s other arguments and find them unconvincing. We therefore conclude that the Board did not err in affirming the removal of Hubbard. Because the Board\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence and was not arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
