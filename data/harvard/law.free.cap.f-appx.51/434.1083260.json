Counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Additionally, Gindraw has filed a pro se supplemental brief and a motion for appointment of new counsel. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-20\">On appeal, Gindraw contends his Fed. R.Crim.P. 11 plea hearing was inadequate. In light of the district court\u2019s thorough plea colloquy, we find this argument to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-21\">Gindraw also contends the district court erred in calculating his sentencing guidelines range. We find no error in the district court\u2019s calculations. Gindraw further contests the extent of the district court\u2019s downward departure and the choice of a sentence within the guidelines range. However, neither the extent of the district court\u2019s departure nor the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence within a properly calculated range are reviewable by this court. <em>See United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324-25 (4th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Porter, </em>909 F.2d 789, 794 (4th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-22\">Gindraw next contends the district court failed to address his objections to the presentencing report. A review of the record shows the district court did, in fact, resolve Gindraw\u2019s objections. Gindraw also contends he was detained too long prior to his arraignment. However, by pleading guilty, Gindraw has waived any claims with respect to antecedent non-jurisdictional defects. <em>See United States v. Willis, </em>992 F.2d 489, 490 (4th Cir.1993); <em>Tollett v. Henderson, </em>411 U.S. 258, 267, 93 S.Ct. 1602, 36 L.Ed.2d 235 (1973).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-23\">Pursuant to <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record and find no error. Accordingly, we affirm Gindraw\u2019s sentence and conviction. We deny Gindraw\u2019s motion for appointment of new counsel. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>draw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
