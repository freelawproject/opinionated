Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">(1) Orr has failed to make a prima facie showing of gender discrimination because she failed to show that she was qualified for her job and that similarly situated male employees were treated more favorably. <em>See Villiarimo v. Aloha Island Air, Inc., </em>281 F.3d 1054, 1062 (9th Cir.2002). An implicit part of the \u201cqualification\u201d requirement is that the plaintiff was performing her job satisfactorily. <em>See id. </em>at 1062 n. 8; <em>Pejic v. Hughes Helicopters, Inc., </em>840 F.2d 667, 672 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Tolbert v. Page, </em>182 F.3d 677, 687 n. 2 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc) (McKeown, J., dissenting). Orr\u2019s lengthy disciplinary record is more than adequate evidence to show that she was not. Moreover, Orr failed to compare herself to any male employee with a similar disciplinary history. <em>See Jauregui v. City of Glendale, </em>852 F.2d 1128, 1134-35 (9th Cir.1988); <em>Gunther v. County of Wash., </em>623 F.2d 1303, 1321 (9th Cir.1979), <em>aff'd, </em>452 U.S. 161, 101 S.Ct. 2242, 68 L.Ed.2d 751 (1981); <em>see also Peele v. Country Mut. Ins. Co., </em>288 F.3d 319, 330 (7th Cir.2002); <em>Holbrook v. Reno, </em>196 F.3d 255, 261 (D.C.Cir.1999). Consequently, the district court properly held that Orr failed to make a prima facie showing of gender discrimination.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-14\">(2) Even if Orr had made out a prima facie case, summary judgment against her was still proper because she failed to rebut UMC\u2019s legitimate non-discriminatory reason for her suspension. <em>See Villiarimo, </em>281 F.3d at 1062. Orr has not offered evidence sufficient to support an alternate, discriminatory reason for her suspension; nor has she factually contested her disciplinary record. <em>See id. </em>Orr\u2019s contention that UMC\u2019s offered reasons for her suspension changed over time is completely unsupported by the record. Further, the later developments to which she refers have no relevance to UMC\u2019s imposition of discipline for Orr\u2019s own disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b314-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b314-17\">. We will not consider claims that Orr failed to bring before the district court or claims that she has not adequately raised in her opening brief. <em>See Crawford v. Lungren, </em>96 F.3d 380, 389 n. 6 (9th Cir.1996); <em>Brookfield Communications, Inc. v. W. Coast Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>174 F.3d 1036, 1046 n. 7 (9th Cir.1999). The only issue properly before us is whether Orr was suspended because UMC discriminated against her on account of her gender.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
