Eddy also appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his remaining claims under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review de novo, <em>Barnett v. Centoni, </em>31 F.3d 813, 815-16 (9th Cir.1994) (per curiam), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">Eddy contends that defendants\u2019 denial of his request to see an ophthalmologist constitutes deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs. Because Eddy failed to raise any disputed issues of fact regarding the appropriate course of medical treatment, the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment was proper. <em>See Jackson v. McIntosh, </em>90 F.3d 330, 332 (9th Cir.1996) (noting that a difference of opinion about the appropriate course of medical treatment generally will not amount to deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">Eddy\u2019s claim that the district court erred by dismissing the remainder of his complaint under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) because the three strikes provision is unconstitutional, is foreclosed by this court\u2019s opinion in <em>Rodriguez v. Cook, </em>169 F.3d 1176, 1178 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">We reject Eddy\u2019s remaining contentions on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b300-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
