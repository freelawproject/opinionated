Ramsey appeals pro se the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition challenging his conviction and sentence for selling a substance in lieu of a controlled narcotic substance in violation of California Health and Safety Code \u00a7 11355. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review the denial of a \u00a7 2254 petition de novo, <em>Patterson v. Gomez, </em>223 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2000), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">Ramsey contends that his Sixth Amendment right to self-representation was violated when the state trial court denied his request, made during jury selection, to represent himself. Although a criminal defendant has a right to self-representation, we have determined that a request to represent oneself must be timely made. <em>See Moore v. Calderon, </em>108 F.3d 261, 265 (9th Cir.1997) (citing <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975)), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000). The finding of the state appellate court that Ramsey\u2019s request was untimely was neither contrary to, nor an unreasonable application of, <em>Faretta. See e.g., United States v. Smith, </em>780 F.2d 810, 811 (9th Cir.1986) (stating that a demand for self-representation is timely if made before meaningful trial proceedings have begun).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-11\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s denial is AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1), <em>Van Tran v. Lindsey, </em>212 F.3d 1143, 1153-54 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b784-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\">. Given our conclusion regarding the state court's finding on untimeliness, we need not decide whether Ramsey\u2019s request was unequivocal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
