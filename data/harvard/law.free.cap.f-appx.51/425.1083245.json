Johnson filed a complaint alleging employment discrimination in his termination as a police planner for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority (MWAA) and in MWAA\u2019s failure to hire him for other positions. The district court conducted a hearing and granted summary judgment in favor of MWAA for the reasons stated from the bench. Johnson appeals. We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s statements from the bench. The court properly found that, even if Johnson could make a prima facie showing of discriminatory treatment, MWAA showed legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for the adverse employment actions and that Johnson failed to show that the reasons were pretextual. <em>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., </em>530 U.S. 133, 137-39, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court as stated at the hearing on January 4, 2002. <em>See Johnson v. Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, </em>No. CA-01-1614-A (E.D. Va. filed April 19, 2002 &amp; entered April 24, 2002). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
