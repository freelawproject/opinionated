Because our decision in <em>Ram v. INS, </em>243 F.3d 510 (9th Cir.2001), makes it clear that application of the stop-time rule to Ayed was proper, given Congress\u2019 unambiguous intent to apply that rule retroactively, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-11\">In <em>Ram, </em>the INS served aliens with Orders to Show Cause (\u201cOSC\u201d) in May 1988, charging them with being deporta-ble. <em>Id. </em>at 512. The Immigration Judge (\u201cU\u201d) found them deportable and denied their petitions for asylum and withholding of deportation. <em>Id. </em>After exhausting their administrative appeals, the aliens then petitioned for review to this court, and we denied their petition on January 12, 1995. <em>Id. </em>Claiming that suspension of deportation was appropriate because they had attained seven years of continuous physical presence since their deportation proceedings had commenced, the aliens in <em>Ram </em>had asked the BIA to reopen their deportation proceedings in November 1994 (while their first petition to the Ninth Circuit was pending) to apply for suspension of deportation. <em>Id. </em>The BIA denied their motion for lack of extreme hardship and the aliens again petitioned for review to the Ninth Circuit. In February 1997 <em>(before </em>IIRIRA took effect), we reversed and remanded the BIA decision for further consideration of the evidence going to \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Deciding the case on remand <em>after </em>IIRIRA\u2019s effective date, \u201cthe BIA summarily denied [the aliens\u2019] motion on the sole ground that they had not satisfied IIRIRA\u2019s new stop-time rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">The aliens in <em>Ram </em>then petitioned again for review to this court, arguing, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) \u201cthe stop-time rule d[id] not apply to OSCs where an alien seeks suspension of deportation\u201d; and (2) the BIA\u2019s \u201capplication of the stop-time rule ... was impermissibly retroactive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that IIRIRA \u00a7 309(c)(5)(A), as amended by NACARA \u00a7 203(a), \u201cgenerally applies the stop-time rule to transitional rule aliens whose deportation proceedings are initiated with the service of an OSC and who seek suspension of deportation.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number><em>Ram, </em>243 F.3d at 516. We also held that application of the stop-time rule to the aliens in <em>Ram </em>was not impermissibly retroactive and did not violate due process, given Congress\u2019 unambiguous intent to apply that rule retroactively to cases heard by an IJ or on appeal after April 1, 1997. <em>Id. </em>at 517-18.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">The facts presented here are not significantly distinct from those in <em>Ram. </em>Ayed asserts continuous physical presence in the United States since September 1989. On July 21, 1995, the INS served him with an OSC, charging him with being deportable for overstaying his visa. Properly applying pre-IIRIRA law, the IJ denied his application for suspension of deportation on March 10, 1997 for lack of \u201cextreme hardship.\u201d Ayed appealed the IJ\u2019s decision to the BIA. The BIA heard Ayed\u2019s case <em>after </em>IIRIRA\u2019s effective date. As in <em>Ram, </em>IIRIRA\u2019s transitional rules govern Ayed\u2019s case because the INS had commenced deportation proceedings against him before that date but no final order of deportation had been entered prior to October 30, 1996. <em>See Hose v. INS, </em>180 F.3d 992, 994 (9th Cir.1999) (en banc). Also as in <em>Ram, </em>the BIA summarily denied Ayed\u2019s petition for suspension of deportation because he could not meet the seven-year continuous physical presence requirement under the stop-time rule, which prevented him from accruing time toward that requirement after he was served with the OSC on July 21,1995.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Thus, under <em>Ram, </em>the BIA\u2019s application of the stop-time rule to Ayed did not violate due process. <em>Cf. Guadalupe-Cruz v. INS, </em>240 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Otarola v. INS, </em>270 F.3d 1272 (9th Cir.2001); <em>Castillo-Perez v. INS, </em>212 F.3d 518 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b683-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
