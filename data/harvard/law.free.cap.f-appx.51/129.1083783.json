We conclude for the reasons stated by the district court that Walton has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See United States v. Walton, </em>Nos. CR-96-41; CA-00-191-5 (N.D.W. Va. June 28, 2002; July 24, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2258(c) (2000). We grant Walton\u2019s motion for judicial notice and dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-22\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b165-19\"> Although Walton did not file a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s order denying a certificate of appealability, we have jurisdiction to review the order because his timely filed informal brief is the functional equivalent of a notice of appeal. <em>Smith v. Barry, </em>502 U.S. 244, 245, 112 S.Ct. 678, 116 L.Ed.2d 678 (1992).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
