Glatfelter contends that the district court erred by failing to adjust his sentence to recognize his acceptance of responsibility. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (2000). Reviewing for clear error, <em>United States v. Connelly, </em>156 F.3d 978, 982 (9th Cir.1998), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-23\">Because Glatfelter put the government to its burden of proof at trial and denied the essential factual elements of guilt, Glatfelter did not <em>\u201cclearly demonstrate </em>[ ] acceptance of responsibility\u201d as the Guidelines require. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a) (2000) (emphasis added). Although in \u201crare situations\u201d a defendant that goes to trial nonetheless will qualify for this adjustment, the district court did not clearly err in concluding that the adjustment did not apply in this case. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, cmt. n. 2 (2000); <em>see also Connel</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number><em>ly, </em>156 F.3d at 982 (\u201cIn particular, a failure to demonstrate contrition and remorse weighs against a finding of acceptance of responsibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b816-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
