Leigh\u2019s counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), raising an <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), claim but representing that, in his view, there are no meritorious issues for appeal. Leigh has filed a pro se supplemental brief. Finding the issue raised by counsel is without merit and discerning no other error in the record below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-20\">Leigh contends his sentence is unconstitutional based on <em>Apprendi. </em>Because Leigh\u2019s sentence of 240 months\u2019 imprisonment does not exceed the statutory maximum of 240 months set forth in \u00a7 841, <em>Apprendi </em>is not implicated. <em>See United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 199-202 (4th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>532 U.S. 937, 121 S.Ct. 1393, 149 L.Ed.2d 316 (2001); <em>United States v. Angle, </em>254 F.3d 514, 518 (4th Cir.) (en banc), <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 309, 151 L.Ed.2d 230 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-23\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Leigh contends he received ineffective assistance of counsel during plea negotiations and sentencing. Because the record does not conclusively establish Leigh\u2019s counsel was ineffective, this claim is not cognizable on direct appeal and must be raised under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000). <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999). We have reviewed the remaining claims made in Leigh\u2019s pro se supplemental brief and find them meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-24\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record for reversible error and found none. We therefore affirm Leigh\u2019s conviction and 240-month sentence. We also deny counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, then counsel may move this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>fore the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
