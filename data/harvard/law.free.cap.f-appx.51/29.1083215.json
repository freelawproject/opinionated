Familia challenges the district court\u2019s denial of a two-level downward adjustment for minor role in the offense under United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2(b). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">The district court denied the request for a minor role adjustment and explicitly adopted the following reasoning set forth in the Government\u2019s sentencing letter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b66-6\">By way of summary, the evidence in this matter concerning the defendant\u2019s role includes: (1) billing records of the phone the defendant was using during the crime confirming that the defendant was in frequent contact with the ... drug source in the Dominican Republic; (2) a recording made during the controlled delivery demonstrating that the defendant was speaking to the drug source during the controlled delivery; (3) the defendant\u2019s statement during the controlled delivery advising Kenneth Ortiz of how he should dress to avoid arousing suspicion from U.S. Customs in future; (4) the defendant[\u2019s] travel from Massachusetts to pick-up the drugs; (5) the defendant\u2019s recruitment [of] another individual, who was arrested but not detained on the night of the defendant\u2019s arrest, to drive him to and from the airport; (6) the apparent understanding (which the defendant denies) that the defendant was to pay ... Kenneth Ortiz upon his delivery of the cocaine at JFK, and (7) as the PSR notes, the defendant\u2019s previous arrest for drug related activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">After hearing arguments on other matters, the district court imposed a sentence of 78 months\u2019 imprisonment, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release, and a $400 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-9\">Guideline \u00a7 3B1.2(b) provides: \u201cIf the defendant was a minor participant in any criminal activity, decrease by 2 levels.\u201d U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual \u00a7 3B1.2(b) (2001). This adjustment is available for a defendant \u201cwho is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3B1.2, cmt. n. 5. \u201cWe review for clear error a sentencing court\u2019s finding that a defendant did not play a minor role in the offense.\u201d <em>United States v. Castano, </em>234 F.3d 111, 113 (2d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-12\">Familia urges that the district court erred in considering three facts set forth in the Government\u2019s sentencing letter: (1) Familia\u2019s recruitment of an unnamed individual to drive him from Massachusetts; (2) Familia\u2019s responsibility to pay Ortiz; and (3) Familia\u2019s arrest more than a decade earlier for a narcotics crime. Familia argues that the first two facts are without basis in the record, and that the third has no bearing on Familia\u2019s role in the present offense. We do not need to reach the question of whether these three facts were improperly considered, because excluding these facts, there is ample support for the district court\u2019s determination that Familia was not entitled to a minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-13\">Familia contends that he \u201cwas merely a delivery man\u201d and \u201chad virtually no knowledge of the nature and scope of the venture.\u201d However, the district court believed that Familia was in effect an engineer of this operation. He drove to New York from Massachusetts (with another individual) to ensure that the cocaine got from Ortiz to the ultimate destination; he spoke frequently with Suarez, the source of the drugs in the Dominican Republic, and even did so during the controlled delivery; and he counseled Ortiz about how <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>to dress to avoid problems with immigration control. This last finding suggests familiarity with cocaine importation and an interest in future transactions involving the two. The district court did not clearly err in concluding that these facts prevented it from awarding Familia a minor role adjustment.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
