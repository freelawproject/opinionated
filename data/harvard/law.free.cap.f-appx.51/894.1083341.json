The government argues that this court lacks jurisdiction to review the sentencing court\u2019s refusal to grant the departure because it was merely an exercise of its discretion. \u201c[A]n appeal lies if the departure decision is based on an assessment that the sentencing court is powerless to depart on the <em>grounds </em>alleged by the proponent, but not if the court simply declines to exercise its discretionary power to depart.\u201d <em>United States v. Morrison, </em>46 F.3d 127, 130 (1st Cir.l995)(emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-21\">\u201cWhen determining whether the sentencing court merely refused to exercise its discretionary power to depart, we consider the totality of the record and the sentencing court\u2019s actions as reflected therein.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The transcript of the sentencing hearing clearly indicates that the sentencing court believed that a departure was impermissible under \u00a7 2L1.2 because one of the requirements of Application Note 5 (concerning length of the sentence imposed for the previous conviction) had not been met. Its ambiguous statement that \u201cif I don\u2019t exercise it, there would still <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>be no question about it,\u201d absent any reference to facts which made such a departure unjustified in this case, does not deprive this court of jurisdiction. <em>Compare United States v. Jackson, </em>93 F.3d 335, 338 (7th Cir.1996) (holding that court lacked jurisdiction \u201cwhere the district court unambiguously indicates that it would not depart from the sentence, even if it had authority to do so\u201d) (emphasis added). We find that this court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s determination that it lacked authority to depart pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2, Application Note 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Application Note 5 permits a downward departure if \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) applies and three other requirements are met. The PSR in this case indicates that the relevant subsection applied and that all three of the other requirements of Application Note 5 were met. The district court erred in concluding that the requirement that the term of imprisonment imposed for the aggravated felony which triggered the 16-level increase under subsection (b)(1)(A) <em>\u201cnot </em>exceed one year\u201d was not met in this case. The PSR indicates (and the district court found) that the relevant prison sentence imposed was one year. Therefore, the sentencing court had authority to grant a departure from the guideline sentencing range pursuant to Application Note 5 \u201cbased on the seriousness of the aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.5). Its conclusion to the contrary was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b931-8\">The sentence is <em>vacated </em>and the case is <em>remanded </em>for resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Loe.R. 27(c).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b931-6\">. We note that on remand for resentencing the current Sentencing Guidelines, including the amended version of \u00a7 2L1.2, apply. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kirkham, </em>195 F.3d 126, 132 n. 5 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
