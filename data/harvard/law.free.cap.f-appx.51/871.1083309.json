Wechsler appeals from the February 12, 2002 Judgment of the United States District Court for the Central District of California that granted summary judgment of non-infringement in favor of Macke International Trade, Inc. (\u201cMacke\u201d), Anthony O\u2019Rourke, and Pets-Mart, Inc. (\u201cPetsmart\u201d). The court concluded that Macke\u2019s and Petsmart\u2019s accused products do not infringe U.S. Patent No. 5,636,592 (\u201c\u2019592 patent\u201d), owned by Mr. Wechsler. <em>Wechsler v. Macke Int'l Trade, Inc., </em>No. 00-00296-CAS (C.D.Cal. Feb. 12, 2002) (order granting summary judgment). However, in granting summary judgment in favor of Macke, Mr. O\u2019Rourke, and Petsmart, the district court did not address or resolve Petsmart\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>counterclaim alleging that the \u2019592 patent is invalid. At oral argument, counsel advised that they believe Petsmart\u2019s counterclaim still is pending in the district court-</p>\n<p id=\"b908-4\">Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1), this court has jurisdiction over an \u201cappeal from a final decision of a district court of the United States\u201d if that court\u2019s jurisdiction was based, in whole or in part, on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1338. A final decision or order is one that \u201c \u2018ends the litigation on the merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>Cunningham v. Hamilton County, Ohio, </em>527 U.S. 198, 204, 119 S.Ct. 1915, 144 L.Ed.2d 184 (1999) (quoting <em>Catlin v. United States, </em>324 U.S. 229, 233, 65 S.Ct. 631, 89 L.Ed. 911 (1945)). In the absence of a final decision disposing of an entire case, we lack jurisdiction. <em>See State Contracting &amp; Eng\u2019g Corp. v. Florida, </em>258 F.3d 1329, 1334, 59 U.S.P.Q.2d 1498, 1501 (Fed.Cir.2001) (noting that there might be no appealable final judgment because \u201c[a]t the time the plaintiffs appealed to this Court, there remained pending in the district court the counterclaims directed toward non-infringement and patent invalidity [and there appeared no certification pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b)].\u201d); <em>Enercon Indus. Corp. v. Pillar Corp., </em>105 F.3d 1437, 1439, 41 U.S.P.Q.2d 1630, 1631 (Fed.Cir.1997) (noting that \u201c[generally, appeal may only be taken from a final decision disposing of an entire case.\u201d (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b908-5\">In this case, although district court docket entry no. Ill describes the grant of summary judgment as \u201cterminating\u201d the case, Petsmart\u2019s invalidity counterclaim apparently remains unresolved. At the same time, none of the exceptions to the general rule that non-final orders are not appealable, such as when there has been a certification for appeal pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b), is present. We therefore lack jurisdiction. Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b908-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-11\">1. This appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, subject, however, to reinstatement under the same docket number without the payment of an additional filing fee if, within 30 days of the date of this order, a party appeals from the entry of a final judgment on the entire case or obtains a certification for appeal pursuant to Rule 54(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-12\">2. If the appeal is reinstated, it will be decided by the present panel, based on the briefs already filed and the oral argument heard on November 5, 2002.</blockquote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b908-6\">. We express no opinion as to whether a Rule 54(b) certification should be made, as this is a matter that is within the discretion of the trial judge. <em>Aleut Tribe v. United States, </em>702 F.2d 1015, 1021 (Fed.Cir.1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
