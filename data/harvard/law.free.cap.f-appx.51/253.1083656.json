Phillippi is an inmate in California state prison. He challenges his jury conviction for the murder and robbery of Daniel Austrian and his sentence of 17 years to life <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>imprisonment. Phillippi contends that the trial court violated his constitutional rights when it denied his motions to sever his trial from that of his co-defendant Shain Bowker. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing <em>de novo, see Alvarado v. Hill, </em>252 F.3d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir.2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-4\">Phillippi filed his habeas petition in 2000; thus, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) governs our review. <em>Lindh v. Murphy, </em>521 U.S. 320, 327, 117 S.Ct. 2059, 138 L.Ed.2d 481 (1997). Under the limited review provided by AEDPA, federal courts can grant habeas relief to state prisoners only if the state court\u2019s decision was \u201ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1). A state court\u2019s decision is \u201ccontrary to\u201d federal law if it \u201capplies a rule that contradicts the governing law\u201d set forth in Supreme Court cases, or if it \u201cconfronts a set of facts that are materially indistinguishable\u201d from a Supreme Court decision, but \u201cnevertheless arrives at a result different from [Supreme Court] precedent.\u201d <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Phillippi is entitled to habeas relief based on a state court\u2019s decision to deny a motion for severance only if the joint trial was so prejudicial that it denied Phillippi his right to a fair trial. <em>United States v. Lane, </em>474 U.S. 438, 446 n. 8, 106 S.Ct. 725, 88 L.Ed.2d 814 (1986); <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 539, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). The state court\u2019s decision that Phillippi \u201cfailed to demonstrate ... a gross unfairness such as to deprive [Phillippi] of a fair trial or due process\u201d was not contrary to <em>Lane </em>and <em>Zafiro. </em>Phillippi\u2019s right to a fair trial was not denied by the trial court\u2019s failure to sever his trial from his co-defendants due to mutually antagonistic defenses. Moreover, even if the Court of Appeal did reach an erroneous result, Phillippi cannot prove that the trial court\u2019s decision denying his severance motion had a substantial or injurious effect on his guilty verdict, as his co-defendant could have testified against him in a separate trial. <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s decision denying Phillippi\u2019s habeas petition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b289-23\">. This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited in or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b290-7\">. In determining whether a state court decision is contrary to federal law, this court examines the last reasoned decision of a state court as the basis of the state court\u2019s judgment. Because the California Supreme Court denied Phillippi\u2019s review petition without comment, the last reasoned decision on Phillippi's due process challenge is the unpublished opinion by the California Court of Appeal. <em>See Ylst v. Nunnemeker, </em>501 U.S. 797, 803-804, 111 S.Ct. 2590, 115 L.Ed.2d 706 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
