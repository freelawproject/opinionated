Jacobs claims the USWA discriminated against him based on his age, race, and national origin, and that it retaliated against him for raising complaints about discrimination. We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and affirming if there are no disputed issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-22\">First, Jacobs claims the USWA discriminated against him on the basis of his age. Jacobs\u2019s age discrimination claim, however, is barred by Minnesota\u2019s one-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>year statute of limitations. <em>See Winkels v. George </em>A <em>Hormel &amp; Co., </em>874 F.2d 567, 570 (8th Cir.1989) (cases filed in state court are governed by state procedural rules); Minn.Stat. \u00a7 363.06, subd. 3 (2000) (statute of limitations for age discrimination claims is one year). Jacobs did not raise claims of age discrimination in his EEOC complaint; he did not claim he suffered from age discrimination after he resigned; and he did not serve the USWA with notice of the lawsuit until June 27, 2002-more than one year after his employment ended. <em>See Ochs v. Streater, Inc., </em>568 N.W.2d 858, 859 (Minn.Ct.App.1997) (a lawsuit begins when the defendant is served with notice). The district court<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> properly concluded Jacobs\u2019s age discrimination claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Second, Jacobs asserts the USWA discriminated against him on the basis of his race and national origin (Hispanic and Native American) when it failed adequately to grieve Jacobs\u2019s complaints about his employer. Title VII and the Minnesota Human Rights Act (MHRA) both prohibit labor organizations from discriminating against their members on the basis of race and national origin. <em>See, e.g., Thorn v. Amalgamated Transit Union, </em>305 F.3d 826, 831-32 (8th Cir.2002). In <em>Thom, </em>we explained the limits of unions\u2019 obligations under Title VII and the MHRA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">A labor organization is liable for an employer\u2019s discrimination in the workplace if it causes or attempts to cause the employer to discriminate, \u00a7 2000e-2(c)(3); or if the union \u201cpurposefully acts or refuses to act in a manner which prevents or obstructs a reasonable accommodation by his employer,\u201d ... or if the union \u201cpursue[s] a policy of rejecting disparate-treatment grievances\u2019 meant to vindicate employee rights protected by Title VII....\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">Though the Unions were prohibited from causing or assisting unlawful discrimination by Thorn\u2019s employer, nowhere in either statute do we find language imposing upon unions an affirmative duty to investigate and take steps to remedy employer discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-8\">Id. at 832-33 (internal citations omitted). Jacobs raises many concerns about his employer\u2019s actions, but we cannot say Jacobs suffered discrimination or retaliation at the hands of the USWA. Thus, we conclude the district court properly granted summary judgment on Jacobs\u2019s claims of race and national origin discrimination, and on his claims of retaliation.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-9\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is affirmed. See 8th Cir. R. 47B.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b221-19\"> The Honorable Donovan W.
