We have reviewed the record and the district court\u2019s opinion accepting the recommendation of the magistrate judge and conclude on the reasoning of the district court that Jones has not made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right. <em>See Jones v. United States, </em>No. CA-02-2790-2-20BC (D.S.C. Mar. 4, 2002). Accordingly, we deny a certificate of appealability and dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-23\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
