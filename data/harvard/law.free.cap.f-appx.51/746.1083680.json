INS, </em>133 F.3d 1147, 1150 (9th Cir.1997), we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1105a(a). We review for abuse of discretion the denial of a motion to reopen. <em>Garcia v. INS, </em>222 F.3d 1208, 1209 (9th Cir.2000) (per curiam). We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-21\">The BIA properly denied Niar\u2019s motion to reopen to apply for relief under Article 3 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture because her motion was untimely. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(b)(2)(i); <em>see also Abassi v. INS, </em>305 F.3d 1028, 1030 n. 1 (9th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-22\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Niar\u2019s motion to reopen due to her counsel\u2019s failure to inform her of the hearing because Nair was personally served with notice of the hearing. <em>See Garcia, </em>222 F.3d at 1209; <em>see Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (9th Cir.2000) (requiring that petitioner must show that counsel\u2019s conduct caused harm).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-23\">We do not review Nair\u2019s contention that she did not understand the hearing notice due to a language barrier because she failed to raise this argument before the BIA or IJ. <em>See Cordon-Garcia v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 985, 988 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b782-24\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b782-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
