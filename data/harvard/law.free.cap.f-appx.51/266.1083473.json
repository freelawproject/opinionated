We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-23\">We review de novo the district court order affirming the Commissioner\u2019s denial of social security benefits. <em>Armstrong v. Commissioner of the Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>160 F.3d 587, 589 (9th Cir.1998). If the Commissioner applied the correct legal standards and substantial evidence supports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>the Commissioner\u2019s decision, it must be affirmed. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">None of Robinson\u2019s examining and treating physicians opined that Robinson\u2019s multiple sclerosis was disabling prior to December 20, 1996. The medical reports and the testimony of the vocational expert constitute substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s conclusion that Robinson was capable of performing her past relevant work as a secretary/clerk until December 1, 1996. <em>See Villa v. Heckler, </em>797 F.2d 794, 796 (9th Cir.1986) (stating that while the Secretary could have chosen an earlier onset date the question we face is whether the chosen onset date is supported by substantial evidence, not whether an earlier date could have been supported).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">The May 1992 report of Robinson\u2019s treating physician Dr. Sibley, that Robinson had never been disabled for purposes of full time employment, provided clear and convincing reasons for finding Robinson\u2019s testimony not credible. <em>See Johnson v. Shalala, </em>60 F.3d 1428, 1433-34 (9th Cir.1995) (finding clear and convincing reasons based on contradictions between claimant\u2019s testimony and the relevant medical evidence). Furthermore, the ALJ properly rejected the opinion of vocational consultant Richard W. Vandenberg because it was based on a one-time evaluation, and conflicted with both Robinson\u2019s testimony and Dr. Sibley\u2019s reports. <em>See Magallanes v. Bowen, </em>881 F.2d 747, 751 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b302-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by 9th Cir.
