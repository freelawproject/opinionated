On appeal, counsel has moved to withdraw under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and has filed a brief raising the issues whether Martinez-Brise-no admitted at his guilty-plea hearing each of the elements of the offense, and whether his sentence was within the applicable Guidelines range, given the facts in the presentence report (PSR).</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-18\">Upon careful review, we find that Martinez-Briseno admitted during his guilty-plea hearing each element of the offense of illegal reentry, and we find no error in the Guidelines range computed in the PSR and adopted by the district court. Moreover, following our independent review, <em>see Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), we find no nonfrivolous issues for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1038-19\">Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed. We also grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1038-17\">. The Honorable Donald E. O'Brien, United States District Judge for the Northern District of Iowa.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
