Wyner entered a guilty plea to one count of making a false statement to a lending institution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1014, and one count of interstate transportation of property obtained by fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2314. He now appeals from the district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence only partially concurrent with a prior sentence of incarceration imposed in the Northern District of California. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we vacate Wyner\u2019s sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">Wyner contends that the district court applied the wrong version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3 in determining whether his sentence was to run concurrently or consecutively to his prior sentence. When a criminal defendant raises for the first time on appeal the district court\u2019s use of the incorrect version of the Sentencing Guidelines, we review the sentence for plain error. <em>United States v. Chea, </em>231 F.3d 531, 535 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b674-8\">The district court committed plain error when it sentenced Wyner because it relied on the wrong version of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines provide that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-9\">if the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the ex post facto clause of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b674-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.11(b)(1). The district court sentenced Wyner on August 6, 1998 for crimes he had committed on or before October 31, 1995. Section 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3 was amended effective November 1, 1995. We have held that the November 1995 amendment did implicate the Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const, art. I., \u00a7 9, el. 3, and that it is plain error for a sentencing court to apply the later version of \u00a7 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3 to a defendant convicted of a crime committed before the amendment\u2019s effective date. <em>Chea, </em>231 F.3d at 535-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-14\">We reject the government\u2019s argument that the district court may have, <em>sub silen-tio, </em>considered and rejected the application of the discretionary standard of \u00a7 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3 in its sentencing. <em>See United States v. Redman, </em>35 F.3d 437, 441-42 (9th Cir.1994). <em>Redman </em>requires that the district court \u201cstate its reasons for abandoning the [\u00a7 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3 (1994) ] methodology in such a way as to allow us to see that it has considered the methodology.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-15\">We further reject the government\u2019s argument that Wyner has waived the grounds for this appeal because his trial counsel erroneously told the district court that it had discretion to choose which version of \u00a7 5G1.3(c) to apply. <em>United States v. Gilcrist, </em>106 F.3d 297, 302 (9th Cir.1997). The attorney\u2019s statement is insufficient to demonstrate that Wyner \u201cexpressly agreed\u201d to the district court\u2019s use of the post-amendment version by \u201caffirmatively waiv[ing] consideration of the [pre-amendment] version of the guidelines or abandoning] the ex post facto argument.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number><em>Chea, </em>281 F.3d at 540 (citing <em>Gilcrist, </em>106 F.3d at 302).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">Although we remand for resentencing under the appropriate version of \u00a7 5G1.3(c), cmt. n. 3, we do not limit our remand to this issue. <em>United States v. Matthews, </em>278 F.3d 880, 885-86 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc). The remand will also permit the government to remedy the jurisdictional problems associated with its untimely Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b) motion by allowing it to petition the district court for a downward sentencing departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b674-10\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
