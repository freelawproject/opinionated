(ROA I at 10, 24.) After firing two court-appointed attorneys, Book chose to represent himself. (ROA VI at 19.) When the district court ruled against him on his motion to suppress key evidence, Book <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>changed his mind about representing himself and asked the court to appoint a new attorney for him. (ROA X at 109-12.) The court refused to grant his request for another attorney and told Book he could choose between the two attorneys he had previously fired. <em>(Id. </em>at 115-18.) Book declined both attorneys and shortly decided to plead guilty to two counts of the indictment and waive his right to appeal any aspect of his case except his motion to suppress. <em>(Id. </em>at 118; ROA I at 87.) Book was sentenced to 84 months in prison and now appeals. (ROA XIII at 14, 107.) He argues that the court deprived him of his Sixth Amendment rights to counsel and self-representation. (Aplt. Br. at 1-2.) We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, find that Book\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was valid, hold him to the terms of his plea agreement and DISMISS his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In January of 2001, police officers in North Denver arrested Book in a parking lot, where he was sitting in his car packaging drugs that he was planning to sell. (ROA V at 4, 34-38.) When the police searched his car, they found 83 grams of methamphetamine and a sawed-off shotgun. (ROA I at 1; ROA IX at 69-70.) In February, Book was indicted on three counts: possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(l)(B)(viii); possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(B); and being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1) and 924(a)(2). (ROA I at 10. 24.) Assistant Federal Public Defender Warren R. Williamson was appointed in January to represent Book but withdrew in March at Book\u2019s prompting, stating that Book no longer trusted him, a sentiment that Book confirmed. (ROA I at 18; ROA II.) The district court then appointed attorney Stephen M. Wheeler to represent Book. (ROA I at 19.) Wheeler moved to suppress the evidence found in Book\u2019s car. (ROA I at 25.) At the beginning of the July 16 hearing on the motion, Book asked the court to dismiss Wheeler and appoint new counsel because of Wheeler\u2019s unwillingness to pursue a \u201cchain of custody\u201d argument that Wheeler felt was not worth pursuing. (ROA VI at 3-9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">After inquiring into Book\u2019s dissatisfaction with Wheeler, the court denied Book\u2019s request, finding \u201cno basis\u201d for his ineffectiveness claim. <em>(Id. </em>at 12.) The court told Book that he could either retain Wheeler or proceed pro se. <em>(Id. </em>at 9-10.) After explaining to Book the charges against him and the risks involved with representing himself, the court permitted Book to proceed pro se and asked Wheeler to stay on as standby counsel for the duration of the suppression hearing. <em>(Id. </em>at 12-20.) In August, however, both Wheeler and Book moved that Wheeler be removed as standby counsel due to irreconcilable differences between them. (ROA I at 70, 71.) The court granted the motions. (ROA VIII at 3.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">On September 5, the court denied Book\u2019s motion to suppress. (ROA X at 103.) Book then asked the court to give him a new attorney. <em>(Id. </em>at 109.) The court offered to reappoint Wheeler, but Book declined, explaining that he and Wheeler differed on what strategy should be used in his case. <em>(Id. </em>at 109-14.)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">After telling Book to choose between proceeding pro se or accepting Wheeler and that it believed Book\u2019s request for new counsel was simply a delaying tactic, the court said that it would also be willing to reappoint Williamson, Book\u2019s first attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"821\">*821</page-number>in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>(Id. </em>at 115, 117.) Book refused that offer as well. <em>(Id. </em>at 117-19.) Two weeks later, he pled guilty to two of the three counts in the indictment (possession with intent to distribute and felon in possession of a firearm) and waived his right to appeal any issue except his suppression motion. (ROA I at 87; ROA XI.) In December, Book \u2014 now represented by Williamson, his first attorney \u2014 was sentenced to 84 months in prison and four years of supervised release. (ROA XII at 2-3; ROA I at 105.) Judgment was entered in February; this appeal followed. (ROA I at 113,107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">\n<em>Standard of review</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">We review de novo both a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel and whether a defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>191 F.3d 1317, 1323 (10th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Rubio, </em>231 F.3d 709, 712 (10th Cir.2000). <em>Introduction</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">If enforceable, Book\u2019s plea agreement\u2014 which waived his right to appeal any issue but his motion to suppress \u2014 robs us of subject matter jurisdiction over his ease, and we must dismiss his appeal. \u201cWe do, however, have jurisdiction to determine our jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Rubio, </em>231 F.3d at 711. First, we must determine whether the defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel was voluntary, knowing and intelligent. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 835, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). Second, we must ask whether the defendant entered into the plea agreement knowingly and voluntarily. <em>Rubio, </em>231 F.3d at 712.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-15\">\n<em>Book\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b857-16\">Here, we inquire into Book\u2019s two waivers of counsel: one, his initial waiver during his July 16 suppression hearing, when he fired Wheeler and the court refused to appoint new counsel; and two, his September request for new counsel after he lost his suppression motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-17\">For a defendant\u2019s waiver of counsel to be voluntary, \u201cthe trial court must inquire into the reasons for the defendant\u2019s dissatisfaction with his counsel to ensure that the defendant is not exercising a choice between incompetent or unprepared counsel and appearing pro se.\u201d <em>Braun v. Ward, </em>190 F.3d 1181, 1185-86 (10th Cir.1999) (quoting <em>United States v. Silkwood, </em>893 F.2d 245, 248 (10th Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted)). In July, Book was given a choice between proceeding pro se and accepting a competent attorney; that he chose the former because Wheeler refused to pursue a \u201cchain of custody\u201d argument does not make his choice invol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"822\">*822</page-number>untary in the constitutional sense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In September, he was given a choice between proceeding pro se and accepting one of two competent attorneys, and he again refused that offer. When the court twice asked Book whether he would accept Williamson or Wheeler, Book responded, \u201cNeither one of those attorneys would be of any use to me,\u201d and \u201cBoth of those attorneys have been dismissed from my case. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to have them represent me again.\u201d (ROA X at 118.) Those statements fail to suggest the existence of an irreconcilable conflict that would warrant the appointment of yet another attorney. We find that his waiver of counsel was voluntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">In determining whether a defendant\u2019s waiver of his right to counsel was knowing and intelligent, \u201c[t]he record should establish the defendant had a sense of the magnitude of the undertaking and the inherent hazards of self-representation at the time of his decision to proceed pro se.\u201d <em>United, States v. Taylor, </em>113 F.3d 1136, 1141 (10th Cir.1997). As noted above, the district court engaged in lengthy colloquy with Book before allowing him to proceed pro se in July. Given the extent of that colloquy and the court\u2019s finding that Book was asking for a third attorney simply to delay the proceedings, Book\u2019s argument that his hand was being forced is not credible. We reach the same conclusion with respect to his waiver at the September hearing. We find that his waiver of counsel in both July and September was knowingly and voluntarily made. <em>Book\u2019s waiver of his right to appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">\u201cThis court will hold a defendant to the terms of a lawful plea agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Atterberry, </em>144 F.3d 1299, 1300 (10th Cir.1998). In his Opening Brief, Book alleges only that he did not voluntarily waive his right to counsel; not until his Reply Brief does he attack his plea agreement. \u201cIssues not raised in the opening brief are deemed abandoned or waived.\u201d <em>Coleman v. B-G Maintenance Mgmt, </em>108 F.3d 1199, 1205 (10th Cir.1997). Because we have determined that Book validly waived his right to counsel, we will hold him to the terms of his lawful plea agreement. That agreement waived Book\u2019s right to appeal any issue except his motion to suppress. We therefore DISMISS his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b855-21\">After examining appellant\u2019s brief and the appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b857-9\">. The court\u2019s exchange with Book included the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-10\">THE COURT: Do you want me to reappoint Mr. Williamson, your first attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-11\">THE DEFENDANT: I don\u2019t even know if Mr. Williamson would be willing to do this either.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-12\">THE COURT: Why should anybody else be willing? You fired two attorneys, you want a third one. * * * I'll broaden the choice: you can have Mr. Williamson or Mr. Wheeler.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Neither one of those attorneys would be of any use to me. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-18\">THE COURT: * * * Now, what do you want me to do, represent yourself or have Mr. Wheeler or Mr. Williamson? Your choice as to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Wouldn\u2019t be fair for me to take either one of those attorneys. THE COURT: Why?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-20\">THE DEFENDANT: Both of those attorneys have been dismissed from my case. It wouldn\u2019t be fair to have them represent me again. I can\u2019t represent myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-21\">THE COURT: Then you\u2019re representing yourself. You let the marshal know if you change your mind. * * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-22\"><em>(Id. </em>at 117-19.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b858-5\">. After Book explained his \"chain of custody\u201d argument and his desire to fire Wheeler for not pursuing it, the court told Book that it found \"nothing in your presentation to suggest that Mr. Wheeler has been incompetent. ... Your other complaints seem to me to be irrational.\u201d (ROA VI at 10, 11.) We agree with the district court. Absent an abuse of discretion, \u201cdeficiencies in the chain of custody go to the weight of the evidence and not its admissibility,\u201d <em>United States v. Gay, </em>774 F.2d 368, 374 (10th Cir.1985), the proper time for Book \u2014 or Wheeler \u2014 to have raised this claim was at trial, not during the motion to suppress. The district court properly recognized this. (ROA VIII at 10-12.) Book was not entitled to fire Wheeler and receive new counsel merely because he disagreed with Wheeler's strategic approach to the case. <em>See United States v. Padilla, </em>819 F.2d 952, 956 (10th Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
