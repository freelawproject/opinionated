The parties agree that Samuels stipulated in his plea agreement that the United States could attempt at sentencing to link a murder for which Samuels had been tried and acquitted in state court to Samuels\u2019 possession of the ammunition. The district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Samuels possessed the ammunition in connection with the murder of Ronald Griggs and imposed a statutory maximum ten-year custodial sentence. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">First, Samuels\u2019 contention that the district court improperly relied on hearsay testimony in concluding he murdered Griggs is without merit. Sentencing courts are accorded wide discretion in evidentiary matters and may consider any relevant, reliable evidence. <em>United States v. Hopkins, </em>310 F.3d 145, 154 (4th Cir.2002) (No. 01-4581). Further, a sentencing court may consider hearsay testimony. <em>United States v. Love, </em>134 F.3d 595, 607 (4th Cir.1998). In light of the substantial testimony linking Samuels to Griggs\u2019 murder, we find no reversible error in the admission of the testimony in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">Second, we find no merit in Samuel\u2019s contention that the district court improperly included a prior conviction for which his civil rights were restored in calculating his criminal history category. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment (n.10) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Accordingly, Samuels\u2019 sentence is affirmed, and we dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
