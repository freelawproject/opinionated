We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">First, Reid argues the district court\u2019s questions to Reid during his testimony called into question his credibility and indicated a disbelief in the veracity of his testimony. Generally, a trial judge\u2019s interrogation of witnesses is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>135 F.3d 291, 307 (4th Cir.1998). Reid, however, made no objections to the judge\u2019s questioning. Rule 614(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure allows objections to interrogation by the court to be made \u201cat the time [of the questions] or at the next available opportunity when the jury is not present.\u201d Therefore, we limit our review to plain error. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-34, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). Reid is not entitled to relief on this claim unless he shows: (1) error; (2) that the error is plain; and (3) that the error affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>at 732. Even then, this Court \u201crefrainfs] from intervening unless the error \u2018seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Godwin, </em>272 F.3d 659, 679(4th Cir.2001) (quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 736). We have reviewed the record and find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-12\">Second, Reid argues the district court erred when it applied a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice under USSG \u00a7 3C1.1. Section 3C1.1 allows a two-level increase when a defendant willfully obstructs or impedes the administration of justice during the investigation, prosecution or sentencing of an offense. The district court\u2019s factual findings concerning sentencing factors are reviewed for clear error, and legal determinations are reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. France, </em>164 F.3d 203, 209 (4th Cir.1998). We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court did not err when it applied the enhancement based on a finding of perjury during Reid\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-13\">Finally, Reid argues the district court erred when it departed upward. Reid argues the district court applied an upward departure based on his reputation and that this consideration is impermissible. The district court, however, departed upward based on the inadequacy of Reid\u2019s criminal history category and the likelihood that he would commit other crimes under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4A1.3 (2001). Assuming, without deciding, that the court\u2019s consideration of repu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>tation was improperly included in its calculus, the record nonetheless amply supports the court\u2019s finding even if that factor is excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The court\u2019s ultimate decision to depart is reviewed for abuse of discretion, but its underlying factual findings are reviewed for clear error and, if the departure is based on a misinterpretation of the guideline, that underlying ruling is reviewed de novo. <em>United States v. Rybicki, </em>96 F.3d 754, 758 (4th Cir.1996). We have reviewed the record and conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion when it departed upward based on the inadequacy of Reid\u2019s criminal history category and the likelihood that he would commit other crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">We therefore affirm Reid\u2019s conviction and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
