Katz, United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b204-6\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b204-7\">Defendant-Appellant, Michael E. Allen (\u201cAllen\u201d), appeals the district court order requiring him to pay restitution of $9,546 to the People\u2019s Bank of Kentucky. Allen alleges that the district court erred when it ordered restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A (\u201cMandatory Victim Restitution Act\u201d) rather than 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663 (\u2018Victim and Witness Protection Act\u201d). Allen also alleges that the district court erred because it failed to take his financial condition into account when it ordered restitution. Allen requests that the restitution order be vacated and remanded to the district court for reconsideration under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-8\">We find that the district court properly ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663A because Allen\u2019s offense fell within the category of offenses enumerated under \u00a7 3663A. As a result, the district court was not required to consider Allen\u2019s financial condition when it ordered restitution. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s order requiring Allen to pay restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-11\">I. Factual and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b204-12\">On August 4, 2000, three individuals, known to the defendant, robbed the People\u2019s Bank and Trust Company in Mon-terey, Kentucky. Allen learned of the robbery after it occurred, and received payment from the individuals who participated in the robbery. Allen failed to notify the authorities that he had knowledge concerning this crime. The record also indicates that Allen\u2019s car was used during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-13\">On November 2, 2000, a Federal Grand Jury in the Eastern District of Kentucky returned a one count indictment which charged that Allen and three other co-defendants:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-14\">\u201c... by force, violence, and intimidation, did take and attempt to take, from the person and presence of another, money that was then in the care, custody, control, management, and possession of People\u2019s Bank and Trust Company in Monterey, Kentucky, an institution that deposits of which were then insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Company <em>}&gt;</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-16\">On January 22, 2001, pursuant to a plea agreement, Allen signed a waiver of indictment and entered a plea of guilty to one count information. The plea agreement lists the elements of Allen\u2019s offense as: \u201c(1) the defendant had knowledge of the actual commission of a felony, that is a robbery, (2) the defendant concealed his knowledge and accepted a payment from those involved in the robbery, (3) the defendant did not make known the commission of the robbery to a person in civil or military authority of the United States.\u201d The three co-defendants pled guilty to the robbery charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>After accepting Allen\u2019s plea, the district court sentenced Allen to a prison term of one year and a day. In its order, the district court adopted the recommendation of the presentence report which stated that \u201cPursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663(a), restitution shall be ordered in this case.\u201d Accordingly, the district court ordered Allen to pay $9,546 to the People\u2019s Bank of Monterey, Kentucky, payment due in full immediately. Allen was held jointly and severally liable for this amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">a. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">This court reviews restitution orders for abuse of discretion. <em>See U.S. v. Sanders, </em>95 F.3d 449 (6th Cir.1996). However, where the defendant does not object to restitution at sentencing, this court reviews the district court order for plain error. <em>See United States v. Schulte </em>264 F.3d 656, 660 (6th Cir.2001). Here, Allen did not object to restitution at the time of sentencing. Accordingly, we review the district court\u2019s order for plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">To establish plain error, the defendant must demonstrate that \u201c(1) an error occurred in the district court; (2) the error was plain i.e., obvious or clear; (3) the error affected the defendant\u2019s substantial rights; and (4) the adverse impact seriously affected the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Schulte </em>at 660.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">b. <em>The district court properly ordered restitution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b205-10\">Allen requests that this court vacate the district court\u2019s restitution order on the grounds that his offense does not fall within the category of offenses enumerated under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A. That section makes restitution mandatory for certain categories of offenses. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3663A provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-12\">(1) This section shall apply in all sentencing proceedings for convictions of, or plea agreements relating to charges for, any offense\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-13\">(A) that is\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-14\">(1) a crime of violence, as defined in section 16;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-15\">(n) an offense against property under this title, or under section 416 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 856(a)) including any offense committed by fraud or deceit; or (iii) an offense described in section 1365 (relating to tampering with consumer products); and in which an identifiable victim or victims has suffered a physical injury or pecuniary loss.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-16\">(2) In the case of a plea agreement that does not result in a conviction for an offense described in paragraph (1), this section shall apply only if the plea specifically states that an offense listed under such paragraph gave rise to the plea agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-17\">We limit our analysis to whether Allen\u2019s offense was related to a crime of violence, and whether the plea agreement specifically mentions that it arose from a crime of violence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 defines a crime of violence as \u201c(a) an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or (b) any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b205-18\">Allen has failed to establish that the district court committed a clear and obvious error when it ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663A. First, Allen\u2019s information plea relates to a bank robbery a crime which clearly satisfies the definition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>crime of violence. Moreover, the plea agreement specifically notes that it was obtained in exchange for the robbery charge. Concerning this, the plea agreement reads, \u201cThe United States hereby agrees that following the Court\u2019s acceptance of the plea of guilty as set forth above, the United States will move to dismiss the defendant from Frankfort Criminal No. 00-22.\u201d Frankfort Criminal No. 00-22 refers to the robbery charge pending before the district court when Allen\u2019s plea was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">As a result, the district court properly ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663A on two grounds: 1) that the plea related to a crime of violence; and 2) that the plea agreement specifically mentioned that it was obtained as a result of a crime of violence. Consequently, we affirm the district court\u2019s restitution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">c. <em>Whether the district court considered Allen\u2019s financial condition?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">Having concluded that the district court did not err when it ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663A, we now examine whether the district court was required to consider the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances in ordering restitution. Section 3663A makes restitution <em>mandatory </em>for certain offenses. As a result, the district court was not required to consider the defendant\u2019s financial condition when it ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663A. (However, if the court had ordered restitution under \u00a7 3663, then the court would have been required to consider the defendant\u2019s financial circumstances before it ordered restitution.) Moreover, we find that the district court satisfied the requirements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3664. Section 3664 requires the district court to consider \u201cthe financial resources of the defendant and other assets of the defendant, including whether any of these assets are jointly controlled.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">This circuit does not require that the district court \u201cmake explicit findings about the statutory factors\u201d in order to demonstrate that it considered the defendant\u2019s financial condition. <em>United States v. Sanders, </em>95 F.3d 449 (6th Cir.1996); <em>see also United States v. Hall, </em>71 F.3d 569, 574 (6th Cir.1995) (holding that the district court was deemed to have considered the defendant\u2019s financial condition because this information was present in the presen-tence report and other documents presented before the court).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">In this case, as in <em>Hall </em>and <em>Sanders, </em>the defendant\u2019s financial condition was fully outlined in the presentence report. Allen has not presented any evidence suggesting that the district court failed to consider this information. As a result, we conclude that the district court did not commit a plain error when it determined the manner and schedule of repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
