We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b54-11\">A government employee who retires for disability may receive disability benefits from two sources: (1) the Federal Employees\u2019 Retirement System disability retirement benefits (\u201cCivil Service disability benefits\u201d) and (2) the Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation Programs (\u201cCompensation benefits\u201d). 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 8451, 8102, 8105-106 (2000). The employee, however, may not receive both types of benefits for the same period, and shall elect which benefits to receive. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 8116(a), (b) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">The appellant Cheryl Griffin retired from the United States Postal Service for disability. The Office of Workers\u2019 Compensation (\u201cCompensation Office\u201d) informed her by letter that she should elect which type of benefit she would receive, and that Civil Service disability benefits and Compensation benefits \u201care not payable for the same period of time.\u201d The election form stated: \u201cI understand that I am not entitled to receive FECA benefits and CSRS/FERS benefits concurrently [with an exception not applicable here].\u201d Griffin chose Civil Service disability benefits, effective May 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-14\">Shortly after that election she received a lump sum interim payment for those benefits for the period between January and April 2000. During that period Griffin also received Compensation benefits. She received $8,290 in overpayments of Civil Service disability benefits, which consisted of (1) $6,283 for the period she was also receiving Compensation benefits (January to April 2000) and $2,007 for the period for which she elected to receive Civil Service disability benefits (after May 1, 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">Griffin stated that she telephoned both OPM and the Compensation Office and asked what to do with the double payment; and that someone at OPM told her to keep the money. Shortly thereafter, however, OPM demanded repayment from Griffin, who requested OPM to waive repayment because of financial hardship. After OPM denied a waiver and denied reconsidera<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>tion, Griffin appealed OPM\u2019s action to the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">In her initial decision, which became final when the Board refused to review it, the Board\u2019s administrative judge modified OPM\u2019s decision and, as modified, affirmed it. The Board determined that Griffin was not entitled to a waiver of the $6,283 overpayment because, as explained below, she was obligated to set aside this amount for repayment; but it reduced the monthly repayment amounts OPM had ordered from $87.50 to $50.00. The Board waived the $2007 overpayment for the period after May 1 because Griffin did not know she was not entitled to this sum and thus, it was not an overpayment that Griffin was obligated to set aside for repayment. The Board found that recovery of this overpayment would cause \u201cfinancial hardship\u201d and would be \u201cagainst equity and good conscience\u201d because Griffin \u201chas a negative monthly income/expense margin of $150 and ... she does not have substantial liquid assets.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">We must affirm the decision of the Board unless we find that it is: \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">OPM regulations provide: \u201c[rjecovery of an overpayment ... may be waived ... when (a) the annuitant is without fault and (b) recovery would be against equity and good conscience.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301 (2002). OPM policy guidelines require, however, that \u201c[individuals who are aware that they are receiving overpayments are obligated by the principles of equity and good conscience to set aside the amount overpaid ... [t]hus, an individual who accepted a payment which he/she suspected or knew to be erroneous but who is found without fault ... is obligated to set the overpaid money aside pending recovery by OPM.\u201d OPM Policy Guidelines, \u00a7 I.C.4 (\u201cset-aside rule\u201d) (emphasis omitted). Absent \u201cexceptional circumstances,\u201d such an annuitant is not entitled to a waiver. <em>Id. </em>Financial hardship does not ordinarily qualify as an \u201cexceptional circumstance.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">We agree with the Board that whether Griffin should have set aside the $6,283 overpayment turns on whether she knew or suspected during \u201cthe period before or during the accrual of the overpayment\u201d that she was required to return the money. <em>See Okonski v. Office of Personnel Mgmt., </em>63 M.S.P.R. 446, 453 (1994) (citation omitted). When Griffin received the overpayment she knew that she was not entitled to receive concurrently Civil Service disability benefits and Compensation benefits. The Worker\u2019s Compensation Office letter, which she received before she received the Civil Service disability benefits, so told her. She signed the election form that stated, \u201cI understand that I am not entitled to receive FECA benefits and CSRS/ FERS benefits concurrently.\u201d Indeed, Griffin admits she knew that she was not entitled to double disability benefits and she understood that the lump sum Civil Service interim retirement payment was for the period of time for which she was already receiving Compensation benefits. Further, as the Board noted, Griffin showed no exceptional circumstances entitling her to a waiver. Griffin was required to set aside the $6,283 Civil Service disability payment and was not entitled to a waiver of repayment.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">\u2018When it has been determined that the recipient of an overpayment is ineligible for waiver, the individual is nevertheless <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>entitled to an adjustment in the recovery schedule if he or she shows that it would cause him or her financial hardship to make payment at the rate scheduled.\u201d 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 845.301 (2002). The Board applied this standard when it reduced Griffin\u2019s monthly repayment from $87.50 to $50.00 because repayment at the higher amount would cause Griffin \u201cfinancial hardship.\u201d</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
