They pointed out that, pursuant to the written policy of the Department of Public Safety and Correction Services, psychiatric illness could be medicated, over objection, if such treatment was for the health and safety of the inmate or others and was clinically appropriate. And each time emergency medication was given to Dancy, it was deemed medically necessary and ordered by a psychiatrist who was either present or contacted by phone. Dancy did not dispute the specifics of the factual underpinnings of his medications, but asserted that he disagreed \u201cwith each and every reason given by the [Defendants] to forcibly inject me without my consent.\u201d Dancy also maintained that he \u201cwas never a danger to [himself] or anyone else.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">On the record before it, the district court concluded that Dancy\u2019s general denial of being dangerous and his conclusory statements failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact on his \u00a7 1983 claims. The court observed that \u201c[n]owhere in his affidavit does he contest the factual evidence about particular incidents where his behavior was abusive, self-injurious, or violent.\u201d The court then reviewed the applicable legal principles and awarded summary judgment to the Defendants on Dancy\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>Dancy v. Simms, 116 </em>F.Supp.2d 652 (D.Md.2000) (the \u201cOpinion\u201d). Dancy has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">Having carefully considered the submissions of the parties, we are unable to discern any error in the ruling of the district court. As it observed, the Supreme Court has held that a state may constitutionally \u201ctreat a prison inmate who has a serious mental illness with anti-psychotic drugs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>against his will, if the inmate is dangerous to himself or others and the treatment is in the inmate\u2019s medical interest.\u201d <em>Washington v. Harper, </em>494 U.S. 210, 227, 110 S.Ct. 1028, 108 L.Ed.2d 178 (1990); Opinion at 3-4. The court carefully reviewed the applicable precedent in this regard, including our decision in <em>United States v. Charters, </em>863 F.2d 302 (4th Cir.1988), and its progeny, concluding that \u201cthe decision to administer anti-psychotic medication over an inmate\u2019s objection comports with due process if ... made in the exercise of professional medical judgment and [in] an emergency situation where the inmate posed a danger to himself or others.\u201d Opinion at 655. The court then concluded that \u201cthe professional judgments of Dan-cy\u2019s health care providers and the emergency medication policies [of Maryland\u2019s] prison officials complied with the [applicable] standard.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656. While Dancy made a general denial of being dangerous, the court properly concluded that such a denial was insufficient to create an issue of material fact. He presented no medical evidence contradicting the judgments of the medical professionals and, in the absence of such evidence, he was unable to create a triable issue. <em>Id. </em>at 656-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">Pursuant to the foregoing, we are content to affirm the award of summary judgment against Dancy on the basis of the district court\u2019s well reasoned Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-6\">. The officials awarded summary judgment include Archie Gee, the Warden at Patuxent; Stuart Simms, the Secretary of Maryland's Department of Public Safety &amp; Correctional Services; Richard Lanham, Sr., the Commissioner of its Division of Corrections; Joseph Henneberry, a Director at Patuxent; Captain Terrence Davis, a Correctional Officer at Pa-tuxent; and Lieutenant Keith Green, a Correctional Officer at Patuxent. The health care providers awarded summary judgment were EMSA Correctional Care, Inc.; Correctional Medical Services, Inc.; and Dr. Ferdinand Massari. Dancy failed to serve the remaining defendants.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b943-12\">. Unlike the others who sought summary judgment, EMSA Correctional Care, Inc., filed a motion to dismiss Dancy's lawsuit. Because, in addressing this motion, the court considered materials outside the pleadings, EMSA\u2019s motion to dismiss was converted to a motion for summary judgment. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b943-13\">. After awarding summary judgment on the \u00a7 1983 claims, the court declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over Dancy\u2019s remaining state law claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
