We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. Reviewing de novo, <em>see Mayfield v. Woodford, </em>270 F.3d 915, 922 (9th Cir.2001) (en banc) (stating that ineffective assistance of counsel claims raised in habeas petitions filed prior to the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act are reviewed de novo), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-23\">Eckstrom\u2019s counsel offered a sufficiency of the evidence defense pursuant <em>People v. Anderson, </em>70 Cal.2d 15, 73 Cal.Rptr. 550, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>447 P.2d 942 (Cal.1968) (in banc), and an insanity defense in a bifurcated court trial. Eckstrom contends that his counsel should have presented a diminished capacity defense, in addition to the <em>Anderson </em>defense, during the guilt phase of his trial. Eck-strom has not shown, however, that his counsel\u2019s failure to do so was the result of incompetence or inadequate preparation. <em>See Murtishaw v. Woodford, 255 </em>F.3d 926, 939 (9th Cir.2001) (stating that petitioner \u201cbears the heavy burden of proving that counsel\u2019s assistance was neither reasonable nor the result of sound trial strategy\u201d). Moreover, Eckstrom does not assert, nor does the record show that his counsel failed to consider or to investigate adequately a diminished capacity defense. We, therefore, conclude that the district court properly determined that counsel\u2019s decision not to present a diminished capacity defense was a reasonable strategic choice rather than the result of deficient performance, and affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Eckstrom\u2019s habeas petition. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689-690, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (stating that \u201ca court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance [and] strategic choices made after thorough investigation ... are virtually unchallengeable ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b799-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
