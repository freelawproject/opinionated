After Stone terminated Lockhart for violating sexual-harassment and workplace-violence policies, he brought this action under section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 185, alleging unfair representation by the Union and breach of contract by Stone. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-19\">In order to prevail in a hybrid claim under section 301 against both an employer and a union, an employee must prove both the union\u2019s breach of its duty of fair representation and the employer\u2019s breach of the collective bargaining agreement. <em>Scott v. United Auto., </em>242 F.3d 837, 840 (8th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Vaca v. Sipes, </em>386 U.S. 171, 186-87, 87 S.Ct. 903, 17 L.Ed.2d 842 (1967)). A court must find unfair representation by the union before considering the merits of a section 301 claim against an employer. <em>Buford v. Runyon, </em>160 F.3d 1199, 1201 (8th Cir.1998). A union breaches its duty of fair representation only when its conduct is arbitrary, discriminatory, or in bad faith. <em>Vaca, </em>386 U.S. at 190. To survive a motion for summary judgment on the issue of bad faith, an employee must demonstrate fraud, deceitful action, or dishonest conduct by the union. <em>Baxter v. United Paperworkers Int\u2019l Union, Local 7370, </em>140 F.3d 745, 747 (8th Cir.1998). Lockhart has simply not met this burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-20\">It may be that the Union could have performed a more rigorous and thorough investigation in this case, but we grant unions \u201cbroad latitude\u201d in dealing with their members and review their performance in \u201ca highly deferential light.\u201d <em>Pe-gump v. Rockwell Int\u2019l Corp., </em>109 F.3d 442, 444 (8th Cir.1997). The Union was certainly within that latitude in its disposi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>tion of this case. Because Lockhart cannot establish unfair representation by the Union, his claim against Stone for breach of contract must also fail. Accordingly, we affirm the grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-17\">. The Honorable William R.
