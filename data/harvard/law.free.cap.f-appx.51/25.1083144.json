M\u00edreles and Paul J. Roa appeal from a final order of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Preska, J.), which granted an application of the Independent Review Board (\u201cIRB\u201d) for entry of an order upholding charges and sanctions imposed against M\u00edreles and Roa, both members and former officers of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\u201cIBT\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The IRB found that M\u00edreles, the Secretary-Treasurer and principal officer of IBT Local 952 from 1989 until 1999, instituted a policy requiring IBT members who served as business agents of the local union to make dues payments on an untimely basis. Since a member who pays dues late is ineligible to run for a local office position, M\u00edreles thereby disabled his business agents from challenging him in a union election. The district court order upheld the IRB\u2019s findings that Roa enforced M\u00ed-reles\u2019 scheme, and that M\u00edreles lied under oath about his role in it and encouraged others to do the same. The court therefore affirmed the IRB\u2019s ruling barring M\u00edreles and Roa from holding any position as an IBT officers for seven and four years, respectively, and suspending M\u00edreles and Roa from IBT membership for four and two years, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">On appeal, appellants M\u00edreles and Roa argue that (1) the IRB lacked authority to sanction their alleged conduct, and (2) the IRB\u2019s finding that M\u00edreles and Roa brought reproach upon the IBT is not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We conclude that the IRB had authority to sanction M\u00edreles\u2019 and Roa\u2019s conduct. This proceeding arises under the Consent Decree that resolved claims brought by the United States against the IBT and other defendants under the civil remedies provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (\u201cRICO\u201d), 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. IBT (\u201c1991 Election Rules Order\u201d), </em>931 F.2d 177, 180-81 (2d Cir.1991). The Consent Decree implemented numerous measures \u201cpremised on the notion that [standards imposed by federal labor law] were not sufficient to rid the IBT of corruption and the influence of organized crime, or to bring democracy to the IBT.\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cCarey Disqualification\u201d), </em>988 F.Supp. 759, 768 (S.D.N.Y.1997), <em>affd, </em>156 F.3d 354 (2d Cir.1998). The purpose of the reforms was to achieve the goal \u201cthat the IBT ... be maintained democratically, with integrity and for the sole benefit of its members and without unlawful outside influence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-9\">The Consent Decree provided for the establishment of the IRB, \u201ca permanent institution vested with power to investigate and eradicate corruption, and to monitor (he IBT\u2019s attempts to eradicate corruption.\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cIRB Rules\u201d), </em>803 F.Supp. 761, 780 (S.D.N.Y.1992), af<em>fd as modified, </em>998 F.2d 1101 (2d Cir.1993). Pursuant to the Consent Decree, the IRB\u2019s authority is co-extensive with that of the IBT General President and General Secretary-Treasurer under the IBT Constitution. Since the IBT Constitution authorizes the IBT General President \u201cto interpret and apply\u201d the IBT Constitution and \u201cto decide all questions of law thereunder,\u201d <em>see </em>IBT Const. Art. VI, Sec. 2(a), the IRB\u2019s authority \u201cnecessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>includes the final authority to decide what constitutes an offense subject to discipline under the IBT Constitution.\u201d <em>Friedman &amp; Hughes, </em>905 F.2d at 619. Therefore, the scope of the IRB\u2019s power under the Consent Decree is not limited to violations of federal labor or criminal law. The Consent Decree recognizes that \u201cconduct which brings reproach upon the IBT,\u201d in violation of Article II, Section 2(a) and Article XIX, Sections 7(b)(1) and (2) of the IBT Constitution, is \u201cwithin the [IRB\u2019s] investigatory and decisional authority.\u201d <em>See United States v. IRB, (Rules), </em>803 F.Supp. 761, 802 (S.D.N.Y.1992) (stating and approving rules governing operation of IRB), <em>affd in relevant part, </em>998 F.2d 1101 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">The IRB therefore had authority to investigate and bring disciplinary charges when it learned of the scheme involving dues default, and suspected it brought reproach upon the IBT.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mireles and Roa contend that their conduct was not unsavory because it was not inconsistent with the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 401 <em>et seq. </em>(\u201cLMRDA\u201d), and therefore did not bring reproach upon the union, citing <em>Finnegan v. Leu, </em>456 U.S. 431, 102 S.Ct. 1867, 72 L.Ed.2d 239 (1982), and <em>Bloom v. Local 952, </em>783 F.2d 1356 (9th Cir.1986). In <em>Finnegan, </em>the Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether the discharge of a union\u2019s appointed business agents by the union president, following his election over the candidate supported by the business agents, violated the [LMRDA],\u201d 456 U.S. at 432, and ruled that because the LMRDA protects the rights of union members as members and not as union employees, the termination of business agents because of their support for a rival candidate did not violate the LMRDA so long as the business agents retained their membership rights. <em>Finnegan, </em>456 U.S. at 441. In <em>Bloom, </em>the Ninth Circuit (relying on <em>Finnegan) </em>held that a business agent of Local 952 who was discharged because he supported a rival candidate in the local union\u2019s election failed to state a claim for relief under the LMRDA. 783 F.2d at 1359 &amp; n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\"><em>Finnegan </em>and <em>Bloom </em>are distinguishable. The issue here is not whether the business agents have an actionable claim for impairment of their membership right to stand for election, but whether the conditioning of union employment on relinquishment of a membership right brought reproach upon the union. The <em>Finnegan </em>and <em>Bloom </em>courts held only that the business agents there had no cause of action under the LMRDA, because although they lost their positions as business agents, they retained their rights as members. Here, the business agents were deprived of their rights as members to run for election to union office. <em>See Carey Disqualification, </em>156 F.3d 354, 361 (2d Cir. 1998) (holding that act of making a person ineligible to seek union office \u201caffects him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>as a member\u201d under federal labor law). We think that the IRB\u2019s findings that M\u00ed-reles and Roa secretly affected the rights of members are sufficient to support its exercise of jurisdiction, which is not limited to violations of federal labor law but is instead, under the Consent Decree, coextensive with that of the IBT General President and General Secretary-Treasurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Further, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the IRB\u2019s findings that M\u00edreles and Roa brought reproach upon the IBT. Substantial evidence is something more than \u201ca mere scintilla\u201d but something less than \u201cthe weight of the evidence,\u201d <em>see United States v. IBT (\u201cSimpson\u201d), </em>120 F.3d 341, 346 (2d Cir.1997), and the \u201ctest is deferential,\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cGiacumbo\u201d), </em>170 F.3d 136, 143 (2d Cir.1999). \u201cSubstantial evidence includes such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cSimpson\u201d), </em>120 F.3d 341, 346 (2d Cir.1997) (internal quotation marks omitted). Inferences that the IRB draws from facts are \u201cdiscretionary and can only be disturbed if they are arbitrary and capricious.\u201d <em>Giacumbo, </em>170 F.3d at 143 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">At a hearing conducted by the IRB on April 17 and 18, 2000, the Chief Investigator called five witnesses, introduced into evidence transcripts of sworn testimony of twelve current and former members of Local 952, and submitted printouts from the IBT\u2019s computer system.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> M\u00edreles and Roa called six witnesses and testified in their own defense. Ten witnesses confirmed that M\u00edreles was involved in a scheme that required certain business agents who were not enrolled in an automated dues \u201ccheck-off\u2019 system to miss a monthly dues payment to ensure ineligibility. Computer records showed that all officers, business agents, and employees of the local paid their dues by \u201ccheck-off\u2019 before 1990, but that within three months after M\u00edreles assumed office, business agents paid dues by \u201cself-pay\u201d method, and (with one exception) \u201cno business agent on the self-pay system was eligible to run in the 1992, 1995, and 1998 Local 952 Local officer elections.\u201d In short, the scheme at issue secretly narrowed the field of possible officers, partially insulated an officeholder from challenge, and thereby impaired the system of open competitive election to union office. We think this is enough to bring reproach upon the union.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">M\u00edreles and Roa argue the credibility and proper weight of certain testimony; however, the members of the IRB are \u201cbest equipped to evaluate the demeanor, credibility and, ultimately, culpability of those who appear before them.\u201d <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cCarey &amp; Hamilton\u201d), </em>247 F.3d 370, 380 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation omitted). \u201cIn accordance with the great deference owed to the IRB\u2019s determinations, law in this circuit establishes that a court \u2018will not substitute its assessment of a witness\u2019s credibility for that of the IRB.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cSimpson\u201d), </em>931 F.Supp. 1074, 1096 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>(S.D.N.Y.1996), <em>affld, </em>120 F.3d 341 (2d Cir. 1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">For the reasons stated herein, M\u00edreles\u2019 and Roa\u2019s claims are hereby DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b62-7\">. The principal provisions of the Consent Decree have been summarized in numerous pri- or opinions of this Court. <em>See, e.g., 1991 Election Rules Order, </em>931 F.2d at 180-81; <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cFriedman &amp; Hughes\"), </em>905 F.2d 610, 613 (2d Cir.1990); <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cIRB Rules\"), </em>998 F.2d 1101, 1105-06 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b63-6\">. When the IRB, pursuant to its investigatory powers, first learned about M\u00fareles\u2019 and Roa's alleged improper conduct, it did not immediately bring disciplinary charges but conducted an evidentiary hearing and issued an investigative report recommending, <em>inter alia, </em>that the IBT bring charges against M\u00edreles and Roa. Two IBT panels heard evidence regarding the charges; the first rendered no decision, and the second found that the charges had been sustained against M\u00edreles but not against Roa. The IBT\u2019s General Executive Board (\"GEB\u201d) adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendations with respect to M\u00ed-reles, and the IBT's president adopted the findings and recommendations with regard to Roa. On appeal, the IRB declared the IBT's decisions regarding M\u00edreles and Roa to be inadequate, and, upon finding that the actions of the GEB and its president were inadequate, scheduled its own hearing on the charges. The hearing took place on April 17-18, 2000, and the IRB\u2019s decision, dated October 17, 2000, stemmed from the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b64-6\">. Mireles and Roa challenge the IRB's reliance on hearsay testimony of witnesses who were not subject to cross-examination. The IRB may rely on hearsay so long as it is \"reliable.\" <em>See United States v. IBT (\u201cBoggia\u201d), </em>167 F.3d 113, 118 (2d Cir.1999); <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cDiGirlamo\u201d), </em>19 F.3d 816, 823-24 (2d Cir.1994). Hearsay is \"reliable\u201d for the purposes of an IRB hearing if it is corroborated by other hearsay or non-hearsay evidence, includes specific detail, or is made under oath. <em>See DiGirlamo, </em>19 F.3d at 823; <em>United States v. IBT (\u201cCimino\u201d), </em>964 F.2d 1308, 1312-13 (2d Cir.1992). The sworn statements at issue are sufficiently reliable. They corroborated each other and were corroborated by the TITAN records.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
