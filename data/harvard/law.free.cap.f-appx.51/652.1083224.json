Rosales-Lira contends that he was persecuted by Guatemalan guerrillas on account of an imputed political opinion. The BIA concluded that the \u201cguerrillas\u2019 behavior appears to be motivated from their own desire to recruit rather than from any desire to persecute [Rosales-Lira] on account of his own or the other soccer players\u2019 political opinion.\u201d Based upon our review of the record, we conclude that substantial evidence supports the BIA\u2019s determination that Rosales-Lira did not meet his burden of establishing either that he suffered from past persecution on account of an imputed political opinion or that he has a well-founded fear of future persecution. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992). Because Rosales-Lira failed to establish his statutory eligibility for asylum, he also necessarily failed to satisfy the higher standard for withholding of deportation. <em>Pedro-Mateo v.
