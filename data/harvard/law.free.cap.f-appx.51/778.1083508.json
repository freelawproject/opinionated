Pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), Vasquez-Pulido\u2019s counsel has filed a brief stating that he finds no meritorious issues for review, along with a motion to withdraw as counsel of record. No pro se supplemental brief or answering brief has been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">Counsel has identified several potential appellate issues, none of which we find availing in light of the appeal waiver in Vasquez-Pulido\u2019s plea agreement. Our examination of the briefs and our independent review of the record pursuant to <em>Penson v. Ohio, </em>488 U.S. 75, 83-84, 109 S.Ct. 346, 102 L.Ed.2d 300 (1988), indicates that Vasquez-Pulido knowingly and voluntarily waived his statutory right to appeal, and was sentenced within the terms of the plea agreement. Accordingly, we enforce the waiver and dismiss the appeal. <em>See United States v. Nguyen, </em>235 F.3d 1179, 1183 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">Counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b815-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
