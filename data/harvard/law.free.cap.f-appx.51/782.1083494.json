We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253(a). Reviewing de novo, <em>see Bowen v. Hood, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>202 F.3d 1211, 1218 (9th Cir.2000), <em>cert, denied, </em>531 U.S. 1111, 121 S.Ct. 854, 148 L.Ed.2d 769 (2001), we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-5\">Krause contends that his federal sentence should have run concurrently with his state sentence. However, because the district court made no indication to the contrary, Krause\u2019s federal sentence properly ran consecutively to his prior state sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584(a); <em>United States v. Chea, </em>231 F.3d 531, 535 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]n the absence of an order to the contrary, a federal sentence is to run consecutively to a prior state sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Krause next argues that when federal authorities released him back to state authorities after a brief transfer, the federal authorities relinquished the right to have him serve his federal sentence. This contention is unpersuasive. Because Krause\u2019s transfer was pursuant to state prison authorities\u2019 belief, albeit possibly erroneous, that Krause was required to attend court proceedings in federal court, the transfer lacked the unconditional quality necessary to end the State\u2019s primary jurisdiction. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(a); <em>Taylor v. Reno, </em>164 F.3d 440, 445 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Thomas v. Brewer, </em>923 F.2d 1361, 1367 (9th Cir.1991) (stating that when a prisoner is surrendered to federal authorities on a federal writ rather than to begin serving his federal sentence, federal custody does not begin). Accordingly, the State\u2019s primary jurisdiction continued throughout the period in question, and Krause\u2019s federal sentence did not then commence.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">Finally, because Krause received credit against his state sentence for the time he was temporarily transferred to the care of federal authorities and for the subsequent six months he served back in state prison, he is not entitled to credit against his federal sentence for those periods. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3585(b); <em>United States v. Von-Willie, </em>59 F.3d 922, 930-31 (9th Cir.1995) (holding that time spent on a federal writ need not be credited against a federal sentence if it has been credited to a state sentence and the federal sentence is to run consecutively to the state sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b819-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b818-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as may be provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
