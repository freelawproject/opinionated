We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-12\">As the parties are familiar with the facts, we recite them only as necessary. We review the denial of Moreno\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion <em>de novo. See United States v. Day, </em>285 F.3d 1167, 1169 (9th Cir.2002). We accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact, and its adoption of the magistrate judge\u2019s findings of fact, unless clearly erroneous. Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a); <em>Sanders v. Ratelle, </em>21 F.3d 1446, 1452 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-15\">Moreno contends that trial counsel Clay Hernandez ineffectively represented him (1) by failing to investigate Jesus Castelo as a potential witness, (2) by failing to stipulate to Moreno\u2019s underlying conviction, and (3) by continuing the trial. Moreno\u2019s claims fail if he cannot prove that these allegedly deficient acts prejudiced his defense. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). To demonstrate prejudice, Moreno \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for [Hernandez\u2019s] unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-16\">Moreno does not show that he was prejudiced by Hernandez\u2019s failure to investigate Castelo. Castelo\u2019s affidavit does not provide testimony that would exonerate Moreno. First, it is uncertain whether Hernandez could have even located Castelo. We accept the district court's finding that Castelo did not return to the United States after being deported to Mexico immediately after his arrest, as it leaves no \u201cdefinite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S.Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948). Moreno provides no evidence indicating that he or Hernandez had an address for Castelo in Mexico in 1994, or otherwise would have been able to locate Castelo.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-17\">Even if Castelo could have been located, Moreno does not show that Castelo would have testified at Moreno\u2019s trial to having possessed the gun. <em>Cf., e.g., Luna v. </em>Cam-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number><em>bra, </em>306 F.3d 954, 963 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Avila v. Galaza, </em>297 F.3d 911, 923 (9th Cir. 2002). In fact, Castelo had a strong incentive not to offer such testimony, as doing so could have constituted an admission to a federal crime for weapons possession. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(5)(A) &amp; 924(a)(2). There is also no evidence that Castelo would have admitted to possessing the gun via foreign deposition. For example, there is no evidence that Castelo admitted to anyone before trial to having possessed the gun. <em>Cf. Avila, </em>297 F.3d at 915; <em>Sanders, </em>21 F.3d at 1450. Even if Castelo had agreed to be deposed, it is not clear that the district court would have found that \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d justified a deposition. Fed.R.Crim.P. 15(a). In sum, Moreno\u2019s speculative arguments do not \u201caffirmatively prove prejudice\u201d from Hernandez\u2019s failure to investigate Castelo. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-4\">Similarly, Moreno fails to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by Hernandez\u2019s failure to stipulate to Moreno\u2019s underlying conviction. At the time of trial, the law in the Ninth Circuit was that a defendant\u2019s offer to stipulate to an underlying offense did not preclude the government from introducing evidence about that offense. <em>See United States v. Breitkreutz, </em>8 F.3d 688, 690 (9th Cir.1993), <em>overruled by Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997). Moreno provides no evidence that, even if Hernandez had agreed to stipulate to the underlying conviction, the government would not have rejected the offer and would not have introduced the particulars of the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">Finally, Moreno fails to show that he was prejudiced by Hernandez\u2019s decision to continue the trial. Moreno presents no evidence that, if the trial date had remained firm, the government would not have filed the sentence-enhancing information earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Because Moreno fails to show that he was prejudiced by any of Hernandez\u2019s allegedly deficient acts, his habeas petition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b285-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
