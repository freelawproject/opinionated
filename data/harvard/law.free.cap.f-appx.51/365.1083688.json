He pled guilty to armed bank robbery and brandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence. Pizarro faced a minimum sentence of 32 years, but the government filed a motion for a downward departure based on Pizarro\u2019s cooperation with authorities leading to the identification, apprehension, and conviction of co-defendant Rindy Lee Martin. The district court granted the motion for downward departure. Pizarro now argues that the district court did not give proper consideration to the five enumerated factors in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K1.1 as it should have done under our recent decision in <em>United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number><em>States v. Torres, </em>251 F.3d 138 (3d Cir.), cert, denied, \u2014 U.S.-, 122 S.Ct. 307, 151 L.Ed.2d 228 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise plenary review over mistake of law or incorrect application of sentencing guidelines. <em>United States v. Spiropou-los, </em>976 F.2d 155 160 n. 2 (3d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-7\">The five factors set out in \u00a7 5K1.1 for the court to consider in determining the extent of a departure are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-8\">(1) the court\u2019s evaluation of the significance and usefulness of the defendant\u2019s assistance, taking into consideration the government\u2019s evaluation of the assistance rendered;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-9\">(2) the truthfulness, completeness, and reliability of any information or testimony provided by the defendant;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-10\">(3) the nature and extent of the defendant\u2019s assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-11\">(4) any injury suffered, or any danger or risk of injury to the defendant or his family resulting from his assistance;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b402-12\">(5) the timeliness of the defendant\u2019s assistance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b402-13\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Kl.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-14\">In <em>Torres, </em>we held that, \u201ca sentencing court <em>would be best served </em>by carefully reciting on the record the factors it evaluated in arriving at its \u00a7 5K1.1 departure decision, and the manner in which it weighed those factors.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 149 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-15\">We find that, although the District Court did not specifically recite the five factors, it gave sufficient consideration to them. This consideration is evident from the information presented to the court by both parties at the sentencing hearing and the court\u2019s response that it gave \u201ca great deal of thought to everything that has been said, everything that has been written.\u201d Moreover, the court noted that it had compared Pizarro\u2019s cooperation with the seriousness of the offenses and his demeanor and remorse in court. We conclude that the District Court did give sufficient consideration to the \u00a7 5K1.1 factors in determining the downward departure and in commenting on its reasons for doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-17\">For the foregoing reasons, we will affirm the judgment of sentence of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
