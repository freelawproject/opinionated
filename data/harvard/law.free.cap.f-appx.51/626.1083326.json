Schwarzer, Senior United States District Judge for the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b663-15\">MEMORANDUM<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b663-16\">Appellee Princess Cruises, Inc. (\u201cPrincess\u201d) filed this action against the Appellant, Amrigon Enterprises, Inc. (\u201cAmrigon\u201d), a corporation that provides direct marketing and telemarketing services. Amrigon refused to transfer Princess\u2019 passenger information when Princess replaced Amrigon with Verity, another database service provider. Amri-gon challenges the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Princess on Amrigon\u2019s counterclaims for copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, breach of confidentiality, and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-17\">In order to establish copyright infringement, Amrigon must prove \u201ccopying of constituent elements of the work that are original.\u201d <em>Feist Publications v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., </em>499 U.S. 340, 361, 111 S.Ct. 1282, 113 L.Ed.2d 358 (1991) (citation omitted). In support of its motion for summary judgment, Princess presented evidence showing that the Verity database did not contain any protectable features from the Amrigon database. In contrast, Amrigon has not pointed to any evidence raising a material issue of fact as to an \u201coriginal\u201d element.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-18\">Amrigon also contends that the district court erred in considering a Special Master\u2019s report. Since the Special Master\u2019s findings were not effectively challenged, they were properly viewed as unrebutted expert testimony. The district court properly found that Amrigon\u2019s copyright claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>were inadequately supported and thus could not survive a motion for summary judgment. <em>See Far Out Prods., Inc. v. Oskar, </em>247 F.3d 986, 992 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-4\">Amrigon similarly challenges the district court\u2019s order granting Princess\u2019 motion for summary judgment on Amrigon\u2019s misappropriation of trade secrets counterclaim. Again, Amrigon failed to provide specific evidence that its alleged trade secrets were not common or obvious concepts in the database industry. <em>See Imax Corp. v. Cinema Technologies, Inc., </em>152 F.3d 1161, 1164-65 (9th Cir.1998). Amrigon\u2019s generalizations concerning its database components are insufficient to establish the necessary distinctions between its work and general knowledge in the trade. Amrigon\u2019s failure to properly specify its asserted trade secrets rendered summary judgment on its counterclaim appropriate. <em>See Oskar, </em>247 F.3d at 992.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">Amrigon asserts additional error in the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on its breach of confidentiality counterclaims. Amrigon postulates that the district court failed to properly review the confidentiality of its proprietary information. However, Amrigon\u2019s citation to 1463 pages of the record is insufficient to establish a \u201cquestion of fact\u201d necessary to preclude a grant of summary judgment on this issue. Amrigon\u2019s unsupported contentions therefore justify a grant of summary judgment. <em>See Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, </em>212 F.3d 528, 531 (9th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Amrigon finally asserts that the district court should be reversed for failing to consider \u201ctwo additional contract terms.\u201d However, the district court noted that Am-rigon never placed these contractual terms at issue during any of the earlier proceedings. Contrary to Amrigon\u2019s assertions at oral argument, these claims were not included in the Pretrial Order governing trial of the contract claims. The district court therefore properly declined to entertain these untimely post-verdict claims. <em>See Ayuyu v. Tagabuel, </em>284 F.3d 1023, 1026 (9th Cir.2002) (requiring objection to the verdict form before the jury retires to deliberate).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-8\">The district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-9\">Costs on appeal are awarded to Princess Cruises pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 39(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b663-19\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
