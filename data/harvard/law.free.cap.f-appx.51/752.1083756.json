The district court dismissed the petition as untimely under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d). We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. We review de novo, <em>Miles v. Prunty, </em>187 F.3d 1104, 1105 (9th Cir.1999), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">Sutton\u2019s conviction became final on August 23, 1993, so his federal habeas petition filed on November 6, 2000 is untimely absent tolling of the one-year AEDPA statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">Sutton first contends that he is entitled to equitable tolling because the prison law library was inadequate. Specifically, he claims that no posted notice of AEDPA rules and the lack of a hired paralegal constitute extraordinary circumstances. His claim is unpersuasive. There is no precedent for his claim that notice of AEDPA requirements must be posted in the prison law library. In addition, states are not required to hire paralegals to assist prisoners. <em>See Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 356, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996) (concluding that a state need not provide legal assistants and law clerks to prisoners to ensure meaningful access to courts).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">Sutton next contends that he did not receive his trial transcripts until after his lawyer filed his state petition for post-conviction relief. He fails, however, to show how the lack of transcripts prevented the timely filing of his federal petition. <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107 (stating that equitable tolling only appropriate when external forces, rather than lack of diligence, account for failure to file a timely claim).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-12\">Sutton also contends that the limitations period should run from the date of his \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d that another prisoner with a similar name mistakenly attended certain of Sutton\u2019s pre-trial appearances. However, Sutton admits that he was aware of these facts as early as 1991, so he does not satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-13\">As Sutton fails to allege facts to demonstrate that extraordinary circumstances beyond his control prevented him from timely filing his petition, the district court properly dismissed his petition as time-barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Miles, </em>187 F.3d at 1107; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b789-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b789-10\">. We decline to address Sutton's claims that fall outside the scope of the certificate of appealability issued on April 17, 2002, <em>see Hiivala v. Wood, </em>195 F.3d 1098, 1103 (9th Cir.1999) (per curiam). We also do not consider claims raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Cacoperdo v. Demosthenes, </em>37 F.3d 504, 507 (9th Cir.1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
