For the reasons that follow, we affirm the decision of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-15\">ON CONSIDERATION WHEREOF, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED, AND DECREED that the judgment of the District Court be and it hereby is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b387-17\">Fortunato was charged, pursuant to a second superceding indictment dated August 9, 2002, with murder in the aid of conspiracy, RICO conspiracy, and conspiracy to obstruct justice, all in connection with the murder of Sabatino Lombardi and attempted murder of Michael Durso in a Brooklyn social club. After a hearing before Magistrate Judge Poliak on August 9, 2002, his bail was continued with new restrictions. The government subsequently moved to have his bail revoked, and Judge Glasser held a hearing on October 3, 2002. At the conclusion of that hearing, the district court found that the government\u2019s proffer had established that Fortunato had violated the conditions of his release, and that no combination of conditions would ensure his appearance, and granted the government\u2019s motion. Fortunato now argues that the district court erred in its reading of the evidence presented at the hearing, and that the factual error infected the legal conclusion the court reached. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b387-20\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s determination of historical facts for clear error. <em>See United States v. LaFontaine, </em>210 F.3d 125 (2d Cir.2000). Because the ultimate determination of whether any conditions will assure defendant\u2019s appearance is a mixed question of law and fact, <em>see United States v. Ferranti, </em>66 F.3d 540, 542 (2d Cir.1995), this Court will set aside a finding if it is based on a mistake of law, <em>see United States v. Shakur, </em>817 F.2d 189, 197 (2d Cir.1987), <em>cert, denied, </em>484 U.S. 840, 108 S.Ct. 128, 98 L.Ed.2d 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-21\">A district court may revoke bail if, after a hearing, it finds that there is \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d that the defendant \u201chas violated any ... condition of release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3148(b)(1)(B), and if it finds that the defendant \u201cis unlikely to abide by any condition or combination of conditions of release.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3148(b)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-22\">The government proffered extensive evidence of Fortunato\u2019s repeated violations of the terms of his release.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The transcript <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>clearly reflects that the district court considered Fortunato\u2019s arguments about his motives and rejected them. (\u201cIn any event, the evidence is just clear and convincing that he has not abided by the conditions of release and pursuant to 3148(b) I\u2019m revoking his bail and in accordance with 3148(b)(2) it would appear to me quite clearly that he\u2019s unlikely to abide by any conditions or combination of conditions.\u201d). The district court found that For-tunato\u2019s actions violated the terms of his release. Under the standard of review that we are bound to follow, we cannot conclude that the district court\u2019s factual findings were erroneous, much less clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b387-18\">. It is well-settled law that the government may proceed by proffer at a bail or bail revo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>cation hearing.
