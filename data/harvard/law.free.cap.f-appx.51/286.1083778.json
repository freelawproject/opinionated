Easter asks that we order the district court to direct defendants \u201cto provide a medical means of receiving treatment without being sanction[ed] and punished for taking ... prescribed medications\u201d and to arrange that his medications be tested to determine their effect on any urinalyses and blood tests that might be performed. (Appellant\u2019s Mot. at 1.) We affirm the decision of the district court and deny the motion for a preliminary injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-17\">Easter is an inmate in the Oklahoma prison system serving a life sentence. He tested positive for the presence of cannabi-noid (THC) by means of a urinalysis. A second confirming urinalysis yielded the same result. Easter requested a blood test to confirm the urinalysis results because he maintained that his prescribed asthma medications had caused the positive results. Prison staff determined that his asthma medications could not cause a false positive result and refused to conduct the blood test. Following a prison disci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>plinary proceeding, Easter was found guilty of possession of THC.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">Easter then commenced this action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. He alleged he was denied due process in the procedures employed in the disciplinary hearing and in the THC testing. He also alleged he was subjected to an Eighth Amendment violation because the prison medical unit was deliberately indifferent to his medical needs by forcing him to choose between taking his prescribed asthma medications and being unable to pass a THC urinalysis test or not taking the medications in order to pass the test.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The district court determined that Easter could not obtain relief for his claims of violations of prison regulations and state statutes, citing <em>Jones v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>854 F.2d 1206, 1209 (10th Cir.1988); that his claim for money damages based on his allegation that prison disciplinary procedures were constitutionally defective was barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994); that his claim that his property was improperly seized did not rise to the level of a constitutional deprivation and, further, that adequate state remedies existed under Oklahoma law. Lastly, the district court held that Easter had failed to state a viable Eighth Amendment claim. The court ordered that defendants give Easter a copy of the determination that his asthma medication could not have caused a false positive test for THC.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">On appeal, Easter argues that the district court denied him the right to be heard, to present evidence, and to amend his complaint. He further contends the district court could not dismiss his action under \u00a7 1915A prior to service of process on defendants and submission of a report pursuant to <em>Martinez v. Aaron, </em>570 F.2d 317 (10th Cir.1978). As to the merits of his complaint, Easter maintains his claims are not barred by <em>Heck, </em>defendants violated his due process rights in the disciplinary proceedings because he did not receive sufficient prior notice of the hearing to prepare his evidence, and defendants denied him due process by not following the manufacturer\u2019s specification that when a urinalysis is positive for THC, a blood test must be performed to confirm this. He also contends his Eighth Amendment rights were violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">We have \u201cnot yet determined whether a dismissal pursuant to \u00a7 1915A on the ground that the complaint is legally frivolous is reviewed <em>de novo </em>or for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Plunk v. Givens, </em>234 F.3d 1128, 1130 (10th Cir.2000). As in <em>Plunk, </em>however, we \u201cneed not resolve that question at this juncture\u201d based on our review of the entire record in this case, including the district court\u2019s order and the magistrate judge\u2019s thorough report and recommendation, \u201cwhich reveals no hint of reversible error under either standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Contrary to Easter\u2019s contentions, defendants were served with his complaint. The district court originally construed the complaint as alleging claims properly brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 and ordered defendants to respond to the complaint accordingly. Easter objected to the \u00a7 2241 characterization and the district court accepted his contention that he was bringing a \u00a7 1983 action. Defendants did not submit a new response addressing Easter\u2019s complaint as a \u00a7 1983 action. However, because the district court dismissed the complaint as frivolous under \u00a7 1915A, there was no need for a response by defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Easter also states he should have been granted permission to amend his complaint. His proposed amendment does not salvage this action. Even without the two claims he is willing to abandon, the strictures of \u00a7 1915A still apply. \u201c[S]ua sponte dismissal of a meritless complaint that cannot be salvaged by amendment comports <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>with due process and does not infringe the right of access to the courts.\u201d <em>Curley v. Perry, </em>246 F.3d 1278, 1284 (10th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 122 S.Ct. 274, 151 L.Ed.2d 201 (2001). Further, a due process violation did not occur because Mr. Easter had \u201ca reasonable post-judgment opportunity to present his arguments to the district court and the appellate court, including the opportunity to suggest amendments that would cure the complaint\u2019s deficiencies.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Easter maintains his claims are not barred by <em>Heck </em>and defendant violated his due process rights in the disciplinary proceedings because he did not receive sufficient prior notice of the hearing. In <em>Heck, </em>the Supreme Court held that before a \u00a7 1983 plaintiff can recover damages for an allegedly unconstitutional conviction, or for other harms caused by unlawful actions which would render a conviction or sentence invalid, the plaintiff must prove that the conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid by a state tribunal authorized to make such determination, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. 512 U.S. at 486-87. The Court applied the rationale of <em>Heck </em>to prison disciplinary proceedings in <em>Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 646-47, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">Although Easter claims that he is not seeking revocation of the punishment imposed by the prison disciplinary board, were we to find that his claims had merit, the correctness of that punishment would necessarily be implicated. Therefore, <em>Heck </em>applies. <em>See id. </em>at 645 (even if prisoner limits \u201chis request to damages for depriving him of good-time credits <em>without due process, </em>not for depriving him of good-time credits <em>undeservedly </em>as a substantive matter,\u201d his request still \u201cnecessarily ... implies] the invalidity of the judgment.\u201d). Therefore, as Easter\u2019s claims \u201cnecessarily imply the invalidity of the punishment imposed, [they are] not cognizable under \u00a7 1983.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Easter next argues defendants did not follow the manufacturer\u2019s specification that when a urinalysis is positive for THC, a blood test must be performed to confirm its reliability. Due process requires that \u201csome evidence\u201d support a prison disciplinary decision. <em>See Superintendent, Mass. Corr. Inst., Walpole v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 455-56, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985) (stating that \u201cthe relevant question is whether there is any evidence in the record that could support the conclusion reached by the disciplinary board.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-11\">A <em>single </em>urinalysis amounts to \u201csome evidence\u201d and thus satisfies due process. <em>See Allen v. Purkett, </em>5 F.3d 1151, 1153 (8th Cir.1993) (due process does not require prison officials <em>to </em>provide second urinalysis by impartial laboratory). Prison officials need not grant an inmate\u2019s request for an additional drug test to satisfy due process. <em>See Koenig v. Vannelli, </em>971 F.2d 422, 423 (9th Cir.1992). \u201cThough the risk of false positives has not been entirely eliminated, we agree ... that use of the test results may be relied upon as sufficient evidence to warrant prison discipline under the standards of <em>Superintendent v. Hill, </em>472 U.S. 445, 454-55, 105 S.Ct. 2768, 86 L.Ed.2d 356 (1985)....\u201d <em>Peranzo v. Coughlin, </em>850 F.2d 125, 126 (2d Cir.1988); <em>see also Koenig, </em>971 F.2d at 422 n. 1 (noting that ADx tests for cannabinoids, when properly performed, are generally accurate).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-12\">Finally, Easter argues his Eighth Amendment rights have been violated because he must choose between taking his asthma medication and failing the urinalysis or not taking it and passing the drug tests.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-13\">A prison official\u2019s failure to prevent harm violates the Eighth Amendment only when two requirements are met. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>First, the prison official\u2019s act or omission must be objectively, sufficiently serious and result in the denial of the minimal civilized measure of life\u2019s necessities. [T]he inmate must show that he is incarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm. Second, the prison official must have a sufficiently culpable state of mind, in this case deliberate indifference to inmate health or safety. Deliberate indifference requires actual knowledge of the risk to inmate safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Curley, </em>246 F.3d at 1282 (quotations and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Easter has failed to make any showing that prison officials have been deliberately indifferent to his health. No Eighth Amendment violation occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. Plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b323-12\"> The case is unanimously ordered submitted without oral argument pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. The court generally disfavors the citation of orders and judgments; nevertheless, an order and judgment may be cited under the terms and conditions of 10th Cir. R. 36.3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-18\">. Section 1915A provides that, \u201cas soon as practicable,\u201d the district court shall review a civil complaint filed by a prisoner and shall dismiss it if the complaint \"is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d In addition to dismissing Easter\u2019s complaint, the court also determined that the complaint would count as one strike under the provisions of \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
