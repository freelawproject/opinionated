Before a defendant may present a necessity defense, his proffered evidence must establish that a reasonable jury could conclude: \u201c(1) that he was faced with a choice of evils and chose the lesser evil; (2) that he acted to prevent imminent harm; (3) that he reasonably anticipated a causal relation between his conduct and the harm to be avoided; and (4) that there were no other legal alternatives to violating the law.\u201d <em>United States v. Aguilar, </em>883 F.2d 662, 693 (9th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-6\">Campos-Saucedo has not demonstrated that his children or his family faced any imminent harm. Nor has he established that there were no other legal alternatives to violating the law. Campos-Saucedo could have petitioned the Attorney General for readmission, <em>see United States v. Arellano-Rivera, </em>244 F.3d 1119, 1126 (9th Cir.2001), or his wife and children could have gone to Mexico to visit or live. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b765-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
