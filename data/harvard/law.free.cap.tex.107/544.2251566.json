The judgment was affirmed on defendant\u2019s appeal and thereupon it applied for writ of error, the opinion following being delivered in refusing the writ.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b567-5\"><em>Terry, Cavin &amp; Mills, </em>and <em>A.

W., 385.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">Conceding that the trains in question were interstate trains, it was found by the trial court, with the finding approved by the Court of Civil Appeals, that, independent of these trains, the railway facilities provided by the company for the service of the citizens of Meridian were not adequate. We are unable to say as a matter of law that that conclusion was unwarranted. The case therefore falls within the established holding that the State may require the stoppage of interstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>trains at a particular locality within its limits'where the*carrier has not otherwise provided proper and sufficient railway facilities for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-3\">The writ of error is refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\">\n<em>Writ of error refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
