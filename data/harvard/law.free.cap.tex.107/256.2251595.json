We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>therefore make the following brief statement of what we understand to be substantially the facts proved by plaintiff below. Diamond and Duncan were old friends and had been closely associated for many years. Diamond was in the brokerage business in connection with other business transactions, and for a number of years had superintended the procuring of insurance for Duncan on his property, taking charge of that business entirely and placing the insurance wherever he saw fit to do so, and secured for Duncan two policies of insurance in the Traders Insurance Company, one for the sum of $1500 on Duncan\u2019s residence, and on the l-6th of October, 1904, he obtained for Duncan a policy of insurance for $300 on the same property. Both of the policies were to run for three years from date thereof, and both expired before the fire occurred. Before the expiration of the time for which the insurance was issued, the Traders Insurance Company became wholly insolvent, which fact was unknown to Duncan, but was known to Diamond, who failed and neglected to apprise Duncan of the insolvency, or to obtain any substitute insurance for him. The result was the loss by a subsequent fire of the property which had been insured. The evidence justifies the conclusion that Diamond undertook, as insurance broker, to keep the property of Duncan insured without any action oh the part of Duncan, and that Duncan, relying on that undertaking and agreement paid no attention to the issuance of the policies or when they expired or anything connected with them. After the policies had expired, something like a year\u2019s time, the houses upon which the two policies were issued, burned and no other insurance had been procured by Diamond for the protection of Duncan. Duncan had inquired about his insurance prior to the fire and was assured that the policies were in effect and all right. Duncan had no notice of the failure of the company, and did not know that the policies were worthless or had expired until after the houses burned, and he went to Diamond for the purpose of making proof and instituting proceedings for the collection of his claim. It was then that he heard for the first time that the company in which he was insured was insolvent and the policies had expired. Evidence on the part of Diamond controverts these facts and disputes the truth of almost everything proven on the' part of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">The facts were submitted to the jury, and the jury found in favor of Duncan. Therefore, we must act upon this case on the assumption that the facts were as Duncan claimed and as the jury found, and must apply the law to them as if there were no controversy, because the questions of fact being settled, this court can not affect the credibility of the witnesses or anything of that character.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">We restate the proposition which is before us and which contains the only issue that is presented to us in this case, thus: Diamond, an insurance broker, undertook to keep the property of Duncan insured, and having it insured in a company that failed, and of which failure he had knowledge, did not give notice to Duncan of such failure or take steps to procure substitute insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>The evidence upon the issue of Diamond\u2019s undertaking to keep Duncan\u2019s property insured is conflicting, but plaintiff\u2019s evidence is sufficient to sustain the finding in his favor. We have no authority to enquire into the propriety of the verdict or the correctness of the conclusions of fact. Therefore, we will dispose of the case upon the finding that the plaintiff in error was an insurance broker, and had for years procured insurance for defendant in error on his property and undertook to procure and furnish fire insurance on Duncan\u2019s property, which he had done many years. Duncan had the right to rely upon Diamond\u2019s performance of the agreement, and having failed, and the property being destroyed by fire with no insurance, Diamond is liable for the loss. Mechem on Agency, sec. 476; Kaw Brick Co. v. Hogsett &amp; Woodward, 73 Mo. App., 432; Thorne v. Deas, 4 Johnson, N. Y., 84; Backus v. Ames, 79 Minn., 145, 81 N. W., 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">We find on our application docket an entry to the effect that Diamond was not liable for the $200. We have examined the matter carefully, and find no ground for difference in liability for the $1500 and his liability for the $200. The duty to reinsure each was the same, and upon failure, the liability must be the same. In fact, the failure, of the insurance company is of no importance in this case, for if it had continued to be solvent and the policies had expired, the failure to reinsure would have imposed the same liability upon Diamond as attaches under the facts before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">If Diamond had pleaded his right to a credit for the amount that it would have cost Duncan to reinsure the property, he might have been entitled to have that sum deducted, but the question is not before us properly. It was not presented in the trial court; in fact, it appears first in the application for writ of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">We find nothing to justify this court in reversing the judgment of the District Court. It is ordered that the judgments of the District Court and the Court of Civil Appeals be and they are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"rehearing\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\">OH MOTIOH FOE EEHEABIHG.</p>\n<author id=\"b282-9\">Mr. Chief Justice PHILLIPS</author>\n<p id=\"Azb\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-10\">It was erroneously stated in the opinion of the late Chief Justice rendered upon the original hearing of the case, that the smaller of the two policies of insurance involved,\u2014the one for $200, had expired before the fire occurred. This policy did not expire, according to its terms, until about three months after the destruction of the property by fire. Hnder the findings of the jury, however, -this circumstance does not in our opinion relieve the plaintiff in error of liability for the loss sustained by Duncan because of the worthlessness of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-11\">We should possibly advert to one other matter. It is again urged by the plaintiff in error in his motion that the judgment in Duncan\u2019s favor for the loss sustained by him on account of Diamond\u2019s failure to comply with his agreement to renew the former\u2019s policies, as found by the jury, ought now to be reversed because of the charge on the measure of dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>ages, and the refusal of his requested instruction for a peremptory verdict. The contention is that the charge did not require that the jury in assessing the damages should deduct from the amount of the policies the amount of the premiums thereon, or the cost of the insurance if Diamond had performed his agreement. It appears that Duncan had not paid the amount of the premiums; and we agree that his measure of damages Avas the amount of the policies, less the premiums or cost of the insurance. We accordingly held on the original hearing that Diamond would have been entitled to such credit in the assessment of the damages, if it had been pleaded by him; but inasmuch as he did not plead it, nor prove it, he was in no position to complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">We are still inclined to the view that this was defensive matter and ought to have been pleaded. Right-of-Way Oil Co. v. Gladys City Oil, etc., Co., 106 Texas, 94, 157 S. W., 737, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.), 268. It should not be overlooked that the policies were in fact issued by Diamond as the insurance agent, and the cause of action arose upon his agreement, substantially, to maintain the insurance on the property in that amount, the worthlessness of the policies within his knowledge, and his failure to notify Duncan that they had become worthless. If Duncan had not paid for them, Diamond was, of course, entitled to offset the amount of the premiums; but we think it was incumbent upon him to make the plea. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">If the proof was admissible in mitigation of the damages on the general issue, without the necessity of a pleading, it is clear that the burden was upon Diamond to make it. He was an insurance agent. Duncan was not. The cost of the insurance or the amount of the premiums was a fact peculiarly within his knowledge. Certainly he was in better position to know what the amount was than Duncan. It is elementary law that the burden of proof is on him who best knows the facts, or in whose knowledge the fact peculiarly lies. I Greenleaf on Evidence, sec. 79; Byan v. Railway Co., 65 Texas, 13, 57 Am. Bep., 589. In his brief in the Court of Civil Appeals Diamond contended that there was no sufficient proof to sIioav what the amount of the premiums was, and that therefore the alleged error could not be cured by remittitur. Since the burden was upon him to make the proof, and, according to his contention,-there was no proof on the question, the charge of the court was not erroneous in failing to submit it. The requested instruction for a peremptory verdict proceeded upon the theory that Duncan had failed to make out his case in having omitted to make this proof; and for the same reason the trial court correctly refused it.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">This case Avas tried in January, 1910. The judgment in Duncan\u2019s favor was affirmed in the Court of Civil Appeals on June 3, 1911. A writ of error was granted by this court October 5, 1911. The case was decided here, affirming both judgments, January 27, 1915. At best, the amount of the premiums was trivial in comparison with the amount properly in controversy. We overrule the contention of the plaintiff in error on the question for the reasons Ave have stated. But if the question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>were not subject to be thus disposed of upon a ground that is clear and satisfactory,, it would in our opinion amount almost to- a travesty to now reverse these judgments and order a .new trial on account of a small error in the amount of the verdict. j</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">With the correction noted in the original opinion the motion for re- j hearing is overruled. . j</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<p id=\"b284-5\">DISSENTING OPINION ON MOTION EOR REHEARING.</p>\n<author id=\"b284-6\">Mr. Justice HAWKIHS</author>\n<p id=\"AA9\">delivered the following dissenting opinion:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">Plaintiff in error complains that the charge to the jury assumed, <em>as a matter of law, </em>that Diamond was under the affirmative duty of notifying Duncan of the insolvency of Traders Insurance Co., or of procuring for Duncan new and solvent insurance. I find no merit in that contention, inasmuch as \u201crenew\u201d in the charge was apparently used by the trial court and understood by the jury as including <em>keeping up the insurance, </em>in a solvent company. And it seems to have been so treated by the Court of Civil Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">However, the charge of the court on the measure of damages was clearly erroneous in permitting recovery of the full amount of insurance which, under the jury\u2019s finding, Diamond should have had kept in force for Duncan. From that sum should have been deducted the amount of the premiums which such substitute insurance would have cost Duncan. His recoverable. damages, if any, should be <em>merely compensatory.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b284-10\">The amount of such premiums was not established by the evidence; consequently, the amount which Duncan was entitled to recover was not established; wherefore plaintiff failed to make out his case. Logically, then, defendant\u2019s requested special charge Ho. 1, directing a verdict for defendant, should have been given. This point was duly presented in the motion for new trial, and in the assignments of error filed in the trial court, and in appellant\u2019s' brief in the Court of Civil Appeals, at p. 54, et seq., under \u201cSecond Assignment of Error\u201d (Ho. 5; in Tr.), and four distinct propositions thereunder, and was also duly presented to this court. The establishment of the proper measure of damages being an essential and affirmative part of Duncan\u2019s case, there rested upon Diamond no duty of pleading or proving what the cost of the premium for such substitute insurance would have been. I do not consider the cost thereof a matter so peculiarly within the knowledge of Diamond as to constitute an exception to the general rule, nor as bringing this case within the rule which this court announced in Right-of-Way Oil Co. v. Gladys City Oil, Gas &amp; Mf\u2019g Co., <em>106 Texas, </em>94, 157 S. W., 736, 51 L. R. A. (N. S.), 268, in which this court said:</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">\u201cIf, however, the person who produced the oil acted in good faith, he would be entitled to have deducted the cost of bringing it to the surface and to the market. The contention of plaintiff in error is in effect that the owner must concede the good faith of the trespasser and prove that which is <em>known only </em>to his adversary, the cost of producing the oil.\u201d (Italics mine.)</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Emphasis was there laid on the fact that the cost of producing the oil was <em>known, to the trespasser only.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Here, it seems to me, it would have been easy for the plaintiff to have proved what the substitute insurance would have cost Duncan.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">My present strong conviction is that the rule announced in the cited case ought not -to be applied to the facts of this case\u2014although I confess that, since this motion was filed, I have been unable to find opportunity for going thoroughly into that question. I think that, at least, the motion for a rehearing should be granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
