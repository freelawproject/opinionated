The appellant sought to establish his property rights in and to the water power at the lower falls on the Colorado Biver at Marble Falls, in Burnet. County, Texas, as riparian owner to a part of the B. G. Blanton survey, which abuts on the river at that point, and also his rights by virtue of certain files made by him on the waters of the river at that point on the 10th day of April, 1909, and 31st day. of May, 1909; alleging that the appellees had entered upon and dispossessed him of his property rights and were constructing a large dam at the point mentioned which would have the effect to submerge and destroy all of his property rights, and prayed that his rights be established; that he have his writ of possession; that appellees be enjoined from interfering with him, and if the court should find that he was not entitled to this relief, then that he recover damages for the conversion \u2022of his rights as riparian owner. The appellee, the Colorado Power Company, resisted appellant\u2019s action, contending that the appellant had no riparian rights; that he owned no land riparian to the river; that it owned all of the land on both sides of the river at the point above <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>mentioned, and that it was entitled to all of the water power and property rights at that point by virtue of certain files made by different persons of which it was the owner, and that the work being done by it was being done by virtue of these rights. The other appellees adopted its answer in addition to filing disclaimers. The case was reached for trial on the 9th day of January, 1911, and a jury being waived by all parties, the matters of fact as well as of law were submitted to the court, and the court, after having heard the pleadings, evidence and argument of counsel, rendered judgment on the 11th day of January, 1911, that appellant take nothing and that the .appellees go hence without day and recover their costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u201cThe case is now pending in the Court of Civil Appeals, and among other material questions involved is the one herein certified. On the 29th day of January, 1883, the State of Texas, by patent issued on that day, granted to William R. Baker, assignee of R. G. Blanton, what was known as the R. G. Blanton survey of land on the Colorado River in Burnet County, containing one hundred and twenty-nine acres. On the 30th day of January, 1883, William R. Baker conveyed the same tract of land to Herman Richter, and on the 29th day of \u00a1November, 1!884, Herman Richter executed to W. H. Roper a deed, which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-5\">\u201c Herman Richter to W. H. Roper.

H. Roper, the receipt of which is hereby acknowledged and confessed, and in further consideration of the sum of One Hundred Dollars to be hereafter paid to me as is evidenced by the promissory note of the said Roper bearing date herewith, payable to me or by my order on or before the 29th day of \u00a1November, A. D. 1885, do grant, bargain, sell, convey, and have by these presents granted, bargained, sold and conveyed unto the said W. H. Roper, of Burnet County, State of Texas, the following piece, parcel or tract of land, lying &amp; being situated in the County of Burnet, in the State of Texas, about 16 miles south of Burnet town, a part of the R. G. Blanton survey, on the south side of the Colorado River. Beginning at a stone mound the lower corner of survey \u00a1No. 605, from which a cedar bears S. 40 E. 5 vrs. do. brs \u00a1N\". 36 W. <em>3 </em>vrs; Thence down the Colorado river with its meanders S. 24 E. 1050 vrs to a stone mound from which a cedar brs.

If appellees\u2019 contention is correct, and the reservation is void, then the case was properly decided, and it will not be necessary to pass upon any other question; hence it appears that the question certified is necessarily material.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\u201cWith the foregoing statement and explanation, the Court of Civil Appeals certifies to the Supreme Court for decision the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">\u201cIs the reservation in the foregoing deed of Herman Biehter to W. H. Boper valid, and does it reserve to or vest in Herman Biehter such right or rights as can form the basis of a suit to protect such rights or recover damages for injury thereto ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-11\">We construe the reservation in Biehter\u2019s deed to Boper to mean an undivided one-half interest in the exclusive use for all power purposes of the waters of the river \"appurtenant to the land described in the deed, or in the exclusive right to appropriate the waters to those purposes, and so much of the land as might be \u201cnecessary to utilize\u201d the power thus developed or be required for its development. As the riparian proprietor of the land before its sale, Biehter had no rights of ownership in the waters of the river; he only had such rights in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>their use as inhered in his ownership of riparian land. Riparian rights subsist only for riparian owners, and those who do not own riparian land can not claim them. The rule is well expressed in F'amham on Waters, section 463, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\">\u201cAll persons on the margin of a flowing stream have by nature certain rights to use the water of- the stream, whether they exercise these rights or not, and they may begin to exercise them whenever they will. . . . The right does not depend upon appropriation or presumed grant from long acquiescence, but exists <em>jure naturae </em>as part of the land;. . . . the right depends, not upon ownership of the soil under which the water flows, but upon lateral contact with the water. . . . The right attaches only to riparian land and can not be claimed for non-riparian land. This must, of necessity, be the rule, because it is necessary to have some limitation upon the right to use the water from a stream, so as to leave enough for the use of riparian owners further down, or it might be entirely consumed near the origin of the stream. The right to use the water is primarily based upon the ownership of land adjoining the stream, and persons whose land is not in contact with the stream are in no' sense riparian owners, and are not entitled to any rights in the use of the water as private individuals. The only things that they can claim are the right of navigation and to share in the public right of fishery, gathering ice, or such other rights as the public are entitled to. That being the rule, the only method of determining who are, and who are not riparian owners is by following the rule established by nature, and holding that that only is riparian land entitled to the benefits of the stream which is actually in contact with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In Gould on Waters, section 148, it is thus stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u201cAll riparian rights depend upon the ownership of land which is contiguous to and touches upon the water; and, in the case of tide waters, at common law, upon the ownership of the land above and adjoining the edge of the water at ordinary high water mark. They attach to the land, and an express mention in the deed that they are sold with it is surplusage. They do not attach to any lands, however near, which do not extend to the water; nor do they necessarily attach to a State grant of lands lying below the tidal high water mark.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Numerous cases are to like effect. Among them are Risien v. Brown, 73 Texas, 135, 10 S. W., 661; Lake Superior Land Co. v. Emerson, 38 Minn., 406, 8 Am. St. Rep., 679, 38 N. W., 200; Boehmer v. Big Rock Irrigation District, 117 Cal., 19, 48 Pac., 908; Stark v. Miller, 113 Mich., 465, 71 N. W., 876; Bank v. Asylum, 108 Ky., 357, 56 S. W., 525.</p>\n<p id=\"AMS\">In Risien v. Brown, McAnelly, the owner of land bordering upon a creek, conveyed it to another, expressing a reservation in the deed to this effect: \u201cI hereby reserve to myself the privilege of banking water up the said creek for the purpose of erecting machinery.\u201d With respect to the right thus attempted to be reserved, it was said: \u201cThis could not have enured to the benefit of McAnelly, as it was a reservation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>a right he could not exercise b)r reason of the fact that he was then divesting himself of all title to the land on the creek.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">In speaking of the nature' of riparian rights, it is said in Lake Superior Land Co. v. Emerson:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">\u201cThese rights all pertain to the use of abutting land in connection with the water, or of the water in connection with the land. The right to ,use beyond the low water mark rests upon the title to the bank, and not to the bed of the water. Diedrich v. Northwestern Union Ry. Co., 42 Wis., 248, 24 Am. Rep., 399. It is a right peculiar to the owner of the land bordering on the lake or stream, and not possessed by others. Morrill v. St. Anthony Falls Water Power Co., 26 Minn., 222, 37 Am. Rep., 399, 2 N. W., 842, and cases cited. The owner of the abutting land has the right to enjoy,, for the purposes of gain or pleasure, all the facilities which the location of his land with reference to the lake affords. Delaplaine v. Chicago &amp; N. W. Ry. Co., 42 Wis., 214, 24 Am. Rep., 386. It exists <em>jure </em>naturae, because the land has, by nature, the advantage of being washed by the stream. Lyon v. Fishmongers\u2019 Co., L. R., 1 App. Cas., 662. The right is incident to the land,\u2014belongs to it by nature. We have not found any case holding that it may be severed from the right to the abutting land, so as to become a right in gross; one person owning exclusively the shore, and another the riparian right incident to it, though owning no shore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that when Richter parted with the title to the land described in the deed to Roper, he equally divested himself of all riparian rights in the waters of the river appurtenant to the land, and he could predicate no cause of action upon their lawful exercise by a subsequent owner of the land, to whom they enured in virtue of its ownership.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-7\">The attempted reservation from the grant of the land, expressed in the deed, of \u201cnecessary ground to utilize\u201d the water power, is so vague and indefinite as to be incapable of enforcement. How much ground would be-subject to appropriation out of the body of the land; as well as its location, under this clause, is a matter of purely speculative determination. The quantity of ground necessary to the utilization of the power would depend upon the methods and purposes of the use. Yet by the terms of this clause no limitation is placed upon either. Any and all purposes for which it might be \u201cutilized\u201d are left open to the adoption of the grantor, and he would be equally at liberty to pursue any and all proper methods to utilize the power for those purposes. Any quantity of land, located anywhere in the tract, necessary to the full utilization of the water for any one or more purposes, since there is no limitation to any particular use of the power or to any designated purpose for which it should be utilized, would thus be subject to appropriation without let or hindrance by its owner. To concede effect to this reservation is, therefore, to recognize a right in the grantor which is repugnant to the grant of the land, and it is accordingly void. McDaniel v. Puckett, 68 S. W., 1007; Butcher v. Creel\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>Heirs, 9 Grat. (Va.), 201; Thompson v. Gregory, 4 Johns. (N. Y.), 80, 4 Am. Dec., 255; Darling v. Crowell, 6 N. H., 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The certified question is answered in the negative.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
