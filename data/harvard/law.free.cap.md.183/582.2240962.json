Before the expiration of the time for filing a lien, the appellant verbally promised to pay the claim if appellee would forego filing a mechanic\u2019s lien.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The facts in this case are very similar to those in the case of <em>Edward A.

The promise to pay the claim in both cases was made at the same time and under the same circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">. We have fully recited all of these facts in Case No. 21, and for the reasons set forth therein the judgment of the lower Court in this case will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed with costs to appellee.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
