It is averred that the operator of .the tractor was entirely free of negligence and the accident was the direct result of the negligence of the appellee\u2019s motorman who was operating the street car. The case was submitted to the trial court without a jury, and at the conclusion of the whole case, judgment was rendered for the defendant (appellee) on the ground of contributory negligence. It is from this judgment that the present appeal was taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-11\">About half past seven on the morning of March 30, 1943, a tractor with a trailer annexed, belonging to The Davidson Transfer and Storage Company, operated by William Bryan, destined to Curtis Bay, was proceeding south on Bond Street in the City of Baltimore. The tractor was 12 feet long and the trailer was 28 feet long. The trailer was loaded with some empty drums and ten tons of pipe fittings. Bond Street, in its approach southerly to Monument Street, is a two and one-half per cent up-grade. The tractor was in third gear, which corresponds to second gear of a touring car. On' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>the level, when in third gear, it has a speed of about twenty miles an hour. That morning the tractor traveling on Bond Street, upgrade, approaching Monument Street to the south, was traveling about ten miles an hour. As it approached Monument Street there was an automobile facing south, parked at the west curb of Bond Street, about eight feet north of the north curb of Monument Street. Rudy Shaw was the driver of this car. His employer was seated in it and he was standing at the curb, at about the windshield of the automobile, with the right door of the car open, about to get in and drive his employer to his office. He had a perfect view easterly down Monument Street to Broadway. He saw the tractor approaching and as it was near him he waited for it to pass. He saw the accident and his description of how it happened is about as follows: When he first saw the tractor-trailer it was about fifteen feet north of his employer\u2019s automobile, traveling about eight or ten miles an hour. At that time, the witness stated, the street car was not coming. As the tractor passed him it was to the right of the center of the street. When it reached a point where its hood projected about six feet into Monument Street he looked over the hood of the tractor and saw the street car coming west, crossing over Bethel Street, traveling about thirty miles an hour. From the center of Bethel Street westerly to the center of Bond Street is 245 feet. \u201cThe cab just got across the first rail, the streetcar was in, I say, fifty feet of it. As the truck got center the track, going about center, the street car ran right into the center ox the truck, I will say, about near the center.\u201d On cross-examination the witness gave this version of the accident: \u201cThe street car was about, when the cab entered over just about the first rail, going west on Monument the street car was coming over Bethel Street, and the cab was hitting the eastbound rail \u2014 When the cab hit the eastbound rail, why, that threw the street car about fifty feet to it, to the trailer. The trailer is just half way across, the trailer gets about even, the center of the trailer gets <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>about even with the eastbound rail, the street car ran right into the side of it, and that knocks the cab cater-cornered up Monument, up the street and knocks the rear end of the trailer down.\u201d It was after the trailer passed, the witness saw the street car fifty feet from the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Addison Warren testified he was walking west on the north side of Monument Street and when he reached the west curb of Bethel Street he saw a street car. It was making a terrific noise. He turned and looked and by that time the car was beside him; \u201cso, I followed the. general direction of the street car, and that\u2019s when I saw the first unit of the truck and trailer going across.\u201d At that time the front wheels of the tractor were about midway between the two tracks of the westbound rails, and then \u201cI noticed the street car was running at a terrific rate of speed, I didn\u2019t expect it to stop. I was continuing walking, and I did notice during that time the motorman made every effort. He applied the brakes and put sand under the wheels, but the street car just continued sliding right straight down the street, and by that time the front of the tractor-trailer had gotten across to the other track of the eastbound run.\u201d \u201cThe rear trailer wheel was just about center of the westbound run when the actual contact came between the two vehicles.\u201d It \u201cupset the trailer, and then I hurried up and ran across the street behind the street car and went over to the cab to see how the fellow was in the cab, and helped him to get out.\u201d At that time the trailer was turned over on its right side, the rear wheels were on the south rail of the westbound tracks. The witness estimated that the motorman applied sand in order to stop the car 100 feet from Bond Street; that the sand and brakes were applied shortly after the street car passed him at Bethel Street. He did not hear the bell on the street car ring.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">William Bryan, at the time of the accident, had been working for the appellant for a year and eight months and had been driving tractor and trailer units for ten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>years. When he came to the intersection of Monument and Bond Streets he \u201ccouldn\u2019t see, didn\u2019t see anything coming or going either way so, as I pulled out in the intersection I looked and saw the street car coming. By that time the front of my tractor was in the car track of the westbound street car, so I continued on across because the street car was up there so far I just say, well, being that far, I will be across before he hit me.\u201d He further stated that the front of the tractor was just about in the westbound tracks when he first saw the street car and it was at that time close to Bethel Street, and when the streetcar struck the trailer the tractor was just about at the building line, meaning the building line on the south side of Monument Street. He stated: \u201cAs I was going across Bond Street, I didn\u2019t think the street car would hit me. I got so far out and all of a sudden I heard something go bump, and just as soon at it hit the whole think went over.\u201d The street car struck the trailer about four feet back from the center. The tractor-trailer was traveling at about ten miles an hour at the time and due to the heavy load the witness stated he could not pick up in speed. On cross-examination he said: \u201cWhen I got to the intersection it wasn\u2019t nothing coming or going, no automobiles or street car or anything.\u201d When asked: \u201cWhere was the front of your tractor when you looked that first time and couldn\u2019t see anything?\u201d he answered: \u201cI was just about at the building line.\u201d \u201cWhen I first seen the street car I was at the building line but the tractor stood out in front of me about six feet.\u201d Question: \u201cWell, didn\u2019t you look for the street car when you yourself got to the building line?\u201d He answered: \u201cI looked for street cars, other automobiles, anything, when I got to the building line, but I didn\u2019t see anything,\u201d and he saw the street car the first time when the front of the trailer was on the car tracks. \u201cWhen I seen the street car my tractor wheels was in the street car tracks.\u201d He stated that due to the upgrade and the heavy load he could not increase his speed. He further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>stated that going ten miles an hour he could stop within two feet.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The damage resulting from this accident is not disputed and the testimony relating thereto need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">From this evidence it appears that the witness Bryan was driving this tractor with the trailer attached, heavily loaded, upgrade, on Bond Street. When he arrived at the building line and had a partial view east on Monument Street, he looked and saw no traffic approaching. The cab in which he was sitting was some five to six feet from the front of the tractor. He proceeded, at ten miles an hour, to cross the intersection, and when the front of the tractor was in the westbound street car tracks he saw the street car for the first time. It was then near Bethel Street, approximately 245 feet east. It further appears that the street car was being operated, down a 5 per cent, grade, at a high rate of speed and when it was about 100 feet east of Bond Street, in an effort to slow down the speed, the motorman released sand for an approximated distance of 100 feet, and applied the brakes, but, nevertheless, the momentum of the street car was such that it hit the rear end of the trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">These facts make out a prima facie case of negligence on the part of the motorman in the operation of the street car. There was evidence tending to show that the street car was operated at an excessive rate of speed, which directly contributed to the accident. To determine whether or not the operator of the tractor was guilty of contributory negligence it was necessary that all the facts and circumstances attending this accident be considered, and it cannot be said, from this evidence, that the operator of the tractor was guilty of such conduct so\" distinct, prominent and decisive that ordinary minds would not differ in declaring it to be negligent. The appellant\u2019s evidence, therefore, was legally sufficient to be submitted to a jury, if this case had been tried before a jury. <em>United Rys. &amp; Electric Co. v. Ward, </em>113 Md. 649, 77 A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>593; <em>United Rys. &amp; Electric Co. v. Watkins, </em>102 Md. 264, 267, 62 A. 234; <em>Schell v.

Mantik, </em>127 Md. 197, 96 A. 261.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">On the question of contributory negligence as a matter of law, the facts in the case of <em>Foos v United Railways &amp; Electric Co., </em>136 Md. 540, 541, 110 A. 849, and the case of <em>Colgate &amp; Co. v. United Railways &amp; Electric Co., </em>156 Md. 472, 144 A. 519, are so different from the facts involved in this case that they are not in point.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">This brings us to a consideration of the evidence of the appellee. The witness Crouse was the motorman operating the car at the time of the accident. His testimony may be summarized as follows: He brought his car to a stop at Broadway. On Monument Street two large blocks extend west from Broadway to Caroline Street. Between Broadway and Bond is Bethel Street, which is a narrow street at which street cars do not stop, and Bond Street, which is between Broadway and Caroline Street, is a skip stop street, that is, street cars do not stop there to discharge or take on passengers. There is a five per cent, downgrade to Caroline Street. The street car could have drifted all the way down, without the motorman applying the current, \u201cat a pretty fair speed\u201d. When he \u201ccame down from Broadway\u201d he said: \u201cI just don\u2019t know how fast I was going but moderate.\u201d At Bethel Street he checked the speed some and rang the bell. At that time he put the current on and \u201cI just had started to start again from being slowed up when I got to the building line.\u201d At that time the car was traveling between ten and fifteen miles per hour. When the front of the street car was south of the east building line on Bond Street, the motorman said he could not see the tractor-trailer, although Bond Street, as it intersects Monument Street at the north side thereof, is 41 feet 10 inches in width from curb to curb and the east sidewalk on Bond Street is 14 feet wide, from curb to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>building line. It would seem at that time the motorman could have seen down Bond Street farther than the building line on Monument Street. He states at that time he could not see the tractor-trailer. He further stated that he slowed up at Bond Street and didn\u2019t see anything there and he \u201cthrew it around against the post to go on down,\u201d meaning that he turned on the current. When he saw the truck (meaning the tractor) it was at the building line (north building line) of Monument Street. Question: \u201cYou say you did not observe this truck (meaning tractor)\u2019 at all until you got to the building line on Bond Street?\u201d Answer: \u201cWell, I couldn\u2019t see it around the corner. You have to wait until I got down to the corner to see it.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t see it until I got down so I could see it.\u201d Question: \u201cWell, if the truck was back of the building line and you were at the building line, why did you throw your street car in emergency and throw sand at that point?\u201d Answer: \u201cI thought he was going to do something like that, like he did, cut in front of me, and I started stopping again.\u201d After the accident the-back wheel of the truck (meaning the tractor) was on the eastbound tracks and part of the trailer was \u201csticking out beyond that.\u201d The tractor-trailer was knocked over on its right side. It thus appears from this evidence that when the street car came to Bethel Street its speed was slackened. It picked up some speed as it approached Bond Street, when current was again applied. At the building line the motorman did not see the tractor-trailer, although if he had looked'to his right it is highly probable that he could have seen it before it arrived at the building line on Monument Street. He says that when he \u201cspied\u201d the truck he threw sand, rang the gong and applied the brakes all at the same time and \u201cbefore I knew it he was right across in front of me because he was going fast.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">Frank Shiner testified he was sitting on the right side of the street car, about in the center. The front end of the street car was about at the corner when he first saw the truck. He was asked, on direct examination: \u201cWell, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>at that time where was the front of the traetor with respect to the north side of Monument Street?\u201d And he answered: \u201cA pretty good, I might say a right good distance past the center of the street.\u201d The next question was: \u201cWhat?\u201d A. \u201cThe tractor \u2014 \u201d Q. \u201cNo, the tractor, the motor truck \u2014 where was the front of the motor truck with respect to the north side of Monument Street, when you first saw \u2014 where was the front of the motor truck with respect to the north side of Monument Street when you first saw it?\u201d To which he answered: \u201cWell, now, I was in the center of the street car, and, of course, if I had been up front I could have saw more but being in the center, I just about got a glimpse of it.\u201d Later on this witness materially changed his testimony. The fact that this witness was called by the defendant, if his evidence is entitled to any weight it would tend to corroborate the testimony produced by the plaintiff. He was not a very impressive witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">Florence Shawker was sitting in the second seat from the front, on the left side of the street car. She remembers that the motorman was very \u201ccareful traveling\u201d and that she felt the slowing down of the car when nearing Bond Street. Of this she definitely took notice. She cannot remember whether the motorman rang the bell. The street car was about at the northeast building line of Bond Street when she first saw the tractor which was at that time at \u201cabout the building line of Monument and Bond, the north\u201d. She said: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was going too fast; I mean, not too fast for comfort to me, but I knew it was coming and I also think it picked up a little speed, after he started across Monument Street probably to clear the track.\u201d Q. \u201cWas there any sounding of the bell ?\u201d A. \u201cI couldn\u2019t remember now whether it was, most likely it was, because I wasn\u2019t uncomfortable.\u201d When asked where the collision occurred with respect to the center of the intersection, she answered: \u201cWell, I wouldn\u2019t know about that. I just picked out the part of the trailer we were going to hit, and we hit it about where I put it.\u201d The trailer was hit, she said, between the center and the back.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>James Quinn stated that he was a passenger on the street car and that after the car left Broadway the motorman was coming downhill and was ringing his bell and was doing everything a motorman should do. He was \u201cgoing regular.\u201d The Court asked the question: \u201cWell, if he was not going fast why.was he ringing his bell?\u201d His answer was: \u201cHe kept ringing it.\u201d When asked the question: \u201cWell, did you see this truck before the accident happened?\u201d He answered: \u201cThat truck came out of Bond Street just like a flash, a vision like, and all of a sudden it crashed.\u201d The street car was about three feet east of the Bond Street building line when he first saw the tractor-trailer. He stated he guessed that the street car was traveling at about ten miles an hour at the time. When asked: \u201cWell, where was the truck when you first saw it with respect to the street car?\u201d he answered: \u201cWell, now, she bounded out so fast from Bond Street that I just couldn\u2019t tell you how close it was. It really came out like a flash.\u201d When asked the question : \u201cHad the tractor gotten on to the street car tracks when you first saw it or was it north of the track?\u201d he answered: \u201cHe came out awful quick, sir.\u201d So that, according to this witness, when the street car was three feet east of Bond Street, this heavily laden trailer, drawn by this tractor., upgrade, \u201cflashed\u201d out in front of the street car. Where the tractor was when the street car was three feet east of Bond Street he does not appear to know. It is sufficient to say that the description given by this witness of how this accident occurred is highly improbable.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">Agnes McCord was a passenger on the street car. She said it \u201cwasn\u2019t going very fast\u201d and she didn\u2019t recall hearing the motorman ring the bell. She said: \u201cJust as we reached the building line on the northeast, I saw the truck coming out of Bond Street.\u201d \u201cThe street car motorman then applied his brakes to stop the car, the street car, and the truck kept on going. It didn\u2019t make any effort to stop. It was going at a pretty fast speed',\u201d and it seemed to her it was going faster than the street car was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>going before the motorman applied the brake. She further testified when the motorman saw the truck, that is, when he applied his brakes, he saw it almost the same time she did. \u201cI was right in front' of the car.\u201d She further stated that when she first saw the truck it was \u201cright at the north building line when I saw it.\u201d She testified that the front part of the truck (meaning tractor) was at the building line when she saw it.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">The testimony of the photographer and of the police officer who arrived after the accident need not be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">We have carefully considered all of the testimony produced in this case in connection with primary and contributory negligence. The preponderance of the evidence tends to show that this street car was traveling downgrade at a high rate of speed, which was the direct and proximate cause of this accident. Almost all of the witnesses testified when they first saw the front end of the tractor it was even with the building line of Monument Street. It is uncontradicted that the trailer was heavily laden and that it was going a little upgrade. Its operator stated that by reason of the load and the grade the tractor could not pick up speed and it was moving about ten miles an hour as it approached the intersection. He could have stopped it within two feet. It seems highly improbable that under such circumstances he should attempt to cut in front of a fast moving street car, and it is improbable that the tractor was moving faster than the street car was before the motorman applied the brakes. It is hard to believe that the tractor-trailer came out into Monument Street like a \u201cflash\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">\u201cEffect has been given to the known disposition of men to act prudently to avoid danger and thus are entitled to the presumption that they did act with due care.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">\u201cBefore the victim of the accident can be judicially declared to have been guilty of contributory negligence, we must give due consideration not only to all inferences of fact tending to support the opposite view, but also to the important presumption that he exercised ordinary care for his own safety.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>\u201cIn Maryland the law is well established that the burden of proving contributory negligence is on the defendant. There is no burden on the plaintiff to free himself from the charge of contributory negligence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\"><em>Sheriff Motor Co. v. State, </em>169 Md. 79, 84, 179 A. 508, 511.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">We conclude that <em>primary </em>negligence was established by the plaintiff; that the defendant failed to meet the burden of proof which was on it to show that the operator of the tractor was guilty of negligence directly contributing to the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, judgment entered in favor of appellant against the appellee for $1,011.03, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
