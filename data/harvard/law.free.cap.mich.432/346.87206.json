Appellant brought several cans of beer with him. With Larson driving, the two went to JB\u2019s Firebird Lounge, consuming some of the beer en route. At the lounge, appellant and Larson drank beer served to them by the lounge. Larson testified in his deposition that they alternated paying for the beer. Appellant testified in his deposition that either of them could have paid for the beer. The two young men left the lounge in Larson\u2019s car, with Larson driving. A short time later, appellant was seriously injured when Larson\u2019s car collided with another vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Appellant brought this action against Larson, seeking damages for negligence, and against appellee Firebird Lanes, Inc., seeking damages under Michigan\u2019s dramshop act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993. The trial court granted summary judgment to defendant-appellee Firebird Lanes, Inc., holding that appellant could not recover under the dram-shop act against appellee Firebird Lanes, Inc., because appellant actively participated in Larson\u2019s intoxication. The Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">We granted leave to consider the following issues: (1) whether or not principles of comparative negligence should replace the rule, also known as the noninnocent party doctrine, that a plaintiff may not recover under the dramshop act if the plaintiff actively participated in the intoxication of the tortfeasor, and (2) whether or not the rule should be applied differently where the plaintiff is a minor. We hold that comparative negligence has not replaced the noninnocent party doctrine as a defense in a dramshop action, and we decline to apply the noninnocent party doctrine differently when the plaintiff is a minor._</p>\n<p id=\"Axs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">The section of the Liquor Control Act governing dramshop actions at the time this case was filed provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b594-6\">A wife, husband, child, parent, guardian, or other person injured in person, property, means of support, or otherwise, by a visibly intoxicated person by reason of the unlawful selling, giving, or furnishing of intoxicating liquor to the person, if the sale is proven to be a proximate cause of the injury or death, shall have a right of action in his or her name against the person who by the selling, giving, or furnishing the liquor has caused or contributed to the intoxication of the person or who has caused or contributed to the injury. [1933 (Ex Sess) PA 8, as amended by 1980 PA 351, MCL 436.22(5); MSA 18.993(5).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Recently, this Court declared, \"Under this state\u2019s dramshop act, the intoxicated person himself and those who contributed to his intoxication have no right of action under the act.\u201d <em>Jackson v PKM Corp, </em>430 Mich 262, 267-268; 422 NW2d 657 (1988) (interpreting the provision quoted above). This interpretation of the act has prevailed for several decades. <em>Malone v Lambrecht, </em>305 Mich 58, 61-62; 8 NW2d 910 (1943); <em>Kangas v Suchorski, </em>372 Mich 396, 399; 126 NW2d 803 (1964).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Appellant urges us to reevaluate this interpretation and exercise our authority to reshape the common law by replacing the noninnocent party doctrine with principles of comparative fault.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Citing <em>Placek v Sterling Heights, </em>405 Mich 638; 275 NW2d 511 (1979), where this Court abandoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>the common-law doctrine of contributory negligence and adopted comparative negligence, appellant argues that the noninnocent party doctrine is of common-law, not legislative, origin, and is therefore subject to change by the judiciary. The dramshop act does not state specifically that a plaintiff who participates in the intoxication of the allegedly intoxicated person may not recover damages under \u00a722. Regarding defenses, the statute says only that \"all factual defenses open to the alleged intoxicated person or minor shall be open and available to the principal and surety.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, the noninnocent party doctrine is not mandated by an express declaration of the Legislature. However, keeping in mind that the object of statutory construction is \"to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the Legislature,\u201d <em>Browder v Int'l Fidelity Ins Co, </em>413 Mich 603, 611; 321 NW2d 668 (1982), we decline to disturb our long-settled judicial interpretation of the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">In <em>Rosecrants v Shoemaker, </em>60 Mich 4; 26 NW 794 (1886), this Court interpreted 1881 PA 259, as amended by 1883 PA 191, a precursor of the provision before us today, as barring recovery by a plaintiff who suffered injuries as the result of an unlawful sale of liquor to her husband if the plaintiff herself caused, encouraged, or requested the sale. The Court reasoned that such a plaintiff \"does not stand on the footing of an innocent injured party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The Court in <em>Morton v Roth, </em>189 Mich 198, 202; 155 NW 459 (1915), again held that a person who participates in the intoxi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>cation of the intoxicated person \"is not an 'other person\u2019 within the meaning of the statute . . . In <em>Malone, </em>the Court reviewed <em>Rosecrants </em>and <em>Morton </em>and recognized that the more recent enactment, 1933 (Ex Sess) PA 8, as amended by 1937 PA 281, failed to change the noninnocent party defense earlier held to be intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-7\">If the Legislature in enacting our more recent statutes had intended to depart from the long-established construction of the civil-damage provisions of like enactments above noted, it seems certain that it would have expressed such intention in clear and definite terms. Instead the recent enactments follow quite literally the wording of the earlier provisions of like character. <em>[Malone, </em>305 Mich 61-62.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">The same reasoning applies to the present question. The Legislature amended the Liquor Control Act several times between the time <em>Malone </em>was decided and the events of this case,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> modifying the language of \u00a7 22 in 1958, 1961, 1972, and 1980.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In none of these efforts to revise the scope of the dramshop cause of action did the Legislature undertake to limit or preclude the noninnocent party doctrine, despite this Court\u2019s reaffirmance that the noninnocent party doctrine was a complete defense to a dramshop action in <em>Malone, McDaniel v Crapo, </em>326 Mich 555, 558; 40 NW2d 724 (1950), and <em>Kangas, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>6</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Instead, the language defining who may bring a civil damage action remained essentially the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>In addition, between 1980 and 1986, when the Legislature again amended \u00a722, published opinions continued to apply the noninnocent party doctrine.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Three of these decisions expressly rejected an argument, similar to appellant\u2019s, that comparative negligence has replaced the defense. <em>Goss v Richmond, </em>146 Mich App 610; 381 NW2d 776 (1985); <em>Barrett v Campbell, </em>131 Mich App 552; 345 NW2d 614 (1983), lv den 419 Mich 877 (1984); <em>Dahn v Sheets, </em>104 Mich App 584, 591; 305 NW2d 547 (1981), lv den 412 Mich 928 (1982). Yet the Legislature, in its extensive 1986 amendments of the act, failed to suggest any intention to modify or eliminate the judiciary\u2019s construction. Under these circumstances, we construe the Legislature\u2019s silence over the past decades as an affirmance of this Court\u2019s interpretation. See <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675, 691; 377 NW2d 804 (1985); <em>Wikman v City of Novi, </em>413 Mich 617, 638; 322 NW2d 103 (1982); <em>Smith v Detroit, </em>388 Mich 637, 650-651; 202 NW2d 300 (1972); <em>In re Clayton Estate, </em>343 Mich 101, 106-107; 72 NW2d 1 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">Not only does the Legislature\u2019s acquiescence in this established interpretation counsel against announcing a new rule adopting comparative negligence for noninnocent parties, the language in \u00a7 22 itself is inconsistent with such a rule. The statute allows recovery by a \"wife, husband, child, parent, guardian, or other person injured <em>... by </em>a visibly intoxicated person . . . .\u201d MCL 436.22(5); MSA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>18.993(5) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Given this language, the intoxicated person who injures himself cannot recover any damages from the dramshop, even though the dramshop may be partially responsible for his injuries.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In light of the Legislature\u2019s clear intention to preclude partial recovery by the intoxicated person himself, we cannot conclude that the Legislature nevertheless intended partial recovery to be available to a dramshop plaintiff who actively participates in the intoxication of the person who thereafter injures her.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> It seems unlikely that the Legislature intended that the principles of comparative fault would apply in cases brought by some noninnocent plaintiffs, but not in cases brought by others.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">The modification in common-law negligence defenses wrought by the 1979 decision in <em>Placek </em>fails to provide a basis for revising our conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>the Legislature intended to bar noninnocent parties from recovering damages under the dramshop act. The civil damage action defined in the dram-shop act is not a common-law remedy based on common-law negligence principles. <em>Longstreth, </em>423 Mich 696. Instead, the remedy of \u00a7 22 was created long ago by the Legislature to \"fill the void left by the common law\u2019s general rule of nonliability.\u201d <em>Jackson, </em>430 Mich 267. It was intended to be \"a complete and self-contained solution to a problem not adequately addressed at common law and the exclusive remedy for any action arising under 'dramshop related facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Millross v Plum Hollow Golf Club, </em>429 Mich 178, 186; 413 NW2d 17 (1987); <em>Jackson, </em>430 Mich 274-276.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">The noninnocent party doctrine is a defense to this statutory cause of action gleaned from the intent of the Legislature and is not dependent upon the common-law doctrine of contributory negligence.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In none of its prior decisions did this Court rely on common-law negligence principles or mention contributory negligence when interpreting the Legislature\u2019s intent to bar noninnocent party recovery under the act. Any development in common-law negligence rules, including the <em>Placek </em>decision, cannot be grafted upon \u00a7 22 unless the Court first finds that that is the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">We are not persuaded that the Legislature intended the principles of the <em>Placek </em>decision to be applied in a dramshop action. We note the Legislature has had no difficulty whatever in explicitly applying the principles of comparative negligence in a number of other instances, including product <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>liability actions, and the areas of contribution and joint and several liability.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> However, neither the 1980 nor the 1986 amendments of \u00a7 22 reflect any legislative intention to adopt comparative negligence in place of the established bar to recovery for the intoxicated person or a plaintiff partially responsible for the intoxication of the person who causes injury. Instead, the Legislature left unchanged the language which precludes all recovery by the intoxicated person himself, demonstrating that the Legislature continued to expect that comparative fault not apply.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">We agree with appellant that the dramshop act is remedial in nature and should be liberally construed,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and that any construction that decreases the defenses available under the act may further the legislative purpose of deterring unlaw<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>ful liquor sales. However, the legislative history of the act reflects repeated efforts by the Legislature to narrow the liability of dramshop owners. The amendments of 1958, 1961, 1972, and 1986 have consistently limited, not expanded, dramshop liability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Given the Legislature\u2019s attempts over the past decades to carefully and deliberately delineate the scope of dramshop liability, accepting appellant\u2019s invitation to expand dramshop liability would be improvident and would risk disturbing the remedial balance the Legislature has attempted to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">We now examine whether comparative fault principles should nevertheless apply in the specific circumstances of this case involving a minor plaintiff who actively participated in the intoxication of the person alleged to have caused him injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">No case decided by this Court applying or recognizing the noninnocent party doctrine has addressed whether or not different rules might apply for adult and minor plaintiffs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> However, an examination of the statute itself discloses no legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>intent to afford dramshop defendants less defenses against minor plaintiffs than against adult plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Admittedly, the Liquor Control Act imposes greater restrictions and controls where minors are involved. While a vendor is prohibited from selling liquor to \"any person in an intoxicated condition,\u201d MCL 436.29(2); MSA 18.1000(2), there is no criminal prohibition against such sales. By contrast, selling, <em>or furnishing, </em>liquor to a minor is a misdemeanor. MCL 436.33; MSA 18.1004. Minors are subject to penalties under the act that adults, even visibly intoxicated adults, are not. For instance, minors who transport or possess liquor in a car commit a misdemeanor. MCL 436.33a; MSA 18.1004(1). Minors who buy, consume, or possess liquor are subject to civil fines. MCL 436.33b; MSA 18.1004(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">On the basis of the act\u2019s heightened regulation of minors\u2019 access to alcohol, appellant argues that the Legislature does not believe minors are capable of understanding, anticipating, or handling the consequences of alcohol consumption. Accordingly, appellant argues, although adults may be held responsible for their lack of judgment under the noninnocent party doctrine, minors should not be penalized for their allegedly noninnocent behavior, but should be allowed at least partial recovery under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">Despite the merits of appellant\u2019s premise,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Legislature in enacting \u00a7 22 has rejected it. Section 22 limits dramshop plaintiffs to persons injured \"by\u201d the intoxicated person. Both a minor and a visibly intoxicated adult to whom a dramshop makes unlawful sales are barred from bringing an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>action under \u00a7 22 for their own injuries.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Under appellant\u2019s view, however, neither the minor who drinks and later injures himself, nor the minor who encourages another to drink and is later injured by that other person, can understand or anticipate the consequences of alcohol consumption. Because appellant\u2019s premise does not accommodate the legislative decision to bar all recovery by the former minor, we cannot accept it as a basis for finding a legislative intent to treat minor plaintiffs differently than adult plaintiffs under the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">Appellant also argues that special rules apply to children in other tort contexts, likening the proposed comparative negligence defense for minor plaintiffs in dramshop actions to attractive nuisance and modified negligence standards for children. However, as the dramshop action is not based on common-law tort principles, any insights into legislative intent gained by examining developments in unrelated tort actions have little value compared to interpretations of the statute\u2019s language. Similarly, although this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Longstreth </em>established different rules for minor and adult plaintiffs in common-law actions against social hosts, <em>Longstreth </em>involved the judicial craft<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>ing of a common-law, not a legislatively created, remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">The history and present language of the dram-shop act cause this Court to defer to legislative initiative in the engrafting of the principle of comparative fault upon this statutory remedy.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of the courts below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b604-6\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b593-8\"> Section 22 of the Michigan Liquor Control Act, 1933 (Ex Sess) PA 8 as amended by 1980 PA 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\"> Other states have adopted a similar defense.

The dubious legislative-silence canon of statutory construction has indeed been given credence by this Court in a variety of contexts.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Justice Harlan, speaking for the United States Supreme Court, in <em>Zuber v Allen, </em>396 US 168, 185; 90 S Ct 314; 24 L Ed 2d 345 (1969), said that \"[legislative silence is a poor beacon to follow in discerning the proper statutory route.\u201d Justice Rutledge, concurring in an earlier case, explained why this canon of statutory construction should be applied with caution:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b607-7\">There are vast differences between legislating by doing nothing and legislating by positive enactment, both in the processes by which the will of Congress is derived and stated and in the clarity and certainty of the expression of its will. And there are many reasons, other than to indicate approval of what the courts have done, why Congress may fail to take affirmative action to repudiate their misconstruction of its duly adopted laws. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Among them may be the sheer pressure of other and more important business. See <em>Moore v Cleveland R Co, </em>108 F2d 656, 660 [CA 6, 1940]. At times political considerations may work to forbid taking corrective action. And in such cases, as well as others, there may be a strong and proper tendency to trust to the courts to correct their own errors, see <em>Girouard v United States </em>[328 US 61, 69; 66 S Ct 826; 90 L Ed 1084 (1946)], as they ought to do when experience has confirmed or demonstrated the errors\u2019 existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-6\">The danger of imputing to Congress, as a result of its failure to take positive or affirmative action through normal legislative processes, ideas entertained by the Court concerning Congress\u2019 will, is illustrated most dramatically perhaps by the vacillating and contradictory courses pursued in the long line of decisions imputing to \"the silence of Congress\u201d varied effects in commerce clause cases. That danger may be and often is equally present in others. More often than not, the only safe assumption to make from Congress\u2019 inaction is simply that Congress does not intend to act at all. Cf. <em>United States v American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, </em>310 US 534, 550 [60 S Ct 1059; 84 L Ed 1345 (1940)]. At best the contrary view can be only an inference, altogether lacking in the normal evidences of legislative intent and often subject to varying views of that intent. In short, although recognizing that by silence Congress at times may be taken to acquiesce and thus approve, we should be very sure that, under all the circumstances of a given situation, it has done so before we so rule and thus at once relieve ourselves from and shift to it the burden of correcting what we have done wrongly. The matter is particular, not general, notwithstanding earlier exceptional treatment and more recent tendency. Just as dubious legislative history is at times much overridden, so also is silence or inaction often mistaken for legislation. <em>[Cleveland v United States, </em>329 US 14, 22-24; 67 S Ct 13; 91 L Ed 12 (1946).

The evidence also tended to show that Heikkala \"was somewhat intoxicated at the time of the injury.\u201d Isaacson contended that Heikkala had no right of action under the dramshop act \"because there was testimony tending to show he himself was intoxicated.\u201d This Court acknowledged that there was \"testimony in the record tending to show that both plaintiff and the said Lund were intoxicated at the time of the injury complained of,\u201d but nevertheless held that \"the case is brought directly within the provisions of\u201d the dramshop act and that Heikkala was an \"other person\u201d who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>could maintain an action under the act.

Larson. It begs the question\u2014whether the noninnocent party doctrine applies to a minor, Craig, who furnishes liquor to another person, Larson, who together with the tavern caused his injury\u2014to stress that Craig\u2019s injury may not have been <em>caused </em>solely by the acts of Larson and the tavern but also in part by Craig\u2019s act in providing or purchasing liquor for Larson. Indeed, to the extent the Court would preclude recovery by Craig, not because he contributed to Larson\u2019s <em>drinking, </em>but rather because by so doing he contributed to or caused his own <em>injury, </em>the Court lends credence to Craig\u2019s argument, rejected by the Court, that the doctrine of comparative fault should replace the noninnocent party doctrine now that contributory fault is no longer generally an absolute bar to any recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">The Legislature has, to be sure, \"narrow[ed] the liability of dramshop owners\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> in recent legislation. It does not follow that it would \"expand dramshop liability\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> were the Court to hold that the judicially enunciated noninnocent party doctrine, developed in cases involving adult plaintiffs, does not apply where the plaintiff is a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">This is a case of first impression. There is thus no decision of this Court ruling whether the Legislature intended that the noninnocent party doctrine would apply to a minor plaintiff. When we decide this case, we decide for the first time what the Legislature intended in enacting the dramshop <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>act. This Court\u2019s construction of the act in the instant case states the scope of a tavern\u2019s liability as it was when the dramshop act was enacted, and thus this Court\u2019s decision can neither narrow nor expand the scope of the liability as it was from inception.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">The majority states that because the Legislature did not provide a \u00a7 22 dramshop remedy against a tavern for an intoxicated person, adult or minor, the Legislature thereby indicated that no distinction should be made in applying the noninnocent party doctrine between adults and minors.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The noninnocent party doctrine developed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>this Court in the construction of the dramshop act, that a person\u2014in all prior cases an adult\u2014who furnishes liquor to another who, together with the tavern, caused the contributor\u2019s injury, may not maintain a dramshop action against the tavern was not predicated on and did not follow ineluctably from the structure of the act in failing to provide a dramshop remedy against the tavern for an intoxicated person when he is the only drinker involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">The dramshop act provides in \u00a722 that \"an individual who suffers damage or is personally injured by a minor or visibly intoxicated person,\u201d may bring a dramshop action.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> It is thus indeed clear from the structure of the act<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> that neither a minor nor a visibly intoxicated person may bring a dramshop action \"for their own injuries\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> suffered in consequence of unlawful sales by the tavern to the minor or visibly intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>It is the primary responsibility of the drinker, adult or minor, to refrain from libation short of intoxication. It is thus understandable that the Legislature would not provide a \u00a722 dramshop remedy against a tavern for an intoxicated adult or affirmatively provide, as an exception, a dram-shop remedy for a minor who becomes intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">While an intoxicated minor or adult may not recover against the tavern for injuries suffered in consequence of his own excessive drinking, he may recover against the tavern for injury suffered as a result of the excessive drinking of another. A person is not barred by the structure of the act from maintaining an action where another drinker is involved simply because he could not maintain an action against the tavern if he was the only drinker involved in his injury. <em>Heikkala v Isaacson, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">If two persons become visibly intoxicated at a tavern at opposite ends of the bar and get together, say, as they are finishing their last drink at closing time, and drive off together, and an accident occurs, the visibly intoxicated passenger can maintain a dramshop action against the tavern for injuries caused by the sales to the visibly intoxicated driver. <em>Heikkala v Isaacson, supra. </em>Similarly, if the two drinkers meet and drink side by side at the bar and each pays his own bill, the result should it seems be the same, neither drinker having furnished liquor to the other.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">An adult passenger who furnishes liquor to the driver is barred, however, under the noninnocent party doctrine from maintaining a dramshop action even if he does not drink and is not himself intoxicated. It is thus clear that the basis or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>rationale of the noninnocent party doctrine is not the failure of the Legislature to provide a \u00a7 22 dramshop remedy to a person who becomes intoxicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Accordingly, the noninnocent party doctrine need not, because of the structure of the dramshop act in failing to provide a remedy where the only drinker is the plaintiff himself, be applied when another drinker is involved in plaintiff\u2019s injury without regard to other policies set forth in the act. In failing to provide a dramshop remedy to an intoxicated minor where he is the only drinker involved in his injury, the Legislature did not send a signal regarding its intention where the minor, who may not himself have become intoxicated,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> contributed to the intoxication of the person who, together with the tavern, by their concurrent acts caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Other policies set forth in the act should be considered in deciding whether the Legislature intended that the judicial gloss on the dramshop remedy\u2014barring a dramshop remedy where an adult, deemed as a matter of law to have reached the age of discretion in respect to alcoholic beverages, participates in furnishing liquor to the person who together with the tavern caused his injury \u2014also bars a dramshop remedy where a minor, deemed as a matter of law <em>not </em>to have reached the age of discretion in respect to alcoholic beverages, so participated in the intoxication of the person who together with the tavern caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">In <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675; 377 NW2d 804 (1985), this Court held, in a case where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number><em>a minor had become intoxicated, </em>that the Legislature intended that such a minor or his estate may bring an action against a social host for violation of \u00a7 33 of the liquor law<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> barring the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to a minor. In so holding, the Court in effect recognized that the legislative failure to provide a \u00a7 22 dramshop remedy against a tavern did not mean that a \u00a7 33 remedy had not been provided, at least against a social host. The Court reserved the question whether a \u00a7 33 remedy was provided against a tavern<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> despite prior holdings of this Court,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> now codified,<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> that the \u00a7 22 remedy was the exclusive remedy against a tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Logical symmetry is not the lodestar of statutory construction.

This Court has said that an adult who purchased liquor for a minor cannot recover for \"consequences for which he was directly and actively responsible\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> and that an adult who matched coins with and purchased liquor for another adult he knew was intoxicated is not \"an innocent person entitled to recover under the act.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Neither rationale can appropriately be applied where a minor furnishes liquor to the driver because the Legislature, in barring in \u00a7 33 sale or furnishing of alcoholic beverages to minors, indicated that they are as a matter of law deemed to be so \"innocent\u201d regarding alcoholic beverages that no one (Long<em>streth, </em>supra) may lawfully sell or furnish alcoholic beverages to them and sought to protect them from the \"consequences\u201d of excessive use of alcoholic beverages.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">The Legislature barred the selling of liquor to minors because it was thought that minors have not reached the age of discretion regarding alcoholic beverages. The Legislature said in effect that adults are deemed, as a matter of law, to have reached the age of discretion regarding alcoholic beverages and that minors are deemed, as a matter of law, not to have reached the age of discretion and thus minors are legislatively deemed \"innocent\u201d regarding alcoholic beverages._</p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>The legislative prohibition of sales to minors sought to protect not only third persons, but also the minor from the consequences of youthful indiscretion and folly in the use of alcoholic beverages. It is inconsistent with that legislative judgment to apply the noninnocent party doctrine, developed in cases of adults (who the Legislature has said, in effect, have reached the age of discretion regarding alcoholic beverages) in a case where the tavern sells intoxicating beverages to a minor, deemed innocent as a matter of law, in violation of provisions of the act\u2014barring all sales to minors<footnotemark>39</footnotemark>\u2014 separate and apart from those barring sales to a visibly intoxicated person.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">It is contrary to the spirit of this legislation to permit the tavern to avail itself as a defense of the very consequences of the indiscretion of the minor respecting alcoholic beverages that the Legislature sought to obviate by the legislative prohibition of all sales to minors.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In sum, there is nothing in \u00a722, the dramshop act, bearing on whether the judicial construction of that legislation known as the noninnocent party doctrine should apply to a minor as well as an adult\u2014\u00a7 22, in failing to provide a remedy to an intoxicated person, does not indicate what the rule should be when the injured person is seeking to recover for injuries resulting from an unlawful sale to another person to whose drinking he contributed.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">Section 33, barring all sales to a minor, intro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>duces another legislative policy which justifies, indeed requires, distinguishing between a minor and an adult who contributed, together with the tavern, to the drinking of the person whose driving caused the minor\u2019s injury. In light of that declaration of legislative policy, this Court cannot appropriately apply the \"consequences for which he was directly and actively responsible\u201d and \"noninnocent\u201d rationales\u2014stated in propounding the noninnocent party doctrine in actions brought by adults\u2014in an action brought by a minor who, by reason of that declaration of legislative policy, is deemed as a matter of law to be so \"innocent\u201d regarding alcoholic beverages that no sale is to be made to him and who is to be thereby protected against \"consequences\u201d for which he would otherwise be responsible and for which, by reason of that declaration of legislative policy, the tavern, not the minor, is \"directly and actively responsible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">We would hold, on the basis of \u00a7 33, barring all sales to a minor, that the judicially developed noninnocent party doctrine does not apply to a minor, and that a minor who participated, together with the tavern, in furnishing liquor to the intoxicated person may maintain an action against the tavern for injuries suffered as a result of an unlawful sale of intoxicating liquor by the tavern.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">We would reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b620-7\">Archer, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b604-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 351.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b604-10\"> MCL 436.22; MSA 18.993.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b604-11\"> <em>Morton v Roth, </em>189 Mich 198, 202; 155 NW 459 (1915).
