The Court of Appeals entered summary judgment in defendant\u2019s favor on the basis of UCC 7-404.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-13\">We hold that \u00a77-404 does not apply to the defendant, and we reject the latter defense as it is based upon a misapplication of the Restatement provision. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"AsP\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">In 1978 and 1981, plaintiff, Michigan National Bank, made loans to farmers William and Rosemary Christacopulos and their co-partnership, Trojan Farms. The collateral for these loans included \"all livestock and increase\u201d of the farmers. The bank filed its security interest with the county, but not with the Secretary of State.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">In 1982, the farmers had the defendant Livestock Exchange auction some of the cattle which it had pledged to the bank as collateral. Defendant made no attempt to search the county or state records for a ucc filing. The payment for the cattle, less sales commission, was made solely to the farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">Plaintiff filed a complaint for conversion against the exchange on January 24, 1983. Defendant filed its answer on March 17, 1983. Plaintiff filed a motion for summary judgment under GCR 1963, 117.2(2) and (3) (now MCR 2.116[C][9] and [10]), on the grounds that defendant had failed to state a valid defense and that there was no genuine issue of material fact. After a hearing on the matter, the trial court granted summary judgment on the ground that the exchange had failed to state a valid defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">Defendant appealed and the Court of Appeals remanded to the trial court</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b524-9\">for consideration of the applicability and effect of \u00a7 7-404 of the Uniform Commercial Code to and upon this case, and such amendments to the pleadings as may be necessary to raise and consider this issue .... See <em>United States v Hext, </em>444 F2d 804; 9 UCC Rep 321 (CA 5, 1971). [Order of the Court of Appeals, entered on September 28, 1984 (Docket No. 78496).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>On remand, the trial judge concluded that UCC 7-404 did not apply in this case, and he reentered summary judgment in plaintiff\u2019s favor. The case was again appealed, and this time the Court of Appeals reversed and entered summary judgment in favor of defendant, holding that \u00a7 7-404 shielded the defendant from liability. Many cases cited and discussed by the defendant in its Court of Appeals brief addressed not \u00a7 7-404, but UCC 9-307. It is likely that defendant saw fit to do so since the Court of Appeals, in its remand order, had cited <em>United States v Hext, </em>444 F2d 804; 9 UCC Rep 321 (CA 5, 1971), which, although it addressed \u00a7 7-404, relied upon \u00a7 9-307. In a footnote, the Court of Appeals noted this and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-4\">The order of summary disposition in the bank\u2019s favor was entered solely on the basis of UCC \u00a7 7-404. For that reason and because we find that the exchange is entitled to the immunity afforded by that section, it is unnecessary to address issues involving UCC \u00a7 9-307 and other code provisions. [165 Mich App 243, 250, n 2; 418 NW2d 663 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">Plaintiff appealed from the Court of Appeals decision, and this Court granted leave to determine \"whether the trial court erred in granting the plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition.\u201d 430 Mich 858-859 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">Michigan common law has long held that \"where an auctioneer receives and takes . . . property into his possession, and sells it, paying over the proceeds, less his commission, he is liable, although he has no knowledge of want of title in the party for whom he sells, and acts in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>faith.\u201d <em>Kearney v Clutton, </em>101 Mich 106, 111; 59 NW 419 (1894). See also <em>Sunlin v Skutt, </em>133 Mich 208, 211; 94 NW 733 (1903); cf. <em>Trail Clinic v Bloch, </em>114 Mich App 700; 319 NW2d 638 (1982); <em>Willis v Ed Hudson Towing, </em>109 Mich App 344; 311 NW2d 776 (1981) (good faith is not a defense in a suit for conversion). This common-law rule is also followed in the great majority of jurisdictions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant has not requested that we revise this common-law approach, nor for reasons which will be discussed below, n 19, would we choose to do so in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Defendant and the Court of Appeals accordingly rely on \u00a7 7-404 of the Uniform Commercial Code for the view that plaintiff has no claim against the defendant. This provision provides bailees with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>immunity from liability for conversion where certain conditions are met. The section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-4\">A bailee who in good faith including observance of reasonable commercial standards has received goods and delivered or otherwise disposed of them according to the terms of the document of title or pursuant to this Article is not liable therefor. This rule applies even though the person from whom he received the goods had no authority to procure the document or to dispose of the goods and even though the person to whom he delivered the goods had no authority to receive them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">The parties agree that this provision can shield the defendant only if three conditions are met:</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">1) The defendant is a bailee for purpose of Article 7;</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">2) The defendant disposed of the cattle pursuant to a document of title;<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">3) The defendant acted in good faith, including the observation of reasonable commercial standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Because we conclude that defendant does not meet the first two of these requirements for \u00a7 7-404 protection, we do not reach the question whether defendant acted in good faith and followed reasonable commercial standards.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">\"Bailee\u201d as it is used in Article 7 is defined in \u00a7 7-102(a), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-12\">\"Bailee\u201d means the person who by a warehouse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>receipt, bill of lading or other document of title acknowledges possession of goods and contracts to deliver them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Thus, in order to fall within this definition, the bailee must:</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">1) by a <em>warehouse receipt or other document of title</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">2) acknowledge possession of <em>goods </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">3) <em>contract to deliver them.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b528-9\">\"Goods,\u201d according to \u00a7 7-102(f), means:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-10\">all things which are treated as movable for the purposes of a contract of storage or transportation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">Therefore, for the cattle to be considered \"goods\u201d for purposes of Article 7, they must be dealt with pursuant to \"a contract for storage or transportation.\u201d This is consistent with the requirement that the bailee \"contracts to deliver\u201d the \"goods,\u201d as well as with Article 7\u2019s definition of warehouseman in \u00a7 7-102(h), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-12\">\"Warehouseman\u201d is a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-13\">The essential determination which we must make is whether the defendants and the farmers entered into a contract for storage or transportation. If not, the cattle are not \"goods,\u201d and thus the defendant is not a bailee. Defendant argues that it did enter into a contract for storage and transportation, claiming that it earns its commission not only by auctioning cattle, but also by holding, feeding, and watering them before and after auction.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-14\">It is uncontested that defendant provides storage and transportation as part of its service. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>these activities are incidental to the primary service provided by the defendant\u2014that of an auction or commission merchant. It would strain the meaning and scope of Article 7 to include in it all parties who engage in some element of storage or transportation as required to carry out their primary task. Similarly, while the cattle were stored in the course of the execution of the contract for commission sale, it is inaccurate to say that they were treated pursuant to \"a contract of storage or transportation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">In their ucc treatise, Professors White and Summers have observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-5\">Article Seven is unlike Article Two on sales and Article Nine on secured transactions where freedom of contract is the rule rather than the exception. The paucity of free contract under Article Seven can be readily explained. <em>The Article deals with two ancient common callings, namely storage and transport. </em>[2 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d ed), \u00a7 21-2, p 135. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">The defendant\u2019s activities as a commission merchant sometimes require it to store and deliver livestock. However, that is not to say that such activities are the \"calling\u201d of a business whose essential work is to act as a commission sales agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">Speaking directly about \u00a7 7-404, White and Summers have also written:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">In a batch of cases, courts have considered whether 7-404 immunizes auctioneers, brokers, and the like who unknowingly assume control of stolen goods or goods subject to security interest, all in the course of participating in their resale. We do not think 7-404 was meant to apply here to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>immunize such persons from conversion liability. [2 White &amp; Summers, Uniform Commercial Code (3d ed), p 148, n 50. Citations omitted.][<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">Defendant has not suggested that it is generally in the business of storing goods or that it would provide such storage absent a contract for auction. We recognize that there is a common-law category of \"bailment for sale.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, such activities have been governed by the laws of agency rather than bailment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In no auction cases decided under the common law by Michigan courts have bailment principles been utilized. See, e.g., <em>Ives v Tregent, </em>29 Mich 390 (1874); <em>Mercer v Leihy, </em>139 Mich 447; 102 NW 972 (1905).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Defendant is an auctioneer and only incidentally stores livestock pursuant to contracts for commission sale. We therefore conclude that it is not an Article 7 bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the \"trucker\u2019s receipt\u201d employed in the transaction was a document of title. While the record and briefs do not clearly define how this receipt is used, it appears that when livestock are delivered to the exchange, the exchange issues a document which identifies the animals\u2019 owner, the trucker making delivery, and the trucking charges. A copy is given to the trucker. The receipt also identifies the stock by number, type, and weight. After a sale occurs, the exchange records on the trucker\u2019s receipt the purchase price, the name of the buyer, and the amount of the commission due. Copies are then apparently provided to the buyer and seller. A document of title is defined in UCC 1-201(15),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\"Document of title\u201d includes bill of lading, dock warrant, dock receipt, warehouse receipt, or order for the delivery of goods, and also any other document which in the regular course of business or financing is treated as adequately evidencing that the person in possession of it is entitled to receive, hold, and dispose of the document and the goods it covers. To be a document of title a document must purport to be issued by or addressed to a bailee and purport to cover goods in the bailee\u2019s possession which are either identified or are fungible portions of an identified mass.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Defendant argues that the trucker\u2019s receipt is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>either a warehouse receipt or falls within the broader \"any other document\u201d language of the provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In light of our conclusion that defendant is not in the business of storing goods for hire, we reject the contention that the trucker\u2019s receipt is a warehouse receipt. Section 1-201(45)<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> defines warehouse receipt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-7\">\"Warehouse receipt\u201d means a receipt issued by a person engaged in the business of storing goods for hire.-</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">We also note that UCC 7-202(2)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> suggests that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>trucker\u2019s receipt is not a warehouse receipt. This provision lists necessary provisions of such a receipt.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Two important elements listed in \u00a7 7-202 are missing from the trucker\u2019s receipt. First, the trucker\u2019s receipt does not contain a \"statement whether the goods received will be delivered to the bearer, to a specified person, or to a specified person or his order.\u201d Second, it does not provide \"the rate of storage and handling charges.\u201d The auctioneer\u2019s fee, if it can be considered \"storage and handling charges\u201d at all, is entered only after the sale since it is done on a commission basis. More important, however, is the fact that the document does not state who is to receive the goods. At most, it could be said that the exchange, as bailee, issues its own delivery order,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> but by definition, the delivery order must come from the bailor.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the trucker\u2019s receipt is a form of a document of title other than a warehouse receipt. The final sentence of \u00a7 1-201(15) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b533-5\"><em>To be a document of title a document must purport to be issued by or addressed to a bailee and purport to cover goods in the bailee\u2019s possession </em>which are either identified or are fungible portions of an identified mass. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The emphasized portion of this provision makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>clear that the trucker\u2019s receipt cannot be deemed a document of title unless it covers goods in a <em>bailee\u2019s </em>possession.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> We have already determined that defendant is not a bailee. However, even putting that fact aside, we would still conclude that the receipt is not a document of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Defendant relies on the broadest language in the \u00a7 1-201(15) definition, viz.,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">also any other document which in the regular course of business or financing is treated as adequately evidencing that the person in possession of it is entitled to receive, hold, and dispose of the document and the goods it covers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">It is clear that the drafters intended to leave this provision open-ended so that changes in technology could be accommodated. The official comment refers to the open-ended nature of the definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-9\">[T]he definition is left open so that new types of documents may be included. It is unforeseeable what documents may one day serve the essential purpose now filled by warehouse receipts and bills of lading. Truck transport has already opened up problems which do not fit the patterns of practice resting upon the assumption that a draft can move through banking channels faster than the goods themselves can reach their destination. There lie ahead air transport and such probabilities as teletype transmission of what may some day be regarded commercially as \"Documents of Title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">While the code provided for the likelihood that new types of documents of title would be developed, we do not believe that the document in this case is such an example. The open definition does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>not purport to convert commission sales contracts into documents of title. It merely recognizes that with changes in technology, new and unforeseeable types of documents of title could yet develop. Moreover, defendant has provided no information which would lead us to believe that this type of receipt was not already in use at the time the ucc was adopted. While the definition was designed so as to not exclude newly developing forms of documents of title, we do not think it was intended to provide for a reclassification of documents already in use, absent a change in commercial practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">In addition, the receipt does not serve the essential function which documents of title perform, viz., to define to whom delivery is to be made. Section 7-403(l)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> requires that delivery be made to \"a person entitled under the document . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Such a person is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">[a] holder in the case of a negotiable document, or the person to whom delivery is to be made by the terms of or pursuant to written instructions under a non-negotiable document. [MCL 440.7403(4); MSA 19.7403(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Thus, where the document is negotiable, it must be presented to the bailee in order to take delivery since delivery must be made to the bearer of the document. Obviously, the trucker\u2019s receipt is not a negotiable document of title since it does not state that delivery is to be made to the bearer as required by UCC 7-104(1). The exchange accordingly claims that the receipt is a nonnegotiable docu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>ment of title. However, nonnegotiable documents of title must either explicitly state who is to receive the goods or the goods remain deliverable to the bailor only, in which case the bailor may at any time issue a \"delivery order\u201d in writing to the bailee stating who is to receive the goods or a portion of them.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> A \"delivery order\u201d is a document of title in its own right.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> No one was named in the trucker\u2019s receipt when defendant issued it, and the bailor never provided a delivery order. Therefore, if we view the receipt as a document of title, the only parties entitled to receive the cattle were the bailor farmers.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">Defendant argues that the trucker\u2019s receipt defines who is to receive the goods by its implied terms. However, these very implied terms, viz., that the exchange is to act as a commission merchant and auction them to the highest bidder, demonstrate that the trucker\u2019s receipt is not a document of title. To the degree that the defendant claims that the \"person entitled\u201d is whomever the exchange negotiates a sale to, the exchange has exceeded the duties of a ucc bailee.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">In light of the above discussion, we conclude that the trucker\u2019s receipt was not a document of title under Article 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Defendant cites no cases which have held that \u00a77-404 shields auctioneers from liability for conversion. Further, it cites no cases in which auctioneers were held to be bailees for purposes of any provision of Article 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>The only authority which defendant cites for its view is 7 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 7-404:3, p 583, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">Code \u00a7 7-404 destroys the common law tort liability of one innocently selling or handling the goods of another.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As long as the bailee acts innocently he is not liable to the true owner for a conversion of the latter\u2019s goods in the case here considered.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">This commentary is of doubtful relevance for two reasons. First, it relies on the official comment which, as we have explained, n 5 <em>supra, </em>speaks only of warehousemen and common carriers as being within the scope of the provision. Second, defendant\u2019s reading of the Anderson treatise is questionable in light of other commentary provided in that treatise. In its discussion of UCC 9-306,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the treatise states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-7\">When an auctioneer sells property in which a creditor has a perfected security interest without the permission of the creditor, the auctioneer is liable for conversion of the collateral even though he had acted in good faith and without knowledge of the existence of the security interest. Such liability is a continuation of prior non-Code law and is not displaced by the fact that the Code contains no provision on the subject of the liability of third persons to the secured creditor. [9 Anderson, Uniform Commercial Code, \u00a7 9-306:55, p 179.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Defendant also relies on <em>United States v Hext, supra. </em>That case primarily addressed Article 9 and will be discussed below, pp 296-301. Defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>reliance on it vis-\u00e1-vis Article 7 is misplaced. In <em>Hext, </em>the commission sales agent and the bailee were two distinct entities. The <em>Hext </em>court held, on the basis of its somewhat attenuated reading of Article 9, that the sales agent was not liable. In footnote 34 the court noted that while the Article 9 analysis would shield the sales agent, it would not do the same for the bailee. The note then stated that the bailee \"is otherwise protected from conversion liability by 7-404 . . . .\u201d Therefore, defendant\u2019s citation to <em>Hext </em>is misleading on two levels. First, while <em>Hext </em>correctly stated that a bailee is shielded by \u00a7 7-404, the bailee in that case was an ordinary warehouseman, not a sales agent. Second, since the <em>Hext </em>court relied on Article 9 rather than Article 7 to find in favor of the sales agent, it would seem that it did not believe that sales agents are shielded by \u00a7 7-404. If that were so, the attenuated Article 9 analysis would not have been necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">While there is little case law interpreting \u00a77-404, what there is supports plaintiffs position. <em>First Nat'l Bank of LeCenter v Farmers Union Marketing &amp; Processing Ass'n, </em>371 NW2d 22 (Minn App, 1985); <em>United States v New Holland Sales Stable, Inc, </em>603 F Supp 1379 (ED Pa, 1985). Cf. <em>Turner v Scobey Moving &amp; Storage Co, </em>515 SW2d 253; 15 UCC Rep 1122 (Tex, 1974); <em>Bishop v Allied Van Lines, </em>80 Ill App 3d 306; 399 NE2d 698 (1980). Further, we are aware that in interpreting the ucc, courts should attempt to promote uniformity. <em>United States v Burnette-Carter Co, </em>575 F2d 587 (CA 6, 1978). In addition, there are many cases in which the common-law rule of auctioneer liability was followed after the adoption of the ucc. <em>United States v Burnette-Carter Co, supra; United States v Topeka Livestock Auction, Inc, </em>392 F Supp 944 (ND Ind, 1975); <em>In re Van Rhee, </em>80 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Bank Rptr 844 (WD Mich, 1987); <em>United States v Chesley\u2019s Sales, Inc, </em>523 F Supp 528 (WD Pa, 1981); <em>Commercial Bank at Alma v Hales, </em>281 Ark 439; 665 SW2d 857 (1984); <em>Hills Bank &amp; Trust Co v Arnold Cattle Co, </em>22 Ill App 3d 138; 316 NE2d 669 (1974); <em>Top Line Equipment Co v Nat'l Auction Service, Inc, </em>32 Wash App 685; 649 P2d 165 (1982); <em>Bottema v Producers Livestock Ass\u2019n, </em>174 Ind App 206; 366 NE2d 1189 (1977); <em>Farmers State Bank v Stewart, </em>454 SW2d 908 (Mo, 1970). In <em>Stewart, </em>p 915, n 5, the Missouri Supreme Court took specific note of the fact that the defendant was not an ordinary bailee, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-4\">The action of the sales barn operator in the case at bar went beyond taking charge of the cattle as a mere depositary. The defendant Stewart took charge of the cattle with the intention of handling them in such a way\u2014namely, by selling them\u2014 that some third person would acquire a proprietary interest in them. This is a serious invasion of the rights of the lienholder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In light of our conclusion that the defendant is not an Article 7 bailee and that the trucker\u2019s receipt is not a document of title, as well as the lack of any authority supporting defendant\u2019s position, we hold that UCC 7-404 does not apply to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Both parties, as well as the amicus curiae, discuss the effect of UCC 9-307 on the question of defendant\u2019s liability. While the Court of Appeals based its decision on \u00a7 7-404, it invited the discussion of \u00a7 9-307 by citing <em>Hext, supra, </em>which relied on that provision. Since the issue was raised and preserved, and we did not limit our grant order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>\u00a7 7-404 alone, we will, in the interests of judicial economy, forgo a remand to the Court of Appeals and address the Article 9 issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">There are two possible grounds for affirmance of summary judgment in favor of the defendant on the basis of \u00a7 9-307. The first relies on the statute in effect at the time of the transaction as read in the context of 1 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 233(1). The second suggests that policies underlying the revised version of \u00a7 9-307, which was not in effect at the time this suit arose, should be applied to this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">Section 233(1) of the Restatement of Torts, 2d, p 453, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">Except as stated in Subsection (4), one who as agent or servant of a third person disposes of a chattel <em>to one not entitled to its immediate possession </em>in consummation of a transaction negotiated by the agent or servant, is subject to liability for a conversion to another who, as against his principal or master, is entitled to the immediate possession of the chattel. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">The defendant\u2019s argument focuses on the emphasized phrase. Defendant claims that under the Restatement\u2019s version of this common-law principle, if the party who purchased the cattle was in fact \"entitled to [their] immediate possession,\u201d then there is no conversion and the defendant is not liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-11\">In order to demonstrate that the purchaser was in fact entitled to the immediate possession of the, cattle, defendant then cites UCC 9-307(1), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>A buyer in ordinary course of business (subsection [9] of section 1-201) other than a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations takes free of a security interest created by his seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">This provision is an exception to the general rule stated in \u00a7 9-306(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-5\">Except where this Article otherwise provides, a security interest continues in collateral notwithstanding sale . . . unless the disposition was authorized by the secured party ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Thus, the general rule is that a security interest remains with collateral even though it is no longer owned by the debtor, but, pursuant to \u00a7 9-307, if the new owner of the collateral is a \"buyer in the ordinary course of business\u201d he takes free of the security interest <em>unless the collateral is \"farm products </em>[bought] <em>from a person engaged in farming operations </em>. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Rather than decide the more difficult question of whether the cattle were farm products or inventory, we will assume, for the purpose of argument, defendant\u2019s view that they were inventory when auctioned by the exchange. Therefore, defendant suggests, since the purchasers took free of the bank\u2019s security interest, they were entitled to immediate possession and the agent, i.e., the exchange, is not liable for conversion.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">This analysis was first defined in <em>United States v Hext, supra. </em>In that case, the debtor had pledged cotton as collateral for loans from the plaintiffs creditor. The cotton was stored with a bailee and sold through a separate sales agent. Quoting \u00a7 233(1), the <em>Hext </em>court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>Accepting this as an authoritative statement of the law (and none of the other authorities cited by the parties are to the contrary),<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> it is at once apparent that [the sales agent and the bailee], to the extent that they acted, in good faith and without actual knowledge of the Government\u2019s interest, as agents of the Gin Co. by facilitating the sale of the cotton to the buyers, cannot be liable as converters since the cotton was not transferred \"to one not entitled to its immediate possession.\u201d Rather, since the buyers took free of the Government\u2019s security interest under Section 9-307(1) of the Code, they were entitled to immediate possession, and the acts of [the sales agent and bailee] in facilitating the transfer to them were thus not tortious.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">[444 F2d 816.]</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Defendant notes that this approach has also been followed in <em>United States v Muleshoe Livestock Auction, </em>unpublished opinion of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, decided April 25, 1988 (Docket No. CA-2-83-149). See also <em>United States v Progressive Farmers Marketing Agency, </em>788 F2d 1327 (CA 8, 1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">We reject this analysis for two reasons. First, the Restatement provision, as interpreted by the defendant, does not accurately represent Michigan common law. As noted above, that rule was stated in <em>Kearney v Clutton, </em>101 Mich 111:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-8\">[W]here an auctioneer receives and takes . . . property into his possession, and sells it, paying over the proceeds, less his commission, he is liable, although he has no knowledge of want of title in the party for whom he sells, and acts in good faith.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Assuming arguendo that the Restatement means what defendant says it does, stare decisis nevertheless compels our reliance on <em>Kearney.</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\">Even if we were to rely on the Restatement provision rather than our own common law, we would nevertheless reject it because the analysis which defendant derives from it and \u00a7 9-307 rests on bootstrap reasoning. One commentator has observed that the <em>Hext </em>analysis \"is suspect\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b543-5\">[The <em>Hext </em>court] correctly observed that there can be no conversion liability for having disposed of chattels if the property was transferred to a person who is entitled to immediate possession of them. In such a case, \"no tort has occurred, since the possession has merely been surrendered to one who has a right to it.\u201d [Quoting 1 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7235, comment d, p 461.] In the <em>Hext </em>case, however, the buyers were not entitled to immediate possession as against the secured party until after their purchases that the selling agent helped to arrange. The buyers had no preexisting superior right to the property that apparently is necessary if liability is to be avoided for the reason advanced by the court in <em>Hext. </em>Arguably, therefore, the agent\u2019s immunity in <em>Hext </em>is a product of bootstrap reasoning. [Hillman, McDonnell, Nickles, Common Law and Equity Under the Uniform Commercial Code, \u00b6 22.01(2)(a)[iv], p 22-12.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">The <em>Hext </em>analysis was also criticized in <em>First National Bank of Amarillo v Southwestern Live</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>stock, Inc, </em>616 F Supp 1515, 1519-1520 (D Kan, 1985), whose reasoning we adopt:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-4\">This Court is not persuaded by <em>Hext\u2019s </em>reliance on Restatement (Second) of Torts, \u00a7 233(1). Even assuming the Fifth Circuit was correct in equating the buyer\u2019s entitlement to possession with the strength of title acquired after sale, the premise of \u00a7 233(1) is that the buyer acquires all, but only, the degree of title previously possessed by the seller; therefore, the strength of the buyer\u2019s title is considered prima facie evidence of the validity of the sale. This premise is clear in the illustrations following \u00a7 233(1):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\">1. A, as agent for B, negotiates a purchase from C of goods stolen from D. A delivers the goods to B. A is subject to liability to D for conversion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-6\">2. A, as agent for B, negotiates a sale to C of goods which B has stolen from D. A delivers the goods to C. A is subject to liability to D for conversion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-7\">In contrast to these situations, under the unique provisions of the ucc a buyer may acquire bona fide title to property even when the sellers, as in this case, had none to convey. That simply does not mean, as defendant would have the Court believe, that the agent\u2019s sale of the chattel was proper. The premise of \u00a7 233(1), that the ultimate buyer acquires only such title as the seller has to convey, is not always true under the ucc. Therefore, in these cases the buyer\u2019s title may not be looked to as prima facie evidence of whether the agent\u2019s sale was proper as against the seller\u2019s creditor. Section 233(1) does not govern the question of the agent\u2019s liability for conversion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-8\">The critical factor, rather, is the debtor\u2019s authorization to sell. Unless otherwise provided by the ucc, a security agreement is effective according to its terms between the parties, against purchasers of the collateral and against creditors. [UCC \u00a7 9-201.] The failure to perfect one\u2019s security interest does not impair the secured party\u2019s right to pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>ceed against the debtors. Clark, The Law of Secured Transactions, \u00b6\u00b6 3.2[2], 9.4[1]. In this case defendant nowhere claims the [debtor] or [the auctioneer] derivatively, were authorized to sell the cattle. Under the law allowing an unperfected secured creditor to proceed against its debtor for conversion, so may the plaintiff in this case proceed against the debtors\u2019 agent, which merely \"stands in the shoes of his principal\u201d regardless of the rights acquired by the ultimate buyer for value.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b545-4\">Accordingly, we hold that the Restatement of Torts, 2d, \u00a7 233(1), even when read in the light of UCC 9-307, does not shield the defendant from liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">In 1986, the Legislature substantially revised \u00a79-307 so as to provide for actual notice to auctioneers of any outstanding security interests in the farm products which come before them for auction. (See Appendix.) The details of this new scheme need not concern us, but its purpose is to avoid the very situation in which the litigants in this case find themselves and to shield auctioneers from such liability where they have complied with the statute\u2019s requirements and have not received actual notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Defendant cites two cases, <em>United States v Progressive Farmers Marketing Agency, supra, </em>and <em>Utah Farm Production Credit Ass\u2019n v Hansen, </em>738 P2d 642 (Utah App, 1987), in which the protections afforded to livestock auctioneers under simi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>lar revisions of \u00a7 9-307 were applied retroactively as a matter of public policy.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-4\">We agree that the system now in place is a superior mechanism for ensuring fairness and efficiency in the farm product market. However, that alone does not compel a different result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">When the Legislature revised \u00a7 9-307, the Senate Analysis Section issued two Bill Analyses, the first, analyzing the original bill which would simply have done away completely with the farm products exception without substituting any notification system for it, and the second, analyzing the enrolled bill which is the law today. Each of these analyses described the intent of the original \u00a79-307 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-6\">The intent of the exemption for farm products was to protect the collateral security of lenders who made loans to farmers, thus helping to ensure the availability of credit to farmers. [Senate Legislative Analyses, SB 362, June 6, 1985 and March 10, 1986.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">If the intent of the original provision was to protect creditors so as to ensure the availability of credit, then the controlling public policy, in the view of the Legislature, was not to \"be fair\u201d to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>buyers and commission merchants, but instead to make sure that creditors received payment for their agricultural loans. That being the intent, it is appropriate to assign liability as broadly as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">In addition, under the new provision, the debtor has a duty to inform the creditors of its likely sales agent. Since the debtor did not have that duty in this case, it would be improper to apply duties to the creditors beyond those defined in the provision controlling at the time this case arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">In light of these concerns, and the general principle that statutes shall not be applied retroactively, e.g., <em>McQueen v Great Markwestern Packing Co, </em>402 Mich 321; 262 NW2d 820 (1978), we decline to apply the policies of the new statute in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">In sum, we hold that neither UCC 7-404 nor UCC 9-307 shields the defendant from liability in this case. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and vacate the order of summary judgment in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Defendant argues that certain other defenses, such as a possible waiver of the bank\u2019s security interest,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> were not considered by the trial court in its grant of summary judgment for the plaintiff. Whether such defenses were in fact considered by the trial court is not clear from the record, and we therefore remand the case to that court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b547-9\">Levin, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"Azd\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b548-3\">MCL 440.9307; MSA 19.9307, after amendment by 1985 PA 199, provides;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-4\">(1) Except as otherwise provided by subsection (10), a buyer in ordinary course of business, as defined in section 1201(9), takes free of a security interest created by his or her seller even though the security interest is perfected and even though the buyer knows of its existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-5\">(2) Subsections (3) to (10) shall apply in the case of a person buying farm products from a person engaged in farming operations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">(3) If requested by the secured party, a debtor engaged in farming operations who gives a security interest in farm products shall provide to the secured party a written list identifying potential buyers and points of delivery of the farm products.

Even if we were inclined to do so, this case would not be an appropriate setting. The 1986 revision of \u00a7 9-307 assures that the situation in this case cannot again arise. Were we to revise the rule today, it would have virtually no effect on livestock/ farm product cases (except those which arose prior to 1986) while it could have significant effect on other types of sales agent cases. Any such change should be taken only in a case where a party actively sought it and where its effects would be more immediately discernible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b545-8\"> This conclusion was affirmed by the Tenth Circuit, which noted that the Restatement provision shields an agent from liability only if \"its transferee had a <em>preexisting </em>and superior right to possession.\u201d <em>First National Bank of Amarillo v Southwestern Livestock, Inc, </em>859 F2d 847 (CA 10, 1988) (emphasis in original).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b546-8\"> In the <em>Progressive Farmers </em>decision, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit focused on whether the collateral was inventory or farm products for purposes of \u00a7 9-307 and it concluded that the collateral was inventory. However, even assuming that conclusion is correct, \u00a7 9-307 as in effect in this case and in <em>Progressive Fanners </em>does not in and of itself protect anyone other than a buyer in the ordinary course of business. Absent some further provision such as the Restatement section just discussed, there is no mechanism by which \u00a7 9-307 can be applied to shield an auctioneer. Therefore, the <em>Progressive Farmers </em>application <em>of </em>the then-existing \u00a79-307 has no basis. For this reason, we read <em>Progressive Farmers </em>as resting on a retroactive application of the policies embodied in the revised version of \u00a7 9-307 and Congress\u2019 passage of the Food Security Act, PL 99-198, \u00a7 1324(g), which provided for similar reforms.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b547-10\"> See MCL 440.9306; MSA 19.9306.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b552-6\">Riley, C.J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aar\">(concurring). While I agree with the majority that Articles 7 and 9<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the Uniform Commercial Code do not protect plaintiff in the instant case, I write separately because I disagree with its decision to avoid classifying the collateral (the livestock) as either farm products or inventory for purposes of Article 9.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b552-7\">It is axiomatic that in order to determine the priority of a debtor\u2019s creditors under Article 9, we must first classify the collateral. As the majority notes, classifying the livestock as either farm products or inventory determines whether the \"farm products\u201d exception within \u00a7 9-307(1) exempts the Michigan Livestock Exchange from the general language of \u00a7 9-307(1) which provides that \"a buyer in the ordinary course of business . . . takes free of a security interest created by his . . . seller . . . In the instant case, unless the \"farm products\u201d exception exempts the exchange from \u00a7 9-307(1), then Article 9 arguably shelters the exchange from conversion liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">However, in my opinion, livestock owned by a debtor, but temporarily in the hands of an auctioneer, does not destroy an otherwise valid perfected security interest. See <em>First Nat'l Bank in Lenox v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number><em>Lamoni Livestock Sales Co, </em>417 NW2d 443 (Iowa, 1987); <em>In re Roberts, </em>38 BR 128 (D Kan, 1984); but see <em>United States v Progressive Farmers Marketing Agency, </em>788 F2d 1327 (CA 8, 1986). Presumably, in order to conclude that the livestock constituted inventory, the majority would have to rely upon Official Comment 4 to \u00a7 9-109.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Two federal courts interpreting state law reached this result.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">For example, in <em>Progressive Farmers, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit concluded under Iowa law that Official Comment 4 expressed the intention of the drafters to reclassify collateral in the hands of an auctioneer as inventory, rather than farm products. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In the year following the <em>Progressive Farmers </em>decision, the Iowa Supreme Court expressly rejected the rationale and conclusion reached by the <em>Progressive Farmers </em>court. <em>First Nat'l Bank in Lenox, supra. </em>See also <em>In re Roberts, supra. </em>I prefer to adopt the reasoning of the Iowa Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 9-307(1) rather than the attempt by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to speculate how the Iowa Supreme Court would decide the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">Similarly, the revised version of \u00a7 9-307 in Michigan, 1985 PA 199, supports the conclusion that the legislators intended to classify livestock in the hands of auctioneers as farm products and not inventory under the older version of \u00a7 9-307. In addressing the proposed amendment to \u00a7 9-307, the Journal of the House referred to HB 362 (1985 PA 199) as the \"clear title exception under certain circumstances for all <em>farm products; </em>provided for.\u201d 1985 Journal of the House 4524 (emphasis added). Similarly, \u00a7\u00a79-307(9), (11) and (12) continuously describe collateral in the possession of a commis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>sion merchant as <em>farm products </em>and not inventory. For example, as \u00a7 9-307(9) states, \" 'buyer\u2019 includes a commission merchant or selling agent who sells <em>farm products </em>in the ordinary course of business for a person engaged in farming operations.\u201d (Emphasis added.) See also \u00a7\u00a7 9-307(11) and (12). Whereas, the majority\u2019s interpretation would render the term \"farm products\u201d within these provisions incongruous with the provisions themselves because it classifies the livestock as <em>inventory </em>while \u00a7 9-307 refers to the livestock as <em>farm products. </em>If the Legislature intended to classify collateral in the temporary possession of an auctioneer as inventory, it could have done so rather than specifically referring to the collateral as farm products.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">Accordingly, I would classify livestock in the instant case as farm products and not inventory for purposes of Article 9. Therefore, I agree with the majority that Articles 7 and 9 do not protect the exchange from liability for conversion of the debtor\u2019s livestock.</p>\n<judges id=\"b554-5\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b552-9\"> Before amendment by 1985 PA 199.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\"> I recognize that this Court need not resolve this issue in order to subject defendant to conversion liability.
