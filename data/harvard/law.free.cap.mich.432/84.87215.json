In exchange for the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, the prosecution agreed to recommend a maximum term of imprisonment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>of thirty years, but \"retained] its right to recommend the minimum sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AD\">The defendant was subject to receive an enhanced sentence of imprisonment pursuant to the habitual offender act, MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082.

This Court has stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-8\">Once legislative intent is discerned, it must be given effect, even if doing so might appear to conflict with the letter of the statute. \" '[A] thing which is within the spirit of a statute is within the statute, although not within the letter; and a thing within the letter is not within the statute, unless within the intention.\u2019 \u201d <em>[People v Stoudemire, </em>429 Mich 262, 266; 414 NW2d 693 (1987). Citation omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-9\">A review of this Court\u2019s holding and rationale in <em>People v Tanner, supra, </em>together with fundamen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>tal principles of statutory construction, leads to the conclusion that the Legislature intended to provide a meaningful interval between minimum and maximum sentences imposed pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">In <em>People v Tanner, </em>the defendant, who had pleaded guilty to manslaughter, was sentenced to serve fourteen years, eleven months to fifteen years in prison. The Court addressed itself to the purely legal question whether the defendant\u2019s sentence was in fact \"indeterminate,\u201d as contemplated by the provisions of the indeterminate sentence act.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Tanner, supra </em>at 688. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">Thus, turning to the precise proposition involved, we are convinced that 30 days is not a sufficient interval of time to guarantee that the corrections authorities will be able to exercise their jurisdiction or judgment with any practicality. The net effect of such severe judicial limitation on indeterminate sentencing is to frustrate the intended effect of indeterminate sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\"><em>Convinced as we are, that a sentence with too </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number><em>short an interval between minimum and maximum is not indeterminate, we hold that any sentence which provides for a minimum exceeding two-thirds of the maximum is improper as failing to comply with the indeterminate sentence act. </em>[Emphasis added. <em>Id. </em>at 689-690.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">This cogent and concise statement of policy provides for fundamental fairness in the sentencing process without undue restriction of trial judges\u2019 ability to tailor sentences to fit the individual defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Similar policy considerations exist with respect to repeat offenders. The ability of correctional authorities to consider subsequent developments in setting the actual date of release remains vital to the functions of an effectiv\u00e9 criminal justice system.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In amending the habitual offender act, the Legislature sought to incorporate this policy into the sentencing of habitual offenders through elimination of determinate sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">As amended by 1978 PA 77, \u00a7 10 of Michigan\u2019s habitual offender act provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b334-8\">(2) If the court pursuant to this section imposes a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years, the court shall fix the length of both the minimum and maximum sentence within any specified limits in terms of years or fraction thereof and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>sentence so imposed shall be considered an indeterminate sentence. [MCL 769.10(2); MSA 28.1082(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">Prior to the 1978 amendment, the statute provided only for a term of imprisonment for habitual offenders bearing a certain relationship to the longest term prescribed for the underlying felony.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> There was no requirement in the prior statute that the court impose both a minimum and maximum sentence. Accordingly, the prior statute was interpreted to allow the imposition of a determinate sentence on an habitual offender.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>In re Wil</em>son, 295 Mich 179, 184; 294 NW 145 (1940); <em>People v Ungurean, </em>51 Mich App 262, 267; 214 NW2d 873 (1974), lv den 395 Mich 805 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">Appellant contends that the Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \"shall be considered an indeterminate sentence\u201d in the amended version of the statute, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>merely indicates that if the sentence in fact has a minimum and a maximum term, it will be considered an indeterminate sentence, and nothing more. We are wholly unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">If the Legislature had not been concerned with providing a significant period of indeterminacy in sentences imposed pursuant to the habitual offender act, there would have been no need to amend the statute. It is axiomatic that when the Legislature effects a change in the provisions of a statute, a presumption arises that the Legislature intends a substantive change in the law. <em>Lawrence Baking Co v Unemployment Compensation Comm, </em>308 Mich 198, 205; 13 NW2d 260 (1944); 1A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 22.30, p 265. See also <em>Sam v Balardo, </em>411 Mich 405; 308 NW2d 142 (1981); <em>Detroit Edison Co v Janosz, </em>350 Mich 606, 613; 87 NW2d 126 (1957).</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">When a term has received past judicial interpretation, the Legislature is presumed to have intended the same meaning. <em>People v Powell, </em>280 Mich 699, 703; 274 NW 372 (1937). The Legislature\u2019s use of the phrase \"indeterminate sentence\u201d in \u00a7 10(2) of the act, expresses an intent to incorporate that term into the statute in its familiar legal sense. Accordingly, it must be presumed that the Legislature intended to use the phrase \"indeterminate sentence\u201d as defined by this Court in <em>People v Tanner, supra. </em>The Legislature employed the phrase \"indeterminate sentence\u201d with the requirement immediately preceding it that \"the court shall fix the length of both the minimum and maximum sentence.\u201d Its intent was to provide for indeterminate sentences with a meaningful interval between the minimum and maximum term. It would be disingenuous for this Court not to acknowledge this obvious intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-8\">Since the 1978 amendment of the habitual of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>fender act, the Court of Appeals has, with one exception, uniformly held that habitual offenders must receive indeterminate sentences with a minimum term of no more than two-thirds of the maximum. <em>People v Stevens, </em>138 Mich App 438; 360 NW2d 216 (1984); <em>People v Roby, </em>145 Mich App 138; 377 NW2d 366 (1985), lv den 424 Mich 887 (1986); <em>People v Morin, </em>146 Mich App 629; 381 NW2d 416 (1985); contra <em>People v Freeney, </em>166 Mich App 128; 419 NW2d 754 (1988). See also <em>People v Langham, </em>101 Mich App 391; 300 NW2d 572 (1980), lv den 410 Mich 892 (1981) (a determinate or \u201cflat\u201d sentence held improper under the habitual offender act).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The Legislature has declined to disturb the holdings of this Court and the Court of Appeals, which require a meaningful interval of discretion for corrections authorities where an indeterminate sentence is required by statute. In light of the Legislature\u2019s acquiescence to the statutory interpretation and policy rationale set forth in <em>People v Tanner, </em>we continue to adhere to the analysis and decision therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">We hold that any sentence for a term of years imposed pursuant to \u00a7 10 of the habitual offender act, MCL 769.10; MSA 28.1082, is subject to the rule that the minimum term of years may not exceed two-thirds of the maximum term of years. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, modifying the defendant\u2019s sentence to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>comply with the two-thirds rule of <em>People v Tanner.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b338-4\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Archer, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b330-8\"> (1) If a person has been convicted of a felony, an attempt to commit a felony, or both, whether the conviction occurred in this state or would have been for a felony in this state if the conviction obtained outside this state had been obtained in this state, and that person commits a subsequent felony within this state, the person shall be punished upon conviction as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b330-9\">(a) If the subsequent felony is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment for a term less than life, then the court, except as otherwise provided in this section or in section 1 of chapter 11, may place the person on probation or sentence the person to imprisonment for a maximum term which is not more than <em>IV2 </em>times the longest term prescribed for a first conviction of that offense or for a lesser term.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-10\">(b) If the subsequent felony is punishable upon a first conviction by imprisonment for life, then the court, except as otherwise provided in this section or in section 1 of chapter 11, may place the person on probation or sentence the person to imprisonment for life or for a lesser term.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-11\">(c) If the subsequent felony is a major controlled substance offense, the person shall be punished as provided by Act No. 196 of the Public Acts of 1971, as amended, being sections 335.301 to 335.367 of the Michigan Compiled Laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-13\">(2) If the court pursuant to this section imposes a sentence of imprisonment for any term of years, the court shall fix the length of both the minimum and maximum sentence within any specified limits in terms of years or fraction thereof and the sentence so imposed shall be considered an indeterminate sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b331-6\"> The prosecutor\u2019s reservation of the right to recommend a minimum sentence in the future was apparently a surprise to the defendant. At the session of the court wherein the defendant pleaded guilty, the court attempted to ascertain whether the defendant understood the plea bargain. After the prosecutor recited the terms of the agreement, the following colloquy occurred between the court and the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-7\"><em>The Court: </em>And do you understand what has been said?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-8\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir, but it was my understanding that the prosecution was going to recommend 30 years as a maximum sentence and I was to plead as a second offender, but until now I knew nothing about retaining the right to recommend whatever minimum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-9\"><em>The Court: </em>Well, I will read it again. The prosecution will recommend the 30-year maximum sentence and retain its right to recommend the minimum sentence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-10\"><em>The Defendant: </em>Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-11\">Several months later at the hearing on the defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea, this exchange occurred between defendant and his appellate counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-12\"><em>Q. [Counsel]: </em>All right. Sir, will you explain to the Court in your own words why you feel that you had ineffective assistance of counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-13\"><em>A. [Defendant]: </em>Well, as [trial defense counsel] started explaining some of the legal procedures, such as giving a guilty plea to the Court, and the, <em>he tried to explain the guidelines to me and the one-third, I think it is called the Turner Rule [sic] or something like that. </em>He, I don\u2019t think he gave me enough, how should I say it. A reasonable explanation, you know, for guidelines and Turner Rule and all that. And I wasn\u2019t really given enough time to make a decision, a decision, I am talking about a proper decision, five minutes I don\u2019t believe is enough time to make a decision that is going to\u2014going to last the rest of my life. And that is what I was given each time was about five or ten minutes. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-14\">Thus, it appears that defense counsel and defendant relied on <em>Tanner </em>in their plea-bargain considerations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b332-10\"><em> People v Wright, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, decided December 29, 1986 (Docket No. 90412).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\"> <em>People v Wright, </em>430 Mich 856 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b333-10\"> Sec. 8.

I write separately to explain why I am persuaded that the majority correctly concludes that the Legislature did not intend to permit trial courts to sentence an individual in habitual offender status to a minimum term that effectively deprives corrections officials of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">The public demand for reform of release policy expressed in Proposal B was an unequivocal directive to reallocate authority between trial courts and corrections officials as to Proposal b offenses. However, the Legislature did not similarly act to prohibit parole board jurisdiction upon the basis of the habitual offender status, as such. While it is arguable that the Legislature intended to give trial judges unlimited discretion in sentencing defendants convicted as habitual offenders, absent a clear Legislative directive that parole board jurisdiction can be circumvented on the basis of habitual offender status alone, I concur in today\u2019s result.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b338-8\">Prior to 1978, a trial court could impose only a determinate sentence, that is, a sentence for a fixed term of years upon a defendant convicted as an habitual offender. MCL 769.10-769.12; MSA 28.1082-28.1084. Sections 10, 11, and 12 of the habitual offender act then provided that the trial judge, sentencing a defendant to a term of years imposed a maximum term, either the maximum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>allowed under the statute,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> or a lesser term at the judge\u2019s discretion. No minimum term was set.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">For offenders charged as first offenders, the only punishment authorized by the Legislature was an indeterminate sentence where the maximum was imposed by law and the minimum was to be determined by the sentencing courts. MCL 769.8; MSA 28.1080. The Legislature had thus created two types of sentences, a flat determinate sentence for habitual offenders and an indeterminate sentence for first-time offenders.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">Under the indeterminate sentence act, judicial discretion operated only to establish the minimum sentence.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This type of structure, a legislatively set maximum, and a judicially set minimum, transferred the discretion from the sentencing court to the parole board in regard to the actual length of service of a defendant\u2019s prison term. Thus, a function of the indeterminate sentence structure itself was to apportion the authority to determine a defendant\u2019s actual period of confinement between the court and the parole board.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-7\">In <em>People v </em>Tanner, 387 Mich 683; 199 NW2d 202 (1972), this Court addressed the issue whether an indeterminate sentence with too short an interval between the minimum and maximum term satisfied the policy underlying indeterminate sentencing. The Court concluded in <em>Tanner </em>that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>indeterminate sentence with too short an interval between minimum and maximum frustrated the effect of the indeterminate sentencing act because it did not allow parole authorities any meaningful time within which to exercise their authority.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore the Court in <em>Tanner </em>held that a sentence which provided for a minimum exceeding two-thirds of the maximum was improper.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>pp 689-690. The structure of the indeterminate sentencing act to which the holding of <em>Tanner </em>was addressed was a structure with legislatively set m\u00e1ximums and judicially set minimums, that emphasized the authority of the corrections authority to determine the length of a defendant\u2019s actual term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In 1978, the Legislature made substantial changes throughout the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, including the sentencing provisions of the habitual offender act. The 1978 amendments of the habitual criminal statute directed the trial court to set both the maximum and minimum terms of the sentence, fixed outer limits as the maximum term allowed under the statute,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and provided that the sentence would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>considered an indeterminate sentence. See subsection (2) of 769.10-769.12; MSA 28.1082-28.1084.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">However, while providing that such a sentence was \"indeterminate,\u201d the amendments maintained the feature of prior habitual sentence acts that the judge was to determine the maximum sentence within any stated maximum. Thus, unlike a sentence under the indeterminate sentence section which provides that the maximum penalty provided by law <em>\"shall be </em>the maximum sentence in all cases,\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> all three sections of the habitual criminal act authorize the sentencing judge to sentence a defendant for a minimum term and for the maximum term authorized under the statute or \"for a lesser term.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Unless the words \"or for a lesser term\u201d are surplusage,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the obvious intent of the Legislature was to give the trial court discretion to set the maximum term of the defendant\u2019s sentence. Given the fact that the judge was thus authorized to set the maximum term within the outer limit proscribed, and that the Legislature did not restrict the trial judge in regard to the minimum term, it appears that this \"indeterminate\u201d scheme is not the type of structure to which the <em>Tanner </em>two-thirds/one-third rule applied. <em>Tanner </em>emphasized the need for parole board discretion to determine a defendant\u2019s actual term of imprisonment in the context of a legislatively proscribed maximum sentence. By contrast, legislative authorization of judicial control over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>maximum and minimum sentences suggests a possible reallocation of authority between the courts and corrections.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">The contention that the Legislature did not intend that the habitual criminal acts incorporate the <em>Tanner </em>formulation finds its strongest support in the context of indeterminate sentences imposed on persons convicted as first offenders under the controlled substance act. Unlike the sentence structure at issue in <em>Tanner </em>where the judge was authorized only to set the minimum within the maximum term provided by law, these provisions follow the format of the habitual criminal sections and direct the court to set <em>both </em>a minimum and a maximum term.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>This Court held in <em>People v Perez, </em>417 Mich 1100.21 (1983), that the statutory minimum and maximum sentences for major controlled substances were not mandatory, except in so far as they established the outer limits within which the sentence must be fixed. Thus, for example, given the fact that the judge is authorized to set the maximum term within the mandatory outer limit, application of <em>Tanner </em>to a sentence for a violation of the controlled substance act with a maximum term of twenty-five years would have the anomalous effect of repealing the mandatory minimum of twenty years required by the very same Legislature, a dubious construction at best. The use of the same language in \u00a7\u00a7 10, 11, and 12 of the habitual criminal act supports the contention that the Legislature did not intend to circumscribe trial judge discretion with the two-third minimum <em>Tanner </em>rule.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">However, despite the differences between the indeterminate sentence to which <em>Tanner </em>applies and the indeterminate sentences authorized under the habitual criminal act,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> we are unable to conclude that the Legislature intended to permit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>judges to eliminate parole board authority solely on the basis of habitual offender status.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Prior to the passage of Proposal b in 1978, parole authorities treated habitual offenders and first offenders in the same manner in regard to the computation of credits to reduce a defendant\u2019s minimum term of imprisonment. In 1977, the Court of Appeals recognized a distinction in the point at which the prisoner came under the exclusive direction and jurisdiction of the parole board. While a first offender was subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board when the minimum term of the sentence minus allowances was served, and the eventual release was considered discretionary and unreviewable, if in compliance with the law, an habitual offender was not subject to exclusive jurisdiction of the parole board and could not be released prior to the expiration of the minimum term fixed by the sentencing judge without written approval of the judge or a successor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In 1978, Proposal b was enacted into law and the statutes governing parole board authority were amended. These statutes created two basic types of offenders: Proposal b offenders and non-Proposal b offenders. Distinctions between prisoners in regard to parole eligibility were thereafter based on whether the underlying offense for which a person was convicted was a \u201cProposal b\u201d offense<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> rather <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>than whether the person was an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">There is no indication of an intention by the Legislature to alter the prior practice of treating offenders in an habitual status differently than persons convicted as first offenders.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Indeed both are treated the same once they have served the calendar minimum and the parole board has jurisdiction in each instance. Stated otherwise, while the purpose of the habitual criminal provisions is to augment the punishment for subsequent offenses, and the climate surrounding Proposal b <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>clearly indicated public opposition to early release, the Legislature did not modify the treatment of non-Proposal b offenders other than as indicated. Thus, non-Proposal B habitual offenders are eligible for special parole prior to expiration of the calendar minimum with the court\u2019s approval, and Proposal b offenders are not eligible for special parole even with the court\u2019s consent, MCL 791.233(l)(b); MSA 28.2303(l)(b). Parole authorities apply rules appropriate for each prisoner on the basis of the underlying offense for which the offender has been convicted.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">Parole board release policies are of course not binding on this Court. However, I find it both instructive and persuasive that the Legislature has differentiated the authority of the corrections officials only by precluding special parole for Proposal B offenders. Since the Legislature has not indicated an intent to restrict the jurisdiction of the parole board after service of the calendar minimum,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> I conclude that it has not permitted courts to constrict parole board authority by failing to provide a meaningful interval between the minimum and maximum term.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b339-8\"> Under the habitual offender act the court would first determine the punishment authorized on the principal charge and then sentence the defendant to a term not greater than one and one-half times, or whatever the statute proscribed, the maximum term authorized for a first conviction of the offense.
