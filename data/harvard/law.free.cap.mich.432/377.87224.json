[MCL 281.1141; MSA 18.1287(141).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The Courts below erroneously assumed that by enacting \u00a7 192 of the Marine Safety Act, the Legislature not only intended to impose a regulatory duty on the operation of public beaches, but also intended to condition all authority to engage in that activity upon compliance with that duty. Nothing in \u00a7 192 or \u00a7 141 suggests that the Marine Safety Act\u2019s requirements modify the grant of authority found in 1917 PA 156. There is no evidence that the Legislature considered 1917 PA 156 or the other enabling statutes in the drafting or enactment of the Marine Safety Act. Indeed, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>1972 when the Legislature adopted \u00a7 192, the Marine Safety Act did not clearly apply to governmental agencies. \"Person\u201d was then defined as an \"individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association or other entity.\u201d 1972 PA 331; 1967 PA 303. It was not until 1974 that the Legislature amended the definition of \"person\u201d to include governmental entities. 1974 PA 153.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">We might nevertheless presume that after its 1974 amendment, the Legislature intended \u00a7 192 to modify the grant of authority provided in 1917 PA 156 if the two statutes are in pari materia. See 2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 51.05, pp 499-500. Statutes are in pari materia when they relate to the same person or thing, to the same class of persons or things, or have the same purpose or object. Id., \u00a7 51.03. The subject of both statutes is the operation of recreation facilities. However, the more important purposes or objectives of the two statutes are quite different.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> 1917 PA 156 is \"An act authorizing cities, villages, counties, townships, and school districts to operate systems of public recreation and playgrounds.\u201d The purpose of the Marine Safety Act is essentially to promote the safe use of Michigan\u2019s waters.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Because the two statutes are not in pari <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>materia, the rule of the specific and later act controlling the earlier and general act is inapplicable. See Sands, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 51.05.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">Attributing to the Legislature an intent to withdraw defendants\u2019 authority under these circumstances is not necessary to give effect to the language of \u00a7 192. Like other regulations,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> \u00a7\u00a7 141 and 192 set forth certain technical requirements. While noncompliance with these technical rules does not revoke the defendants\u2019 authority to operate a bathing beach, it does carry penalties. Under \u00a7 166 of the Marine Safety Act,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> violators of the proscription in \u00a7 192 may be charged with a misdemeanor. Section 141 provides that the Department of Natural Resources may order the removal of buoys placed without a permit and recover the costs of removal.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">The Legislature has granted authority to Jackson County and Summit Township to operate, equip, and maintain this beach as a recreational facility. By regulating how the swimming area must be marked, it did not withdraw that delegation of power.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Enabling acts, which grant authority in broad terms, must be distinguished from regulatory statutes. Improper performance of an activity authorized by law is, despite its impropriety, still \"authorized\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Ross </em>governmental function test. An agency\u2019s violation of a regulatory statute that requires the agency to perform an activity in a certain way cannot render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>activity ultra vires, as such a conclusion would swallow the <em>Ross </em>rule by merging the concepts of negligence and ultra vires. See <em>Smith v Dep\u2019t of Public Health, </em>428 Mich 540, 590, n 10, 611; 410 NW2d 749 (1987) (opinion of Brickley, J.) (the plaintiff alleged transfer contrary to applicable procedures).</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">In applying the \"governmental function\u201d test of the immunity statute, this Court must consider that statute\u2019s breadth. The statute extends immunity \"to <em>all </em>governmental agencies for <em>all </em>tort liability <em>whenever </em>they are engaged in the exercise or discharge of a governmental function.\u201d <em>Ross, </em>420 Mich 618 (emphasis in original). Nothing in the governmental immunity act suggests the Legislature intended to treat the failure to meet a \"condition precedent,\u201d such as obtaining a license or permit, any differently for immunity purposes than the failure to meet other sorts of regulatory duties.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> None of the act\u2019s four narrowly drawn exceptions single out activity conditioned on permits or licenses for special treatment. Under <em>Ross, </em>activities conducted in violation of regulations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>other than approval requirements are as \"unauthorized\u201d as activities conducted without proper approval. Licensing is nothing more than an intense form of regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">The Legislature did not intend that the term \"governmental function\u201d be interpreted so that immunity for activity authorized generally by statute should evaporate upon the failure to perform a regulatory condition contained in another statute. In sum, ultra vires activity is not activity that a governmental agency performs in an unauthorized manner.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, it is activity that the governmental agency lacks legal authority to perform in any manner. Defendants did not lack authority to operate<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> this beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b631-6\">Riley, C.J., and Boyle and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-11\"> Defendants also moved for summary judgment under the recreational use statute, MCL 300.201; MSA 13.1485.

Divining when a regulatory statute\u2019s requirement was intended to be a condition <em>precedent </em>to authority as opposed to a mere duty for performance may prove difficult and arbitrary. Under the dissent\u2019s analysis, in each case alleging a governmental agency\u2019s violation of a statutory duty, the Court must decide whether a given statute\u2019s phrasing requires that the duty be met <em>before </em>authority to perform that activity arises or whether the statute\u2019s language merely regulates <em>how </em>the already authorized activity is to be performed. If a court determines that the agency\u2019s authority is conditioned by statute on the prior performance of a duty, ruling on the immunity issue would first require fact finding concerning whether or not the duty was performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">The public acts are replete with regulatory statutes that employ conditional language potentially subject to the dissent\u2019s analysis. Even if the dissent\u2019s analysis is limited to approval, permit, or license requirements, one missed or mistaken step in obtaining approval for an otherwise authorized activity would subject governmental agencies to suit for any injury arising from the activity so conditioned, no matter how remote the injury is from the approval requirement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> Although a governmental agency may not be held liable for negligently performing an authorized activity in a manner prohibited by statute, under the 1986 amendments, a governmental agent may be individually liable if the agent\u2019s conduct amounts to gross negligence and is a proximate cause of the iryury or damage.

We find it necessary to dissent from the majority\u2019s finding that the unmistakable language of \u00a7 192, which commands the defendant to \"not knowingly permit a person to bathe or swim . . . unless buoys are established in accordance with section 141,\u201d MCL 281.1192(1); MSA 18.1287(192)(1), is not a denial of authorization to carry on such activity absent compliance with \u00a7 141.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">If we meant what we said in <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567; 363 NW2d 641 (1984), that unauthorized governmental activity is not immune, and if the Legislature meant what it said in \u00a7 192, that the operator should not allow bathing or swimming unless \u00a7 141 is complied with, the conclusion that defendants have lost their immunity is unavoidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>Ross, supra, </em>p 620, we said that in order to qualify as a governmental function, and therefore to be vested with immunity, the governmental activity must be \"expressly or impliedly mandated or authorized by constitution, statute, or other law.\u201d In other words, a denial of authority is not required in order to negate immunity status; only an absence of authority need be shown. It is therefore all the more remarkable that in this instance, when the Legislature has in such an unambiguous manner prohibited the activity in question, the majority would strive so mightily to conclude that because prohibition is conditional and because it has a regulatory purpose it is not a denial of authority. The majority simply refuses to accept that the Legislature intended what it said and to accept the consequences under <em>Ross.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-6\">The Courts below erroneously assumed that by enacting \u00a7 192 of the Marine Safety Act, the Legislature not only intended to impose a regulatory duty on the operation of public beaches, but also intended to condition all authority to engage in that activity upon compliance with that duty. Nothing in \u00a7 192 or \u00a7 141 suggests that the Marine Safety Act\u2019s requirements modify the grant of authority found in 1917 PA 156 [the general authority to operate recreational facilities]. <em>[Ante, </em>p 383.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>\"Nothing,\u201d that is, except the words of the statute. The majority further states, \"There is no evidence that the Legislature considered 1917 PA 156 or the other enabling statutes in the drafting or enactment of the Marine Safety Act.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p 383.) What possible reason could there be for the Legislature to consider the general enabling legislation that implies the authority to operate a beach when it decides to prohibit the operation of a beach as it has done, and to the extent it has done it, in the Marine Safety Act? Section 192 certainly suggests that the Legislature knew that there were beaches that were being lawfully operated; otherwise, why would it prohibit such operation under the conditions provided for in the act?</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">The majority then concludes that the general enabling statute and the Marine Safety Act are not in pari materia. \"[T]he rule of the specific and later act controlling the earlier and general act is inapplicable.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p 385.)</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">This established rule could, of course, be overlooked if there were ambiguity or doubt about what the Legislature intended in adopting \u00a7 192. There is no such ambiguity or such doubt here about the unmistakably clear language of \u00a7 192. The majority, try as it might, cannot convincingly say that a statute that states that the defendants \"shall not knowingly permit a person to bathe or swim\u201d does not interfere with authority to permit a person to bathe or swim from a bathing beach. This rule of construction, found \"inapplicable\u201d by the majority, embodies the sound recognition that it is often necessary for additional legislation to take into account the specific nature of the subject matter being addressed. While broad municipal authority existed to operate parks, the Legislature\u2019s preference for uniform statewide marking and safety standards relating to water activities is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>reflected in the narrower Marine Safety Act. We thus agree with the plaintiff\u2019s observation that authorization \"to engage in marine activities is addressed and restricted in the narrower statute in a way which could not be done in a broad statute.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Part and parcel of the majority\u2019s view is the ironic notion that in <em>Ross, </em>which embodies a monumental effort to <em>clarify </em>the then-confused state of the law regarding the meaning of \"governmental function,\u201d we employed the \"authority\u201d concept as a mere term of art whose vague legal meaning required exploration in future cases rather than as a simple, unambiguous term whose everyday meaning is readily understood. We can only conclude that the result of today\u2019s decision interprets this \"term of art\u201d to provide that activities for which authority is partially, temporarily, or conditionally denied, will still enjoy immunity if it can be shown that authority is intended to be restored upon meeting the temporal or conditional requirements specified in the denial of authority. The majority applies this gloss to <em>Ross </em>without any suggestion as to why it is necessary to distinguish between the two kinds of ultra vires activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">Only in conclusory fashion does the majority say, \"Enabling acts, which grant authority in broad terms, must be distinguished from regulatory statutes.\u201d <em>(Ante, </em>p 385.) The majority supports this conclusion with an obviously accurate statement, but one which does not describe what the Legislature did in this instance.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-7\">Improper performance of an activity authorized by law is, despite its impropriety, still \"authorized\u201d within the meaning of the <em>Ross </em>governmental function test. An agency\u2019s violation of a regulatory statute that requires the agency to perform <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>an activity in a certain way cannot render the activity ultra vires, as such a conclusion would swallow the <em>Boss </em>rule by merging the concepts of negligence and ultra vires. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 385-386.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">Of course there is no reason why noncompliance with a regulatory statute would necessarily deprive a governmental entity of the authority to engage in the activity. What the majority avoids, however, is the fact that on this occasion the Legislature chose not just to mandate compliance with \u00a7 192, not just to provide penalties for failing to observe it, but also to prohibit absolutely the carrying on of the activity absent compliance with the statute. There is simply no reason to \"merg[e] the concepts of negligence and ultra vires.\u201d There is only a need to read the obvious meaning of this statute in which the Legislature clearly intended to give the operators of public beaches an opportunity to choose between complying with the Marine Safety Act or interrupting the operation of the beach.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">Finally, the majority states in a footnote <em>(ante, </em>p 386, n 10):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b635-6\">The public acts are replete with regulatory statutes that employ conditional language potentially subject to the dissent\u2019s analysis. Even if the dissent\u2019s analysis is limited to approval, permit, or license requirements, one missed or mistaken step in obtaining approval for an otherwise authorized activity would subject governmental agencies to suit for any injury arising from the activity so conditioned, no matter how remote the injury is from the approval requirement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">This is the first suggestion, either in <em>Ross </em>or since <em>Ross, </em>that the rule that unauthorized activity does not amount to a governmental function was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>based on the assumption that absence of authority would not occur often, that liability should be limited to the purpose of the absence of authority rather than to the extent of the unauthorized activity, or that authority to engage in an activity should not be denied if the statute affecting the invocation of authority contains conditions which make compliance difficult.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">We have found no authority, nor can we envision any rationale, which would prevent the Legislature from conditioning the right to engage in a given activity on obtaining and complying with a regulatory permit. As we stated in <em>Ross, </em>authorization to engage in a given activity may be derived from the constitution or law; it is indisputable that authority given by statute can be taken away by statute. We therefore agree with the Court of Appeals that the conceded failure of the defendants to satisfy the conditions precedent embodied in \u00a7\u00a7 141 and 192 rendered the operation of the swimming beach an unauthorized governmental activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">While it is not necessary for us to base our decision on other considerations, we note that even if \u00a7 192 did not contain language of prohibition, the mere fact that the Legislature has in effect required a permit to be obtained before a swimming area may be opened to the public supports the same conclusion. It is undeniable that the Legislature enjoys plenary power to control the existence and extent of municipal powers. The well-settled, general rule of the legislative prerogative has been neatly summarized by the United States Supreme Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">A municipality is merely a department of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>State, and the <em>State may withhold, grant or withdraw </em>powers and privileges as it sees fit. However great or small its sphere of action, it remains the creature of the State exercising and holding powers and privileges subject to the sovereign will. <em>[City of Trenton v New Jersey, </em>262 US 182, 187; 43 S Ct 534; 67 L Ed 937 (1923).

MCL 24.205; MSA 3.560(105). \"A license\u2019 is permission by competent authority to do an act which, without such permission, would be illegal.\u201d <em>Westland Convalescent Center v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>414 Mich 247, 272; 324 NW2d 851 (1982) (citations omitted).

Focusing our attention, as we must, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>on the latter, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the act\u2019s statutory scheme expressly withdraws the previous, implied grant of authority to operate a swimming facility contained in MCL 123.51; MSA 5.2421. Thus, we conclude that the activity involved (the operation of a swimming area) was not authorized and, therefore, that liability for the alleged tort arising out of the activity (the drowning of the decedent resulting from the failure to warn him adequately of dangerous conditions in the lake) is not barred by governmental immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b638-6\">In view of the decision of the majority to consider the operation of the beach to be a governmental function, it is not necessary for us to address the question of the liability of the county defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">We would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b638-8\">Levin and Archer, JJ., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b637-7\"> See also <em>Detroit v AASER &amp; MCE of A, </em>332 Mich 237, 253; 51 NW2d 228 (1952) (\"The city of Detroit is merely 1 of the State\u2019s governmental agencies; and, subject to constitutional provisions, the State may limit or restrict the powers of such governmental agencies\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
