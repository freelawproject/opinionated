Section 3109(1) does not deprive an injured person, who may be eligible to obtain service in kind in a military hospital, of such choice of medical service providers.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-6\">The purpose of \u00a7 3109(1) is to eliminate duplicative benefits provided or required to be provided under federal or state law and thereby reduce the cost of no-fault automobile insurance. Because of differences in quality and service, medical service provided in kind by a governmental source may not be duplicative of medical service obtainable in the private sector with the no-fault medical expense benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b887-8\">William Morgan was injured in an automobile accident on his way to National Guard training. Citizens is the no-fault insurer. Morgan\u2019s initial medical expenses were paid by the federal govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>ment because he was on military service when the accident occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-4\">Nine months after the accident, Morgan experienced pain, sought treatment at a nonmilitary hospital, and was advised to undergo surgery for a ruptured disc. He did so, and incurred medical expense exceeding $10,000. Morgan sought payment of this expense by Citizens. Citizens refused and Morgan commenced this action. During the pendency of this litigation, he submitted bills for this expense to the National Guard, which denied payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-5\">The circuit judge granted Citizens\u2019 motion for summary disposition on the basis of \u00a7 3109(1) of the no-fault act which requires that benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of the federal government be subtracted from the benefits otherwise payable by the no-fault insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-6\">The judge declared that Morgan did not have the option under the act of obtaining nonemergency medical care in a nonmilitary hospital and seeking payment from a no-fault insurer when the federal government is required by law to provide the medical service at a military hospital. He also said that Morgan failed to show that he used reasonable efforts to obtain repayment from the federal government of the expense he had incurred at a nonmilitary hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b888-7\">The Court of Appeals in affirming observed that in <em>Crowley v DAIIE, </em>428 Mich 270; 407 NW2d 372 (1987), this Court declared that amounts paid by the federal government for medical care provided a member of the armed forces pursuant to 10 USC 1071 is a benefit provided under the laws of the federal government required under \u00a7 3109(1) to be subtracted from no-fault benefits otherwise pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>able to the injured person.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court also noted <em>Perez v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>418 Mich 634; 344 NW2d 773 (1984), where this Court ruled that benefits required to be paid to a worker injured in a motor vehicle accident as workers\u2019 compensation, but which will not be paid because the employer did not have workers\u2019 compensation coverage, are not required under \u00a7 3109(1)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to be subtracted from no-fault work-loss benefits. The Court of Appeals said that in <em>Perez </em>the workers\u2019 compensation benefits \"were unavailable to the plaintiffs.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also found significant this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Gregory v Transamerica Ins Co, </em>425 Mich 625, 634-636; 391 NW2d 312 (1986), where the Court held that the workers\u2019 compensation disability benefits payable for the full period of disability rather than the lesser amount paid in redemption of the insurer\u2019s liability to pay such benefits should be subtracted from the amount of the no-fault benefits payable to a worker injured in an automobile accident during the course of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b889-4\">The Court of Appeals interpreted the decisions of this Court as \"indicating that a no-fault insurer may offset primary insurance benefits except when injured persons fail to receive benefits through no fault of their own.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court said that Morgan might have been entitled to medical benefits provided by the military if he had received treatment at a military hospital. He did not have a choice of having nonemergency surgery performed at a nonmilitary hospital and seeking payment by the no-fault insurer. The Court of Appeals declared that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>to allow recovery from Citizens \"would defeat the purpose of the setoff provision by allowing plaintiff to choose which insurance would pay for his medical treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b890-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b890-7\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that Morgan did not have the option under the no-fault act of choosing \"which insurance would\u201d pay his medical expense. If federal law obliged the federal government to pay or reimburse Morgan for the expense of his medical treatment in a nonmilitary hospital, Citizens was not, by reason of \u00a7 3109(1), obliged to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-8\">We do not agree, however, with the Court of Appeals or the circuit judge that Morgan was precluded from seeking payment of expense incurred in a nonmilitary hospital simply because he could have had the surgical procedure performed in a military hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b890-9\">The act speaks of benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government, and states that such benefits shall be subtracted from the benefits otherwise payable for the injury.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The benefits required to be subtracted are generally dollar amounts. When \u00a7 3109(1) has heretofore been invoked, the benefits sought to be deducted generally were dollar benefits.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Section 3109(1) requires the subtraction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>governmental dollar benefits from the dollar amount of no-fault benefits\u2014governmental benefit dollars from no-fault insurer dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-4\">A person injured in an automobile accident is not required under \u00a73109(1) to avail himself of whatever medical service in kind a governmental source may provide.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Governmental medical service may not be comparable in quality and service with the doctor or hospital service that the injured person purchased or may be able to purchase with the no-fault dollar. Hospitals and doctors are not fungible. There are good hospitals and some that are not, good doctors and some that are not. The Legislature did not intend that however legitimate the injured person\u2019s concern regarding the quality of the governmental service in kind\u2014even if the medicine practiced at the hospital or the doctor is questionable, debatable, or notoriously bad\u2014it is nevertheless a benefit as a matter of law within the meaning of \u00a7 3109(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-5\">The no-fault act preserves to injured persons a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>reasonable choice of hospitals and physicians although this may add to the premium cost of no-fault insurance. The no-fault insurer cannot, in the name of reducing the premium cost, require an injured person to obtain medical service from a particular provider.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b892-6\">Section 3109(1) does not mandate the offset of all governmentally provided benefits, only duplicative benefits:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b892-7\">The history of \u00a7 3109(1) indicates that the Legislature\u2019s intent was to require a set-off of those government benefits that <em>duplicated </em>the no-fault benefits payable because of the accident and <em>thereby </em>reduce or contain the cost of basic insurance. <em>[O\u2019Donnell v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>404 Mich 524, 544; 273 NW2d 829 (1979). Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b892-8\">It is by the offsetting of duplicative benefits that \u00a7 3109(1) \"thereby reduce[s] or contain[s] the cost of basic insurance.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is not within the purpose of \u00a7 3109(1) to require the offset of governmental benefits that are not duplicative.</p>\n<p id=\"b892-9\">A surgical procedure performed in a military hospital may not, because of differences in quality and service, be duplicative of the medical service that an injured person could obtain and pay for with the no-fault medical expense benefit through the exercise of the choice in medical service providers preserved to injured persons under the no-fault act._</p>\n<p id=\"ASq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b893-3\">Citizens asserts alternatively that Morgan might have obtained payment by the federal government of the cost of the medical services had he applied formally for such payment. Citizens filed with its motion for summary disposition the affidavit of a captain stating that he was familiar with Morgan\u2019s claim for medical expenses allegedly resulting from the automobile accident; that at the time of the alleged injury Morgan was in the line of duty, thereby entitling him to payment of medical expenses if he complied with all applicable Army and National Guard regulations; and that his claim for medical expenses was denied by the National Guard for two reasons: (a) nonemergency medical care in a civilian medical facility is not authorized without written or verbal authorization from the chief, National Guard Bureau, or his designee, and such authorization had not been asked for or granted; (b) medical documentation indicating that the automobile accident was the cause of the herniated disc had not been furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\">Morgan filed an affidavit stating that he was admitted to a hospital nine months after the automobile accident and was told he needed an operation to remove a disc in his neck, that he spoke to a staff sergeant about the operation who called back later stating that the military would not pay for the operation because it was elective surgery. There was attached to the affidavit a communication from a colonel in an Army personnel center located in Virginia repeating that the request for medical claim payment was denied for the reasons stated in the affidavit of the captain filed by Citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">It appears that Morgan had been advised to have an operation by a physician and desired to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>so. It is unclear what would have been involved in formally requesting payment by the federal government of the medical expense incurred in having the operation performed by the surgeon Morgan chose in the nonmilitary hospital he chose. It is unclear what delays would have occurred or whether the request would have been granted. The Legislature did not impose under \u00a7 3109(1) on injured persons the burden of obtaining authorization from a governmental source before proceeding with medical treatment that the injured person has been advised by his physician is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The injured person is, however, obliged to submit a request for payment from the governmental source and provide whatever documentation may reasonably be required. The no-fault insurer has the burden of establishing that had he done so benefits would have been paid or payable.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-5\">Reversed and remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b894-6\">Cavanagh, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b887-9\"> Benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from the personal protection insurance benefits otherwise payable for the injury.

The central issue in this case is whether the term \"benefits provided or required to be provided under the laws of any state or the federal government shall be subtracted from the [no-fault insurance benefits]\u201d under \u00a7 3109(1)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> of the no-fault act only applies to dollar amount benefits, or whether it also applies to services provided in kind by the government in its own hospitals.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>_</p>\n<p id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>The lead opinion provides a somewhat contingent response to this question by stating that the purpose of \u00a7 3109(1) is to \"eliminate duplicative benefits\u201d and that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-5\">[b]ecause of differences in quality and service, medical service provided in kind by a governmental source <em>may </em>not be duplicative of medical service obtainable in the private sector with the no-fault medical expense benefit. [Emphasis supplied. <em>Ante, </em>p 643.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">The majority adds to this the rationale that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-7\">[t]he benefits required to be subtracted are generally dollar amounts. When \u00a7 3109(1) has heretofore been invoked, the benefits sought to be deducted generally were dollar benefits. Section 3109(1) requires the subtraction of governmental dollar benefits from the dollar amount of no-fault benefits\u2014 governmental benefit dollars from no-fault insurer dollars. <em>[Ante, </em>pp 646-647.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-8\">In response, I find no support, in law or in logic, that a given surgical procedure in a military hospital is not \"duplicative\u201d of a similar procedure in any other medical facility in terms of the overall purpose of the no-fault act.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">It is certainly true that in a military hospital, as in any medical facility, a given service may be of inferior quality, and that by not having a choice under a given government benefit program an insured may at least lose the opportunity to exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>cise discretion in an attempt to affect the quality of the chosen services. Also, although it is not the goal of the act that \"the no-fault act preserves to the injured person a choice of medical service providers,\u201d the act certainly does in its effect, in most cases, leave to the insured the choice of where to take advantage of medical services. Unlike the United States military, no-fault insurers are not in the business of owning and operating large-scale medical facilities. Of course, all of this sidesteps the central issue here whether or not \u00a7 3109(1) has a different effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">Nowhere in the no-fault act is it provided that it is the goal, purpose, or preference of the act to preserve in all instances a choice of where medical services should be provided. The majority, in a conclusory manner, merely states that \"[sjection 3109(1) does not deprive an injured person, who may be eligible to obtain service in kind in a military hospital, of such choice of medical service providers.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 643. This statement begs the very question we must answer in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">I would hold that the benefits in kind in this case are governmental benefits under \u00a7 3109(1) \"provided or required to be provided\u201d and, accordingly, can be subtracted from the defendant insurer\u2019s liability under the policy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b896-7\">The conclusion of the majority suggests that the Legislature, in using the words \"benefits . . . under the laws of . . . the federal government\u201d was unaware of the major sources of governmental benefits, and military hospitals in particular, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>suggestion I think is implausible. To the contrary, there can be no doubt that the Legislature intended to avoid any evasion of the opportunity to have governmental benefits fully taken advantage of to effectuate a setoff for the no-fault insurer wherever such alternate benefits existed. The best evidence of that is the language of \u00a73109(1) that mandates that not only \"benefits provided\u201d but that \"benefits . . . required to be provided\u201d also can be taken advantage of by the no-fault insurer. We have often in other settings discussed the legislative intent of the words \"required to be provided,\u201d but we have probably never had a better example of its purpose. See <em>Perez v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>418 Mich 634; 344 NW2d 773 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-4\">It is exactly in this setting where the \"benefits provided\u201d have been declined by the insured that the additional words \"required to be provided\u201d make the difference between the insured being able to frustrate the purpose of \u00a7 3109(1) by bypassing the \"benefits provided\u201d in kind and requiring the no-fault insurer to pay for the costs the insured incurred which could have been provided under federal law. By including the term \"required to be provided,\u201d the Legislature has stated that whether the benefits are taken or not, the fact that they are required to be provided is sufficient to allow the no-fault insurer to receive credit for the benefits which were available to the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-5\">Furthermore, the fact that not only benefits that are provided can be \"subtracted\u201d from the no-fault benefits, but that benefits that are not provided or received but \"required to be provided\u201d can be subtracted from the no-fault insurer\u2019s benefits, forces the conclusion that \"subtracted\u201d is not intended to be confined to the interpretation offered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>by the majority. See <em>ante, </em>pp 646-647. It is obvious that \"subtracted\u201d means that the no-fault insurer should not have to pay for what the insured did receive or could have received. The majority interpretation that \"subtraction\u201d in \u00a7 3109(1) is in this situation confined to dollar amounts would render the words \"or required to be provided\u201d a nullity because the value of benefits not received, but that could have been received, could not be set off.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b898-5\">When the \"benefits provided . . . under the laws of any state or the federal government\u201d are provided in kind, rather than as reimbursement for expenses incurred, then under \u00a73109(1) no \"subtraction\u201d is required because no costs have been incurred. Similarly, no costs having been incurred, the no-fault carrier is also free of obligation to reimburse. However, to allow the insured to decline benefits in kind and to incur the costs of treatment outside the \"benefits provided or required to be provided by law,\u201d and then not to allow the subtraction of those benefits would, in my judgment, be a clear frustration of the specific intent of \u00a7 3109(1) and the overall goal of the no-fault automobile insurance scheme. It is the intent of \u00a7 3109(1) that benefits provided by law be taken advantage of to lessen the cost of no-fault insurance. This effort to lower the costs of no-fault insurance is one of the stated goals of the no-fault insurance act generally. <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554; 267 NW2d 72 (1978); <em>LeBlanc v State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins Co, </em>410 Mich 173; 301 NW2d 775 (1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b899-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>Simply stated, it would defeat the obvious intention of the Legislature to suggest that the no-fault insurer can take advantage of money received by the insured from government benefits but not service provided in kind by the government in place of money.</p>\n<judges id=\"b899-4\">Riley, C.J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b899-5\">Boyle, J., concurred only in the result reached by Brickley, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\"> MCL 500.3109(1); MSA 24.13109(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-9\"> I assume, as does the majority, that the plaintiff could have availed himself of the services of a military hospital, but that he declined <em>to </em>do <em>so. </em>Because I disagree with the majority that he could decline such services in a military hospital and collect the costs of those same services in a nonmilitary hospital from his insurer, I do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>not find it necessary to determine whether the insured plaintiff could have collected for his services in a nonmilitary hospital from the federal government.
