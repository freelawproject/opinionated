He argues that the sentence is unlawful. We agree, and we therefore remand this case to the trial court for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b557-8\">In February of 1985, the defendant killed a woman with whom he had been romantically involved. The defendant was prosecuted for first-degree murder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and for possession of a firearm during the commission of this felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">Three witnesses testified at the defendant\u2019s trial. With minor variations, they testified as follows. The victim and her current flane\u00e9 were home when the defendant and the defendant\u2019s sister arrived.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The defendant sought to speak with the victim. After a time, the defendant produced a pistol from a briefcase and took the victim to another room, out of the witnesses\u2019 sight. The victim was heard pleading not to be killed and then one or two shots were heard. The victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 went to get help, and the defendant\u2019s sister fled. On his return, the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 found her \"laying [sic] in the kitchen [with] quite a few stab wounds to the chest.\u201d The defense introduced no proofs.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">The jury found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder and felony-firearm. As noted by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>sentencing judge, the presentence report in this case indicated that the defendant had a history of assaultive crime and that the defendant had been harassing the victim, and perhaps planning to harm her, for some time. The defendant did not challenge the accuracy of the presentence report.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">The sentencing judge imposed a term of from 100 to 200 years in prison for second-degree murder.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In doing so, he clearly stated that the purpose of the 100- to 200-year sentence was to foreclose parole:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">Because the appellate courts of our state have said that in point of fact a life sentence for this sort of crime allows him to be reviewed in ten years, I intend to utilize numbers with the belief that the law requires that the numbers be served before you become eligible for review.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and sentence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court said that the defendant\u2019s 100- to 200-year sentence was not cruel or unusual punishment<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and that the sentencing judge had not abused his discretion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-10\">A sentence does not constitute cruel and unusual punishment when it is within statutory limits and does not shock the judicial conscience. <em>People </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>v <em>Curry, </em>142 Mich App 724, 733; 371 NW2d 854 (1985); <em>People v Knoll, </em>137 Mich App 701, 704; 358 NW2d 926 (1984).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-4\">Here, the sentence was within the \"life or any term of years\u201d sentence authorized by statute, MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549. Moreover, we believe that, contrary to defendant\u2019s argument, the fact that parole will not be available prior to defendant\u2019s life span does not make the sentence erroneously harsher than a life sentence. <em>People v Rodgers, </em>30 Mich App 582, 584-585; 186 NW2d 840 [1971]; <em>People </em>v <em>Charles Williams, </em>19 Mich App 544, 546; 172 NW2d 897 (1971), lv den 386 Mich 783 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-5\">This case is similar to <em>People v Martinez, </em>147 Mich App 94; 382 NW2d 741 (1985), lv den 425 Mich 873 (1986), cited by plaintiff. In <em>Martinez, </em>defendant was convicted of manslaughter and habitual offender, fourth offense, and was sentenced to a prison term of 100 to 150 years. Defendant claimed, inter alia, that the sentence was an abuse of discretion because it was longer than his life expectancy and designed to prevent him from qualifying for parole. This Court rejected these arguments, concluding:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b559-6\">\"First, it was evident that the sentence imposed was fashioned to insure that Mr. Martinez would never be a free man again. The trial judge quite pointedly stated that he intended 'to design a sentence that will mean that Mr. Martinez will not be released from prison.\u2019 Under the statute, MCL 769.12; MSA 28.1084, the trial court had the authority to sentence Mr. Martinez for life or for any lesser term. The trial judge obviously selected the long term of years instead of life in hopes that the 'lifer law,\u2019 MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4), would not apply so as to make Mr. Martinez eligible for parole consideration after serving ten calendar years. See <em>People v Johnson, </em>421 Mich 494; 364 NW2d 654 (1984). We are persuaded that the trial court did not err in imposing a lengthy term of years where such a sentence is expressly authorized by statute and warranted by a dispas<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>sionate consideration of legitimate sentencing criteria and objectives.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-6\">\"The second aspect of Mr. Martinez\u2019s argument is that, in effect, the trial court imposed a sentence which will exceed his life expectancy. Obviously, that was the trial court\u2019s intent and there is no showing that such a sentence was not justified. In fact, there is no claim that this sentence should shock this Court\u2019s conscience nor could there be. Mr. Martinez\u2019s extensive prior record fully supported the imposition of the sentence in this case.\u201d 147 Mich App at 95-96.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-7\">Similarly, the trial court here specified that it wanted to impose a sentence that would keep defendant in prison for the rest of his life, while preventing the possibility that defendant would be paroled in 10 years under the \"lifer law.\u201d The trial court also considered the \"heinous and shocking\u201d nature of the crime, defendant\u2019s prior criminal record, deterrence and the needs to protect society and'to punish defendant. These factors were all legitimate and, considering these factors, the sentence does not shock the conscience of this Court. The mere fact that the sentence exceed\u2019s [sic] defendant\u2019s life expectancy does not change this result. <em>People v Martinez, supra; People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523; 339 NW2d 440 (1983). See also <em>People v Crawford, </em>144 Mich App 86 [88]-90; 372 NW2d 688 (1985). Cf. <em>People v Hurst, </em>[155] Mich App [573; 400 NW2d 685 (1986)].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">We granted leave to appeal to consider several aspects of the sentence imposed in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>People v Timothy Moore, </em>429 Mich 858 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"A_4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\">A. THE PENALTY FOR SECOND-DEGREE MURDER</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">Employing language used in connection with a number of other offenses,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the Legislature has established that second-degree murder \"shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for life, or any term of years, in the discretion of the court trying the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">On its face, the stated penalty for second-degree murder (\"life, or any term of years\u201d) indicates that a term of years is a lesser penalty than life.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This is well explained in <em>People v Oscar Moore, </em>164 Mich App 378, 389-391; 417 NW2d 508 (1987).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In that case, the defendant had been given a 100- to 300-year term of imprisonment following a conviction of armed robbery. The Court of Appeals built upon the majority opinion in <em>People v Johnson, </em>421 Mich 494; 364 NW2d 654 (1984), to reach the conclusion that \"any term of years\u201d must mean a period shorter than life.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">We believe that [certain earlier decisions] mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>construe the phrase \"any term of years.\u201d In <em>People v Blythe, </em>417 Mich 430; 339 NW2d 399 (1983), the Supreme Court considered whether the phrase \"for any term of years\u201d in the armed robbery statute required imposition of a mandatory minimum sentence. In determining that it did not, the Supreme Court concluded that the phrase referred to the maximum sentence to be imposed. 417 Mich at 434. In <em>Johnson, supra </em>at 497-498, the Supreme Court wrote:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-5\">\"The difference between a life sentence and an indeterminate sentence having a minimum and maximum term has been recognized by this Court since our decision in <em>People v Vitali, </em>156 Mich 370; 120 NW 1003 (1909). We observed in <em>Vitali </em>that if a life sentence is imposed there can be no minimum term.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-6\">\"Accordingly, when a statute authorizes the imposition of a sentence of 'life or any term of years\u2019 it allows the imposition of a fixed sentence\u2014life\u2014 or an indeterminate sentence\u2014any number of years. We observed in <em>People v Blythe, </em>417 Mich 430, 434-435; 339 NW2d 399 (1983), that the Legislature viewed the phrase 'life or any term of years\u2019 as descriptive of the maximum sentence only. The sentence concepts 'life\u2019 and 'any term of years\u2019 are mutually exclusive and a sentencing judge may (in the appropriate case) opt for either but not both.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-7\">If \"life\u201d and \"any term of years\u201d are mutually exclusive concepts, the Court\u2019s statement that the latter allows imposition of \"any number of years\u201d must mean \"any number of years <em>less than </em>life.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-8\">By definition, a person cannot serve a prison sentence lasting longer than that person\u2019s life. A life term is, as a matter of law, a greater penalty than a term of years. <em>People v McNeal, </em>156 Mich App 379, 381; 401 NW2d 650 (1986); <em>People v Lindsey, </em>139 Mich App 412, 415; 362 NW2d 304 (1984). Therefore, it is meaningless for a person to receive a sentence longer than life. The phrase \"any term of years\u201d also cannot mean a time equal to life, as it would then be surplusage for the Legislature to have also provided for life sentences in the same statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>All that remains, then, is a term of years less than life. <em>[Oscar Moore, </em>164 Mich App 389-391. Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Thus there are two types of sentences that a judge may impose upon a person convicted of second-degree murder\u2014a sentence of life in prison, or a sentence of a term of years less than life.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">B. THE INDETERMINATE SENTENCING ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">If the judge chooses to impose a term of years less than life, the sentence must be an indeterminate sentence, as stated in the indeterminate sentencing act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-9\">In all cases where the maximum sentence in the discretion of the court may be imprisonment for life or any number or term of years, the court may impose a sentence for life or may impose a sentence for any term of years. If the sentence imposed by the court is for any term of years, the court shall fix both the minimum and the maximum of that sentence in terms of years or fraction thereof, and sentences so imposed shall be considered indeterminate sentences. The court shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>impose a sentence in which the maximum penalty is life imprisonment with a minimum for a term of years included in the same sentence. [MCL 769.9(2); MSA 28.1081(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-6\">In <em>People v Tanner, 387 </em>Mich 683, 689-690; 199 NW2d 202 (1972), this Court found that a sentence is \"not indeterminate\u201d if there is not a significant interval between the minimum and the maximum sentence. Tanner had pled guilty of manslaughter and had been sentenced to a term of from 179 to 180 months in prison. This Court found such a sentence not to be lawful, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">Though the question comes to us couched in terms of abuse of discretion, it clearly involves, and we address ourselves to, the purely legal proposition of whether defendant\u2019s sentence is in fact \"indeterminate\u201d as contemplated by the provisions of MCL 769.8 and 769.9; MSA 28.1080 and 28.1081.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">Having before us a plethora of cases involving sentences with a period of but 30 days between minimum and maximum, we are constrained to observe that though technically providing some period, though brief, within which the correction authorities may exercise the discretion vested in them by the Legislature, such sentences fail to comply with the clear intent and purpose of the indeterminate sentence act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-9\">Thus, turning to the precise proposition involved, we are convinced that 30 days is not a sufficient interval of time to guarantee that the corrections authorities will be able to exercise their jurisdiction or judgment with any practicality. The net effect of such severe judicial limitation on indeterminate sentencing is to frustrate the intended effect of indeterminate sentencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-10\">Convinced as we are, that a sentence with too <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>short an interval between minimum and maximum is not indeterminate, we hold that any sentence which provides for a minimum exceeding two-thirds of the maximum is improper as failing to comply with the indeterminate sentence act. <em>[Id. </em>at 688, 689-690.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">In the present case, the entire interval between the defendant\u2019s minimum sentence and his maximum sentence is certain to occur after his death. Even more clearly than <em>Tanner, </em>we therefore have before us a sentence that is not indeterminate.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Legislature has authorized only that a person convicted of second-degree murder be sentenced to life in prison or to an <em>indeterminate </em>term of years. The Legislature has not authorized that such a person be, in effect, sentenced to a flat term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-7\">C. ELIGIBILITY FOR PAROLE</p>\n<p id=\"b565-8\">As we have noted, the sentencing judge in this case clearly stated that the purpose of the 100- to 200-year sentence imposed upon this defendant was to foreclose the possibility of parole. The judge\u2019s concern was that, if he were to sentence the defendant to a life term, the defendant would be eligible for parole after ten years. This eligibility is stated in the so-called lifer law, MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The sentencing judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>instead sought to rely upon Proposal b<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and the accompanying legislation,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> which provide that a person convicted of an enumerated offense may not be paroled until the person has served the minimum term of imprisonment, less available disciplinary credits.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-4\">The Legislature has established a Parole Board<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> and has established procedures and eligibility criteria for granting paroles.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> With the exception of a person convicted of a major controlled substance offense, any person sentenced to a term of years falls eventually within the jurisdiction of the Parole Board after ten years and may be released on parole in accordance with the statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-5\">A prisoner under sentence for life or for a term of years, other than prisoners sentenced for life for murder in the first degree and prisoners sentenced for life or for a minimum term of imprisonment for a major controlled substance offense, who has served 10 calendar years of the sentence is subject to the jurisdiction of the parole board and may be released on parole by the parole board, subject to the following conditions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b566-6\">(b) A parole shall not be granted a prisoner so sentenced until after a public hearing held in the manner prescribed for pardons and commutations .... Notice of the public hearing shall be given to the sentencing judge or the judge\u2019s successor in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>office, and parole shall not be granted if the sentencing judge, or the judge\u2019s successor in office, files written objections to the granting of the parole within 30 days of receipt of the notice of hearing. The written objections shall be made part of the prisoner\u2019s file.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-5\">(d) A parole shall not be granted under this subsection in the case of a prisoner who is otherwise prohibited by law from parole consideration. In such cases, the interview procedures [for pardons and commutations] shall be followed. [MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b567-7\">The Legislature has stated that persons convicted of second-degree murder are to be given either a sentence of life in prison or a term of years. For the reasons explained above, a term of years is an indeterminate sentence less than life. The Legislature has provided that persons sentenced to life or to a term of years are eligible for parole consideration in ten years. The people of this state, in enacting Proposal b effectively modified the lifer law to provide that a person sentenced to a term of years for an offense listed in Proposal b would not become eligible for parole until the minimum term was served. Neither the Legislature nor the people, however, have authorized the imposition of a nonparolable term of years. There is no indication that either the Legislature or the people intended such a drastic change in sentencing law.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The Court of Appeals has well stated the law in <em>Oscar Moore, supra </em>at 386-387:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b567-9\">The Legislature has mandated life sentences for first-degree murder, MCL ,750.316; MSA 28.548, and certain major controlled substance offenses, MCL 333.7401(2)(a)(i) and 333.7403(2)(a)(i); MSA 14.15(7401)(2)(a)(i) and 14.15(7403)(2)(a)(i). The so-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>called \"lifer law\u201d excludes persons serving the mandatory life sentences for these crimes from the jurisdiction of the parole board. MCL 791.234(4); MSA 28.2304(4). See also MCL 333.7401(3); MSA 14.15(7401X3).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b568-5\">We are unable to locate any similar statutory authorization for a sentence of life without parole for an armed robbery conviction, however. While such may be a desirable public policy, it is up to the Legislature to authorize such a sentence. The Legislature is the source of a court\u2019s sentencing power. <em>People v [Roosevelt] Moore, </em>51 Mich App 48, 54; 214 NW2d 548 (1974). As we are unable to discern any legislative authorization for the result of defendant\u2019s sentence, we must conclude that the sentence given was not valid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">In considering the effect of the lifer law, we believe that the sentencing court has failed to appreciate fully MCL 791.234(4)(b); MSA 28.2304(4)(b), which gives the judge, or the judge\u2019s successor in office, a veto over parole. There is a great difference between a prisoner coming under the jurisdiction of the Parole Board, and a prisoner actually receiving a parole. See <em>People v Hurst (After Remand), </em>169 Mich App 160; 425 NW2d 752 (1988). The extreme measure employed in this case (an attempt to impose a nonparolable determinate sentence of a term of years) was simply unnecessary. The sentencing judge (and the judge\u2019s successor) have the lawful authority to preclude parole for a person sentenced to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b568-7\">D. SENTENCING DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b568-8\">In <em>People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523, 550; 339 NW2d 440 (1983), we held that an appellate court may \"review a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in sentencing.\u201d We went on to say that relief would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>be afforded only where \"the trial court, in imposing the sentence, abused its discretion to the extent that it shocks the conscience of the appellate court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b569-4\">In the present case, the defendant argues that the appellate conscience should be shocked by the length of the defendant\u2019s sentence. We are not shocked, and we do not find the effective length of this sentence (life imprisonment) to be an abuse of the trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-5\">We nevertheless believe that the sentencing judge abused his discretion in this case. Sentencing is an event of critical importance. A judge must enter, after careful consideration, a just order. Even when emotions understandably and properly are running high, the judge must discharge faithfully the difficult task of exercising sentencing discretion. The judge must give a sentence that fits the offense and the offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-6\">In this case, the sentencing judge has abdicated his discretion by entering an order that is impossible to obey. The defendant has committed a terrible crime and must serve a lawful sentence. Whether sentenced to serve life in prison or a term of years in prison, the defendant is obliged to obey the order of the sentencing judge and the subsequent dictates of the Parole Board. This defendant cannot serve a minimum sentence of 100 years in prison because he will die first. Neither can he serve a maximum sentence of 200 years in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b569-7\">This defendant has been sentenced to serve 200 years in prison. It is impossible for him to obey this order. It is as if he had been ordered to jump off the ground and not come back down. Such a sentence serves only to subject an already much <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>maligned system to further ridicule. The judge\u2019s outrage is understandable, but the awesome judicial power to enter judgments and orders must be employed with discretion. A judgment or order is not an appropriate case for an emotional or editorial statement. It is not an opportunity for a judge to display for the benefit of the press and the public how \"tough on crime\u201d the court might be. On remand, the trial court must enter an order that is possible to obey.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-6\">The sentence in this case is an abuse of sentencing discretion in one other regard. The lifer law clearly provides that parole for a person sentenced to life imprisonment is dependent, inter alia, upon the approval of the sentencing judge or the judge\u2019s successor. By entering a sentence of from 100 to 200 years in prison, the sentencing judge in this case has effectively sentenced the defendant to life imprisonment. However, the form of this life sentence forecloses not only this judge\u2019s own future exercise of discretion, but has foreclosed his successor in office from exercising the discretion that the Legislature clearly has provided in cases where a person convicted of second-degree murder is sentenced to life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">As recognized by the Legislature, it is appropriate at any time for the sentencing judge (or the judge\u2019s successor) to take the position that the court knows more about the person who has been sentenced to life imprisonment than does the Parole Board, and accordingly to exercise the power of veto over parole. It is an abuse of discretion, however, to enter an order on the day of sentencing that effectively forecloses all future exercise of such Legislatively provided discretion by either the Parole Board or the judge\u2019s successor. No one can see the future with such clarity.</p>\n<p id=\"Ayv\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>E. SEPARATION OF POWERS</p>\n<p id=\"b571-3\">Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 2 provides that the powers of one branch of government are not to be exercised by another:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b571-4\">The powers of government are divided into three branches; legislative, executive and judicial. No person exercising powers of one branch shall exercise powers properly belonging to another branch except as expressly provided in this constitution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">The head of the Executive Branch of government is the Governor,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> who has the exclusive power to grant reprieves, commutations, and pardons.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Department of Corrections lies within the Executive Branch,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and the Parole Board is placed within the department.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">This Court has made it clear that a defendant cannot come to the courts for a parole when the Parole Board is unwilling to act. <em>People v </em>Fox, 312 Mich 577; 20 NW2d 732; 168 ALR 703 (1945).

CRUEL OR UNUSUAL PUNISHMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b572-4\">The defendant argues that the sentence in this case amounts to cruel or unusual punishment, in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 16. Again, our resolution of the other issues renders it unnecessary to reach that constitutional question.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Having determined that the trial court has imposed a sentence that does not accord with the sentencing practices established by the Legislature, we must remand this case to the trial court for the imposition of a new sentence. To guide the trial court on remand, we offer additional direction regarding the nature of a lawful sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The defendant informs us that he was thirty-four when he committed this offense and when he was sentenced. He reports that the life expectancy of a person of his age, gender, and race is 34.5 years from the date of sentencing, and that he thus might expect to live until about the year 2020.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> He would like these facts considered in the imposition of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In <em>Oscar Moore, supra </em>at 392, the Court of Appeals held that an indeterminate sentence must \"be fashioned with consideration of a defendant\u2019s life expectancy at the time of sentencing as determined by the trial judge.\u201d The dissent, however, warned that if a term of years \"cannot equal or exceed a particular defendant\u2019s life expectancy, every judge will be an actuary, every attorney will be a physician, and every defendant will be at death\u2019s door on sentencing day.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 395.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>For the reasons stated earlier in this opinion, we hold that a \"term of years\u201d must be an indeterminate sentence less than life. It must be something that is reasonably possible for a defendant actually to serve.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">We decline, however, to adopt either a rigid cap on indeterminate sentences or a rule that a trial court must make a factual determination of a particular defendant\u2019s actual life expectancy. Otherwise, the trial court would not only find itself evaluating a defendant\u2019s actual state of health, but would find itself reviewing the life expectancies of demographic subgroups, family health histories, and behavioral risks of acquiring certain illnesses, such as cancer and heart disease.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Instead, we simply direct the trial court to fashion a sentence that a defendant in his mid- to late-thirties has a reasonable prospect of actually serving. The effect of the defendant\u2019s first sentence being life in prison, the trial court may, on remand, impose a life sentence or an indeterminate term of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">The defendant requests that we order a resentencing before a different judge. We see no reason to enter such an order in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">The defendant\u2019s conviction is affirmed. His sentence is vacated, and this case is remanded to the trial court for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b573-9\">Levin, Brickley, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-11\"> MCL 750.317; MSA 28.549.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b557-12\"> MCL 750.316; MSA 28.548.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b557-13\"> MCL 750.227b; MSA 28.424(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b557-14\"> The victim\u2019s present fianc\u00e9 and the defendant\u2019s sister were two of the witnesses at trial.

The statute provides that second-degree murder is punishable by imprisonment for life or any term of years. The issue is not whether the defendant can serve the sentence, but whether the Court can lawfully impose it. The conclusion follows \"with the force and simplicity of Aristotelian syllogism\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> that the sentence was authorized by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Having decided <em>People v Johnson, </em>421 Mich 494; 364 NW2d 654 (1984), which produced the anomalous result that a life sentence for a Proposal b offense may actually be for less than a term of years, the Court now concludes that a term of years must be less than life. The conclusion is founded on the unarticulated and impermissible premise that an inmate serving a life sentence will probably be paroled. <em>People v Fleming, </em>428 Mich 408; 410 NW2d 266 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b574-6\">More understandably, the motivating impulse of this opinion may well be a misguided attempt to mitigate the disparity between those serving life terms and those sentenced to lengthy indeterminate sentences. In fact, however, today\u2019s result runs counter to the philosophy of sentence reform that \"Neither justice nor the appearance of justice is served when similar offenders committing similar offenses receive dissimilar sentences, Michigan Sentencing Guidelines\u2014Statement of Purpose.\u201d The court now declares as a matter of law that an older offender must receive a different sentence than a younger offender who has committed a similar offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-7\">If the majority is offended by the sentence im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>posed, it ought to forthrightly say so under the \"shock the conscience\u201d standard of <em>People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523; 339 NW2d 440 (1983).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, the majority shifts responsibility to the Legislature for the result it wishes to achieve.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The motivating factor for this sentence was the trial judge\u2019s determination of how much time he thought the defendant should actually serve in prison.

The victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that at approximately five o\u2019clock a car pulled up in the driveway and that he recognized the person getting out of the car as the defendant. While the defendant\u2019s sister remained in the car, the defendant came to the porch, knocked on the door, and called out the victim\u2019s name. The defendant asked to speak to the victim, saying that he wanted some pictures and albums that belonged to him and stated that, \"I got my sister with me. I\u2019m not going to do anything.\u201d At that point the victim opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">The defendant asked the victim to step out on the front porch where she informed him she would pack up the albums immediately and went back into the house. The defendant then returned to the car, and his sister got out of the car and they both came into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">When the defendant and his sister entered the home, they remained in the living room, and when the victim came into the room, the defendant indicated he wished to speak to her in the back. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>The victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that he said no and that the defendant opened up the briefcase and produced a gun and stated, \"Oh yes. I\u2019m going to talk to her.\u201d The defendant then jumped off the couch and grabbed the victim\u2019s hand and pulled her into the bedroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Both the defendant\u2019s sister and the victim\u2019s fianc\u00e9 testified that they heard the victim plead, \"Please don\u2019t kill me.\u201d The defendant fired two shots and the victim screamed, \"Somebody help me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">Medical documentation revealed that the defendant stabbed the victim seven times, either with a knife or a screwdriver. The evidence technician assigned to the homicide case testified that it appeared the struggle originated in the bedroom, then went through the hallway into the living room area, finally ending in the kitchen. The living room walls, which were eleven feet apart had blood smears and droplets on both sides of the walls, as did the entrance to the bedroom, the bedroom itself, and the hallways.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-7\">After a three-day trial the jury found the defendant guilty of second-degree murder and felony-firearm. On October 31, 1985, the day of sentencing, the trial judge reviewed the evidence presented at trial and the information contained in the presentence report. According to the report, the defendant had intended to carry out this plan over a period of time. The defendant had threatened the victim a number of times, and she had tried changing her address on two occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The thirty-four-year-old defendant had a juvenile history that began at age fifteen, three prior felony convictions, and one misdemeanor conviction. The presentence report revealed the circumstance of defendant\u2019s prior armed robbery conviction which involved forcible entry into an apart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>ment and a robbery and rape of one of its occupants.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\">The judge noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">We know from the evidence and the testimony that at some given point the deceased must have been physically in a position where she was cowering down. At least the shot that was fired, was fired in the direction that it traveled in a downward fashion, grazing the scalp, I believe, and the hand, and then entering into the dresser drawer. We know that by the trail of blood from that bedroom throughout and into the kitchen that she was fleeing or trying to escape from Mr. Moore. And we know that Mr. Moore did in fact mutilate the deceased by stabbing her some seven times.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-6\">I don\u2019t know what any appellate court would need by way of recitation other than what I just stated, but a heinous crime of this nature deserves a substantial sentence in order to deter others and as straight out punishment in the hope that Mr. Moore will not be in a position to be in society to do it again in this life. Because the appellate courts of our state have said that in point of fact a life sentence for this sort of crime allows him to be reviewed in ten years, I intend to utilize numbers with the belief that the law requires that the numbers be served before you become eligible for review.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">The defendant was sentenced to a 100- to 200-year prison term, and, on appeal, the sentence was affirmed by the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">The defendant was sentenced pursuant to MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>769.9; MSA 28.1081, the relevant section of which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">In all cases where the maximum sentence in the discretion of the court may be imprisonment <em>for life or any number or term of years, </em>the court may impose a sentence for life or may impose a sentence for any term of years.

The court shall not impose a sentence in which the maximum penalty is fife imprisonment with a minimum for a term of years included in the same sentence. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">The majority states that \"[o]n its face, the stated penalty for second-degree murder ('life, or any term of years\u2019) indicates that a term of years is a lesser penalty than life.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 317.

The ordinary meaning then of \"any,\u201d used to describe \"term of years,\u201d simply indicates the obvious: the Legislature has not limited the judge as to the duration of the term of years.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The plain meaning of the phrase \"any term of years\u201d is a term of years without limitation as to duration.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">The lead opinion asserts that the use of the word \"or\u201d inserted between \"life\u201d and \"any term of years\u201d indicates alternatives that are mutually exclusive,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> concluding \"there are two types of sentences that a judge may impose upon a person convicted of second-degree murder\u2014a sentence of life in prison, or a sentence of a term of years less than life.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Ante, </em>p 319. Obviously the terms are \"mutually exclusive\u201d only in the sense that a court may not both sentence an individual to a term of life and to a term of years. It does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>logically follow that a term of years must be less than life; it logically follows that the term of years could be equal to or less than life, and that life could be greater than or equal to a term of years. Thus, the Legislature has in terms authorized any term of years that equals actual life.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">While it may be a truism to conclude that the alternatives, \"term of years\u201d or \"life\u201d present choices that are mutually exclusive in that if one is chosen the other must be rejected, it does not follow that one must be less than the other. <em>Id. </em>There is no basis for the conclusion, that the alternative of \"life\u201d is a \"term of years less than life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">As a basis for this conclusion the lead opinion initially relies on <em>People v Blythe, </em>417 Mich 430; 339 NW2d 399 (1983). <em>Ante, </em>p 317, n 10. <em>Blythe </em>involved only the question whether \"life or any term of years\u201d referred to the mandatory minimum sentence imposed, thus requiring a minimum sentence of at least a year and a day. <em>Blythe </em>is inapposite to the case before us.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>p 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">Nor does <em>People v Johnson, </em>421 Mich 494, 498; 364 NW2d 654 (1984), support this conclusion. In <em>Johnson, </em>this Court discussed the holding of <em>Blythe, supra, </em>and observed that the \"sentence concepts 'life\u2019 and 'any term of years\u2019 are mutually exclusive and a sentencing judge may (in the appropriate case) opt for either but not both.\u201d This statement was made in the context of observing that if a life sentence was imposed there could be no minimum term of years, concluding then that since \"Proposal b\u201d mandated only that a defendant serve the calendar minimum term imposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>by the court before being eligible for parole, the lifer law only applied to a determinate life sentence.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MCL 791.233b; MSA 28.230(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">Since <em>Johnson </em>held that a life sentence under Proposal b was subject to the lifer law, a \"life\u201d sentence now carries the potential to require a shorter sentence than a term of years, the very anomaly the trial court here observed. However, despite <em>Johnson\u2019s </em>holding that a defendant sentenced to life for a \"Proposal b\u201d offense is eligible for parole after ten years, the lead opinion now holds that a sentence of life is a greater penalty than a term of years, implying life is the most severe penalty that can be imposed.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> This conclusion focuses on the function of the sentence, and assumes incorrectly that an inmate serving life will probably be paroled. There is no support for the assumption. If a life inmate is not paroled, his sentence is identical to the defendant\u2019s. If a life inmate is paroled, his sentence is less than Mr. Moore\u2019s. Thus, the assumption is not only logically flawed, it is based on a speculation as to how the system will actually operate, a consideration this Court held was impermissible as a factor in imposing a sentence. <em>People v Fleming, supra, </em>p 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>The Legislature has mandated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-4\">a parole shall not be granted to a prisoner sentenced for the commission of a crime described in section 33b(a) to (cc) until the prisoner has served the minimum term imposed by the court less an allowance for disciplinary credits .... A prisoner described in this subdivision is not eligible for special parole.[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>] [MCL 791.233(1)(c); MSA 28.2303(1)(c).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">If it is true that life is more severe than a term of years, then, despite the mandate of the Legislature that a \"Proposal b\u201d offender serve the calendar minimum prior to being considered eligible for parole, defendants sentenced to indeterminate terms must presumably not only be sentenced to a term of years less than life, but it should follow that defendants should be eligible for parole prior to the service of ten years of their calendar minimum term, since a term of years must necessarily be a less severe penalty than life imprisonment.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>Finally, despite protestations to the contrary, to impose a limit on the number of years as the lead opinion suggests would require the sentencing court to compute a criminal\u2019s life expectancy upon the basis of age, physical health, and family history. If it is the maximum term of years that violates the statute, the maximum term would have to be less than this computed life expectancy and then under <em>People v </em>Tanner, 387 Mich 683; 199 NW2d 202 (1972); the court would have to perform the final computation, the one-third/two-thirds formulation, which would become the minimum sentence.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> This procedure is also inconsistent with the guidelines which recommend a minimum sentence up to life in prison. <em>People v Broden, </em>428 Mich 343, 355; 408 NW2d 789 (1987). This procedure would essentially require every court to function as an actuary:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-4\">For example [take] a person who has the foresight to commit a murder at the age of 45 years old and due to his genetic history, his current physical health and diet, has a projected life span of 55 years. The maximum term of years then would have to be less than 10 years. The appropriate computation under <em>Tanner </em>would then result in a minimum term of six years. This would have the net result of eliminating any discretion from the sentencing judge if \"any term of years\u201d is determined to be less than life. Indeed, murder committed by a defendant who has outlived his individual life expectancy would not be punishable by a term of years at all. Life would be the only permissible sentence. This eliminates a portion of the penalty provision established by the Legislature and would have the impermissible result of eliminating the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion which is required by statute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>The above example assumes the opinion\u2019s holding refers to the maximum term. On the other hand, if it is the minimum term of the sentence that is of significance to the majority the trial court must also presumably use actuarial tables to impose a minimum no greater than two-thirds of the defendant\u2019s life expectancy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Whether the term addressed by the majority is the minimum or the maximum,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> the observation is well taken that the inevitable direction of the opinion is the impo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>sition of determinate life sentences for the majority of serious offenders and the elimination of the indeterminate portion of the penalty provision established by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">This Court recognized in its dicta in <em>Johnson </em>that the lifer law does not apply to a defendant sentenced to a term of years for a Proposal b offense. The purpose of Proposal b is to prevent early release. The ultimate illogic in the majority result is to conclude that it is contrary to the legislative will to impose a term of years that precludes parole when Proposal b was enacted for the purpose of precluding early parole. If the Legislature wished to restrict that authority it could modify Proposal b, increase disciplinary credits, or modify the \"lifer law.\u201d To conclude that given terms of years are \"unnecessary\u201d is simply to frustrate the very authority given to the sentencing judge by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">Therefore, because the language of the statute <em>is </em>unambiguous, no judicial interpretation is necessary. We would find the sentence of 100 to 200 years within the statutory limits which authorize the sentencing judge to impose a sentence of \"life\u201d or \"any term of years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">ABUSE OF DISCRETION</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">Under Michigan law the appellate court may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>review a trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in sentencing and will provide relief for the defendant only in those instances in which the sentence \"shocks the conscience of the appellate court.\u201d <em>People v Coles, supra, </em>550. We agree with the conclusion reached in the lead opinion that as the reviewing court we are not shocked, and thus do not find the effective length of this sentence to be an abuse of the trial court\u2019s sentencing discretion. <em>Ante, </em>p 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">However, we disagree with the conclusions also reached by the lead opinion that the sentencing judge abused his discretion by entering an order that is impossible for the defendant to obey, and one which effectively foreclosed his, or his successor\u2019s, future exercise of discretion in regard to granting approval of parole prior to the service of the defendant\u2019s minimum calendar term. <em>Ante, </em>pp 325-326. It cannot be an abuse of discretion to do what the Legislature has authorized, nor can it be an abuse of discretion to foreclose the discretion of the Parole Board when the Legislature has authorized foreclosure by mandating that a defendant serve the calendar minimum term of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">To repeat, the issue is not whether a defendant can actually serve the sentence imposed by the trial court, but rather whether the court has the lawful authority to impose the sentence. The sentencing judge stated the sentence imposed on defendant Moore was designed so that the defendant would not be released from prison during his natural life. The judge noted that \"[b]ecause the appellate courts of our state have said that in point of fact a life sentence for this sort of crime allows [the defendant] to be reviewed in ten years, I intend to utilize numbers with the belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>law requires that the numbers be served before you become eligible for review.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0l\">Under <em>People v Coles, supra, </em>a sentence must bear a reasonable relationship to a legitimate sentencing goal.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The trial judge stated that the purpose of the 100- to 200-year sentence was to foreclose parole and thus provided a rationale for the sentence which bore a reasonable relationship to the shocking, heinous crime committed by the defendant.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The sentence does not constitute an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion because the legislative referendum authorized avoidance of the lifer law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">The lead opinion\u2019s assertion that the action of the trial judge precluded the judge or his successor from the opportunity to deny or approve early release is simply incorrect. The Legislature itself has precluded the court\u2019s discretion by enacting legislation which declares that \"Proposal b\u201d offenders are ineligible for special parole.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In this case, the defendant was convicted of second-degree murder, a \"Proposal b\u201d offense. Thus the defendant could not be released prior to serving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>calendar minimum, even with the sentencing judge\u2019s approval. MCL 791.233b(n); MSA 28.2303(3)(n).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">It cannot be an abuse of discretion to foreclose a sentencing judge\u2019s discretion in a situation, such as here, where the Legislature effectively foreclosed both the judiciary\u2019s and the Parole Board\u2019s discretion regarding release prior to serving a minimum term. Thus, there is no basis for the lead opinion\u2019s conclusion that the sentence of 100 to 200 years constituted an abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">To be clear, while all might not agree with this sentence, the sentence was within the authority legislatively granted to the trial court. There is no support for the construction of the statute offered in the lead opinion. Accordingly, I would affirm the opinion below.</p>\n<judges id=\"b589-7\">Riley, C.J., and Griffin, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-8\"><em> People v Oscar Moore, </em>164 Mich App 378, 394; 417 NW2d 508 (1987) (Tahvonen, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> <em>People v Coles </em>has not led this Court or the Court of Appeals to find many sentences that \"shock the conscience.\u201d It appears that trial courts are, with few exceptions, imposing sentences which are in context not offensive.

The punishment in this case, while admittedly strong, is not disproportionate to the violent and brutal murder of which the defendant was found guilty. In addition, other criteria, such as disciplining the wrongdoer, the protection of society, and deterrence of others from committing like offenses, must be taken into account. <em>People v Snow, </em>386 Mich 586; 194 NW2d 314 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">Second, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion that \"[njeither the Legislature nor the people . . . have authorized the imposition of a nonparolable term of years\u201d <em>(ante, </em>p 323) or that the Legislature did not intend a drastic change in sentencing law, we believe this is precisely what the Legislature intended in enacting \"Proposal b.\u201d MCL 791.233b(b); MSA 28.2303(3)(b).
