An insurer may relieve itself of its duty to defend and indemnify if (1) the insured acted <em>either </em>intentionally <em>or </em>criminally, and (2) the resulting injuries occurred as the natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated result of an insured\u2019s intentional or criminal acts. In the instant case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the exclusion precludes coverage for Alonda Freeman. We find that Alonda Freeman. acted <em>either </em>intentionally or criminally and Mary Kelly\u2019s injuries were the \"expected\u201d result of Alonda Freeman\u2019s acts. We also hold that \"an insured\u201d unambiguously refers to \"all\u201d or \"any\u201d insureds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>under the homeowner\u2019s policy. Therefore, the exclusion also excluded coverage for Marshall Freeman. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Freeman. </em>160 Mich App 349; 408 NW2d 153 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b905-6\">In <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>we hold that a proper analysis of whether an insurer has a duty to defend and indemnify an insured under a homeowner\u2019s policy requires a determination of whether coverage exists under the policy, and if coverage exists, then there must follow a determination of whether the exclusionary clause applies. In the present case, we find that the claimed incident constituted an \"occurrence\u201d under the coverage provision of the insured\u2019s policy. However, unlike a majority of this Court, we would hold that, in order to avoid its duty to defend and indemnify under the exclusion, the insurer must show that an objective insured \"intended or expected\u201d injury to result from those intentional acts. In this case, we find that an objective insured would expect injury to result from the stabbing incident. Even assuming we agreed with the majority and applied a subjective standard of review to the \"intended or expected\u201d exclusion, we would conclude that a subjective insured would \"expect\u201d injury to result in the instant case. Therefore, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>DiCicco </em>and reinstate the decision of the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVB\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>I. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">In reviewing a grant or denial of summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(10), we consider the pleadings, affidavits, depositions, admissions, and any other documentary evidence in favor of the party opposing the motion. A motion for summary disposition tests the factual basis for plaintiff\u2019s allegations and may be granted only if \"there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d MCR 2.116(C)(10); <em>Velmer v Baraga Area Schools, </em>430 Mich 385, 390; 424 NW2d 370 (1988). An insurer may utilize this procedure in a declaratory action to determine whether it must indemnify and provide a defense for an insured in an underlying tort action. See, e.g., <em>Wright v White Birch Park, </em>118 Mich App 639; 325 NW2d 524 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b906-6\">The duty of an insurance company to provide a defense in an underlying tort action depends upon the allegations in the complaint and extends to allegations which \"even arguably come within the policy coverage.\u201d <em>Detroit Edison Co v Michigan Mutual Ins Co, </em>102 Mich App 136, 142; 301 NW2d 832 (1980). The duty to defend is broader than, and not necessarily conclusive of, an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. The court must resolve any doubt pertaining to the duty to defend in favor of the insured. <em>Guerdon Industries, Inc v Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co of New York, </em>371 Mich 12, 18-19; 123 NW2d 143 (1963); <em>Illinois Employers Ins of Wausau v Dragovich, </em>139 Mich App 502; 362 NW2d 767 (1984). However, it is equally clear that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend and indemnify does not depend solely upon the terminology used in a plaintiff\u2019s pleadings. Rather, \"it is necessary to focus on the basis for the injury and not the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>nomenclature of the underlying claim in order to determine whether coverage exists. . . . [S]o must the allegations be examined to determine the substance, as opposed to the mere form, of the complaint.\u201d <em>Illinois Employers Ins, supra </em>at 507; <em>Shepard Marine Construction Co v Maryland Casualty Co, </em>73 Mich App 62; 250 NW2d 541 (1976). It is against this backdrop that we must decide the cases before us today.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-4\">II. <em>METROPOLITAN INS V DiCICCO</em></p>\n<p id=\"A8L\">A. FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">The parties stipulated that the trial judge would decide the case upon the basis of the briefs and deposition transcripts. We adopt the facts as set forth by the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b907-6\">There is little dispute as to what occurred on February 25, 1984. DiCicco and Gravenmier were residents of the same college residence hall. Gravenmier was in a hallway with his girlfriend and a Graham Williamson. They had discovered glue in Gravenmier\u2019s door lock and suspected DiCicco had committed the prank. They knocked and kicked at DiCicco\u2019s door, and when DiCicco came out there was a scuffle in the hall with first Williamson and then with Gravenmier. Both DiCicco and Gravenmier landed blows, the glass of a fire extinguisher cabinet was broken. Gravenmier and DiCicco separated and the fight came to an abrupt end. DiCicco returned to his room and Gravenmier started down the hall with his girlfriend and Williamson. Within a short time DiCicco came from his room again holding a folding hunting knife with the three-inch blade exposed. DiCicco called Gravenmier and his girlfriend offensive names and Gravenmier returned to respond. Gravenmier observed the knife, put his hands up and told DiCicco in effect that if he were dumb enough or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>brave enough to use it on Gravenmier\u2019s stomach. DiCicco commenced poking at Gravenmier\u2019s chest with his left hand repeating the admonition, \"don\u2019t mess with me.\u201d He backed Gravenmier against the wall. Gravenmier reacted by grabbing DiCicco by the throat, turning, and pushing DiCicco against the wall. Gravenmier then felt the knife being withdrawn from his stomach.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-5\">DiCicco denies any intent to use the knife, claiming that he went to get the knife merely to scare away the other persons he considered to be a threat. No one observed him make a gesture of moving the knife as though to stab Gravenmier. The knife was held in his right hand and the poking was done with his left. DiCicco denies knowledge of in fact stabbing. Immediately following the stabbing, DiCicco looked shocked. Gravenmier obviously did not expect DiCicco would use the knife or he would not have engaged in his act of bravado.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-6\">Subsequently Gravenmier commenced a tort action. Grand Traverse File 84-2119-NO. In that action Gravenmier makes allegations against DiCicco in Count i of negligence in the course of the dispute in that DiCicco inadvertently stabbed him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-7\">In Count ii he alleges DiCicco intentionally inflicted the stab wound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b908-8\">There is no dispute that as of the date of the incident David DiCicco was an insured under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Plaintiff, Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Insurance Company, to David DiCicco\u2019s parents.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b908-9\">The prosecutor filed criminal assault charges against DiCicco, but eventually dismissed the charges. The plaintiff argues that the prosecutor dismissed the charges because Gravenmier withheld his cooperation, fearful that a criminal conviction would eliminate any possibility that DiCicco\u2019s insurer would pay damages awarded in a civil suit. Although plausible, there is no record support for this theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Defendant Gravenmier filed a civil suit against DiCicco, and plaintiff Metropolitan has provided a defense for DiCicco in the civil suit under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to DiCicco\u2019s father. That case remains pending in Grand Traverse Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">Plaintiff filed the instant suit, seeking a declaration that the policy does not cover the stabbing incident between DiCicco and Gravenmier and, therefore, it does not have a duty to defend or indemnify DiCicco in the underlying tort action. The trial court granted summary disposition in favor of plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-6\">Defendant appealed, and the Court of Appeals reversed, remanding the case to the trial court to determine whether DiCicco <em>intended </em>to stab Gravenmier. This Court granted leave to appeal in consolidation with <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b909-7\">B. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b909-8\">Initially, in determining whether a policy applies, we first must determine whether the policy is clear and unambiguous on its face. We look to the language of the policy and we construe any ambiguity in favor of the insured. <em>Powers v DAIIE, </em>427 Mich 602, 624; 398 NW2d 411 (1986).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the instant case, the policy sets forth the essential terms and phrases in bold-faced type under conspicuously marked sections entitled \"Coverages ii,\u201d \"Definitions,\u201d and \"Exclusions applicable to section ii\u201d (section headings are also in bold-faced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>type).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355, 363; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). The terms used are either clearly defined within the policy itself or given a meaning in accordance with their common usage. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins Co v Ex-Cell-O Corp, </em>702 F Supp 1317, 1323, n 7 (ED Mich, 1988) (the omission of a definition of a term with a common meaning does not necessarily render an insurance policy ambiguous). Therefore, we conclude that the provisions in the Metropolitan policy are clear and unambiguous.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Jones v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>172 Mich App 24; 431 NW2d 242 (1988); <em>American States Ins Co v Maryland Casualty Co, </em>587 F Supp 1549 (ED Mich, 1984). We cannot create an ambiguity where none exists. <em>Edgar\u2019s Warehouse, Inc v United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty Co, </em>375 Mich 598; 134 NW2d 746 (1965); <em>Patek v Aetna Life Ins Co, </em>362 Mich 292; 106 NW2d 828 (1961); <em>Dimambro-Northend Associates v United Construction, Inc, </em>154 Mich App 306, 313; 397 NW2d 547 (1986); <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Hoag, </em>136 Mich App 326, 332; 356 NW2d 630 (1984). Similarly, we reject the temptation to rewrite the plain and unambiguous meaning of the policy under the guise of interpretation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Rather, we enforce the terms of the contract as written. <em>Eghotz v Creech, </em>365 Mich 527, 530; 113 NW2d 815 (1962); <em>Stine v Continental Casualty Co, </em>419 Mich 89, 114; 349 NW2d 127 (1984); <em>Dimambro-Northend Associates, supra </em>at 312-313; <em>Murphy v Seed-Roberts Agency, Inc, </em>79 Mich App 1, 7-9; 261 NW2d 198 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b911-4\">Plaintiff argues that the Court of Appeals should have affirmed the trial court\u2019s summary disposition in its favor because the coverage section of DiCicco\u2019s homeowner\u2019s policy does not apply to the fighting incident between DiCicco and Gravenmier. This provision requires an \"occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> However, neither the trial court nor the Court of Appeals appears to have determined whether the fighting incident constituted an \"occurrence\u201d within the meaning of the coverage provision of the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b911-5\">Plaintiff contends that the language of the insurance contract requires the determination of whether the fighting incident constituted an \"occurrence\u201d under the policy before addressing any applicable exclusionary provisions. See <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Kompus, </em>135 Mich App 667; 354 NW2d 303 (1984); <em>Western Casualty &amp; Surety Group v Coloma Twp, </em>140 Mich App 516, 521; 364 NW2d 367 (1985); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Cannon, </em>644 F Supp 31, 32-33 (ED Mich, 1986); <em>Unigard Mutual Ins Co v Spokane School Dist, </em>20 Wash App 261; 579 P2d 1015 (1978); <em>Grange Ins Ass\u2019n v Authier, </em>45 Wash App 383; 725 P2d 642 (1986); <em>Hins v Heer, </em>259 NW2d 38 (ND, 1977); <em>American Home Assurance Co v Osbourn, </em>47 Md App 73; 422 A2d 8 (1980). Although some courts have addressed the exclusionary clause before determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>coverage exists under a policy,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> we agree with plaintiff that the proper construction of a contract requires that we first determine whether coverage exists, and then whether an exclusion precludes coverage. As the Maryland Court of Appeals observed in a case implicating the identical provisions involved in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b912-5\">Osbourn here contends that \"it was for the jury to determine whether the facts of this case as revealed by the evidence, fit within the exclusions of the policy. The jury declared that they did not.\u201d We disagree. It is plain that the court submitted to the jury an irrelevant issue. The exclusion was inapplicable for the reason that there was no language in Section n, Part i, the liability provision, which afforded coverage to the appellee in the first place under the facts alleged. [American <em>Home Assurance Co, </em>47 Md App 82.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b912-6\">Accordingly, we must determine first whether the fighting incident constituted an \"occurrence.\u201d Plaintiff places great reliance on <em>Frankenmuth v Kompus, supra, </em>for its position that the fighting incident did not constitute an \"occurrence.\u201d In <em>Kompus, </em>several insurance companies and individuals appealed orders declaring their respective duties to defend Dr. Kompus, the insured, in his underlying tort actions, alleging assault, malpractice, and other claims. These claims arose from Dr. Kompus\u2019 alleged homosexual activity with several patients. Dr. Kompus was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual assault. The <em>Kompus </em>Court found that Dr. Kompus\u2019 actions were not accidental and, thus, did not satisfy the policy\u2019s definition of \"occurrence.\u201d In <em>Kompus, </em>the policy defined an \"oc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>currence\u201d as an \"accident,\u201d and the Court of Appeals interpreted \"accident\u201d with reference to an insurance policy involving a general liability section identical to that in the present case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b913-6\">\"An 'accident,\u2019 within the meaning of policies of accident insurance, may be anything that begins to be, that happens, or that is a result which is not anticipated and is unforeseen and unexpected by the person injured or affected thereby\u2014that is, takes place without the insured\u2019s foresight or expectation and without design or intentional causation on his part. In other words, an accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d <em>[Kompus, supra </em>at 678, quoting <em>Guerdon Industries, Inc, supra </em>at 18-19; <em>Allstate Ins Co v Cannon, supra </em>at 32.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b913-7\">The <em>Kompus </em>Court found this definition to be in harmony with the word\u2019s common usage. See also <em>American States Ins v Maryland Casualty Co, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b913-8\">However, the Court of Appeals in the present <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>case distinguished <em>Kompus </em>on the ground that <em>\"Kompus </em>merely held that a psychiatrist\u2019s homosexual acts on his patients were intentional as a matter of law.\u201d Consequently, the Court reasoned, it was unnecessary to reach the exclusion provision of the insured\u2019s policy since the psychiatrist\u2019s acts were not \"occurrences\u201d as that term was defined in the policy. According to the Court of Appeals, \"[t]he same conclusion cannot be reached in the present case . . . [because] a homosexual act can never be unintentional; a stabbing can be.\u201d We disagree. If we adopted the Court of Appeals interpretation of <em>Kompus, </em>then we would effectively restrict the definition of \"accident\u201d to \"unintentional.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> This we decline to do. Rather, we find that the last sentence of the <em>Kompus </em>definition accurately summarizes those events which constitute an \"accident\u201d: \"an accident is an undesigned contingency, a casualty, a happening by chance, something out of the usual course of things, unusual, fortuitous, not anticipated, and not naturally to be expected.\u201d Accordingly, we find that ascertaining the insured\u2019s \"intent\u201d may determine whether the insured\u2019s actions constituted an \"accident,\u201d but it does not necessarily follow that an insured must act unintentionally for an act to be an \"occurrence.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b914-4\">We also find <em>Allstate Ins Co v Cannon, supra, </em>particularly instructive when characterizing an event as an \"occurrence\u201d under the present policy language. In <em>Cannon, </em>Allstate brought an action for declaratory judgment that it did not have a duty to defend or indemnify its insured under a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>homeowner\u2019s policy with the same language involved in this case. Plaintiffs in the underlying action, Louise L. Jackson and Ernestine Dennis, sued Kenneth Cannon (the insured) for the shooting death of Larry James and the wounding of David Dennis by defendant Lance Rutland with a rifle which he obtained from defendant Eddie Gaines. Gaines gave the rifle to Cannon because Rutland wanted the gun for protection. A verbal street fight ensued between Rutland and James. After Cannon broke up the fight, he and Rutland went to Cannon\u2019s home. Cannon handed the loaded rifle to Rutland knowing Rutland was angry. Rutland returned to the scene of the fight and fired two warning shots and a third in self-defense. Although Rutland said he never aimed the rifle at anyone, he killed James and wounded Dennis, a bystander. Rutland pleaded guilty to second-degree murder. United States District Court Judge Avern Cohn held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b915-4\">[S]ummary judgment in favor of <em>Allstate </em>is appropriate in this case. The operative act is Cannon\u2019s handing a loaded rifle to Rutland. Indeed, Cannon had custody of the rifle on behalf of Rut-land. Cannon also purchased ammunition for the rifle. . . . Rutland had been in a fight and was angry. He left the scene of the fight to g\u00e9t the rifle. Cannon knew that. Cannon also knew Rutland was returning to the scene of the fight with the rifle. It is fatuous to argue that the injuries from the shootings were \"accidents\u201d as defined by the Michigan Supreme Court. While D. Dennis\u2019s wounding may have been accidental, certainly the discharge of the rifle was not an accident. <em>[Allstate Ins Co v Cannon, supra </em>at 33.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">Although we find <em>Cannon </em>and <em>Kompus </em>analogous to the case at bar, and we agree that they represent examples of situations in which there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>was no \"occurrence\u201d under the present policy language, the claimed incident in the instant case is not clear cut enough to allow us to make a similar determination. Under the analyses we advance today, we conclude that the present coverage provision<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> must be broadly construed.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, we hold that the claimed incident constituted an \"occurrence\u201d under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">Thus, we turn next to the exclusionary clause in the plaintiffs policy. That provision reads: \"[The policy does not cover] bodily injury or property DAMAGE WHICH IS EITHER EXPECTED OR INTENDED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE INSURED.\u201d There \u00cdS precedential authority in this jurisdiction which holds that under an exclusion excepting coverage for \"injury . . . caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured,\u201d an insured must subjectively intend both his act <em>and </em>the resulting injury in order to avoid its duty to defend and indemnify. <em>Morrill v Gallagher, </em>370 Mich 578, 583; 122 NW2d 687 (1963). <em>Putman v Zeluff, </em>372 Mich 553; 127 NW2d 374 (1964). See also <em>Transamerica Ins Co v Anderson, </em>159 Mich App 441; 407 NW2d 27 (1987); <em>Turner v Burch, </em>156 Mich App 303; 401 NW2d 355 (1986); <em>Linebaugh v Berdish, </em>144 Mich App 750; 376 NW2d 400 (1985); <em>Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co v Rademacher, </em>135 Mich App 200; 351 NW2d 914 (1984); <em>Kermans v Pendleton, </em>62 Mich App 576, 580; 233 NW2d 658 (1975); <em>Vermont Mutual Ins Co v Dalzell, </em>52 Mich App 686; 218 NW2d 52 (1974); <em>Connecticut Indemnity Co v Nestor, 4 </em>Mich App <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>578; 145 NW2d 399 (1966). Drawing on this authority, defendants argue that the Court of Appeals erred and that we should construe the current exclusionary clause as narrowly as the \"caused intentionally\u201d exclusion. Thus, DiCicco would have us interpret the addition of the word \"expected\u201d to the exclusion as superfluous, thereby requiring plaintiff to prove DiCicco acted intentionally and intended to injure Gravenmier. Whereas, plaintiff urges that we construe the addition of \"expected\u201d according to its plain and unambiguous meaning and find, therefore, that the exclusion applies to \"expected,\u201d as well as \"intended,\u201d injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-4\">We are convinced that the exclusion in the present case differs from the \"caused intentionally\u201d exclusion and, as the plaintiff persuasively argues, that the exclusion does not require a determination of whether DiCicco intended to stab Gravenmier. Rather, as plaintiff contends, the express language of the exclusion only requires a determination of whether \"bodily injury . . . is . . . <em>either </em>expected <em>or </em>intended.\u201d We agree and we so hold.</p>\n<p id=\"b917-5\">Although other jurisdictions have not reached a uniform conclusion on this issue,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> we agree with plaintiff that the addition of the word \"expected\u201d expands the meaning of the \"caused intentionally\u201d language. We are persuaded that the present policy exclusion represents an attempt by insurers to avoid the harsh results of <em>Morrill </em>and similar cases nationwide. <em>Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co v Freyer, </em>89 Ill App 3d 617; 44 Ill Dec 791; 411 NE2d 1157 (1980). Accordingly, \" '[n]o word in a contract should be rejected as surplusage if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>serves some reasonable purpose.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ex-Cell-O Corp, supra, </em>pp 1325-1326; <em>Geerdes v St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins Co, </em>128 Mich App 730, 734; 341 NW2d 195 (1983); <em>Draper v Nelson, </em>254 Mich 380, 383; 236 NW 808 (1931). See also <em>Associated Truck Lines v Baer, </em>346 Mich 106, 110; 77 NW2d 384 (1956). In our opinion, under a literal reading of the exclusion, the addition of \"expected\u201d serves the purpose of excluding coverage for \"expected,\u201d in addition to \"intentional,\u201d injuries. In fact, the Court of Appeals has distinguished between \"intended\u201d and \"expected\u201d injuries in cases involving the \"caused intentionally\u201d and the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusions. <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co v Jenkins, </em>147 Mich App 462; 382 NW2d 796 (1985); <em>Linebaugh v Berdish, supra; State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co v Groshek, </em>161 Mich App 703; 411 NW2d 480 (1987); <em>Allstate v Freeman, supra; Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co v Sprague, </em>163 Mich App 650, 654; 415 NW2d 230 (1987). As the <em>Jenkins </em>Court stated in the context of the identical exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-5\">We believe, where a policy excludes coverage for intended or expected injuries, a distinction should be drawn between the terms \"intentional\u201d and \"expected.\u201d In order to avoid liability for an expected injury, it must be shown that the injury was the natural, foreseeable, <em>expected, </em>and anticipated result of an intentional act. <em>[Jenkins, supra </em>at 467-468.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>In this respect, we agree with those courts which have held that \"[f]or the purposes of an exclusionary clause in an insurance policy the word 'expected\u2019 denotes that the actor knew or should have known that there was a substantial probability that certain consequences will result from his actions.\u201d <em>City of Carter Lake v Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co, </em>604 F2d 1052, 1058-1059 (CA 8, 1979).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that the standard we adopt today will preclude coverage for negligent acts by the insured. As the <em>City of Carter Lake </em>court stated, <em>supra </em>at 1059, n 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-4\">The difference between \"reasonably foreseeable\u201d and \"substantial probability\u201d is the degree of ex-pectability. A result is reasonably foreseeable if there are indications which would lead a reasonably prudent man to know that the particular results could follow from his acts. Substantial probability is more than this. The indications must be strong enough to alert a reasonably prudent man not only to the possibility of the results occurring but the indications also must be sufficient to forewarn him that the results are highly likely to occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">Moreover, we note that our decision today is in accord with those Court of Appeals decisions which have held that plaintiff must show: (1) the insured acted intentionally, and (2) the insured \"intended or expected\u201d injury to result from those acts. <em>State Farm v Jenkins, supra; Yother v McCrimmon, </em>147 Mich App 130; 383 NW2d 126 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number>(1985); <em>Wright, supra; Group Ins Co of Michigan v Morelli, 111 </em>Mich App 510; 314 NW2d 672 (1981).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> We find that the above-cited cases support the proposition that if the court determines that the insured acted intentionally, then the \"expected or intended\u201d language is satisfied by a finding that injury resulted as the \"natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated\u201d consequence of those intentional acts. However, we disagree with defendants that these cases or the policy language requires a determination of the insured\u2019s intent to act. Accordingly, we agree with the trial court that the insurer need not prove that the insured acted intentionally under the exclusion.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Finally, defendants also contend that we must determine the insured\u2019s expectations or intentions from his subjective viewpoint because the exclusion states expectation \"from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d Basically, they would have us construe the exclusionary language so as to require an insurer to prove that the insured said, \"yes I expected or intended injury to result from my intentional act.\u201d Unfortunately, a majority of this Court agrees with defendants on this issue. However, in our opinion, plaintiff persuasively argues that we should adopt an objective standard. As one court recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b921-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>Probing one\u2019s state of mind is an elusive task at best. Supplanting an objective standard with a subjective standard for determining whether the act or conduct of an insured is \"intentional\u201d or \"expected or intended\u201d for purposes of assessing coverage would emasculate apposite policy provisions by making it impossible to preclude coverage for intentional acts or conduct absent admissions by insureds of a specific intent to harm or injure. Human nature augers against any viable expectation of such admissions. <em>[Truck Ins Exchange v </em>Pickering, 642 SW2d 113, 116 (Mo App, 1982).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b921-4\">In deciding this issue, we take into account that under the \"caused intentionally\u201d exclusion, numerous Court of Appeals panels have avoided potentially absurd results by not requiring a literal finding of an insured\u2019s \"subjective intentions.\u201d For example, some Court of Appeals panels have held that, under the \"intent to injure\u201d require-, ment of the \"caused intentionally\u201d exclusion, \"intended tortious acts and unintended tortious results [is a distinction] without a difference . . . .\u201d <em>Linebaugh v Berdish, supra </em>at 756. Moreover, some panels have stated that the finding of an intentional act necessarily encompasses the corollary finding that the insured intended the injury. <em>Turner v Burch, supra. </em>Similarly, several recent Court of Appeals decisions have achieved a similar result under the \"caused intentionally\u201d language by inferring the insured\u2019s \"intent to act\u201d from the very nature of his actions. <em>Kermans v Pendleton; Farm Bureau Ins Co v Rademacher, supra. </em>Lastly, some panels have avoided such theoretical exercises and simply equated the \"caused intentionally\u201d language with the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusion. <em>Transamerica Ins Co v Anderson; Linebaugh v Berdish, supra. </em>We find these cases persuasive, but rather than engaging in their theoret<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number>ical exercises or drawing questionable inferences to determine the insured\u2019s \"subjective expectation,\u201d we hold that the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusion must be determined on the basis of an objective standard. <em>Shelter Mutual Ins Co v Parrish, </em>659 SW2d 315 (Mo App, 1983); <em>Pickering, supra; Fireman\u2019s Ins Co v Smith, </em>13 Ark App 250, 253-254; 683 SW2d 234 (1985); <em>CNA Ins Co v McGinnis, </em>282 Ark 90, 93-94; 666 SW2d 689 (1984).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-5\">Under the facts of the instant case, we would conclude that the trial court properly granted plaintiffs motion for summary disposition. Summary disposition is appropriate when there is no genuine issue of material fact. MCR 2.116(0(10). Neither party contends that DiCicco returned to his room after the brawl with Gravenmier ended. Rather, it is unrefuted that DiCicco obtained a folding hunting knife, he opened it, and returned to confront Gravenmier with a barrage of verbal attacks and threatening motions with the knife. We find it inconceivable that, under these facts, an objective person would not \"expect\u201d injury to result from his stabbing Gravenmier with a hunting knife. Therefore, we agree with the trial court that DiCicco must have expected serious injury to result.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">Even assuming that we agreed with the defendant and adopted a subjective standard of review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>of the exclusionary clause, nevertheless, we would conclude that the trial court properly granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition. We have the complete record upon which the parties stipulated to the resolution of their declaratory action. Accordingly, we disagree with the dissent that we must remand the case to the trial court for a determination under a subjective analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-4\">In our opinion, the facts of the instant case would present the ideal circumstances in which a trial court should infer the insured\u2019s subjective intentions as a matter of law. The mere fact that the defendants denied their intentions or expectations does not surprise us, nor should it obligate plaintiff to defend in the underlying suit. Otherwise, an insured could simply obligate an insurer to defend by denying that he intended or expected injury to result.</p>\n<p id=\"b923-5\">Rather, we would hold that defendant \"subjectively expected\u201d injury to result even though he denied any intent to injury. This Court has recognized the difficulty in determining an individual\u2019s \"subjective intentions\u201d: \" 'Intent is a secret of the defendant\u2019s mind,\u2019 which he can disclose by his declarations or by his actions and 'his <em>actions sometimes speak louder than words.\u201d People v </em>Strong, 143 Mich App 442, 452; 337 NW2d 335 (1985). (Citations omitted; emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b923-6\">We adopt this analysis because it accurately addresses the circumstances of the instant case. Although the defendant denies any intent to injure, his actions speak louder than those words. In the instant case, we note that determining the defendant\u2019s \"subjective expectations\u201d requires a lesser degree of proof than his \"subjective intentions.\u201d DiCicco never contested that he grabbed a folding hunting knife from his room, opened it, and returned to confront Gravenmier with a barrage of verbal attacks and threatening motions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>with the knife.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Contrary to Justice Boyle\u2019s con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>elusion, we believe that to claim that DiCicco did not <em>\"expect </em>or intend\u201d injury to result from his conduct, does in fact, \" 'fl[y] in the face of all reason, common sense and experience.\u2019 \u201d Boyle, J., <em>post, </em>p 720 (citing <em>McGinnis, supra </em>at 93). Therefore, even under these circumstances, we would hold that the defendant \"subjectively expected\u201d injury to result.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">Accordingly, we would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s declaratory order in favor of Metropolitan.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">III. <em>ALLSTATE INS CO V FREEMAN</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6s\">A. PACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">The plaintiff, Allstate Insurance Company, seeks a determination of its obligation to defend and indemnify under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued to Marshall and Alonda Freeman for a shooting incident in which Alonda shot the defendant-appellant, Mary Helen Kelly. The Freemans lived two houses away from Kelly. On February 25,1984, Kelly stood outside her home, shouting at another neighbor. Alonda Freeman came out of her home and told Kelly to shut her \"damn mouth.\u201d This provoked an argument between Kelly and Alonda Freeman, during which Alonda Freeman went back into her home. However, rather than remaining safely inside, she retrieved a loaded .38 caliber handgun from her kitchen cabinet and reappeared almost immediately on the front porch. Alonda Freeman testified that without issuing any type of a warning, she aimed the gun in Kelly\u2019s direction and fired. Although Alonda Freeman stated that she did not intend to injure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>Kelly, she also admitted that she stood only three to six feet away from Kelly when she fired the gun. The shot hit Kelly in the shoulder. On August 16, 1984, Alonda Freeman was convicted of discharging a firearm intentionally, aiming without malice and with injury. MCL 750.235; MSA 28.432.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b927-5\">On July 13, 1984, a month prior to Alonda Freeman\u2019s conviction in the criminal case, Kelly filed a tort action for assault and battery against Marshall and Alonda Freeman for damages resulting from the February, 1984, shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-6\">On August 7, 1984, plaintiff filed the instant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>declaratory judgment suit seeking a determination that plaintiff did not have to pay any obligation or defend the Freemans upon the basis of the intentional-act exclusion. On September 26, 1984, Kelly amended her original complaint in an attempt to claim damages for negligence. On October 12, 1984, the court entered a default judgment against the Freemans for failure to appear or file an answer. Plaintiff stipulated to the setting aside of these default judgments on December 17, 1984, and on January 25, 1985, moved for summary disposition, seeking a determination that it had no obligation to defend or indemnify. There is no dispute that on the date of the incident the Free-mans were insureds under a homeowner\u2019s policy issued by Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">On February 22, 1985, Wayne Circuit Court Judge Maureen P. Reilly granted plaintiff\u2019s motion with regard to Alonda Freeman. However, she reserved judgment, without prejudice, as to Marshall Freeman because of the nonspecific nature of the tort allegations alleged against him. Marshall Freeman was not at home at the time of the shooting incident. On March 15, 1985, Kelly filed a second amended complaint in the underlying tort action in which she argued that Marshall Freeman breached an independent duty of care, which essentially amounted to a claim for negligent entrustment of the firearm. On October 4, 1985, Judge Reilly granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary disposition and held that plaintiff did not have a duty to defend or indemnify Marshall Freeman in the underlying tort action. Defendants filed a joint claim of appeal in the Court of Appeals on November 1, 1985. The Court of Appeals affirmed the orders of summary disposition. On March 22, 1988, this Court granted the declaratory defendants\u2019 delayed application for leave to appeal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>in consolidation with <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco. </em>430 Mich 857 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b929-4\">B. SUMMARY DISPOSITION MOTION\u2014ALONDA FREEMAN</p>\n<p id=\"b929-5\">The Court of Appeals held that the policy exclusion requires application of a two-part test.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The exclusion in the Allstate policy provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b929-6\">Exclusions\u2014Losses We Do Not Cover</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJS\">1. We do not cover any bodily injury or property damage which <em>may reasonably be expected </em>to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b929-7\">The Court of Appeals held that Allstate may obviate its duty to defend and indemnify under the exclusion if it can prove that (1) the insured acted <em>either </em>intentionally <em>or </em>criminally,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and (2) the resulting injury was reasonably expected to result from such intentional <em>or </em>criminal conduct. However, Alonda Freeman contends that under the second prong, the Court of Appeals erred in not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>requiring Allstate to prove Alonda Freeman intended to injure Kelly and, alternatively, that her subjective expectation controls. We find neither argument proffered by Alonda Freeman persuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b930-4\">We note first that neither party contends that the exclusion is ambiguous as it applies to Alonda Freeman.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> We agree with this conclusion. The provision, under a conspicuous heading entitled, \"Exclusions\u2014Losses We Do Not Cover,\u201d sets forth, in plain English, a two-part test. We do not find the terms, \"reasonably be expected,\u201d \"intentional,\u201d or \"criminal\u201d ambiguous. Moreover, several recent decisions interpreting the identical exclusionary clause in this case have failed to find any ambiguity. See <em>Barton v Allstate Ins Co, </em>527 So 2d 524 (La App, 1988); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Talbot, </em>690 F Supp 886 (ND Cal, 1988); <em>Allstate Ins Co v Foster, </em>693 F Supp 886, 888 (D Nev, 1988) (citing <em>Freeman, supra); Allstate Ins Co v Gilbert, </em>852 F2d 449 (CA 9, 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b930-5\">Applying the exclusionary language that we find unambiguous to the facts in this case, we are persuaded, as was the Court of Appeals, that Alonda Freeman\u2019s conduct satisfies the first element of the exclusionary language as either an intentional or criminal act. The uncontroverted testimony showed that Alonda Freeman left the scene of the fight and reentered her home. However, rather than remaining safely inside, she reappeared with a loaded .38 caliber gun and fired it towards Kelly who was approximately three to six feet away. As the Court of Appeals stated, \"there is ... no dispute that [Alonda Freeman] pointed a loaded gun in the direction of Kelly and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>fired it at her at close range.\u201d <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 356. Under these circumstances, we affirm the holding of the Court of Appeals that Alonda Freeman acted intentionally.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b931-4\">In her second argument, Alonda Freeman asserts that the exclusion does not apply because she did not intend to injure Kelly. See, e.g., <em>Morrill, supra; Putman, supra. </em>We rejected the same argument involving a slightly different exclusion in <em>DiCicco, supra. </em>In so doing, we distinguished \"expected\u201d from \"intended\u201d injuries within the context of an exclusion which excluded injuries \"either expected or intended,\u201d and held that \"expected\u201d required a lesser degree of proof than \"intended.\u201d Accordingly, we held that an insurer could satisfy either the \"expected <em>or </em>intended\u201d portion of the exclusion by proving that injury resulted as the \"natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated result of [the insured\u2019s] intentional act[s].\u201d <em>Jenkins, supra </em>at 468; <em>Morelli; Yother; Wright, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b931-5\">Similarly, the Allstate exclusion requires an <em>intentional </em>or <em>criminal </em>act. We find our analysis of \"expected injuries\u201d in <em>DiCicco </em>equally applicable in the context of this case. Therefore, we hold that \"expected,\u201d within the context of \"reasonably be expected,\u201d connotes the same meaning as it does in \"expected or intended.\u201d An insurer may obviate its duty to defend and indemnify under the exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>sion in the present case if the resulting injury was the natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated result of the intentional or criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-6\">Alonda Freeman further argues that we must determine \"expectation\u201d from her subjective viewpoint. While there is a line of authority which appears to support this view under the \"expected or intended\u201d exclusion in other jurisdictions, we do not choose to follow it.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Rather, we find that \"reasonably be expected\u201d is unambiguous, and therefore, requires application of an objective standard of expectation.</p>\n<p id=\"b932-7\">In support of this conclusion, we find that the exclusion also excludes coverage for injuries \"actually intended by an insured person.\u201d In our opinion, this section of the exclusion requires application of a subjective standard. As we stated in <em>DiCicco, </em>we will give effect to all words in an insurance contract if they serve a reasonable purpose. We are persuaded that Allstate included both phrases in order to reinforce its intent to exclude both \"objectively expected injuries\u201d and \"subjectively intended injuries.\u201d Therefore, we agree with the Court of Appeals that, under the Allstate exclusion, \"reasonably he\u201d immediately preceding \"expected,\u201d in addition to the omission of \"from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d requires application of an <em>objective </em>test of \"expectation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b932-8\">Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals that a reasonable person would expect injury to result from the shooting incident in this case. As the Court of Appeals stated, \"we agree with the principle that 'some acts . . . \"are so nearly certain to produce injury that intent or expectation to injure should be inferred as a matter of law.\u201d \u2019\" <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 356; <em>MacKinnon v Hanover Ins Co, </em>124 NH 456, 460; 471 A2d 1166 (1984); <em>Barton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"689\">*689</page-number>v <em>Allstate Ins Co, supra. </em>For example, <em>Barton </em>involved a shooting incident and implicated the identical exclusionary clause involved in this case. The insured and wife were separated. At 4:00 a.m. one morning, he went to her home and found a man hiding in her bathroom. The insured took out his .357 magnum revolver and shot through the bathroom door, injuring the man. However, the insured claimed he intended to open the door and not to injure the boyfriend. The court held that the exclusion applied because it found that the insured intentionally (intentional act) fired the gun and, therefore, he should have been aware that \"it was substantially certain [reasonably be expected] that the person behind the door would be injured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-4\">Similarly, the shooting incident in this case constitutes such an act. The uncontroverted testimony showed that after the initial fight with Kelly ended, Alonda Freeman reentered her home, retrieved a loaded .38 caliber handgun, and returned outside to confront Kelly. Then, without issuing a warning, Alonda Freeman shot towards Kelly from a close distance. A motion for summary disposition is proper under the facts of the instant case. MCR 2.116(0(10). It would be patently disingenuous to say that injury would not be reasonably expected from the shooting incident. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 356; <em>Linebaugh, supra </em>at 760-761; <em>Cannon, supra </em>at 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-5\">Therefore, for the reasons discussed above, we affirm the Court of Appeals holding that under the intentional-act exclusion of the Freemans\u2019 policy, Allstate had no duty to defend or indemnify Alonda Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-6\">C. SUMMARY DISPOSITION MOTION\u2014MARSHALL FREEMAN</p>\n<p id=\"b933-7\">Next, we address Marshall Freeman\u2019s argument <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>that Allstate must defend him against the Kelly suit. Marshall Freeman raises two arguments. First, that Allstate has a separate and distinct duty to cover each insured under the policy, and, therefore, its duty to defend depends solely upon his conduct. And, second, that the policy language, \"an insured,\u201d is ambiguous and, therefore, must be construed in favor of the insured. The Court of Appeals rejected both contentions and held that Allstate did not have a duty to defend Marshall Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">With respect to Marshall Freeman\u2019s first argument, we agree with the Court of Appeals analyses holding that \"[w]hile we agree with Kelly and the Freemans that, under the policy, Allstate has a separate and distinct duty to cover each of the insureds, we nonetheless agree with the trial court that in this case any duty to defend Marshall Freeman is solely derivative of the duty to defend Alonda Freeman under the policy.\u201d <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 357. Although the Court determined that the claim against Marshall Freeman was essentially one of negligent entrustment, \"where an insurance policy exclusion precludes coverage for the particular injury, then it also excludes coverage for negligent entrustment of the instrumentality that caused the injury. In other words, we look to the underlying cause of the injury to determine coverage and not to the specific theory of liability.\u201d <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 357-358. See <em>Illinois Employers Ins of Wausau v Dragovich, supra </em>at 507; <em>Shepard Marine Construction Co v Maryland Casualty Co, supra </em>at 65. For example, in <em>Michigan Mutual Ins Co v Sunstrum, </em>111 Mich App 98; 315 NW2d 154 (1981), Timothy Sunstrum suffered severe injuries in an automobile accident while riding in a truck owned by Warren Priesman and driven by, his son, Michael. Although Michael was uninsured, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"691\">*691</page-number>Warren had automobile insurance for the truck through Associated General Insurance Company, a subsidiary of Michigan Mutual Insurance Company. Michigan Mutual also provided homeowner\u2019s insurance for Warren Priesman\u2019s residence. Timothy Sunstrum brought an action alleging that Warren Priesman negligently entrusted the truck to his son. The Court of Appeals, <em>supra </em>at 103-104 denied coverage holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b935-4\">Other jurisdictions which have denied coverage have done so after concluding that negligent entrustment of a motor vehicle, as a cause of action, is derived from the more general concepts of ownership, use or operation of a motor vehicle. These decisions have reasoned that although the act of negligently entrusting a motor vehicle is an essential (if not the primary) element of the tort, liability giving rise to the tort is not actually triggered until the motor vehicle is used in a negligent manner resulting in injury. These jurisdictions have concluded that because the accident occurred off the homeowner\u2019s premises and resulted from the use or operation of a motor vehicle, the clear language of the exclusionary clause disavows coverage. [Citations omitted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See also <em>Allstate Ins Co v Goldwater, </em>163 Mich App 646, 649; 415 NW2d 2 (1987); <em>State Farm Fire &amp; Casualty Co v Huyghe, </em>144 Mich App 341; 375 NW2d 442 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">We also find <em>Allstate Ins Co v Goldwater, supra, </em>a recent Court of Appeals decision, particularly instructive. In <em>Goldwater, </em>two minors, Ronald Goldwater and Robbie Buchte, collided while rid<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>ing their dirt bikes. The Buchtes sued the Goldwaters for negligent operation of a motor bike. They also sued Ronald Goldwater\u2019s father under a negligent-entrustment theory. Plaintiff, the Goldwater\u2019s insurer (Allstate Insurance Company), filed a declaratory action, seeking a determination that it had no duty to defend and indemnify the Goldwaters. The Court of Appeals held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">[The Goldwater\u2019s homeowner\u2019s insurance] excludes coverage for an accident involving a motorized land vehicle designed for recreational use off public roads, owned by an insured, that occurred away from the residence premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">Since plaintiff has no duty to defend the claim against Ronald Goldwater for negligent use of the dirt bike, it has no duty to defend his father on the claim of negligent entrustment. <em>[Id. </em>at 649.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-7\">Similarly, in the instant case, the Court of Appeals concluded that the exclusion focused on \"bodily injury\u201d and that Alonda Freeman\u2019s conduct precluded coverage under the policy. We agree. Therefore, Allstate has no duty to defend Marshall Freeman because it has no duty to defend Alonda Freeman\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-8\">However, Marshall Freeman also contends that the exclusion is ambiguous as applied to him because \"an insured\u201d could mean either \"that insured,\u201d \"the insured,\u201d or \"any insured.\u201d Whereas, plaintiff contends that \"an insured\u201d means \"any insured.\u201d The policy exclusion provides, in pertinent part: \"[w]e do not cover any bodily injury or property damage which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person . . . .\u201d Any ambiguity must be construed in favor of the insured. Thus, we agree that if \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous, then Allstate must defend Marshall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>Freeman because \"the insured\u201d or \"that insured\u201d would refer to criminal or intentional acts of that particular insured, and in this case, Alonda Freeman. <em>American States Ins Co v Borbor, </em>826 F2d 888, 894 (CA 9, 1987); <em>Western Casualty &amp; Surety Co v Aponaug Mfg Co, </em>197 F2d 673, 674 (CA 5, 1952); <em>Arenson v Nat'l Automobile &amp; Casualty Ins Co, </em>45 Cal 2d 81; 286 P2d 816 (1955); <em>Unigard Mutual Ins Co, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\">The crux of Marshall Freeman\u2019s argument adopts the reasoning asserted by the dissenting opinion in the Court of Appeals decision. <em>Freeman, supra </em>at 361.

However, Margaret argued that the claims against her only involved negligence,<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> and, therefore, the Allstate policy required Allstate to defend her in the underlying action. Further, she advanced an argument identical to that of Marshall Freeman, namely, that \"the term 'an insured person\u2019 connotes the singular, not the plural, and therefore applies only to the insured committing the willful act.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 454. However, the court rejected her contention:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">Recently, a California appellate court was faced with a similar problem of policy interpretation. In <em>Allstate Ins Co v Condon, [supra], </em>an automobile insurance policy excluded coverage of certain automobiles \"available or furnished for the regular use 'of a person insured.\u2019 \u201d The issue was whether \"a person insured\u201d should be interpreted to mean only the named insured or to include additional insureds under the policy. The court held that \"a person insured\u201d was functionally equivalent to the terms \"any insured\u201d and \"an insured,\u201d and \"logically refers to any one of all the persons insured under the policy\u201d (as distinguished from \"the insured\u201d which refers only to a particular insured). . . . We agree with <em>Condon </em>that \"an insured\u201d refers to all insureds under the policy. <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">We adopt the analysis of the <em>Gilbert </em>court and hold \"that by excluding insurance coverage for injury or damage intentionally caused by 'an insured person,\u2019 Allstate unambiguously excluded coverage for damages caused by the intentional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>wrongful act of <em>any </em>insured under the policies.\u201d <em>Gilbert, supra </em>at 454 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">While Justice Archer attempts to distinguish <em>Gilbert, </em>his effort misses the mark. We are persuaded that a proper analysis of <em>Gilbert, </em>the cases upon which it relied, and a correct usage of the English language mandates that this Court adopt the conclusion advanced by plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-6\">Justice Archer contends that in <em>Gilbert </em>the court reversed its holding in <em>American States Ins Co v Borbor, supra. </em>We find this conclusion untenable for several reasons. First, Justice Archer uses the following quote from <em>Borbor </em>out of context: \"Judge Thompson, who wrote <em>Gilbert, </em>stated that '[h]ad <em>American States </em>intended that the wrongful act of <em>any </em>insured would void the policy, it could have unambiguously drafted and included such language in the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>pp 734-735. We agree with this quotation as applied in the context of the <em>Borbor </em>opinion. In <em>Borbor, </em>the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit addressed the issue whether an insurance policy covered defendants as individuals, a partnership, or both. The court addressed the limited interpretation of the meaning of \"the insured,\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> and concluded that if the insurer intended \"any insured\u201d it could have unambiguously drafted such language. The <em>Borbor </em>court, and the cases which it relied upon, <em>never </em>distinguished, nor had reason to distinguish, the term \"an insured\u201d from \"any insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">The <em>Gilbert </em>court never contested the validity of this proposition. However, Justice Archer, in his effort to distinguish <em>Gilbert, </em>extrapolates from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number><em>Borbor </em>court\u2019s opinion the conclusion that it also held that \"[t]he court reasoned that no uncertainty or ambiguity would have existed if the policy exclusion would have referred to 'any insured\u2019 rather than 'an insured.\u2019 \u201d <em>Post, </em>p 735. We disagree that <em>Borbor </em>even remotely supports this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">In fact, the only authority cited by the <em>Borbor </em>court, which analyzed the relationship between \"an insured\u201d and \"any insured,\u201d distinguished \"the insured\u201d from \"a,\u201d \"any,\u201d <em>or </em>\"an\u201d insured and, therefore, supports the position advanced by plaintiff. <em>Borbor, supra </em>at 894 (emphasis added) quoting Comment, <em>Spouse\u2019s fraud as a bar to insurance recovery, </em>21 Wm &amp; Mary L R 543, 549-554 (1979). If the <em>Borbor </em>court intended to distinguish \"an insured\u201d from \"any insured,\u201d then it would have done so rather than citing authority which equated the two terms. Accordingly, we disagree with Justice Archer that the <em>Gilbert </em>court retreated from its position in <em>Borbor.</em><footnotemark><em>30</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Rather, we believe that <em>Borbor </em>supports the conclusion reached by Judge Thompson in <em>Gilbert.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">Justice Archer also concludes that \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous because <em>Gilbert </em>sought guidance from <em>Allstate Ins Co v Condon, supra </em>which, in turn, drew support from a provision of the California Insurance Code. <em>Post, </em>p 734. Although we agree that <em>Gilbert </em>sought guidance from <em>Condon </em>and that <em>Condon </em>drew support from the insurance code, we disagree that this suggests that \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">In <em>Condon, </em>an exclusion in the insurance policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"697\">*697</page-number>precluded coverage for nonowned automobiles that were \" 'available or furnished for the regular use of a <em>person insured.\u2019\u201d Condon, supra </em>at 152 (emphasis added). The court rejected the <em>Condon </em>argument that \"a person insured\u201d was ambiguous and unequivocally held that \"a person insured\u201d means \"any insured\u201d and not \"the insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">However, Justice Archer finds \"it instructive\u201d that the <em>Condon </em>court drew upon a statutory provision to support its holding that \"an insured\u201d means \"any insured.\u201d We agree and rely upon the specific wording of the <em>Condon </em>opinion to determine the significance of the court\u2019s reference to the insurance code. As the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-5\">\"A person insured\u201d in the Allstate policy has a plural connotation similar to \"any insured.\u201d \"A person insured\u201d logically refers to any one of all the persons insured under the policy. There is no logical method to construe the phrase as singling out any particular insured person within the coverage of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (c)(8) <em>provides another analogous definition. [Condon, supra </em>at 153. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Thus, the court <em>drew support </em>from the insurance code <em>only after already concluding in the preceding paragraph </em>that \"a person insured\u201d unambiguously meant \"any insured.\u201d Accordingly, we find that the <em>Condon </em>court referred to the insurance code for exactly the purpose which it stated, nam\u00e9ly, that it \"provide[d] another analogous definition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Even assuming that we agreed with Justice Archer\u2019s analysis of the interrelationship between <em>Gilbert, Condon, </em>and the insurance code, we disagree with the conclusions drawn from that relationship. We note that the California code is part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"698\">*698</page-number>of every insurance policy written in California and is \"equivalent to an exclusionary clause in the policy.\u201d <em>Borbor, supra </em>at 894 (citations omitted). This Court has held that the omission of a definition from an insurance policy does not render that term ambiguous. In this respect, we note that insurance law in California differs from many other states, including Michigan, because the California Insurance Code codifies many seemingly obvious and well-established principles of insurance law. If we adopted the analysis of Justice Archer in the instant case, we would preclude ourselves from drawing upon cases involving the interpretation of insurance policy provisions merely because the California Legislature codified them. We cannot agree that \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous because the California Legislature defined a term in a code which it considers the equivalent of a policy exclusion, whereas, plaintiff in the instant case did not define the same, unambiguous terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Furthermore, we agree with those decisions that reach the same conclusion as <em>Gilbert </em>by relying upon a correct usage of the English language. See <em>Allstate Ins Co v Foster, supra </em>at 889. This case does not present a situation in which the particular word in question has several meanings. See <em>Shumake v Travelers Ins Co, </em>147 Mich App 600, 607-608; 383 NW2d 259 (1985). Rather, this case involves the interpretation of a word in which sources uniformly define \"an\u201d as an indefinite article. For example, the <em>Foster </em>court stated that, \" '[a]\u2019 or 'an\u2019 is an indefinite article often used in the sense of 'any\u2019 and applied to more than one individual object; whereas 'the\u2019 is an article which particularizes the subject spoken of.\u201d <em>Foster, supra </em>at 889; Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed); The American Heritage Dictionary (2d ed, 1982). See <em>Brooks v Zabka, </em>168 Colo 265, 268-270; 450 P2d 653 (1969); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number><em>People v Enlow, </em>135 Colo 249, 261-263; 310 P2d 539 (1957); comment, <em>supra </em>at 551. We agree. Strong public policy supports this decision. Adherence to a correct usage of the English language in insurance contract construction promotes a uniform, reliable, and reasonable foundation upon which policyholders and insurers alike may rely when they enter into a contractual agreement. In the instant case, if we place the word \"a\u201d or \"an\u201d in front of the word \"insured,\u201d then we must conclude that \"an insured\u201d unambiguously means \"any insured.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Accordingly, we hold that under the policy exclusion in the instant case, \"an insured\u201d unambiguously refers to \"any insured.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> As we have previously held: \"The expectation that a contract will be enforceable other than according to its terms surely may not be said to be reasonable.\u201d <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, supra </em>at 362; <em>Klym v Nida, </em>147 Mich App 709, 713; 383 NW2d 93 (1985). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number>We base our decision today upon an interpretation of the insurance policy and not upon a factual dispute.

SUMMARY</p>\n<p id=\"A9U\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">In <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>we hold that Allstate\u2019s exclusionary clause requires application of a two-part objective test. An insurer may relieve itself of its duty to defend and provide coverage if (1) the insured acted <em>either </em>intentionally <em>or </em>criminally, and (2) the resulting injuries occurred as the natural, foreseeable, expected, and anticipated result of an insured\u2019s intentional acts. We also hold that \"an insured\u201d unambiguously refers to \"all\u201d or \u201cany\u201d insureds under the homeowner\u2019s policy. Accordingly, we affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Freeman.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">In <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>we hold that the claimed incident constituted an \"occurrence\u201d under the coverage provision of the insured\u2019s policy. We also hold that an insurer need not prove that the insured acted intentionally in order to avoid its duty to defend and indemnify under the present exclusion. However, unlike a majority of this Court, we would hold that, in order to avoid its duty to defend and indemnify under the exclusion, the insurer must show that an objective insured \"intended or expected\u201d injury to result from those acts. Therefore, we would reverse the decision of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>Appeals in <em>DiCicco </em>and reinstate the decision of the trial court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b945-4\">Griffin, J., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">Boyle, J. I agree with the analyses and conclusions of Chief Justice Riley in <em>Freeman, </em>but write separately to express my views in <em>DiCicco, </em>viz., that Metropolitan Property and Liability Insurance Company has a duty to defend on these facts, although it may yet emerge that Metropolitan is not liable to indemnify DiCicco.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">THE ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b945-8\">We are initially faced with the most basic of tasks for any appellate court\u2014that of discerning the issue before the Court. While the issue presented by the parties is whether Metropolitan has a duty to <em>defend, </em>it often appears in the opinion of the Chief Justice that the issue is whether Metropolitan has a duty to <em>indemnify.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>As explained in one treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b945-9\">A duty to defend is contractual and if there is no contract to defend there is no duty to defend. The policy sets forth the duty to defend as primarily giving rise to the insured\u2019s reasonable expectation of protection. Therefore, a duty to defend may exist even though an exclusion would be sufficient to bar the insurer\u2019s duty to pay a claim. [14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 51:35, pp 444-445.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">Because the duty to defend, like the duty to indemnify, is contractual, any delineation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>scope of the duty to defend without reference to the policy itself must be viewed as a mere generality. Indeed, even the delineation quoted above may be too sweeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">However, the importance of distinguishing between the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify extends beyond analysis of the policy language itself. A complaint against an insured may state facts within policy coverage, outside policy coverage, or partly within or partly outside policy coverage. See, generally, 14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7\u00a7 51:44-51:47, pp 458-487. Moreover, it may well be that a conflict will emerge between the alleged and known facts. Again, as explained in the treatise:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">The general rule\u2014that is, that the determination of whether or not the claim made against the insured is one which by the terms of the contract the insurer is required to defend depends upon the facts stated in the complaint or petition in the action against the insured\u2014does not take into account the possibility that a divergence may exist between the facts as alleged in the petition and the actual facts as they are known to, or ascertainable by, the insurer. The few cases in which the existence of such a divergence was discussed do not show a uniform result. Some of them take the view that allegations in the complaint or petition remain determinative of the insurer\u2019s duty to defend even though the actual facts are to the contrary, while other cases apparently favor the opposite view and hold that the insurer should not look exclusively to the allegations of the complaint or petition in the proceedings against the insured but is to be guided by the actual facts of which it has knowledge. The duty of the insurer to defend should be fixed by the facts which the insurer learns from the complaint, the insured, or other sources. It has the duty to defend its insured whenever it ascertains facts which give rise to the [potential] of liability under the policy. Thus, an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>insurer under a comprehensive personal liability policy obligating it to defend suits alleging bodily injury but excluding coverage as to injury caused intentionally by the insured was obligated to defend an action alleging intentional assault since there was a possibility that damages obtained were covered by the indemnity provisions of the policy in that injured party could have amended to allege negligent conduct and insured might have been able to show a defense of self-defense so that any injury was not willful and intended. <em>[Id., </em>\u00a751:51, pp 495-501.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">Nevertheless, whether the complaint against the insured states facts within or outside the scope of coverage, whether the dispositive facts are those pled or known, we must eventually return to the language of the policy itself to decide whether there is a duty to defend.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This very basic question is not one of public policy, but whether the insurer has contractually bound itself to provide a defense. In contrast, once a duty to defend is found, public policy comes to bear upon exercise of the duty by the insured:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b947-6\">Under liability or indemnity policies in which the insurer assumes the duty of defending or settling suits or claims against the insured, this obligation is one requiring due care and a strict performance in utmost good faith. In such case, the insurer owes the duty to exercise reasonable care in conducting the defense, and is liable for damages resulting to the insured by reason of its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>negligence in performing such duty. [14 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 51:78, pp 565-566.][<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">It is particularly easy in this case to blend the contractual duty to <em>defend </em>with the duty to <em>indemnify, </em>because both forms of coverage are set forth in the same policy language. The trial court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-6\">There is no dispute that as of the date of the incident David DiCicco was an insured under a homeowner\u2019s insurance policy issued by Plaintiff, Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Insurance Company, to David DiCicco\u2019s parents. It is also undis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>puted that the policy language in pertinent part [specifies]:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-4\">Section ii</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJP\">Coverages:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-5\">Coverage f\u2014personal liability</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYeV\">Metropolitan will pay on behalf of the insured all sums which the insured shall become legally obligated to pay as damages because of bodily injury sustained by other persons or property damage, to which this insurance applies, caused by an occurrence. Metropolitan shall have the right and duty, at its own expense, to defend with attorneys selected by and compensated by Metropolitan, any suit against the insured seeking damages on account of such bodily injury or property damage even if any of the allegations of the suit are groundless, false or fraudulent. . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-6\">Exclusions applicable to section ii</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AWen\">Metropolitan does not insure:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-7\">1. Under coverage f\u2014personal liability . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AH8\">f. Bodily injury or property damage which is</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-8\">EITHER EXPECTED OR INTENDED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE INSURED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-9\">Plaintiff advises the Court through its brief that the policy further states:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-10\">Definitions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-11\">Occurrence means an accident, including injurious exposure to conditions, which results, during the policy term, in bodily injury or property damage.[<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">In this case it is undisputed that the duty to defend is coextensive with the duty to indemnify, at least insofar as the operative facts are the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>for both coverages.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, the operative facts may be quite divergent, because the duty to indemnify arises only after liability is found in the underlying claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">The declaratory judgment action of the insurer with which we are presently concerned was tried without a jury by the stipulation of the parties on the basis of deposition transcripts and the written arguments of counsel. Thus, although our resolution of this matter is based upon the findings of the trial court, see opinion of Chief Justice Riley, <em>ante, </em>p 665, different facts may yet emerge at trial on the underlying claim. At this point, we know only that DiCicco has denied \"any intent to use the knife\u201d and that Gravenmier \"did not expect DiCicco would use the knife\u201d in an actual stabbing. See opinion of Chief Justice Riley, <em>ante, </em>p 664. It is within this factual framework that we must resolve the limited coverage question of the duty to defend.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">A. INTRINSIC ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b950-8\">I agree that the incident in the instant case is not so \"clear cut\u201d as to allow us to conclude that there was no \"occurrence.\u201d Thus, I believe that the next logical step is to determine whether \"such bodily injury\u201d unambiguously falls within the ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>elusion of \u00a7 1(f).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> I am assisted in this task by this Court\u2019s own opinions and the policy language at issue. In <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co, </em>412 Mich 355, 361-362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982), we explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-5\">Any clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous and not in contravention of public policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">A contract is said to be ambiguous when its words may reasonably be understood in different ways.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-7\">If a fair reading of the entire contract of insurance leads one to understand that there is coverage under particular circumstances and another fair reading of it leads one to understand there is no coverage under the same circumstances the contract is ambiguous and should be construed against its drafter and in favor of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-8\">Yet, if a contract, however inartfully worded or clumsily arranged, fairly admits of but one interpretation it may not be said to be ambiguous or, indeed, fatally unclear._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>To emphasize the relevant policy language, it excludes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b952-4\">Bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">There are no complex or contradictory provisions in this exclusion. Moreover, it is difficult to justify a search for ambiguity in this provision as a whole, since neither party nor either of the other opinions of the Court suggests one which might preclude coverage.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The Chief Justice reasons that the use of both \"intended\u201d and \"expected\u201d unambiguously requires an objective construction of \"expected\u201d in order to avoid a superfluous reading of the latter. However, this reading ignores the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d which, by the absence of a comma following \"expected,\u201d presumably modifies both \"expected\u201d and \"intended.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Cf. <em>Buntz v General American Life Ins Co, </em>136 Pa Super 284; 7 A2d 93 (1939). See, generally, 2 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 15:13, pp 156-157 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>(the punctuation in an insurance policy may be resorted to as an aid in construction, although the construction according to strict rules of grammar does not prevail over the intent of the parties as shown by the whole instrument). See also 3 Cor-bin, Contracts, \u00a7 549, pp 183-186 (contracts are to be interpreted and their legal effects determined as a whole). Indeed, the Chief Justice does not dispute that the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d modifies both words, but instead reasons that the phrases \"expected\u201d and \"intended\u201d are alternatives and \" '[p]robing one\u2019s state of mind is an elusive task ....\u2019\u201d <em>Ante, </em>p 677. Quoting with approval <em>Truck Ins Exchange v Pickering, </em>642 SW2d 113, 116 (Mo App, 1982). Again, I find the case law instructive, but of little use in an intrinsic analysis for ambiguity.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-4\">Perhaps most instructive is a comparison of Metropolitan\u2019s exclusion with one which all members of this Court agree creates an objective standard. The Allstate exclusion specifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b953-5\">We do not cover any bodily injury or property damage which <em>may reasonably be expected </em>to result from the intentional or criminal acts of an insured person or which is in fact intended by an insured person. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b953-6\">In the Allstate exclusion, the addition of the word \"reasonably\u201d clearly imparts an objective standard in contrast to \"in fact intended.\u201d In contrast, the absence of the word \"reasonably\u201d coupled with the modifying clause \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d clearly imparts a subjective standard in the Metropolitan exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-7\">I do not believe that a fair reading of the Metropolitan exclusion would support an objective standard and therefore conclude that the policy lan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>guage is unambiguously subjective. Moreover, given that all members of this Court agree that the exclusion is unambiguous, I believe that it is unnecessary to belabor the point. I would therefore apply the exclusion in its plain and easily understood sense. <em>Wertman v Michigan Mutual Liability Co, </em>267 Mich 508, 510; 255 NW 418 (1934).</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">To apply the exclusion in its plain and easily understood sense, we need only determine whether Gravenmier\u2019s injury was either expected or intended from the standpoint of DiCicco. In doing so, we must apply the facts as found by the trial court. See the opinion of the Chief Justice, <em>ante, </em>p 664. Most relevant in this regard are the following findings of the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b954-6\">DiCicco denies any intent to use the knife, claiming that he went to get the knife merely to scare away the other persons he considered to be a threat. No one observed him make a gesture of moving the knife as though to stab Gravenmier. The knife was held in his right hand and the poking was done with his left. DiCicco denies knowledge of in fact stabbing. Immediately following the stabbing, DiCicco looked shocked. Gravenmier obviously did not expect DiCicco would use the knife or he would not have engaged in his act of bravado.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">It is obvious that these findings will not require the conclusion that DiCicco expected or intended to injure Gravenmier. I therefore conclude that the plaintiff insurer has failed to establish that the \u00a7 1(f) exclusion is relevant. Metropolitan is bound, by the general coverage provision, the unambigu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>ous language of its own policy, to provide a defense to DiCicco in the underlying claim.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Again, I emphasize that this disposition of the declaratory judgment claim involves no determination of Metropolitan\u2019s duty to indemnify. If it is established in the underlying claim that DiCicco intended or expected to injure Gravenmier, Metropolitan may yet have a defense to indemnification.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">B. EXTRINSIC ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">As this Court has long held, insurers in drafting policies must use language which is clear and understandable to laymen. See, e.g., <em>Wadsworth v New York Life Ins Co, </em>349 Mich 240, 259; 84 NW2d 513 (1957); <em>Century Indemnity Co v Schmick, </em>351 Mich 622, 627; 88 NW2d 622 (1958). This is simply correlative of the rule that technical constructions of policies are not favored and exceptions to the general liability provided for in a policy are to be strictly construed against the insurer. <em>Francis v Scheper, </em>326 Mich 441, 448; 40 NW2d 214 (1949). See, generally, 2 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 15:74, pp 334-357. Both rules stem from the presumption that the parties to a contract of insurance fully understand the provisions. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 15:12, pp 155-156. Since an insured is charged with knowledge of the provisions of the policy, <em>Cleaver v Traders\u2019 Ins Co, </em>71 Mich 414, 417; 39 NW 571 (1888), 2 Couch, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 15:14, pp 157-159, it reasonably follows that insurers must draft policies in language which is clear and understandable to laymen.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>I have concluded that Metropolitan failed to draft its exclusion so as to clearly preclude a duty to defend DiCicco. Indeed, I have concluded that the policy clearly and unambiguously requires the insurer to provide a defense on these facts. Thus, there is no need to resort to extrinsic evidence to ascertain the meaning of the exclusion. <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 15:57, pp 298-302. (Since all prior negotiations are assumed to be merged in the written contract, the policy itself constitutes the contract between the parties, and, if the meaning is clear, it alone must be looked to in construction.)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, assuming arguendo that an ambiguity exists and therefore that extrinsic evidence is admissible, I would nevertheless hold that Metropolitan has a duty to defend under this policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">Perhaps the most common of extrinsic aids to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>the construction of an insurance policy or other contract are usage and custom. See <em>id., </em>\u00a7 15:60, pp 307-308; 3 Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 555, pp 228-239. It is in this light that I have reviewed the large number of cases from foreign jurisdictions cited by the parties. It is, of course, possible that the reasoning of other courts would also add insight into relevant methods of intrinsic analysis. Moreover, it is possible that the weight of authority may be of use in resolving an ambiguity.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, the sheer weight of authority cannot create an ambiguity in the plain and ordinary meaning of the policy language where none would otherwise exist. Again, we charge the insured with knowledge of the policy provisions. We do not charge the insured with the accumulated knowledge of a law library. As explained by Professor Corbin:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-5\">When a member of a trade or profession makes a contract with one who is not a member, a usage or custom is not operative against the latter unless he in fact knows it or has such reason to know it that the member reasonably believes that he knows it. This is true even though the transaction is one that regularly occurs within the trade or profession. [3 Corbin, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 557, p 248.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Here, there is no evidence that the insured in fact knew or had reason to know of a usage apart from the plain or ordinary meaning of the words of the exclusion. Thus, in reviewing the case law as to usage, I am only assuming arguendo both that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>policy language requires extrinsic analysis <em>and </em>that it is relevant to the interpretation of the policy language in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">As explained in the opinion of Justice Archer, standard policy language prior to 1966 included coverage for bodily injury or property which was \"accidental.\u201d See opinion of Justice Archer, <em>post, </em>pp 723-725. This was interpreted to exclude coverage for \"expected or intended\u201d injury, but two problems arose.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">The first problem with the \"expected or intended\u201d interpretation was whether it should be viewed from the standpoint of the injured party or from that of the insured. As one commentator has explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-7\">A split of authority existed prior to the 1966 revisions as to whether the happening of an accident must be determined from the standpoint of the insured or from the standpoint of the victim. Where the question of accident is viewed from the standpoint of the victim, it seems obvious that almost all instances of personal injury or property damage would appear to be accidents. The victim of an assault or other personal injury or property damage generally does not intend or expect it to happen. [Rynearson, <em>supra, Exclusion of expected or intended personal injury or property damage under the occurrence de\u00f1nition of the standard comprehensive general liability policy. </em>19 Forum 513, 521-522 (1984). See also anno: <em>Liability insurance: Assault as an \u2019\u2019accident,\u201d or injuries, therefrom as \u201daccidentally\u201d sustained, within coverage clause, </em>72 ALR3d 1090, \u00a7 4, p 1100.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">Obviously, interpretation of the policy language to require only that the injury be \"expected or intended from the standpoint of the injured party\u201d greatly expanded the liability of the insurer.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-9\">A second, and relatively minor problem, arose in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>interpretations of the pre-1966 language regarding whether \"accidental, expected or intended\u201d injuries must be measured by the act or the result. As explained by Rynearson:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-4\">The primary split in authority involved a question of whether or not an insured would be barred by the \"foreseeable\u201d or \"expected\u201d consequences of his act or conduct. A distinction was made between intentional acts and intentional results, with the emphasis being on the result, and not the act which brought about the result. <em>Thus, one had to have either foreseen or intended the results of his act in order to bar coverage. </em>The term \"expected\u201d was not necessarily equated with the term \"foreseeable\u201d and could denote a different degree of anticipation of damage from a particular course of action. [Rynearson, <em>supra, </em>19 Forum 518. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">As can be seen from Rynearson\u2019s discussion, although \"foreseen\u201d and \"intended\u201d acts may denote different degrees of anticipation, either may be viewed from the standpoint of the insured. A split of authority had nevertheless developed over the use of a subjective or an objective test.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-6\">The 1966 revisions were clearly designed to remedy the split of authority as to whether the accidental nature of the injury was to be measured from the standpoint of the insured or from that of the injured party:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b959-7\">Prior to 1966, the language employed to achieve a similar \"exclusion\u201d objective had been, generally, \"bodily injury or property damage caused intentionally by or at the direction of the insured.\u201d The courts had experienced difficulties with this latter language insofar as it was being used to clarify the concepts of \"accident\u201d or \"accidental means,\u201d as those concepts appeared in policies prior to 1966. The view that \"caused intention<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>ally,\u201d as an amplification of the circumstances that constituted an \"accident\u201d or \"accidental means,\u201d signified that the prospective [sic] was to be from the standpoint of the victim, had been rejected, for the reason that it is the state of the will of the person by whose agency the injury was caused rather than that of the injured person which determines whether an injury was accidental. However, this approach was characterized as a form of punishment to the wrongdoer, and it ignored the fact that insurance also is for the benefit of injured victims of accident. For this reason, others considered the resulting injury from the point of view of the victim, and if it was accidental from that point of view, the loss would be covered by the liability insurance issued to the actor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b960-6\">It appeared that the change of language now under scrutiny, which emerged from the 1966 \"revision\u201d undertaking, had reference to this agreement as to perspective, and that one of its purposes was to make more specific the concept of \"accident\u201d contained in the definition of \"occurrence.\u201d It was stressed that the phrasing \"from the standpoint of the Insured\u201d seemed designed to make plain that the \"accident\u201d component of an \"occurrence\u201d is to be evaluated from the perspective of the insured rather than of the injured victim. [Anno: <em>Construction and application of provision of liability insurance policy expressly excluding injuries intended or expected by insured, </em>31 ALR4th 957, 972. See also 34 ALR4th 761 (acts of self-defense as within the same exclusion), and 35 ALR4th 1063 (criminal conviction as falling within the same exclusion).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b960-8\">While the 1966 revision, adopting the language of dispute in this proceeding, resolved the split of authority as to the viewpoint of the injured or insured, it did nothing to resolve the insurer\u2019s problem as to whether a subjective or objective standard should be employed. Indeed, it made the insurer\u2019s position as to the latter less tenable. As I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>have discussed in part n, intrinsic analysis of the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d imparts a subjective meaning to the words \"expected or intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-4\">Parenthetically, it might be argued that the prepositional phrase, \"from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d should be read to modify the antecedent \"intended.\u201d See 2 Couch, Insurance, 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 15:13, pp 156-157. Thus, the word expected might be given an objective meaning in contrast to \"intended,\u201d i.e., \"reasonably expected.\u201d However, under such a reading, the word \"expected\u201d might yet be viewed from the standpoint of the injured party. Indeed, had the insured insisted that the qualifying phrase be applied only to \"intended,\u201d viewing \"expected\u201d from the standpoint of the injured party would appear to be the most reasonable reading of the modified exclusion in an intrinsic analysis. Needless to say, it is not a reading that the insurer has suggested nor does it appear to be one that the insurer would prefer. Therefore, even in light of the extrinsic evidence, I would adopt a reading of the exclusion under which the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d qualifies both \"expected\u201d and \"intended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">Clearly, extrinsic analysis establishes that the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d was not <em>principally </em>intended by the insurer to convey a subjective standard. However, it must be conceded that the insurer was aware of the split of authority regarding a subjective or objective standard. Subsequently, language was adopted by the insurer which solved one coverage issue while weakening the insurer\u2019s position as to another. That is, the insurer accepted a clause imparting a subjective standard in order to clarify that the accidental nature of the injury must be viewed from the standpoint of the insured. In this light, the contin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>uing argument as to an intent to employ an objective standard is commensurately weakened.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-4\">The insurer\u2019s argument is weakened further when it is considered that alternative language might have placed them in a better position as to both coverage questions, as illustrated by the language employed by Allstate in the companion case.</p>\n<p id=\"b962-5\">There are presently two distinguishable classes of cases under the standard exclusion used by Metropolitan. First, there is the class of cases involving an intended act, but unintended injury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b962-6\">The courts in a number of jurisdictions have adopted the view that the injury or damage is \"caused intentionally\u201d within the meaning of an intentional injury exclusion clause so as to preclude coverage if the insured intended the act and to cause some kind of bodily injury or damage . . ., with the result that the insurer will not be relieved of its obligations under a liability policy containing the exclusion unless the insurer acted with such specific intent. . . . [T]here is authority explicitly supporting the view that once it is found that harm was intended, it is immaterial that the actual harm caused was of a different character or magnitude from that intended by the insured .... [31 ALR4th at 973.][<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b962-7\">Utilizing a subjective standard for \"expected or intended,\u201d courts have found that there was coverage when the intentional burning of property, but without the intent to injure or cause damage, in fact caused injury or damages. See, e.g., <em>Aetna Ins Co v Janson, </em>60 Ill App 3d 957; 18 Ill Dec 143; 377 NE2d 296 (1978). Similarly, coverage has been found in cases in which guns were intentionally pointed, but the discharge or the striking of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>injured party was unintentional. See, e.g., <em>Vanguard Ins Co v Cantrell, </em>18 Ariz App 486; 503 P2d 962 (1972); <em>Jackson v Lajaunie, </em>253 So 2d 540 (La App, 1971), aflPd in part and rev\u2019d in part on other grounds, 264 La 181; 270 So 2d 859 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b963-4\">Another class of cases involves an intentional act, the result of which injury can only occur.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In these cases, some courts have quite reasonably presumed that the injury was intentional. Thus, in <em>Fireman\u2019s Ins Co v Smith, </em>13 Ark App 250, 253-254; 683 SW2d 234 (1985), cited by the Chief Justice, a wrongful death action was brought against the insured in alleging that the shooting of the victim was \"willful, malicious and intentional.\u201d Since the language of the complaint in the underlying claim was controlling, it could only be presumed that the injury was intended and coverage was excluded. Similarly, in <em>Cavanagh v Ohio Farmer Ins Co, </em>20 Ariz App 38; 509 P2d 1075 (1973), an intent to injure was presumed from the fact that the insured placed a loaded gun to the victim\u2019s head and pulled the trigger. Presumed intent can also be found in <em>CNA Ins Co v McGinnis, </em>282 Ark 90; 666 SW2d 689 (1984), also cited by the Chief Justice. In <em>McGinnis </em>the insured caused injury to his minor stepdaughter through sexual abuse. The court rejected McGinnis\u2019 claim that although the sexual intercourse was intended, no <em>harm </em>was intended. The <em>McGinnis </em>court analogized to <em>Clark v Allstate Ins Co, </em>22 Ariz App 601; 529 P2d 1195 (1975), in which no coverage was found as a matter of law, although the insured denied an intent to injure when striking the victim in the face with a closed fist. As explained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number><em>McGinnis, </em>to claim that the insured did not expect or intend to cause injury \"flies in the face of all reason, common sense and experience.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 93.</p>\n<p id=\"b964-4\">The same cannot be said in this case. While DiCicco did intentionally brandish the knife and further \"poked\u201d Gravenmier in the chest with his other hand, it was apparently Gravenmier\u2019s own act of bravado which immediately preceded the injury. While it is true that facts may yet emerge in the underlying claim which would establish that DiCicco actually expected or intended to stab Gravenmier (as opposed to Gravenmier accidentally being cut), I cannot say on the present facts that the denial of an intent to injure \"flies in the face of all reason, common sense and experience\u201d so that intent to injure may be presumed. I cannot say that brandishing a knife always results in injury\u2014that DiCicco\u2019s actions preclude coverage as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b964-5\">Therefore, assuming arguendo that extrinsic analysis is necessary, it is my conclusion that the trial court improperly granted judgment for the insurer in this action, and I would reverse its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>judgment. However, I would again emphasize that I necessarily take no position as to whether Metropolitan must eventually indemnify DiCicco for injuries caused to Gravenmier.</p>\n<p id=\"b965-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-5\">The insurer has failed to establish either an actual intent to injure Gravenmier or such acts as would allow the court to presume an intent to injure as a matter of law. The trial court therefore erred in granting declaratory judgment for the insurer in this action. I would remand this matter for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b965-6\">Brickley, J., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b905-7\"> Apparently, Justice Boyle believes that we inadvertently referred to the issue in the instant case as \"whether Metropolitan has a duty to <em>indemnify,\u201d </em>and not \"whether [it] has a duty to <em>defend.\u201d Post, </em>p 701. On the contrary, we specifically distinguished the two concepts in section i. Therefore, because we hold that Metropolitan has no duty to defend in the instant case, it necessarily follows that this finding obviates its duty to indemnify DiCicco.

Although she began walking towards the Free-mans\u2019 house, Kefly alleged that she did not make any threats and never encroached upon the Freemans\u2019 property.

Further, she stated that Kelly threatened to kill Alonda and her children. Kelly began walking toward the Freemans\u2019 house.

Although Alonda first thought Kelly held an object in her hands, she stated that she did not see anything when she pulled the trigger.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">Our review of the testimony persuades us that the Court of Appeals was correct in concluding that upon the basis of the evidence and testimony presented, the trial court properly rejected Alonda Freeman\u2019s claim of self-defense. As the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b927-11\">In reviewing a grant or denial of summary disposition under MCR 2.116(0(10), this Court considers the pleadings, affidavits, depositions, admissions and other documentary evidence available to it and gives the benefit of any reasonable doubt and views the evidence in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Wright, [supra </em>at 646.] Considering the evidence under these standards, we must nonetheless reject the Freemans\u2019 self-defense argument. . . .

By clear and unequivocal language in most policies, the insurer has assumed the obligation of relieving its insured of the expense of defending an action alleging and seeking damages within the coverage policy .... Thus, the insured should reasonably expect that the insurer will employ its vast legal and investigative resources to defeat the action for the mutual benefit of both the insurer and the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b948-9\">It has been noted in a number of cases that a conflict arises between the insurer and the insured under the intentional injury exclusion clause, since the insurer would escape liability if the insured\u2019s acts are determined to have been intentionally done to cause injury, and in fact lead to an award of punitive damages against the insured, while the insured would be most interested in having \"coverage\u201d for both the cost of defense and the amount of a judgment rendered against him, if any .... It has been held that the insured is not deprived of his contractual right to have a defense provided by the insurer when a conflict of interest between the two arises under the described circumstances, and it has been suggested that when such a conflict of interest arises, the insured must be informed of the nature of the conflict and given the right either to accept an independent attorney selected by the insurer or to select an attorney himself to conduct his defense; if the insured elects to choose his own attorney, the insurer must assume the reasonable costs of the defense provided. [Anno: <em>Construction and application of provision of liability insurance policy expressly excluding injuries intended or expected by insured, </em>31 ALR4th 957, 976.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b949-13\"> The trial court was also without a copy of the complete policy and additionally noted that the defendant had not admitted that the policy contained the above-quoted definition of \"occurrence.\u201d However, the defendant on appeal has conceded that the definition is contained in the policy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b950-9\"> I do note, but do not base my decision on, the preface to the exclusions applicable to section n: \"Metropolitan does not <em>insure.\u201d </em>Because the common meaning of \"insure\u201d is to <em>indemnify </em>or to secure <em>indemnity, </em>see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 726; <em>The Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged Edition, </em>p 738, it is arguable that the exclusions do not apply to the duty to defend. However, the defendant has not argued this point, nor is it necessary to my decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b951-9\"> I must observe at the outset that I find some irony in the opinion of the Chief Justice insofar as it holds that Gravenmier\u2019s injury constitutes an \"occurrence,\u201d or \"accident,\u201d yet falls within the relevant exclusion. As I read the opinion of the Chief Justice, it adopts the definition of an \"accident\u201d as set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Guerdon Industries v Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co of New York, </em>371 Mich 12, 18-19; 123 NW2d 143 (1963), and adopted by the Court of Appeals in <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Kompus, </em>135 Mich App 667, 678; 354 NW2d 303 (1984), \" 'anything that . . . takes place without the insured\u2019s foresight or expectation and without design or intentional causation on his part.\u2019 \u201d This language exists without reference to \"the standpoint of the insured\u201d\u2014the critical language of exclusion at issue. If as asserted by the Chief Justice, \"expected or intended\u201d must be given an objective meaning, i.e., <em>reasonably </em>expected or intended, it would appear that the definition of \"occurrence\u201d or \"accident\u201d would be the better candidate. I find it difficult to accept a method of interpretation under which the words \"without the insured\u2019s foresight or expectation\u201d are deemed to allow coverage in the absence of a subjective intent, while the words \"either expected or intended from the standpoint of insured\u201d are deemed to unambiguously preclude coverage even in the absence of a subjective intent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b952-7\"> Doubtless, this is at least in part because of the general rule that ambiguities must be resolved in favor of the insured. See <em>Raska, supra. </em>See also <em>Nickerson v Citizens Mutual Ins Co, </em>393 Mich 324, 330; 224 NW2d 896 (1975) (language in an insurance policy is to be strictly construed against the drafter). Nevertheless, an insurer might suggest an unambiguous reading of the actual policy language which supports its conclusion, while leaving it to the courts to find an ambiguity upon the basis of an alternative, fair reading suggested by the insured. The plaintiff-insurer in this instance has not suggested a plain or unambiguous reading of the policy language which supports its position. The defendant insured claims there is an ambiguity, but does not indicate the specific source or nature of the ambiguity.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b952-8\"> Arguably, the prepositional phrase, \"from the standpoint of the insured,\u201d modifies only the last antecedent \"intended.\u201d See 2 Couch, Insurance 2d (rev ed), \u00a7 15:13, pp 156-157. Thus, the word, \"expected\u201d need not be viewed from the standpoint of the insured, but instead given an objective construction. However, the insurer has not argued in favor of this reading of the policy and, for reasons discussed in part B, it seems unlikely that the insurer would prefer this reading.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b955-8\"> Arguably, this matter should be remanded to the trial court for further findings which would establish whether in fact DiCicco intended or expected to stab Gravenmier. However, both parties have been content to premise their appeal on the trial court\u2019s present fact finding. Metropolitan has requested no relief, either principally or alternatively, involving a remand for further findings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b956-6\"> In so concluding, I am mindful of Professor Corbin\u2019s admonition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-7\">Before holding that the words of a written contract are so \"plain and clear\u201d that extrinsic evidence in aid of interpretation is not admissible, the court\u2019s attention should be call\u00e9d to the fact that in so holding it is substituting is own linguistic education and experience for that of the contracting parties. In such cases, the court often says that \"a court can not make a contract for the parties\u201d; but when it holds the parties bound in accordance with a meaning that seems \"plain and clear\u201d to the court and excludes convincing evidence that the parties gave the words a different meaning, it is doing exactly what it declares that it can not do: the court is making a contract for the parties that they did not themselves make. [3 Corbin, Contracts, \u00a7 542, pp 111-112.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b956-8\">But Professor Corbin also observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-9\">Without a doubt, in supporting the interests of their clients, counsel often urge upon the court interpretations of the language of a contract that are far removed from common and ordinary usage, without producing any substantial evidence that the other party to the transaction gave the unusual meaning to the language or had any reason to suppose that the first party did so. In such cases the harassed judge is justified in saying that the words are too plain and clear to justify such an interpretation. <em>[Id., </em>p 112.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b957-7\"> This, of course, additionally assumes that the cases have construed the same policy language. Unfortunately, in a number of cases cited by the Chief Justice, the policy language varies significantly. See, e.g., <em>CNA Ins Co v McGinnis, </em>282 Ark 90; 666 SW2d 689 (1984); <em>The Fireman's Ins Co v Smith, </em>13 Ark App 250, 253-254; 683 SW2d 234 (1985), <em>ante, </em>p 678. In these cases, the policy exclusions were apparently limited to acts \"expected or intended\u201d without regard to the \"standpoint of the insured.\u201d These cases are also factually distinguishable, as discussed below.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b962-8\"> Thus, as Justice Archer observes, post, p 731, n 11, the insured need not intend the actual bodily injury inflicted in order to fall under the exclusionary clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b963-5\"> Again, as explained at 31 ALR4th 973, although a subjective standard may be used, \"[ujnder such a view, the courts have also recognized that the insured\u2019s intent may be actual or inferred from the nature of the act and the accompanying reasonable foreseeability of harm . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b964-6\"><em> </em>Again, it must be emphasized that the trial court\u2019s findings of fact, upon which the insured\u2019s appeal is based, specify only that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b964-7\">DiCicco denies any intent to use the knife, claiming that he went to get the knife merely to scare away the other persons he considered to be a threat. No one observed him make a gesture of moving the knife as though to stab Gravenmier. The knife was held in his right hand and the poking was done with his left. DiCicco denies knowledge of in fact stabbing. Immediately following the stabbing, DiCicco looked shocked. Gravenmier obviously did not expect DiCicco would use the knife or he would not have engaged in his act of bravado.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b964-8\">These findings have not been challenged as clearly erroneous or inadequate by the plaintiff insurer, nor has the insurer requested any alternative relief, such as a demand to the trial court for further findings. It is inappropriate to reach behind the trial court\u2019s findings and search the record for evidence which might have supported the insurer\u2019s positions and construe the record most favorably toward the insured.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b965-7\">Archer, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asr\">\n<em>(concurring in part and dissenting in part).</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b965-8\">INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b965-9\">I respectfully dissent from the lead opinion\u2019s application in <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>of an objective standard to an insurance exclusionary clause regarding coverage of an insured\u2019s behavior which results in \"bodily injury or property damage which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d In <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>I concur with the conclusion of the lead opinion that the exclusionary clause at issue mandates the application of an objective standard of review, thus relieving the insurer of a duty to defend against Alonda Freeman\u2019s actions.

Accordingly, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>affirm the result of the Court of Appeals in <em>Metropolitan Property &amp; Liability Ins Co v DiCicco. </em>I would also affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman </em>with regard to Alonda Freeman. However, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals with regard to Marshall Freeman, and remand this portion of the case to the trial court for consideration on the separate question of the insurer\u2019s liability for Marshall Freeman\u2019s alleged negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-4\">I. <em>METROPOLITAN INSURANCE CO V DlCICCO</em></p>\n<p id=\"b966-5\">I accept the recitation in the lead opinion of the factual background giving rise to the instant case.</p>\n<p id=\"b966-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b966-7\">In <em>Fresard v Michigan Millers Mutual Ins Co, </em>414 Mich 686, 693-695; 327 NW2d 286 (1982), this Court succinctly stated the oft-cited rules concerning the construction of insurance policy provisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-8\">This Court recently reiterated that \"[a]ny clause in an insurance policy is valid as long as it is clear, unambiguous and not in contravention of public policy.\u201d <em>Raska v Farm Bureau Mutual Ins Co of Michigan, </em>412 Mich 355, 361-362; 314 NW2d 440 (1982). The <em>Raska </em>majority noted that the only pertinent question was \"whether the exclusionary clause in this contract is ambiguous, for if it is not ambiguous we are constrained to enforce it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-9\">When examining the language of this or any other insurance policy, we are mindful of several other principles of construction so rudimentary as to be axiomatic:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-10\">The contract should be viewed as a whole.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b966-11\">The intent of the parties should be given effect.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>An interpretation of the contract which would render it unreasonable should be avoided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-4\">Meaning should be given to all terms.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-5\">Ambiguities should not be forced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-6\">Conflicts among clauses should be harmonized.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-7\">The contract should be viewed from the standpoint of the insured.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-8\">The insurer should bear the burden of proving an absence of coverage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-9\">The use of standard policies presents a unique situation in which the precise language we are asked to analyze already has been interpreted by courts in other jurisdictions. The existence of so many opinions is both an advantage and a disadvantage. The benefit, of course, is the insight provided by learned jurists in other states and in the federal courts. The danger is that weight unfairly may be accorded a view merely because it has withstood attack for a period of time or because it is embraced by the majority of jurisdictions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Mindful of these rules of construction, we turn first to the development of the exclusionary clause itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-11\">The insurance industry has employed standardized general liability insurance policies for over four decades.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Fresard, supra </em>at 691. The instant exclusionary clause is the product of sweeping <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>revisions in standardized general liability policies undertaken in 1966. Upon examination of commentary issued contemporaneously with its introduction, it is clear the provision was primarily designed to resolve the controversy concerning the requirement under then-prevalent general liability insurance policies, that bodily injury or property damage be caused \"by accident.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, the term \"accident\u201d was rarely defined by the policy, thus producing contradictory constructions in the instances of an insured\u2019s alleged intentional behavior. As a result, the courts focused alternatively on an accident\u2019s presence either from the standpoint of the victim, in furtherance of a public policy not to reward an insured for intentional tortious actions, or from the standpoint of the insured party, in order not to penalize the injured party and effectuate the remedial purposes of insurance coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b968-5\">In response to the judicial impasse concerning the construction of the term \"accident,\u201d the 1966 drafters premised an insurer\u2019s duty to defend and to provide coverage upon the more expansive concept of an \"occurrence\u201d which, as correctly noted by the majority, is inclusive not only of the commonly understood meaning of \"accident,\u201d but also of intentional actions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, the drafters also provided that the physical injury or property loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>must neither be expected nor intended from the standpoint of the insured. While this language answered the question of the perspective from which an occurrence was to be considered, the inclusion of the terms \"expected\u201d and \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d within the exclusionary provision left unresolved the two issues before us today.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> First, whether the construction of pre-1966 insurance exclusionary clause language is applicable to the instant provision. Second, whether examination of the instant clause entails an objective or subjective standard of review.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b969-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b969-5\">I concur that an insurer\u2019s duty to defend is triggered by the determination of whether an occurrence is in fact present. The concept of an occurrence is appropriately broadly construed, and I accept that in the instant case an occurrence is in fact present for purposes of Metropolitan\u2019s insurance policy. However, while I also find that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>instant exclusionary clause is unambiguous as a matter of law, I disagree as to the conclusions to be drawn from its nonambiguity:<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-6\">The word \"occurrence\u201d instead of the word \"accident\u201d in the insuring clause means that the word \"occurrence\u201d is in fact broader than the word \"accident\u201d and is so intended by the insurer. In such case, <em>the intent of the policy is to insure the acts or omissions of the insured, including his intentional acts, excluding only those in which the resulting injury is either expected or intended from the insured\u2019s standpoint.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-7\">It is clear therefore, that the insured here would be debarred from coverage in those cases where his deliberate acts or assaults resulted in injuries which would be expected or intended by him to result from his deliberate acts. But what about coverage where the results of his acts (even though deliberate) are unexpected or not intended by the insured? The answer under which a policy provision is that (1) the event is an occurrence; (2) since it results in bodily injury it is an accident under the definition of the policy, and (3) since it is unintended or unexpected, it is within the coverage of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b970-8\">Such a construction of the insurance policy is not strained or forced, but rather is an interpretation of the plain, ordinary and popular meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>the words used by the insurer in defining the coverage extended. It should be interpreted in that sense. . . . <em>We do not consider this provision to be ambiguous; the possibility of unintended bodily injury brings that result within the policy coverage </em>.... <em>[Northwestern Nat'l Casualty v Phalen, </em>182 Mont 448, 455-456; 597 P2d 720 (1979). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b971-4\">As noted in the lead opinion, prior to the introduction of the 1966 revisions, this Court required under language involving injury or property loss incurred \"by or at the direction of the insured,\u201d a showing both of subjective intention to commit the act in question and a comparable state of mind to the harm inflicted. Clearly, this requirement becomes unnecessary under the standard espoused in the lead opinion which is satisfied where the bodily or property damage injury need only reach a threshold of natural and foreseeable consequence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, I must dissent from the interjection in the lead opinion of an objective standard of reason-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>ability in the absence of clear language so dictating. See, e.g., <em>Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp v St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins Co, </em>621 F Supp 155, 161 (W Va, 1985):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-5\">[T]he majority rule with respect to intentional injury exclusions is that the exclusion applies if the insured intended to do a particular act, and intended to do some harm, even if the harm actually done was radically different from the harm intended. Yet, on the other hand, an intentional injury exclusion will not apply if the insured intentionally does an act, but has no intent to commit harm, even if the act involves the foreseeable consequences of great harm or even amounts to gross or culpable negligence. . . . <em>Without such a distinction, the policy language referring to \"the standpoint of the insured\u201d is rendered meaningless. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b972-6\">Further, while I agree with the observations in the lead opinion that the terms \"intended\u201d and \"expected\u201d are not synonymous, this does not logically mandate an objective standard of review<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b972-7\">to the extent that \"expected\u201d may be defined in terms of anticipation and that a lesser degree of proof may be required to establish expectation than to establish intent. However, we reject the view that expectation is to be judged on an objective standard. The word \"reasonable\u201d is not employed in the exclusion in question, and we reject [the insurance company\u2019s] plea that we read in a reasonableness standard. It was [the insurance company] which drafted the policy and if it wanted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>an objective standard to apply, it could have drafted its policy accordingly.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>] <em>[Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co v Dichtl, </em>78 Ill App 3d 970, 977; 398 NE2d 582 (1979).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b973-5\">As the lead opinion argues against rendering the term \"expected\u201d superfluous by equating it with the term \"intended,\u201d I similarly find that the application of an objective standard of review places this Court in the position of redacting the phrase \"from the standpoint of the insured\u201d from the instant exclusionary clause. This Court is bound by the language of the exclusionary clause and should be reticent to introduce concepts of foreseeability, more appropriate in the arena of tort actions than in the realm of insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b973-6\">I would also note that the lead opinion cites a number of decisions by the Court of Appeals, in addition to decisions from other jurisdictions, which have found it unnecessary in certain factual situations to engage in a subjective analysis and have inferred either an intent or expectation to injure as a matter of law. However, I disagree that the import of these decisions constitutes an engagement in theoretical exercise seeking to avoid a determination of an insured\u2019s subjective intentions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Upon examination of these decisions, I observe that within the areas of child molestation and certain violent assaultive actions, because of the nature of the act itself, a number of , courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"730\">*730</page-number>have found that the insured fell within the instant exclusionary clause as it was nearly impossible, even under a subjective standard, to find that the party could not have either intended or expected the harm which had been inflicted. However, while there are limited factual scenarios which may arguably lend themselves to such a determination, this does not erase the clear language of the exclusionary clause or the remaining multitude of instances in which a determination of the insured\u2019s subjective state of mind is necessary. Further, the lead opinion fails to cite any authority that these decisions are indicative of an unworkable subjective standard, or that its approach is an exception which threatens to engulf the rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-4\">Accordingly, in the absence of explicit policy language to the contrary, I would hold that the appropriate standard of review to construe the instant exclusionary clause must be subjective:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b974-5\">[W]e decide that the \"exclusion\u201d from the foundational personal liability coverage afforded Dodge by his policy, as the exclusion is stated in the language \"bodily injury . . . which is either expected or intended from the standpoint of the Insured,\u201d refers only to bodily injury that the insured in fact subjectively wanted (\"intended\u201d) to be a result of his conduct or in fact subjectively foresaw as practically certain (\"expected\u201d) to be a result of his conduct. <em>[Patrons-Oxford Mutual Ins Co v Dodge, </em>426 A2d 888, 892 (Me, 1981).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b974-6\">See also <em>Northwestern Nat'l Casualty, supra; Alabama Farm Bureau Ins v Dyer, </em>454 So 2d 921 (1984); <em>Health Care &amp; Retirement Corp v St Paul Fire &amp; Marine Ins Co, supra; Vanguard Ins Co v Cantrell, </em>18 Ariz App 486; 503 P2d 962 (1972); <em>MacKinnon v Hanover Ins Co, </em>124 NH 456; 471 A2d 1166 (1984); <em>Rodriquez v Williams, </em>107 Wash <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"731\">*731</page-number>2d 381; 729 P2d 627 (1986). Thus, the finder of fact may exclude coverage either for actions in which the insured subjectively <em>expected </em>injury or loss or where the loss is the consequence of the insured\u2019s subjective intention both to the act itself and the resultant harm.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b975-4\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">I concur with the statement in the lead opinion of the appropriate standard of review by this Court of the trial court\u2019s grant of declaratory judgment in favor of the insurer.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Upon review of the lower court record, it is clear the trial court applied an objective standard of review to the instant exclusionary clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b975-6\">There appears to be a conflict [by panels of the Court of Appeals] whether there need be a specific showing of intent to injure regardless of which type of contract language is used.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] Faced with the choice of this conflict, this Court prefers the reasoning of <em>Frankenmuth Mutual Ins Co v Kompus </em>[135 Mich App 667; 354 NW2d 303 (1984)], and its progeny. The apparent intent of the policy language excluding coverage for intended or expected injury is to avoid the subjective analysis inherent in the question whether there was an actual intent to injure.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"732\">*732</page-number>As the trial court below explicitly eschewed the application of a subjective standard of review, I would hold that the trial court must apply the standard espoused within this opinion. If there is a question of fact as to the intention or expectation on the part of the insured from a subjective standpoint, a grant either of a directed verdict or summary disposition is clearly incorrect. Accordingly, I would affirm the result reached by the Court of Appeals and would remand the case to the trial court for reconsideration not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">II. <em>ALLSTATE INS CO V FREEMAN</em></p>\n<p id=\"AOzd\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">I concur with the result reached in part iii(b) of the lead opinion that the insurer had no duty to defend Alonda Freeman. In contrast to the exclusionary clause at issue in <em>Metropolitan Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>the instant exclusionary clause contains explicit language relating to the relevance of the reasonableness of the insured\u2019s actions and clearly dictates an application of an objective standard of review.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b976-8\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b976-9\">However, I respectfully dissent from the conclusion in the lead opinion that Allstate had no duty to defend Marshall Freeman.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-10\">Initially, with regard to the analysis of the lead opinion in examining the underlying cause of action as determinative of the instant coinsured\u2019s entitlement to coverage, I disagree with the depiction of a cause of action of negligent entrust<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>ment constituting a derivative action. It is well settled that a cause of action for negligent entrustment is a separate cause of action in negligence for the defendant\u2019s failure to prevent dangerous instrumentalities from falling under the control of persons incapable of proper usage.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 390, pp 314-318, and Prosser &amp; Keeton, Torts (5th ed), \u00a7 33, pp 197-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-4\">However, irrespective of the action alleged against Marshall Freeman, the question here turns upon whether the instant exclusionary clause\u2019s reference to the acts of \"an insured person\u201d is clearly understandable and not subject to reasonable variances in interpretation so that a lay insured would equate the term \"an\u201d with \"any\u201d and would conclude that the acts of any person insured under the policy would serve to relieve the insurer from a duty to defend all the remaining insured individuals. Although I concur with the observation that this Court, in an examination of an insurance provision, should decline to create an ambiguity where none exists, unlike the lead opinion, I do not find that the provision is unambiguous as a matter of law and decline to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>adopt its conclusion that \"an insured\u201d unambiguously means that coverage was excluded for damages caused by the intentional wrongful act of <em>any </em>insured (either Alonda or Marshall).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">The lead opinion adopts the result found in <em>Allstate Ins Co v Gilbert, </em>852 F2d 449 (CA 9, 1988), in support of its construction of the instant exclusionary clause. <em>Gilbert, </em>in turn, relied on <em>Allstate Ins Co v Condon, </em>198 Cal App 3d 148, 153; 243 Cal Rptr 623 (1988), in determining that \"an insured\u201d refers to <em>all </em>insureds under the policy. The <em>Condon </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b978-6\">\"A person insured\u201d logically refers to any one of all the persons insured under the policy [as distinguished from \"the insured\u201d which refers only to a particular insured.] <em>[Id.]</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b978-7\">However, one year prior to the <em>Gilbert </em>decision, in <em>American States Ins Co v Borbor, </em>826 F2d 888, 894 (CA 9, 1987), Judge Thompson, who wrote <em>Gilbert, </em>stated that \"[h]ad American States intended that the wrongful act of <em>any </em>insured would void the policy, it could have unambiguously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>drafted and included such language in the contract.\u201d The result was that an innocent spouse was not excluded because of the intentional wrongdoing of her husband. The court reasoned that no uncertainty or ambiguity would have existed if the policy exclusion would have referred to \"any insured\u201d rather than \"an insured.\u201d Accordingly, the provision was construed in favor of the insured.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">One year later in <em>Condon, </em>the California Supreme Court drew support from the California Insurance Code, \u00a7 11580 (West Supp, 1988), which codified the definition of \"an insured\u201d as meaning \"any insured,\u201d in an attempt to construe the import of these modifiers.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-5\">Insurance Code section 11580.1, subdivision (c)(8) provides another analogous definition. The section reads, in pertinent part:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-6\">\"The term 'the insured\u2019 as used in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4) shall mean only that insured under the policy against whom the particular claim is made or suit brought. The term 'an insured\u2019 as used in paragraphs (5) and (6) shall mean any insured under the policy . . . .\u201d Thus, \"an insured\u201d is defined as referring to all insureds under the policy, contrasted to one insured person when identified as \"the insured.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b979-8\">It is true the Allstate policy herein refers to \"a person insured.\u201d \"A\u201d and \"an\u201d are analogous modifiers; one or the other is used dependent upon whether the word it modifies begins with a consonant or a vowel sound. Words beginning with consonant sounds are properly modified by \"a.\u201d \"An\u201d is used to precede words beginning with vowel sounds. If Allstate had used the term \"an person insured,\u201d the policy provision would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>been grammatically incorrect. Because proper grammar necessitated this deviation from the precise statutory language, for purposes of section 11580.1, subdivision (c), \"a person insured\u201d is the functional analog of \"an insured person.\u201d The Insurance Code thus defines \"a person insured\u201d as \"any person insured under the policy.\u201d <em>[Condon, supra </em>at 153-154.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">I find it instructive that the decision primarily relied upon by the lead opinion found it necessary to draw from an opinion which sought guidance from a comparable statutory provision in order to construe what is today characterized as unambiguous language. Accordingly, I would adhere to the admonition of the <em>Borbor </em>court that an insurer may void a policy by using appropriate language, i.e., \"any insured,\u201d in its policy exclusion. 826 F2d 894. If Allstate had meant \"any,\u201d it should have said \"any,\u201d not \"an.\u201d Rather than engage in an exercise in semantics, I find that \"an\u201d is not synonymous with \"any,\u201d and conclude that \"an insured\u201d should apply to Alonda Freeman alone. Thus, Marshall Freeman should not have been excluded under the terms of the policy\u2019s exclusionary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Accordingly, in <em>Metropolitan Ins Co v DiCicco, </em>I would affirm the result of the Court of Appeals, and would remand the case to the trial court for consideration of the action alleged against DiCicco pursuant to the subjective standard of review announced in this opinion. In <em>Allstate Ins Co v Freeman, </em>I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals denying coverage with regard to Alonda Freeman on the basis of an objective standard of review. However, I would reverse the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>decision of the Court of Appeals with regard to Marshall Freeman and remand the case to the trial court for consideration of the negligence action against him.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b967-12\"> See also Wendorff, <em>The new standard comprehensive general liability insurance policy, </em>ABA Section on Ins, Neg, &amp; Comp Law (1966 Proceedings), pp 250-251.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b967-13\">The National Bureau of Casualty Underwriters, a rating organization composed of stock insurance companies, and the Mutual Insurance Rating Bureau, a rating organization composed of mutual insurance companies, have developed through the joint efforts and co-operation of their Underwriting and Policy Forms Committees so-called \u201cstandard\u201d general liability and automobile policies which their member companies are required to use.

These courts conclude negligence-caused injury or damage is not caused by accident unless an unprecedented or unforeseeable event is an immediate or concurrent cause of the loss so that the loss is not the natural and probable consequence of the negligent act.

These principles are that (1) exclusions are strictly construed against the insurer, because (2) the policy must \"make clear\u201d the exclusion, and, as a consequence, (3) the insurer must accept a liberal interpretation that favors the insured where it could have employed a plainer and more generous use of words that would have removed the ambiguity.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">analysis: does the Allstate policy clearly EXCLUDE COVERAGE FOR NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT BY AN INNOCENT COINSURED SPOUSE?</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">A. INTRODUCTION</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">I now reach the central issue, whether Allstate has unambiguously excluded Marshall\u2019s negligent entrustment liability under the above definition. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"743\">*743</page-number>The majority has found no ambiguity in the Allstate \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion and has put forth, as an incontrovertible fact of English grammar and usage, the argument that the term \"an insured\u201d necessarily refers to all insureds. I disagree with this conclusion. The plain meaning of the term \"an insured\u201d unambiguously means both \"any insured\u201d and \"the named insured.\u201d Indeed, the indefinite articles \"a, an,\u201d and \"the\u201d all may be used before \"insured\u201d to mean either all the insureds or the one insured. Therefore, the Court must construe the ambiguity\u2014that arises from the two plausible meanings that these indefinite articles create when they modify the term \"insured\u201d\u2014 liberally in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">B. THE TERM \"AN\u201d INSURED IS AMBIGUOUS</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">The meaning of the indefinite article \"an\u201d is ambiguous under accepted rules of English grammar and usage. \"An\u201d is the indefinite article sometimes used in the place of \"a.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The term \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous according to a technical, as well as a common-sense, meaning of the term read in the context of the Allstate policy exclusion. This ambiguity is inherent in the use of the indefinite article \"an\u201d before a noun which creates a problem of interpretation since it gives the noun potentially two different meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">The definition of the word \"an\u201d in Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed) demonstrates why this indefinite article (which is in the family of adjectives) has this effect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b987-7\">The word \"a\u201d has varying meanings and uses. \"A\u201d means \"one\u201d or \"any,\u201d but less emphatically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>than either. It may mean one where only one is intended, or it may mean any one of a great number. It is placed before nouns of the singular number, denoting an individual object or quality individualized, [yet] [t]he article \"a\u201d is not necessarily a singular term; it is often used in the sense of \"any\u201d and is then applied to more than one individual object . . . [b]ut the meaning depends on context. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">Given the above definition of the word \"an,\u201d it is clear that the Allstate \"intentional acts\u201d exclusionary clause is reasonably susceptible of two different meanings.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">The term \"an insured\u201d is ambiguous in the context of the Allstate exclusion because it can be taken to mean either the named insured or all insureds. Thus, an ordinary layman of average intelligence could easily read the Allstate exclusion as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-6\">Losses we cover:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-7\">We will pay sums arising from the same loss, which <em>a named insured </em>person becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because of <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage </em>covered by this part of the policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-8\">Exclusions:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b988-9\"><em>We </em>do not cover <em>bodily injury </em>or <em>property damage </em>which may reasonably be expected to result from the intentional or criminal acts of <em>a named insured person (who commits those acts) </em>or which is in fact intended by <em>that named </em>insured._</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b989-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number>In light of this ambiguity, I must dissent.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b989-4\">I have chosen not to follow the analyses of the cases cited in the lead opinion which contain language similar to the Allstate policy. See <em>ante, </em>pp 693-699, citing and discussing two cases, <em>Allstate Ins Co v Condon, </em>198 Cal App 3d 148, 152; 243 Cal Rptr 623 (1988), and <em>Allstate Ins Co v Gilbert, </em>852 F2d 449 (CA 9, 1988). These cases hold that the term \"an insured\u201d is unambiguous. The analysis in these two cases is simply not persuasive, and this Court is not required to follow it.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> These courts simply have not adhered to the concept that an ambiguity must be found where a phrase has more than one plausible meaning when read according to accepted rules of English usage.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">C. THE AMBIGUITY IN THE TERM \"AN INSURED\u201d CAN BE SEEN BY READING THE CONTRACT AS A WHOLE</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">I disagree with the majority for the additional reason that it fails to look at the insurance policy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>as a whole.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Allstate, as drafter of this policy, chose to clarify that the meaning of the term \"insured\u201d in its third exclusion should be understood in the plural sense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion that we must interpret, however, is not similarly clear in its meaning.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b990-4\">The insurer\u2019s failure to insert \"any\u201d before \"insured\u201d in the \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion indicates that the insurer intended \"any insured person\u201d and \"an insured\u201d to have different meanings. We must read the policy as a whole to determine the intent of the parties\u2014at least insofar as it can be ascertained from the language of the contract.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b991-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"747\">*747</page-number>D. THE INSURER COULD USE PLAIN LANGUAGE TO CLEARLY EXCLUDE FROM COVERAGE MARSHALL\u2019S NEGLIGENT ENTRUSTMENT LIABILITY</p>\n<p id=\"b991-6\">The term \"an insured\u201d could have been made unambiguous if Allstate had included a separate definition of that term, making it clear that the noun it modifies (insured) refers to any named insured.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Conversely, if Allstate had used the term \"the insured\u201d to achieve the necessary clarity, then Marshall\u2019s negligent entrustment liability would clearly be covered under the policy and not within the scope of the exclusion. In <em>Unigard Mutual Ins Co v Spokane School Dist, </em>20 Wash App 261; 579 P2d 1015 (1978), the Court stated the accepted view, namely,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b991-7\">[W]here coverage and exclusion is defined in terms of \"the insured,\u201d courts have uniformly considered the contract between the insurer and several insureds, to be separable, rather than joint, i.e., there are separate contracts with each of the insureds.[<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b991-8\">If the Allstate exclusion used the term \"the insured,\u201d the insurer could argue that this term refers to all insureds. This grammatical argument is supported by the theory that \"a, an, and the\u201d are all articles which render the noun they modify subject to two potential meanings. At least one learned jurist has relied upon this argument, lending support to the common-sense notion that even the term \"the\u201d can create ambiguity in the noun it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"748\">*748</page-number>modifies.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If this argument were made by the insurer, however, it would fail because the insurer must clearly and unmistakably exclude negligent entrustment claims from its broad liability insurance contract.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b992-6\">Thus, the insured will not always win in claiming coverage under the intentional acts exclusion. If Allstate had merely added \"y\u201d to the word \"an,\u201d to give us \"any insured,\u201d then Marshall\u2019s negligence liability would clearly be excluded.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> In sum, Allstate has failed to unambiguously exclude negligent entrustment liability of an innocent co-insured spouse, such as Marshall Freeman, either in its broad coverage provision or in the \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b992-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b992-8\">THERE IS NO CONTROLLING PRECEDENT THAT REQUIRES THE TERM \"AN INSURED\u201d TO BE READ ONLY TO MEAN ALL INSUREDS</p>\n<p id=\"b992-9\">The majority relies primarily upon cases that have interpreted the meaning of motor vehicle exclusions in general liability insurance con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>tracts.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> These cases do not stand for any general principle applicable to the construction of the Allstate \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion for the obvious reason that they construe the meaning of different contractual language.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b993-4\">To decide this case, the majority has extracted a principle from these cases that is totally inapposite to the particular language of the Allstate \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-5\">[W]here an insurance policy exclusion precludes coverage for the particular injury, then it also excludes coverage for negligent entrustment of the instrumentality that caused the injury.[<footnotemark>25</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b993-6\">Any such abstract rule, which runs contrary to our established rules of contract interpretation, must be rejected for the reasons stated by Justice Boyle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b993-7\">[Since] the duty to defend, like the duty to indemnify, is contractual, any delineation of the scope of the duty to defend without reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>the policy itself must be viewed as a mere generality.[<footnotemark>26</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b994-4\">But, assuming the validity of the abstraction arguendo, the analysis the majority relies upon is flawed on its own terms. The language of the Allstate policy differs dramatically from the provisions of the homeowner\u2019s liability policies from which the majority gleans the above abstract rule of insurance contract exclusion clause interpretation. Given the plain and obvious differences of language between the Allstate \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion and the exclusions construed by the cases on which the majority relies, it is apparent that these precedents are inapplicable. The coverage dispute involved here is conceptually and linguistically distinct from the issue courts have faced in construing the motor vehicle exclusionary clauses. The Allstate policy excludes bodily injury related to acts of an insured on the basis of the state of mind of a person committing those acts. Yet, the language of the exclusion leaves it unclear whether the negligence of a coinsured is covered when that negligent act is a cause of injury, but there is a concurrent cause of the same injury traceable to the intentional act of another insured (whose acts are clearly excluded).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-5\">Those cases involve claims by insureds who seek coverage for negligent entrustment of an automobile, despite the existence of a motor vehicle exclusion in the general liability policy. They present an issue of contract interpretation that is conceptually distinct from the issue in this case. The issue there is whether the motor vehicle exclusion can be interpreted as unambiguously excluding all injury that is in any way causally related to the use of an inanimate object (i.e., a motor vehicle), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>or whether it also can be viewed as not excluding injuries caused by the loaning or negligent entrustment of the vehicle. See <em>West American Ins Co v Hinze, </em>843 F2d 263, 267-268 (CA 7, 1988) (holding that the negligent supervision of a child is not within the scope of the motor vehicle exclusion clause because no negligent acts were committed in the handling of, or with respect to, the excluded instrumentality).</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">By contrast, the \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion relates to injury that is the product of the acts of one particular insured whose behavior is of a certain type (i.e., is intentional). Thus, we must interpret an exclusion that does not clearly spell out whether all injury is excluded from coverage when the injury is caused both by the intentional acts of one insured and by the merely negligent acts of another.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">The key difference between the two exclusions is that the motor vehicle exclusions clearly exclude all negligence liability related to the use of the motor vehicle.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The \"intentional acts\u201d exclusion, by contrast, does not plainly exclude any negligence liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-7\">Only by a strained construction of the exclusion that gives priority to one of two possible interpretations of the term \"an insured,\u201d can one arrive at the conclusion that negligent entrustment liability is excluded from coverage. Thus, I am unper<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>suaded by the majority\u2019s reliance upon the motor vehicle exclusion cases to support the conclusion that Allstate has no duty to defend Marshall against the claim of negligent entrustment.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-6\">Thus, derivative liability theory upon which the majority relies,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> namely, that Allstate\u2019s duty to defend Marshall is derivative of its duty to defend Alonda, is plainly inapplicable here. Therefore, the cases cited in support of that theory would not control, even if they could be applied to decide this case under the derivative theory.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b996-7\">We must also keep in mind that the first issue is whether Allstate has a duty to defend Marshall Freeman. When interpreting the Allstate policy, we must attempt to discern what meaning would serve the broader purposes of the policy.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Judge Wahls, in his dissent in <em>Dragovich,</em><footnotemark><em>32</em></footnotemark><em> </em>indicates why the language of insurance liability policies, such as the Allstate homeowner\u2019s policy here, often create a duty to defend that is broader than the duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number>indemnify. Allstate, as drafter of the policy, has clearly intended to create a broad duty to defend.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b997-5\">Under this broad duty, Allstate has a clear obligation to defend Marshall Freeman against the allegations by Mary Kelly that he negligently entrusted his wife with a dangerous instrumentality. The pleadings clearly imply facts that would make Allstate liable under its duty to indemnify. Thus, the duty to defend in this case extends at least up to the point of summary judgment, since facts might be available that would establish coverage during the process of discovery.

The exclusionary clause language not only is ambiguous, but it conflicts with a broad coverage provision. This is an easy case since ambiguities in a policy exclusion are to be construed in favor of the insured\u2014especially where there is a broad duty to defend provision in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b998-5\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b998-6\">conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b998-7\">The issue in this case must be decided in reliance on principles of contract interpretation alone.

To accept Allstate\u2019s view, that Marshall\u2019s coverage is purely derivative of Alonda\u2019s intentional or other tort liability, would be incorrect as a matter of tort law (as well as under rules of contract interpretation).<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b999-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>The tort of negligent entrustment focuses on a different type of conduct than Allstate sought to exclude by the language of its exclusionary policy.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, I must conclude that Marshall\u2019s negligent entrustment liability is a separate and independent source of tort liability not clearly excluded by the Allstate policy.
