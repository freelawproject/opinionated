In June, 1981, they each were notified they would be laid off due to a necessary reduction in personnel. At that time, one plaintiff was assigned a split counselor/teacher position,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and the others were assigned full-time counselor positions.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Their positions were subsequently filled by three tenured teachers who had greater seniority and counseling endorsements but had not been assigned previously as counselors.</p>\n<p id=\"b823-5\">Approximately two years after their layoff and after the Tenure Commission\u2019s decision in <em>Leonard </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>v <em>Center Line Bd of Ed,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the plaintiffs filed an appeal with the Tenure Commission.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Leonard, supra, </em>the commission held that the plaintiff was employed in a nonclassroom position as a school counselor on the basis of the types of duties she performed in that capacity, which were administrative. It then found the school district\u2019s failure to include language in the plaintiff\u2019s employment contract specifically excluding tenure resulted in the acquisition of tenure during the time plaintiff was a counselor.</p>\n<p id=\"b824-6\">In the instant case, the Tenure Commission decided, first, that neither <em>Leonard, supra, </em>nor the prior case law<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> upon which it relied fully addressed whether a counseling position is a classroom or nonclassroom position within the meaning of art 3, \u00a7 1, and, second, that whether counselors hold nonclassroom or classroom positions depends upon the duties commonly associated with the position. The commission found that a person whose primary duties involve instruction or guidance of students is a \"classroom teacher\u201d within the meaning of art 3, \u00a7 l.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the plaintiffs, who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>acquired tenure only as classroom teachers, were properly laid off and replaced by tenured teachers with greater seniority.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-5\">The circuit court reversed the decision on the basis that a teacher is \"one that teaches or instructs,\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and since the primary duty of counselors is not teaching,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> the plaintiffs were entitled to tenure as counselors, absent a specific exclusion to that effect in their employment contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b825-6\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the commission with instructions that the term \"classroom teacher\u201d must be given its ordinary meaning which does not include a teacher who acts as a counselor offering guidance to students.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Although the panel was not persuaded that counselors are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>\"classroom teachers\u201d for purposes of the statute and technically are not administrators since their positions are not policymaking positions, they held that the determination as to whether to allow administrative tenure to a teacher employed as a counselor was to be governed by the contract between the teacher and the school board. This Court granted leave to address the issue whether school counselors qualify for position-specific tenure under MCL 38.91; MSA 15.1991.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b826-5\">To determine whether teachers acquire administrative tenure as counselors, we must first look to art 3, \u00a7 1, of the teacher tenure act, which provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b826-6\">If the controlling board shall provide in a contract of employment of any teacher employed other than as a classroom teacher, including but not limited to, a superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head or director of curriculum, made with such teacher after the completion of the probationary period, that such teacher shall not be deemed to be granted continuing tenure in such capacity by virtue of such contract of employment, then such teacher shall not be granted tenure in such capacity, but shall be deemed to have been granted continuing tenure as an active classroom teacher in such school district. [MCL 38.91; MSA 15.1991.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b826-7\">More specifically, the Court must determine what is meant by \"employment of any teacher employed other than as a classroom teacher, including but not limited to, a superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>or director of curriculum,\u201d for purposes of, and within the context of, art 3, \u00a7 1, the tenure act.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">While \"classroom teacher\u201d is not defined in the act, the dissent\u2019s literal definition of a teacher as one who \"teaches or instructs\u201d ignores altogether that \"teacher\u201d is defined as \"all certificated persons employed for a full school year by any board of education or controlling board of any public educational institution.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Just as \"teacher\u201d is not used literally in the act, neither must \"classroom,\u201d and there is no support for the adoption by the Court of a literal definition of \"classroom teacher,\u201d as one who \"teach[es] or provide[s] instruction in a classroom setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b827-6\">Instead, both the language of the act and the history of its enactment support substituting a functional definition for a literal definition of \"classroom teacher.\u201d That \"classroom teacher\u201d is used in contrast to one whose primary duties do not involve instruction or guidance of students is evidenced by the fact that the general term \"other than as a classroom teacher\u201d is followed by the specific, \"including but not limited to, a superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head or director of curriculum . . . .\u201d Where specific words follow general ones, the doctrine of ejusdem generis restricts application of the general term to things that are similar to those enumerated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b827-7\">The rule \"accomplishes the purpose of giving effect to both the particular and the general words, by treating the particular words as indicating the class, and the general words as extending the provisions of the statute to everything embraced in that class, though not specifically named by the particular words.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b828-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>The resolution of this conflict by allowing the specific words to identify the class and by restricting the meaning of general words to things within the class is justified on the ground that had the legislature intended the general words to be used in their unrestricted sense, it would have made no mention of the particular words. [2A Sands, Sutherland Statutory Construction (4th ed), \u00a7 47.17, p 166.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b828-7\">If the general term were given its full and natural meaning, it would include the objects designated by the specific words, making the latter superfluous.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b828-8\">The phrase \"other than as a classroom teacher\u201d would, at first blush, seem broad enough to include counselors, librarians, and essentially any teacher whose <em>primary </em>duty did not involve \"teaching] or providing] instruction in a classroom setting.\u201d It is apparent, however, from a reading of the entire provision that the term \"classroom teacher\u201d is used in contrast to the term \"administrator,\u201d i.e., a person whose duties do not ordinarily involve actual work with students which are positions similar to those enumerated in the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b828-9\">Further, a review of the history and purpose of the tenure act<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> also supports the conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>the Legislature intended<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> that a school district have flexibility in establishing only which administrative positions should carry tenure status. As enacted in 1937, art 3,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> \u00a7 1, of the tenure act provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b829-5\">After the satisfactory completion of the probationary period, a teacher shall be employed continuously by the controlling board under which the probationary period has been completed, and shall not be dismissed or demoted except as specified in this act. [1937 (Ex Sess) PA 4.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b829-6\">Because there is no requirement in the act that the person so employed must, in fact, teach,<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> all teaching personnel, including those in administrative capacities, may acquire tenure after completion of a probationary period.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> In addition, tenure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>cannot be waived once acquired,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> nor can a school district discharge or demote a tenured teacher except for reasonable and just cause.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b830-4\">\"[Ajpparent public dissatisfaction with such shackles on local control of school administration brought about the 1941 amendment<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> providing for the exemption [of tenure], by contract, of those in administrative capacities . . . .\u201d <em>Street v Ferndale Bd of Ed, </em>361 Mich 82, 87; 104 NW2d 748 (1960). The exclusion<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> allows school districts to deny, or grant, tenure in an administrative position,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> and assures that a tenured teacher who accepts a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>nontenured position does not forfeit the right to return to the classroom as such upon termination of the administrative duties. <em>Bode v Roseville School Dist, </em>405 Mich 517, 524; 275 NW2d 472 (1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b831-5\">In 1963, the provision was amended again to expand the scope of the types of positions for which a school district could exclude tenure pursuant to the employment contract. However, the class to which the right was extended was described as \"including,\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but not limited to \"superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head or director of curriculum . . . .\u201d 1963 PA 242. While the new list of positions is no longer exclusive, the types of jobs generic to the list provided indicate that the provision contemplates that the school district has discretion regarding tenure status only with respect to administrative positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-6\">Under the act, a teacher may acquire either teacher tenure or administrative tenure. Accordingly, when a teacher claims tenure status under art 3, \u00a7 1, the decision regarding that claim is made on the basis of the statutory construction of the language of both the tenure act and the provision in the code which addresses employment contracts for administrative personnel.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> See <em>Dodge v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number><em>Saginaw Bd of Ed, </em>384 Mich 346; 183 NW2d 792 (1971); <em>Smiley v Grand Blanc Bd of Ed, </em>416 Mich 316; 330 NW2d 416 (1982); <em>Bode, supra; Goodwin v Kalamazoo Bd of Ed, </em>82 Mich App 559; 267 NW2d 142 (1978).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b832-6\">The underlying philosophy of art 3, \u00a7 1, and the related provisions in the School Code, is to enable \"local school boards to tailor their administrative tenure policies accordingly.\u201d <em>Smiley, supra, </em>p 327. Thus, whether a school district may deny or grant tenure to counselors will depend on whether a school district employs counselors as administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b832-8\">The Tenure Commission correctly held that it is the nature of the duties performed by a teacher which will determine the capacity in which the person is employed and, thus, whether the position is one for which tenure status can be denied. The decision that counselors are classroom teachers for purposes of art 3, \u00a7 1, is based on a reasonable interpretation of the act and is consistent with the purpose of the amendment that a controlling board have discretion to deny tenure only to teach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>ers employed as administrators, while protecting teachers in the security of their tenured status. <em>Goodwin, supra, </em>p 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-4\">The circuit court overturned the commission\u2019s decision on the basis of its determination that \"classroom teacher\u201d should be given its plain and ordinary meaning. However, a literal interpretation is appropriate only when the language is clear and susceptible to a literal reading that results in a conclusion <em>not inconsistent </em>with the purpose of the statute.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this case it leads to the arbitrary and absurd result that the Legislature intended that a school district have the power to deny tenure to any person employed as a teacher, but who spends the majority of the school day outside of a classroom, regardless of how much of the time is spent with students.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">The Court of Appeals erred in assuming the statute contemplates a special tenure status for all teachers who hold a nonclassroom position, absent a nontenure clause in the employment contract between the teacher and the school board.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> First, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>the contract under which the plaintiffs were employed does not distinguish between teachers and counselors, and, second, under the act, a school district cannot insert a nontenure clause in any contract of a person employed as a teacher because tenure status cannot be waived.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b834-6\">However, administrators are employed under a separate contract.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, it is the contract between the school district and the <em>teacher employed as an administrator, </em>not the contract between the district and the <em>teacher employed as a teacher, </em>which must specify whether the individual is denied tenure in the administrative position. There would be no logic in a decision which would require a school district to insert a nontenure clause in the contract of a person employed as a teacher and assigned to a counselor position in order to prevent that person from acquiring administrative tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-7\">The decision of the Court of Appeals defeats rather than promotes the purposes of the tenure act, and further exemplifies why judicial review of agency decisions \"must be undertaken with considerable sensitivity in order that the courts offer due deference to administrative expertise . . . .\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>MERC v Detroit Symphony Orchestra, </em>393 Mich 116, 124; 223 NW2d 283 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">The majority of school districts in the state have bargaining agreements which provide for seniority rights for all teachers and, at the same time, do not restrict school boards from transferring teachers to appropriate positions within the district. Such agreements recognize that teacher-tenure legislation was enacted to protect competent and qualified teachers in the security of their positions and to protect them, after having undergone an adequate probationary period, against removal for unfounded reasons.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> 78 CJS, Schools &amp; School Districts, \u00a7 180, p 1011.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">The lower courts\u2019 determination that counselor positions are nonclassroom positions for purposes of art 3, \u00a7 1 would subject teachers to, rather than protect them from, political and arbitrary interferences with the type of job security envisioned by the tenure act. It would allow school districts to create a separate tenure status for teachers assigned to certain positions, separate and apart from teacher tenure, and, by merely assigning favored teachers to these positions, arbitrarily protect these teachers from layoffs at the expense of other qualified, certified, and more senior tenured teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>In the present case, the commission has interpreted the statute in the manner in which it is generally understood and consistent with the purpose of the tenure act, which is to prevent school boards from arbitrarily discharging or demoting tenured teachers.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b836-7\">There is no support for a conclusion that the Legislature intended that a school district have the power to deny tenure to any person employed as a teacher whose primary duty is not teaching in the classroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-8\">The Tenure Commission correctly determined that the plaintiffs did not acquire administrative tenure as counselors and, because of the necessary reduction in personnel, were properly laid off and replaced by tenured teachers with greater seniority. This decision is in accordance with the job security envisioned by the tenure act which is a guarantee of continued employment and not a guarantee of continued employment in a specific position, absent a nontenured clause in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-9\">Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the decision of the Tenure Commission.</p>\n<judges id=\"b836-10\">Riley, C.J., and Brickley, Cavanagh, Griffin, and Archer, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b821-11\"> MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b821-12\"> MCL 38.91; MSA 15.1991 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b821-13\">After the satisfactory completion of the probationary period, a teacher shall be employed continuously by the controlling board under which the probationary period has been completed, and shall not be dismissed or demoted except as specified in this act.

The first section addressed the statutory definition of teacher:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b825-8\">We find that the outside parameters of the definition of \"classroom teacher\u201d as used in Article III Section 1 can be determined by analysis of the statute itself. First, a teacher is defined as \"all certificated persons . . .\u201d MCL 38.71; MSA 15.1971. Before a person can become subject to Article III, he or she must have satisfactorily completed the probationary period.

The question presented is whether the plaintiffs, tenured school teachers, acquired position-specific tenure as counselors with the defendant school district and thus were wrongfully laid off when they were replaced by tenured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>teachers with greater seniority who did not have position-specific tenure as counselors.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-5\">I would hold that the teacher tenure act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> contemplates that each school district may determine whether the employment contract it enters into shall exclude position-specific tenure for a non-classroom position, and that the plaintiffs were wrongfully laid off because the employment contracts with the plaintiffs did not exclude such tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b837-7\">Plaintiffs, Patricia Belanger, Helen Hanley, Bonnie Zervas, and Norma Stanbury, were tenured teachers who were assigned counseling positions with the defendant Warren Consolidated School District. In 1981, the school district laid off a number of teachers. Plaintiffs were laid off and tenured teachers with greater seniority, who had not theretofore been employed as counselors, assumed their positions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b837-8\">The plaintiffs appealed to the Tenure Commission which found that they had tenure only as classroom teachers and not as counselors. The circuit court, on appeal, reversed, holding that plaintiffs were entitled to tenure as counselors absent a tenure exclusion in their employment contracts. The Court of Appeals affirmed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> I would affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b837-9\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b837-10\">The teacher tenure act provides that after com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>pletion of a probationary period, a teacher shall be employed continuously and shall not be dismissed or demoted except as specified in the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The act further provides that a teacher \"employed other than as a classroom teacher, including but not limited to, a superintendent, assistant superintendent, principal, department head or director of curriculum\u201d shall be deemed to have been granted continuing tenure in such capacity unless the contract of employment provides otherwise, in which event a teacher who is employed other than as a classroom teacher shall be granted continuing tenure as an active classroom teacher.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">The contracts of employment with the plaintiff teachers did not exclude their acquiring tenure as counselors. The question presented thus narrows to whether a tenured teacher employed as a counselor is \"employed other than as a classroom teacher\u201d within the meaning of the act and acquires position-specific tenure absent a contrary provision in the contract of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-5\">In <em>Smiley </em>v <em>Grand Blanc Bd of Ed, </em>416 Mich 316, 327; 330 NW2d 416 (1982), this Court, in holding that teachers who had been originally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>employed under contracts excluding position-specific tenure had not acquired such tenure, quoted with approval the explanation in <em>Goodwin v Kalamazoo Bd of Ed, </em>82 Mich App 559, 566, 568; 267 NW2d 142 (1978), of the \"underlying philosophy\u201d of the act. The Court of Appeals there had held that a tenured classroom teacher employed as the director of buildings and grounds had acquired position-specific tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-5\">The Court, in <em>Goodwin, </em>said that the statute authorizes \"individual school districts to determine which administrative positions should carry tenure.\u201d The statute does not, said the Court, \"dictate categories of administrative positions which carry tenure as a matter of law.\u201d The Court said that \"[i]n view of the wide range and size of school districts, the statute enables local school boards to tailor their administrative tenure policies accordingly. The statute does not attempt to dictate uniform tenure policies for administrators in all school districts.\u201d Since the contract with the plaintiff as director of buildings and grounds did not deny him tenure, he had achieved position-specific tenure.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-6\">The decision whether to allow position-specific tenure to a tenured teacher is to be determined under the act as a matter of contract between the teacher and the school board. I agree with the Court of Appeals, \"One school board may wish to allow its counselors to gain tenure while another may not.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b839-7\">The school district and amicus curiae teacher unions contend that it is unwise and unfair from a policy standpoint to lay off a classroom teacher with greater seniority than a counselor who has acquired position-specific tenure. It appears that the school district and the union have implemented that view by providing, in a collective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>bargaining agreement entered into after the plaintiffs were laid off, that a member of the bargaining unit who has not previously attained tenure in a position other than as a classroom teacher shall not be deemed to have position-specific tenure for a nonclassroom position, but shall be deemed to have tenure as an active classroom teacher. School districts that wish to enter into such agreements may do so. I would decline to impose that policy preference on school districts that do not agree with that policy by adopting a construction of the act contrary to the \"underlying philosophy\u201d stated in <em>Smiley </em>and <em>Goodwin.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b840-6\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b840-7\">The Tenure Commission created its own functional definition of \"classroom teacher,\u201d stating that a classroom teacher is a person whose \"primary duties involve instruction or guidance of students,\u201d and declared that counselors are classroom teachers because they provide instruction and guidance to students.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Neither the Tenure Commission nor the school district have pointed to anything in the language of the act or the history of its enactment that supports substituting a functional definition for a literal definition of \"classroom teacher.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b840-8\">The Tenure Commission\u2019s functional definition ignores altogether the word \"classroom.\u201d A coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>selor\u2019s office is not a classroom or a classroom setting. The Tenure Commission\u2019s functional definition also ignores the general meaning of the word \"teacher\u201d to the extent it would encompass the function of a person who only occasionally and generally infrequently provides \"guidance\u201d or \"instruction\u201d to a particular student.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">I agree with the circuit judge and the Court of Appeals that the term \"classroom teacher\u201d does not include a person who, while offering instruction and guidance to students, does not teach or provide instruction in a classroom setting.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The school district would limit the term \"other than as a classroom teacher\u201d to persons performing administrative duties. 1963 PA 242, which expanded the authority of the school board to grant position-specific tenure by adding the words \"other than as a classroom teacher, including but not limited to\u201d before the words \"superintendent, assistant superintendent [or] principal,\u201d struck the words \"in such administrative capacity\u201d thereby indicating that position-specific tenure could be granted a nonclassroom teacher who did not have administrative duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">I would affirm the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b837-11\"> MCL 38.71 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 15.1971 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b837-12\"> It is not asserted that the pertinent collective bargaining agreement addressed the specific question here presented.
