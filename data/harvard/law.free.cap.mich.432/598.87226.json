We hold that the statute does not preempt state action in this case, even though the victim\u2019s death occurred \"in the workplace\u201d and was allegedly caused by conduct that violated osha standards. Congress did not intend to preclude the enforcement by this state of its criminal laws simply because the alleged criminal activity occurred in the employment setting.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">The defendant, Patrick Hegedus, was charged with involuntary manslaughter, MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553, and conspiracy to violate the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Act,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> MCL 408.1035(5); MSA 17.5Q(35)(5) and MCL 75Q.157a(a); MSA 28.354(l)(a). The charges arose out of the January 18, 1985, death of William Hatherill, an employee of Jackson Enterprises, a company for which defendant Hegedus worked as a supervisor. Mr. Hatherill died of carbon monoxide intoxication while working in a company-owned van. The prosecution contends that the poor condition of the van\u2019s undercarriage and exhaust system allowed exhaust fumes to leak inside the van, causing Hatherill\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-8\">After a preliminary examination, the defendant was bound over on the charge of involuntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant\u2019s subsequent motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>quash the information on the manslaughter charge and reverse the binding over was granted by the circuit court, substantially on the basis that the defendant either had no duty to inspect the van or no duty or ability to take it out of service. The prosecution appealed as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b847-5\">After receiving the parties\u2019 initial briefs, the Court of Appeals ordered supplemental briefs addressing the issue whether criminal prosecutions based on conditions in the workplace are preempted by either miosha or osha. The Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed the trial court\u2019s quashing of the information, finding that criminal prosecution was preempted by osha. <em>People v Hegedus, </em>169 Mich App 62, 68; 425 NW2d 729 (1988) (Danhof, C.J., dissenting). This Court granted leave to appeal. <em>People v Hegedus, </em>431 Mich 870 (1988).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b847-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b847-7\">OSHA</p>\n<p id=\"b847-8\">Osha\u2019s stated \"purpose and policy\u201d is \"to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources.\u201d 29 USC 651(b). To that end, the act gives the Secretary of Labor broad authority and responsibility to establish specific health and safety standards for \"businesses affecting interstate commerce.\u201d 29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>USC 651(b)(3). The act also imposes upon every employer a general duty to \"furnish to each of his employees employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees.\u201d 29 USC 654(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b848-5\">Osha is primarily regulatory in nature, designed to prevent workplace deaths and injuries before they occur. Thus, its emphasis is on the promulgation of health and safety standards and enforcement and review procedures, rather than the assessment of penalties for injuries already suffered. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>Whirlpool v </em>Marshall, 445 US 1, 12; 100 S Ct 883; 63 L Ed 2d 154 (1980), \"the legislation\u2019s remedial orientation is prophylactic in nature.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b848-6\">The act does contain, however, both civil and criminal penalties that can be assessed against employers who violate either specific, promulgated standards or the general-duty clause of \u00a7 5(a)(1). For example, osha provides for <em>civil </em>penalties of up to $1000 for \"serious\u201d violations of either the general-duty clause or specific standards.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Up to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>$10,000 may be assessed for \"willful\u201d or repeated violations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b849-5\">Osha also provides for <em>criminal </em>sanctions under certain circumstances. Section 17(f) makes the unauthorized advance notification of an osha inspection a crime punishable by a fine of not more than $1000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or both. Section 17(g) makes knowingly filing false statements with the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (oshrc) a crime punishable by a fine of up to $10,000 or by imprisonment for up to six months, or both._</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>The relevant section in this case is \u00a7 17(e), which provides criminal sanctions for a \"willful\u201d violation of a specific standard that results in the death of an employee. Section 17(e) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b850-5\">Any employer who willfully violates any standard, rule, or order promulgated pursuant to section 655 of this title, or of any regulations prescribed pursuant to this chapter, and that violation caused death to any employee, shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than six months, or by both; except that if the conviction is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such person, punishment shall be by a fine of not more than $20,000 or by imprisonment for not more than one year, or by both.[<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b850-6\">The defendant contends that if he is subject to any criminal liability for his acts or omissions in causing the victim\u2019s death, it is under this section of osha, not under any state criminal law such as the manslaughter statute under which he was charged. MCL 750.321; MSA 28.553. The defendant argues that both the legislative history of osha and its comprehensive scope indicate that Congress intended to fully occupy the entire field of worker health and safety, and that to the extent that the state criminal sanctions sought to be applied in this case differ from or conflict with those found in osha, they are inapplicable as a result of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>iii</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">OSHA PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"AuV\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Generally, the existence of federal laws or regulations in a particular area can preempt state action in the same field where preemption is either express, implied, or the result of a conflict between state and federal law.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In each of these situations, the extent to which federal law actually preempts state authority is a question of congressional intent. \" '[T]he purpose of Congress is the ultimate touchstone.\u2019 \u201d <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co v </em>Coyne, 482 US 1, 8; 107 S Ct 2211; 96 L Ed 2d 1 (1987) (quoting <em>Malone v White Motor Corp, </em>435 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>US 497, 504; 98 S Ct 1185; 55 L Ed 2d 443 (1978). In addition, \"[w]here, as here, the field which Congress is said to have pre-empted has been traditionally occupied by the States . . . 'we start with the assumption that the historic police powers of the States were not to be superseded by the Federal Act unless that was the clear and manifest purpose of Congress.\u2019 <em>Rice v Santa Fe Elevator Corp, </em>331 US 218, 230 [67 S Ct 1146; 91 L Ed 1447] (1947).\u201d <em>Jones v Rath Packing Co, </em>430 US 519, 525; 97 S Ct 1305; 51 L Ed 2d 604 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">EXPRESS PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b852-7\">The defendant does not argue that osha expressly preempts the application of state criminal laws to conduct in the workplace.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, however, apparently found such express preemption by virtue of \u00a7 18 of the act. Section 18 provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-8\">(a) Assertion of State standards in absence of applicable Federal standards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-9\">Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any State agency or court from asserting jurisdiction under State law over any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which no standard is in effect under section 655 of this title.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-10\">(b) Submission of State plan for development and enforcement of State standards to preempt applicable Federal standards</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b852-11\">Any State which, at any time, desires to assume responsibility for development and enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>therein of occupational safety and health standards relating to any occupational safety or health issue with respect to which a Federal standard has been promulgated under section 655 of this title shall submit a State plan for the development of such standards and their enforcement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b853-5\">The Court of Appeals properly interpreted this language to mean that a state may assert jurisdiction over an occupational safety and health issue <em>\"only if </em>there is no federal standard in effect . . . or the state has submitted its own enforcement plan to the United States Secretary of Labor for approval pursuant to [\u00a7 18(b)].\u201d <em>People v Hegedus, supra, </em>p 67 (emphasis added). However, the Court of Appeals then improperly concluded that the prosecution of the defendant in this case in fact amounted to an assertion of jurisdiction over just such an issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">The Court of Appeals reasoned that since osha does contain standards regulating the existence and allowable proportions of carbon monoxide in the workplace, the state may not exert jurisdiction over \"this issue\u201d except through an approved state plan. <em>Id., </em>p 68. Observing that this case was not prosecuted under the state\u2019s approved plan (miosha), but rather on \"general criminal charges,\u201d the Court concluded that such prosecution was an improper attempt not only to circumvent the penalties prescribed in miosha, but also to assert jurisdiction over a federally covered occupational safety and health issue through means other than an approved plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-7\">The Court of Appeals misreads \u00a7 18. Section 18(a) has the clear effect of actually <em>preserving </em>state jurisdiction over safety and health issues with respect to which no federal standard exists, while the language of \u00a7 18(b) is expressly limited to the development and enforcement of state <em>stan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number><em>dards </em>relating to such issues, and thus does not affect the enforcement of a state\u2019s general criminal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">The term \"occupational safety and health standard\u201d is defined as \"a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.\u201d 29 USC 652(8). The manslaughter statute under which the defendant was charged in this case is not a \"standard\u201d in the sense intended by the act. It does not require particular conditions, or mandate the use of prescribed practices or means, etc., in order to ensure the existence of a safe and healthful work environment. As one commentator explained, \"[standards are ... ex ante, prophylactic measures prescribing or proscribing specific practices. In contrast, general state criminal laws . . . are ex post, reactive measures, focusing on conduct after an injury has occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For the same reasons, \u00a7 17(e) itself cannot be called a \"standard.\u201d It is a penalty provision. It does not literally prescribe or proscribe conduct.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The Court of Appeals characterized the prosecution of the defendant under the state\u2019s general criminal laws as an attempt to \"assert jurisdiction over a federally covered occupational safety and health issue other than through an approved state plan.\u201d <em>Hegedus, supra, </em>p 68. To allow such action, it concluded, would \"emasculate\u201d the requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>of \u00a7 18 that the state act through an approved plan. It thus appears that what the Court really was concerned with is the state\u2019s apparent ability to accomplish the same purpose or end to which safety and health standards are created\u2014regulation of workplace conduct\u2014without having to go through the process of approval the act requires. It therefore in effect concluded that Congress intended \u00a7 18(b) to preempt all state laws to the extent that they regulate workplace safety and health. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">In <em>People v Chicago Magnet Wire Corp, </em>157 Ill App 3d 797, 801; 510 NE2d 1173 (1987), the Illinois Court of Appeals similarly concluded that the state was precluded from enforcing its criminal laws as to \"conduct related to working conditions now regulated by osha.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On appeal, the Illinois Supreme Court rejected this implicit regulation analysis and in reversing the intermediate court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b855-6\">We cannot accept the defendants\u2019 contention that it must be concluded that Congress intended to preempt the enforcement of State criminal laws in regard to conduct of employers in the workplace because the State criminal laws <em>implicitly </em>enforce occupational health and safety standards. <em>[People v Chicago Magnet Wire Corp, </em>126 Ill 2d 356, \u2014; 534 NE2d 962, 966 (1989). Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">It is true that the knowledge that general criminal sanctions, such as prosecution for manslaugh<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>ter, are available in sufficiently egregious situations is likely to affect an employer\u2019s actions in the workplace. It is also likely that the fear of a criminal conviction would cause an employer to adhere more closely to promulgated osha standards to ensure that no such situation results. However, as myriad overlapping areas of state and federal law demonstrate, it can only rarely be said that the enforcement of state laws is precluded simply because it tends of necessity to affect the regulated conduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We agree with the Illinois Supreme Court that in this context the preemption question cannot be resolved with reference to the possible incidental effects of state action. Rather, it is the purpose of the state action that governs the express preemption inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">In <em>Environmental Encapsulating Corp v New York City, </em>855 F2d 48 (CA 2, 1988), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit considered the claim that the city\u2019s program for training and certification of workers who handle asbestos, administered through its Department of Environmental Protection, was preempted by osha.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In rejecting the claim that \u00a7 18 expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>preempted the city\u2019s program, the court in <em>Environmental Encapsulating </em>first observed that the program had a \"dual\u201d purpose, both to protect public health and to safeguard employee health and safety. <em>Id., </em>p 56. It then went on to consider the effect of \u00a7 18 on state or local regulations \"which have a legitimate purpose apart from one promoting occupational health and safety, but which also\u2014even if incidentally\u2014in fact promote occupational health and safety.\u201d <em>Id., </em>pp 56-57. The court ultimately concluded that osha does not preempt such regulations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b857-3\">Thus, we hold that in order to avoid preemption the City must demonstrate only that for each of the dep requirements there is a legitimate and substantial purpose apart from protecting asbestos workers. If this is demonstrated, the particular requirement is not a state \"occupational safety and health standard\u201d preempted by \u00a7 18. <em>[Id., </em>p 57.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b857-4\">The \"legitimate and substantial purpose\u201d test of <em>Environmental Encapsulating </em>recognizes both the intention of Congress to establish a \"federal floor for safety in the workplace,\u201d <em>United Steelworkers of America v Auchter, </em>763 F2d 728, 734 (CA 3, 1985), and the interest of the states in retaining their historic police powers.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AK_\">We similarly conclude that there is a \"legiti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>mate and substantial purpose\u201d on the part of this state, apart from regulating <em>occupational </em>health and safety, in enforcing its criminal laws even though the conduct occurred in the workplace. While deterrence, and thus to some extent regulation, is one aim of general criminal laws, so too is punishment\u2014clearly not one of osha\u2019s primary goals. A more important purpose, however, is the protection of employees as members of the general public. While osha is concerned with protecting employees as \"workers\u201d from specific safety and health hazards connected with their occupations, the state is concerned with protecting the employees as \"citizens\u201d from criminal conduct. Whether that conduct occurs in public or in private, in the home or in the workplace, the state\u2019s interest in preventing it, and punishing it, is indeed both legitimate and substantial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>We thus cannot agree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 18 of the act, the focus of which is the administrative regulation of workplace health and safety through specific, promulgated standards, was clearly intended to deprive citizens, merely by virtue of their status as employees, of the historic protection of this state\u2019s criminal laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In addition to the limited relevance of \u00a7 18 to the question before us, we note the inclusion of a \"saving clause\u201d within the act to guard against undue restrictions upon state action in this area. Section 4(b)(4) of the act states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b859-6\">Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede or in any manner affect any workmen\u2019s compensation law or to enlarge or diminish or affect in any other manner the common law or statutory rights, duties, or liabilities of employers and employees under any law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-7\">The Court of Appeals interpreted this provision as reflecting a congressional intent to \"leave undisturbed private rights and liabilities of employers and employees such as those found in the Workers\u2019 Disability Compensation Act or the Civil Rights Act.\u201d <em>Hegedus, supra, </em>p 68. It should be strictly construed, the Court argued, to preserve only other laws regulating relations between employers and employees, which criminal laws are not primarily designed to do.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>There is some merit to the argument that \u00a7 4(b)(4) was never intended by Congress specifically to save criminal law from preemption. As one author points out, there is no indication in either the act itself or its legislative history that Congress ever contemplated the effect that criminal laws might have on osha enforcement. Note, <em>Getting away with murder: Federal osha preemption of state criminal prosecutions for industrial </em>accidents, 101 Harv L R 535, 543 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">However, it is also true that \u00a7 4(b)(4) arguably includes criminal laws among those specifically not \"superseded.\u201d It states that the act should not be read to supersede or affect either any workers\u2019 compensation law or the \"common law or <em>statutory </em>rights, <em>duties, or liabilities of employers . . . </em>under <em>any </em>law with respect to injuries, diseases, or death of employees arising out of, or in the course of, employment.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The manslaughter law under which the state seeks to impose \"statutory liability\u201d upon the defendant for the death of an employee arguably qualifies as \"any law\u201d under the above language. As written, the section does not appear to be in any way qualified, other than by the \"arising out of, or in the course of, employment\u201d language, which also apparently is met here._</p>\n<p id=\"b861-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>When the broad language of \u00a7 4(b)(4), evidencing a general congressional intent to leave existing state common-law rules and statutes intact so far as possible, is considered along with the general presumption against preemption discussed above, the conclusion that the \u00a7 18 jurisdictional requirements are to be read narrowly to preempt only unauthorized workplace standards, not the state\u2019s criminal laws, is inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">IMPLIED PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">The Court in <em>Hillsborough Co v Automated Medical Labs, Inc, </em>471 US 707; 105 S Ct 2371; 85 L Ed 2d 714 (1985), narrowed the application of implied preemption theory to two distinct situations. First, \"Congress\u2019 intent to pre-empt all state law in a particular area may be inferred where the scheme of federal regulation is sufficiently comprehensive to make reasonable the inference that Congress 'left no room\u2019 for supplementary state regulation. <em>Rice v Santa Fe Elevator Corp, </em>331 US 218, 230 [67 S Ct 1146; 91 L Ed 1447] (1947).\u201d <em>Hillsborough, </em>p 713. Preemption also may be inferred if the field sought to be preempted \"is one in which 'the federal interest is so dominant that the federal system will be assumed to preclude enforcement of state laws on the same subject.\u2019 <em>Hines v Davidowitz, </em>312 US 52, 67 [61 S Ct 399; 85 L Ed 581] (1941).\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 713.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>It cannot seriously be contended, with respect to this second theory of implied preemption, that the federal interest in workplace health and safety outweighs the state\u2019s interests in this situation. Against that federal interest must be balanced not only the state\u2019s own\u2014and in fact predominant\u2014 historical interest in the regulation of health and safety matters, <em>Hillsborough, </em>p 719 (citing <em>Rice v Santa Fe Elevator Corp, supra), </em>but also its traditional police powers interest in prosecuting criminal conduct. See <em>Knapp v Schweitzer, </em>357 US 371; 78 S Ct 1302; 2 L Ed 2d 1393 (1958); <em>Patterson v New York, </em>432 US 197; 97 S Ct 2319; 53 L Ed 2d 281 (1977).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The defendant, however, does not argue the dominancy of the federal interest in this case. He argues instead that the comprehensiveness of the federal act evidences an intent on the part of Congress to \"occupy the field\u201d of workplace safety and health that would be undermined by allowing the application of state criminal laws in cases such as this. He contends that Congress has created a comprehensive regulatory scheme that is \"unquestionably a clear, thorough set of guideposts for employers and employees\u201d that leaves no room for state involvement, and that, in any event, the act\u2019s statutory scheme sets specific \"standards\u201d for criminal liability in this area, thus evidencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>Congress\u2019 intent to occupy entirely at least that portion of the safety and health field.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-5\">There is no merit to the argument that we may infer from osha\u2019s broad scope a congressional intent to occupy the entire field of safety and health regulation or to exclude the states therefrom. The act itself clearly belies that conclusion, since, as discussed above, it preserves in \u00a7 18(a) the states\u2019 jurisdiction over issues for which there is no existing federal standard, and allows states in \u00a7 18(b), albeit with osha approval, to formulate their own standards for workplace safety and health. The act thus contemplates an active role by the states in all areas of regulation. Indeed, it actually encourages states \"to assume the fullest responsibility for the administration and enforcement of their occupational safety and health laws . . . .\u201d 29 USC 651(b)(11).</p>\n<p id=\"b863-6\">The sheer length of the act, in our view, merely reflects the complexity of the subject matter. When considered in the context of that subject matter, the act\u2019s apparent comprehensiveness is not surprising. As the United States Supreme Court stated in <em>New York Dep\u2019t of Social Services v Dublino, </em>413 US 405, 415; 93 S Ct 2507; 37 L Ed 2d 688 (1973), \"The subjects of modern social and regulatory legislation often by their very nature require intricate and complex responses from Congress, but without Congress necessarily intending its enactment as the exclusive means of meeting the problem . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-7\">Despite its length and thoroughness, osha is far from complete. The incompleteness of osha\u2019s provisions for criminal penalties is but one example of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the incompleteness of the act as a whole, and serves to answer the defendant\u2019s second argument, that the inclusion of such sanctions within the act evidences Congress\u2019 intent to preempt at least that portion of the occupational safety and health field. The act itself contains only a few very minor criminal sanctions that can hardly be said to compose a comprehensive and exclusive scheme. Under \u00a7 17(e), a wilful violation of a specific osha standard that results in an employee\u2019s death is punishable by only up to six months\u2019 imprisonment. A similar violation that \"only\u201d seriously injures an employee carries no criminal penalties at all. A violation of the general-duty clause of \u00a7 5(a), even if it results in death, also carries no criminal penalty. Thus, as the Illinois Supreme Court concluded in <em>Chicago Magnet Wire, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b864-5\">[I]t seems clear that providing for appropriate criminal sanctions in cases of egregious conduct causing serious or fatal injuries to employees was not considered. Under these circumstances, it is totally unreasonable to conclude that Congress intended that osha\u2019s penalties would be the only sanctions available for wrongful conduct which threatens or results in serious physical injury or death to workers. <em>[Id., </em>534 NE2d 967.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b864-6\">Rather, as one author has concluded, \"[t]he interpretation most consistent with the Act\u2019s goals is that Congress did not intend to preclude state penalties but rather [intended] to allow states to supplement osha penalties with their own sanctions.\u201d Note, <em>Federal osha preemption, supra, </em>p 548.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">D</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">CONFLICT PREEMPTION</p>\n<p id=\"b864-9\">Preemption of state action lastly may be found if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>a conflict exists between the state and federal laws. Such a conflict arises \"when 'compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility,\u2019 <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers v Paul, </em>373 US 132, 142-143 [83 S Ct 1210; 10 L Ed 2d 248] (1963), or when state law 'stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress,\u2019 <em>Hines v Davidowitz, supra </em>at 67.\u201d <em>Hillsborough, supra, </em>p 713.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">This case does not involve conflicting sets of regulations in the same area, making compliance with both a physical impossibility, as might happen, for example, when compliance with federal regulations necessarily violates state regulations.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The defendant argues only that criminal prosecutions other than under osha for conduct in the workplace \"stand[] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution\u201d of that act\u2019s purposes. <em>Hines v Davidowitz, supra, </em>p 67. The defendant argues in particular that allowing criminal prosecutions other than under osha would frustrate the goal of uniformity of sanctions for violations of the act. According to the defendant, the fact that states may already incorporate different criminal sanctions, with federal approval, into their own occupational safety and health legislation is burden enough on employers. To allow the states to also apply their own criminal laws, which obviously vary from state to state, to workplace conduct, would completely defeat the prospect of uniformity.</p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>We are unpersuaded by this argument, since we are not convinced that uniformity of sanctions\u2014or even of regulations, for that matter\u2014was a significant concern of Congress when it adopted osha. In our view, \"[t]he statute\u2019s purpose was to assure minimum\u2014but not necessarily uniform\u2014occupational health and safety standards.\u201d <em>Environmental Encapsulating Corp v New York City, supra, </em>p 59.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The fact that states are encouraged in the first section of the act to develop their own occupational safety and health standards, subject only to the condition in \u00a7 18(c)(2) that they be \"at least as effective\u201d as the federal standards, indicates that Congress was not primarily concerned with uniformity, but rather intended the federal act to provide a kind of \"floor\u201d of protection to employees. As the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated in <em>United Steelworkers of America v Auchter, supra, </em>p 734, \"[Reduction of burdens posed by multiple state laws does not appear to have been a significant congressional concern; rather, Congress favored a uniform federal law so that those states providing vigorous protection would not be disadvantaged by those that did not.\u201d The application of this state\u2019s criminal laws to conduct in the workplace does not in our view present an obstacle to the accomplishment of osha\u2019s stated goal of assuring employees \"safe and healthful working conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>E</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The result we reach today is compelled by the Supremacy Clause preemption analysis that has been established by the United States Supreme Court. Common sense likewise dictates this result. Consider the hypothetical example<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> in which an explosion occurs in a factory as a result of hazardous conditions amounting not only to a violation of a specific osha standard but also to criminal negligence. It could not seriously be contended in this situation that the prosecution under state criminal laws (such as a manslaughter statute) of the employer for the resulting deaths of his employees is preempted by osha\u2019s provision in \u00a7 17(e) of six months imprisonment for such a violation, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>as to the deaths of any visitors, passersby, or members of the surrounding community, the state\u2019s ability to prosecute the employer as it sees fit is unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">To take the hypothetical example one step further, suppose the employer actually intended to cause the deaths of his employees. Surely it could not be contended that, since the employer\u2019s act involved \"conduct related to working conditions,\u201d <em>People v Chicago Magnet Wire, supra, </em>p 801, the state is precluded from charging the employer with murder, having instead to settle for a six-month prison term for a wilful violation of an osha standard. The difference between this hypothetical example and the case at bar is at most one of degree or of levels of criminal intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">We do not believe that the inclusion by Congress of a few truly minor criminal sanctions within osha for \"willful\u201d violations of its standards, and only for those violations which actually result in death, evidences an intent to subordinate the traditional police powers of this state to the limited authority of the federal government to such an extent that the state is unable to enforce its laws against serious criminal conduct directed against its citizens. The mere fact that such conduct takes place in an employment setting, where there is a limited federal interest in protecting the safety and health of employees, is not sufficient to remove from the state its traditional authority and responsibility to protect the welfare of its citizens.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b869-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b869-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">Our decision on the preemption question addressed by the Court of Appeals does not resolve this case, however. The prosecution\u2019s appeal in that Court initially concerned the circuit court\u2019s decision to quash the information against the defendant and dismiss the manslaughter charge. The Court of Appeals raised the preemption issue sua sponte, requesting supplemental briefs from the parties. Since the Court of Appeals found that the prosecution was preempted by osha, it failed to reach the question whether the magistrate abused his discretion in binding over the defendant on the involuntary manslaughter charge for the reasons stated by the circuit judge. We therefore remand this case to the Court of Appeals for consideration of that issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">The defendant in this case is charged with manslaughter, not simply with a \"willful\u201d violation of an osha standard. While his conduct, if proved, might also satisfy the elements of that \"crime,\u201d the state has chosen, in a valid exercise of its police powers, to pursue this matter under its own criminal laws. We cannot construe osha, the stated purpose of which is \"to assure so far as possible . . . safe and healthful working conditions and to preserve our human resources,\u201d as a grant of immunity to employers who are responsible for the deaths or serious injuries of their employees. We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to that Court for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>consideration of those issues raised on appeal that it failed to consider.</p>\n<judges id=\"b870-3\">Riley, C.J., and Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, Archer, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Boyle, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b845-15\"> 29 USC 651 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b846-9\"> MCL 408.1001 <em>et seq.; </em>MSA 17.50(1) <em>et seq.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b846-10\"> The conspiracy charge against the defendant, along with similar charges against Richard and John Jackson, the owner and general manager, respectively, of Jackson Enterprises, was dismissed at the preliminary hearing.

This Court ordered the case remanded to the Court of Appeals for consideration as on leave granted. <em>People v Jackson, </em>429 Mich 875 (1987).

A \"willful\u201d violation for purposes of \u00a7 17 is not defined in the act. However, we note that most circuits of the federal Court of Appeals continue to adhere generally to the definition of wilful announced by the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in <em>Intercounty Construction Co v Occupational Safety &amp; Health Review Comm, </em>522 F2d 777, 779-780 (CA 4, 1975), cert den 423 US 1072 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b849-7\">\"[Wjillful\u201d means action taken knowledgeably by one subject to the statutory provisions in disregard of the action\u2019s legality.

An omission or failure to act is wilful if it is done knowingly and purposely. Wilful does not require a showing of moral turpitude, evil purpose, or criminal intent provided the individual is shown to have acted or to have failed to act knowingly and purposely.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b850-7\"> Note that, unlike the civil penalties described above, these criminal sanctions apply only to violations of specific standards that cause an employee\u2019s death.

The United States Supreme Court generally has taken a liberal attitude toward, for example, state regulation concerning employment discrimination, <em>Colorado Anti-Discrimination Comm v Continental Air Lines, </em>372 US 714; 83 S Ct 1022; 10 L Ed 2d 84 (1963), and unemployment compensation, <em>New York Telephone Co v New York Dep\u2019t of Labor, </em>440 US 519; 99 S Ct 1328; 59 L Ed 2d 553 (1979).

It cites <em>Silkwood v Kerr-McGee Corp, </em>464 US 238; 104 S Ct 615; 78 L Ed 2d 443 (1984), in which the Court addressed the question whether state courts were preempted by the Atomic Energy Act, 42 USC 2011 <em>et seq., </em>from assessing punitive damages against a defendant for injuries resulting from excessive radiation. The Court found that even though the state was precluded from regulating the safety aspects of nuclear energy, <em>Pacific Gas &amp; Electric v State Energy Resources Conservation &amp; Development Comm, </em>461 US 190, 205; 103 S Ct 1713; 75 L Ed 2d 752 (1983), it was not precluded from granting punitive damages. The Court specifically found unpersuasive the defendant\u2019s argument that since a state-sanctioned punitive damages award \"deters conduct related to radiation hazards,\u201d it should be preempted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b858-7\">It may be that the award of damages based on [sic] the state law of negligence or strict liability is regulatory in the sense that a nuclear plant will be threatened with damages liability if it does not conform to state standards, but that regulatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>consequence was something that Congress was quite willing to accept. <em>[Silkwood, supra, </em>p 256.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">With regard to osha, we note the apparent congressional intent to accept at least some incidental regulation of workplace activity, as evidenced by the act\u2019s \"saving clause,\u201d \u00a7 4(b)(4), which lists those rights and duties that are expressly <em>not </em>preempted by osha.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b859-10\"> The defendant also briefly discusses \u00a7 4(b)(4). He finds significant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>the fact that it does not expressly exempt criminal laws from preemption, as it does, for example, workers\u2019 compensation laws. The defendant cites the comparable saving clause in the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, 29 USC 1001 <em>et seq., </em>as an example of how Congress would have indicated a desire to specifically save criminal laws from preemption. Section 1144(b)(4) of that legislation exempts \"any generally applicable criminal law of a State\u201d from preemption. There is no such provision in \u00a7 4(b)(4). The defendant also argues that \u00a7 4(b)(4) has consistently been interpreted to preserve existing workers\u2019 compensation and tort remedies, but not to create additional remedies for employees. See, e.g., <em>Pratico v Portland Terminal Co, </em>783 F2d 255 (CA 1, 1985); <em>United Steelworkers of America v Marshall, </em>208 US App DC 60; 647 F2d 1189 (1980), cert den 453 US 913 (1981).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b861-8\"> Earlier decisions by the United States Supreme Court included a third theory of implied preemption, in which \"the object sought to be obtained by the federal law and the character of obligations imposed by it may reveal the same purpose.\u201d <em>Rice v Santa Fe Elevator Corp, supra, </em>p 230.

In any event, it appears that the Court is content with the general preemption analysis summarized in <em>Hillsborough, </em>as evidenced by its substantial adoption of the same analysis more recently in <em>Schneidewind v ANR Pipeline Co, </em>485 US 293; 108 S Ct 1145; 99 L Ed 2d 316 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\"> As the Court stated in <em>Patterson, supra, </em>\"It goes without saying that preventing and dealing with crime is much more the business of the States than it is of the Federal Government, . . . and that we should not lightly construe the Constitution so as to intrude upon the administration of justice by the individual States.\u201d <em>Id., </em>p 201.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b863-8\"> See also <em>Hillsborough, supra, </em>pp 716-718; <em>R J Reynolds Tobacco Co v Durham Co, </em>479 US 130, 149; 107 S Ct 499; 93 L Ed 2d 449 (1986) (\"[preemption should not be inferred, however, simply because the . . . regulations are comprehensive\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"23\">\n<p id=\"b865-6\"> The example of impossibility of dual compliance given by the Court in <em>Florida Lime &amp; Avocado Growers, Inc, supra, </em>p 143, involved federal regulations forbidding the picking of any avocado containing more than seven percent oil, while a state regulation excluded any avocado with less than eight percent oil.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"24\">\n<p id=\"b866-5\"> As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stated in <em>Ohio Manufacturers\u2019 Ass\u2019n v City of Akron, </em>801 F2d 824, 831 (CA 6, 1986), \"While the legislation and its history do illustrate that a national standard was felt to be essential to achieve the goals of the Act, they also indicate that this was to assure that the states would at least meet the minimum requirements of the federal standards, and not attempt to undercut each other.\u201d This conclusion is supported by the language and legislative history of \u00a7 18(c)(2) of the act, which requires that federally approved state plans be only \"at least as effective\u201d as the federal plan. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"25\">\n<p id=\"b867-6\"> See <em>\"Getting away with murder in the workplace: osha\u2019s non-use of criminal penalties for safely violations,\u201d </em>HR Rep No. 100-1051, 100th Cong 2d Sess (1988), p 10.
