The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction in an unpublished per curiam opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant appealed in this Court, and we granted leave<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to consider the following issues: 1) whether the proposed testimony and cross-examination concerning the complainant\u2019s sexual contact with a third person were properly excluded under the rape-shield statute, MCL 750.520j(l); MSA 28.788(10X1); 2) whether the proposed testimony and cross-examination concerning the complainant\u2019s sexual contact with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>third person were properly excluded under MRE 404(a)(3) and whether MRE 404(a)(3) supersedes the rape-shield statute; and 3) whether the trial court erred by admitting, under MRE 803(4), the medical diagnosis and treatment exception to the hearsay rule, a psychologist\u2019s hearsay testimony that complainant named the defendant as her assailant.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">The facts of this case are set forth in Justice Archer\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">We conclude, for the reasons set forth in sections i(A) and i(b) of Justice Archer\u2019s opinion, that the exclusion of evidence of complainant\u2019s sexual history did not violate either the rape-shield statute or the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-10\">We do not, however, address whether MRE 404(a)(3) supersedes the statute or whether the exclusion of the evidence of complainant\u2019s sexual history violates that rule. Rather, we determine that leave was improvidently granted as to those issues. At trial, defense counsel did not argue that admission was proper under the rule, and the trial judge did not base his rulings in limine on such a conflict. Moreover, the Court of Appeals did not address the claim, having not been asked to do so. While the issues are of significance, we conclude that we should not address them without a full record having been developed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">hi</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">The trial court admitted testimony of Dr. Joan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Jackson Johnson, the substance of which was the complainant\u2019s hearsay statements that she had been sexually abused by the defendant, her stepfather.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Hearsay is \"a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and may only be admitted if provided for in an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>People v Eady, </em>409 Mich 356; 294 NW2d 202 (1980). MRE 803(4) provides for admission of</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-6\">[statements made for purposes of medical treatment or medical diagnosis in connection with treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof insofar as reasonably necessary to such diagnosis and treatment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">This Court has never had occasion to consider whether MRE 803(4) may serve as a basis for the admission of hearsay statements as to the identity of the perpetrator of a crime. Further, we have not considered its use where the witness is a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">A psychologist treats mental and emotional disorders rather than physical ones.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Lying to one\u2019s health care provider about symptoms and their general causes would be detrimental to the patient, and it is, in part, for this reason that we permit the introduction of such hearsay statements. It is therefore fair to say that, while medical patients may fabricate descriptions of their complaints and the general character of the causes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>of these complaints, we would think it less likely that they will do so than psychological patients. In addition, although there are psychological tests, fabrications of physical complaints would seem to be far easier to discover through empirical tests than are fabrications which might be heard by an examining psychologist. Indeed, statements which are untrue, and which the examining psychologist knows to be untrue, may nevertheless serve as a basis for accurate diagnosis and treatment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Thus, statements made in the course of the treatment of psychological disorders may not always be as reliable as those made in the course of the treatment of physical disorders.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">The introduction of hearsay statements such as those admitted in the instant case is of concern for a second reason. Not only are we less able to ascertain their reliability than those made to a medical doctor, but they identify the person who caused the declarant\u2019s pain. It has long been the rule that the declarant\u2019s naming of the person responsible for his condition may not be admitted pursuant to the hearsay exception described in MRE 803(4).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, the common-law predecessor of MRE 803(4) was of an even more limiting nature. In an early case discussing that rule, this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">[Statements of pain and its locality] are admit<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ted only upon the ground that they are the . natural and ordinary accompaniments and expressions of suffering. It would be impossible in most cases to know of the existence or extent or character of pain without them. They are received therefore as acts rather than declarations, and admitted from necessity. The rule . . . has never been extended so as to include declarations ... of the causes in the past of such suffering, so as to make such statements proof of the facts. Declarations concerning the past are narratives and not acts. <em>[Grand Rapids &amp; I R Co v Huntley, </em>38 Mich 537, 543-544 (1878).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-4\">We do not suggest that the bounds of MRE 803 should be defined by its precodification common-law parallels. In fact, the exception defined in MRE 803(4) inarguably goes beyond that defined in common law because it permits the introduction of statements describing \"past . . . symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof . . . .\u201d See also the committee note to MRE 803(4). However, while the drafters of the rule clearly intended to go beyond the common law, we do not believe that they intended that the victim\u2019s naming of her assailant should be considered a description of the <em>\"general </em>character of the cause or external source\u201d of an injury. To read the exception to provide for such hearsay, particularly in the context of psychological treatment, would clearly broaden the nature of the exception beyond the scope intended by its drafters.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The recent trend to broaden this hearsay exception rests primarily on two decisions of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In <em>United States v Iron Shell, </em>633 F2d 77 (CA 8, 1980), the court held that the testimony of a physician who examined a nine-year-old victim of a sexual assault could be admitted even though it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>contained a repetition of the complainant\u2019s description of the general cause of her injury, i.e., a sexual assault. The testimony did <em>not </em>include the complainant\u2019s naming of the defendant as her assailant. In admitting this testimony, the <em>Iron Shell </em>panel defined a two-pronged test for admission of hearsay evidence pursuant to FRE 803(4). First, the declarant\u2019s motive in making the statement must be consistent with the purposes of the rule, i.e., the promotion of treatment. Second, the content of the statement must have been of the type reasonably relied upon by a physician in diagnosis or treatment. <em>Id., </em>p 84. In <em>Iron Shell, </em>the admitted hearsay involved only the occurrence and nature of the attack. No attempt was made to introduce the identity of the assailant. Indeed, the <em>Iron Shell </em>court, <em>supra </em>at 85, cited <em>United States v Nick, </em>604 F2d 1199, 1201-1202 (CA 9, 1979), and noted that in <em>Nick</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">the examining physician was allowed under rule 803(4) to repeat the child\u2019s description of the assault including the victim\u2019s statements concerning the cause of the injury <em>while omitting any comments about the identity of the assailant. </em>[Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">In addition, the complainant was treated by a physician immediately after the rape, and the fact that she had been raped was physically confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">While <em>Iron Shell </em>kept within the bounds of the language of the rule by admitting hearsay testimony describing only the general nature of the cause of complainant\u2019s injury, the Eighth Circuit later used the <em>Iron Shell </em>test to significantly expand the scope of the hearsay exception in <em>United States v Renville, </em>779 F2d 430 (CA 8, 1985). In <em>Renville, </em>the eleven-year-old complainant was examined by a physician who testified that the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>plainant had told him that she had been subjected to repeated acts of sexual abuse by the defendant. In affirming the admission of the testimony, the panel held that cases of child sexual abuse fell outside the rule that the identity of the individual allegedly responsible for a declarant\u2019s injuries may not be revealed pursuant to FRE 803(4), since the knowledge that the assailant is a member of the same household is pertinent to the treatment required. The panel noted that child abuse involves more than physical injury and that proper psychological treatment requires knowledge of which member of the household was the abuser. The court also noted that a physician must take protective actions such as removing the child from the home upon learning that intrafamily child sexual abuse is occurring and that therefore the identity of the perpetrator is a fact \"relied on\u201d by the physician.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">As we have just discussed, the identity of an assailant cannot fairly be characterized as the <em>\"general </em>cause\u201d of an injury. The <em>Renville </em>court did not address this difficulty in its analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Further, as we have already noted <em>ante, </em>the statements in this case were made to a psychologist rather than to a physician and this suggests that the statement by the victim in this case may be less reliable than a statement made to a physician. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Thus, although we recognize that the patient\u2019s assertion of the identity of the assailant is relevant to psychological treatment, it has not been shown that the reliability of the complainant\u2019s statement reaches the level necessary to fall within MRE 803(4). In addition, we do not believe that a physician\u2019s reliance on the victim\u2019s statements in order to take protective action is of the sort envisioned by the drafters of MRE 803(4). The rule is most specific in limiting the exception to \"medical treatment or medical diagnosis\u201d or other information \"necessary to such diagnosis or treatment.\u201d It did not leave room for speculation on hearsay which may indeed be reliable and useful for other kinds of treatment for the victim, such as security from further criminal activity. It is natural and appropriate that a psychologist or physician confronted with such accusations take immediate measures to protect the child even if it is not certain that actual abuse occurred. The determination as to the occurrence of abuse can be reevaluated after protective measures have been taken. In such a setting, it is likely that the nature of the psychologist\u2019s reliance on the statement for purposes of taking protective action is of a different and more readily found type than the reliance originally intended to suggest a sufficient level of reliability for admission as hearsay.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">In addition, we note that the relevant Michigan rule is narrower than the federal rule construed in <em>Renville. </em>The federal rule permits the introduction of \"[statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment,\u201d while the Michigan rule requires that the diagnosis be \"in connection with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>treatment.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The prosecution claims that complainant\u2019s hearsay statements were indeed made during the course of treatment. Defendant claims that the statements were made at a meeting between Dr. Jackson Johnson and complainant held pursuant to a probate court order that complainant and her accusations be evaluated by a psychologist. The record is not clear as to the actual impetus for that meeting. However, it is clear that complainant\u2019s September 23, 1983, meeting with Dr. Jackson Johnson occurred after she told police authorities that her stepfather had abused her and the investigation into the truth of those accusations had been initiated. While the precise nature of the September 23, 1983, meeting cannot be determined, it did not have the same measure of reliability as would even a normal psychological therapy session, since the complainant had already made the accusations and she was aware that a case against the defendant was being prepared. Defendant claims that the entire story was fabricated. If so, then surely once complainant had offered the story to the police, she would offer consistent statements to a psychologist.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">We also note that Dr. Jackson Johnson testified at the motion in limine that the complainant\u2019s assertions to her regarding the identity of the assailant were reliable. While she did not so testify at trial, the concern arises whether we should enter into an area which may involve expert testimony on the credibility of a complainant\u2019s allegations. Such testimony might violate other rules of evidence. See <em>State v Aguallo, </em>318 NC 590, 598-599; 350 SE2d 76 (1986). In addition, the purpose of hearsay exceptions is to permit the introduction of such statements where they possess a sufficient inherent degree of reliability. If, in laying the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>foundation for admission of a hearsay statement the offering party must provide expert testimony that the hearsay is reliable, then the very basis for the hearsay exception is undercut.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">For all these reasons, we conclude that the hearsay statements testified to by Dr. Jackson Johnson do not fall within either the literal or intended purpose of MRE 803(4) and therefore were erroneously admitted. In doing so, we recognize that no court has fully rejected the <em>Renville </em>analysis, although some have disagreed as to its scope and application.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> However, most of the courts which have adopted the <em>Renville </em>analysis have done so merely by citation of that case and the <em>Iron Shell </em>test without any analysis as to the application of that test to this situation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>The outcome of a child sexual abuse case is often decided by a credibility contest. The narrow and specific wording of MRE 803(4) represents an effort to balance the desire for additional evidence with the need to protect the accused from damaging hearsay. If indeed that balance needs to be shifted to allow nonmedical testimony describing statements of specific fault made after police investigations have begun, then it can best be done by amendment of the current rule.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Through the amendment process, expert advice on various types of therapy and the reliability of statements made in the course of such therapies can be obtained and evaluated.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">Thus, after a review of MRE 803(4), the facts of this case, and the <em>Renville </em>analysis, we are not satisfied that the hearsay testimony was of the type which MRE 803(4) was designed to admit. We therefore reverse defendant\u2019s conviction and remand the case for a new trial in which this evidence shall not be admitted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b361-6\">Riley, C.J., and Griffin, J., concurred with Brickley, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b361-7\">Levin and Cavanagh, JJ.

Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">Defendant was charged on January 4, 1984, with one count of first-degree criminal sexual assault against the complainant, his then fourteen-year-old stepdaughter. The defendant denied the allegation of sexual misconduct and maintained that the complainant had fabricated the assault charge as a means to leave the family home and in retaliation for his punishment of her sexual behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">On October 22, 1984, the trial court conducted a motion in limine to consider the admissibility of the complainant\u2019s alleged sexual history. The defendant testified that the assault charge stemmed from his punishment of three alleged incidents of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>sexual conduct by the complainant: (1) In the summer of 1983, the complainant and defendant\u2019s natural daughter allegedly made sexually explicit telephone calls to several neighborhood youths asking if they wanted \"blow jobs\u201d and whether they used \"rubbers.\u201d The defendant stated that he slapped the complainant and his own daughter in the face and ordered that both were to be grounded. (2) In the summer of 1984, defendant alleged he discovered the complainant, partially clad, in the family barn with a juvenile identified only as \"George.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After the complainant was ordered into the house, a heated family argument ensued at which time the complainant purportedly told the defendant to \"get fucked\u201d and that it was her business whether she wanted to \"get laid.\u201d (3) During the course of this argument, defendant further asserted he learned that earlier that same summer, the complainant\u2019s nine-year-old cousin discovered her and a juvenile named \"DJ\u201d in the complainant\u2019s bedroom. Both were allegedly found nude from the waist down with \"DJ\u201d kissing the complainant while lying on top of her.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendant stated he again grounded the complainant and that he and his wife decided to consult their case worker for advice on how to best address the complainant\u2019s sexual behavior._</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>The complainant testified to a pattern of sexual abuse by the defendant from 1979 to 1983, consisting of his fondling of her breasts and genitals on several occasions and three instances of sexual intercourse in 1981 and 1983. She denied having made obscene phone calls and asserted that she and her stepsister made bogus pizza orders for delivery to several neighbors.

Dr. Johnson treated the complainant in the latter part of September, 1983. Dr. Johnson\u2019s proffered testimony corroborated the complainant\u2019s statements regarding the defendant\u2019s alleged long-term sexual abuse. The defendant argued that as the complainant\u2019s statements were not made to a physician, they lacked the presumption of reliability sufficient to satisfy the medical diagnosis and treatment hearsay exception, MRE 803(4). The defendant also asserted complainant\u2019s identification of the defendant as her assailant was not reasonably necessary to treatment and diagnosis. In reliance upon the Court of Appeals decision in <em>People v Wilkins, </em>134 Mich App 39; 349 NW2d 815 (1984), lv den 422 Mich 826 (1985), the trial court disagreed, concluding MRE 803(4) extended to testimony by a psychologist and further that the complainant\u2019s statements to Dr. Johnson were reasonably necessary to diagnosis and treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Defendant\u2019s second trial was conducted on February 26-28, 1985, at which the defendant did not testify.

Further, the evidence served to shift a trial\u2019s emphasis away from the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence, to a determination of whether a woman\u2019s sexual decisions lent an air of suspicion to her assertions or were probative of the possibility of consent with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>defendant.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The evolution of societal attitudes deeming sexuality as distinct from crimes of sexual violence fostered dissatisfaction with archaic evidentiary rules which freely accorded a woman\u2019s sexual decisions relevancy within a prosecution for rape.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In response to mounting criticism, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>Michigan Legislature in 1974 enacted sweeping statutory reforms of the rape laws. In addition to redefining the crime of \"rape\u201d into the more expansive and gender-neutral concept of criminal sexual conduct, the Legislature also tailored the evidentiary considerations in sexual-assault prosecutions to focus upon the merits of the accused\u2019s guilt or innocence rather than the victim\u2019s sexual behavior.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">The Michigan rape-shield statute reflects the Legislature\u2019s determination that in the overwhelming majority of prosecutions, the introduction of the complainant\u2019s sexual conduct with parties other than the defendant is neither an accurate measure of the complainant\u2019s veracity nor determinative of the likelihood of consensual sexual relations with the defendant.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>People v Arenda, </em>416 Mich 1; 330 NW2d 814 (1982); <em>People v Hackett, </em>421 Mich 338; 365 NW2d 120 (1984); <em>People v Khan, </em>80 Mich App 605; 264 NW2d 360 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>However, the statute\u2019s virtual exclusion of evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual behavior prompted commentators and defendants alike to question whether the statute struck the appropriate balance between evidentiary reform and the accused\u2019s right of confrontation and cross-examination.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">In <em>People v Arenda, supra </em>at 11, this Court upheld the facial constitutionality of the rape-shield law, concluding that the \"minimal relevance of such evidence in most cases, the prohibitions do not deny or significantly diminish defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.\u201d Although in <em>Arenda </em>we acknowledged the legitimacy of the state interest reflected in the rape-shield statute, in the face of a constitutional challenge premised upon the fundamental right of confrontation, evidentiary rules and policy are secondary to the protection of individual freedoms. <em>Rock v Arkansas, </em>483 US 44; 107 S Ct 2704; 97 L Ed 2d 37 (1987). Thus, in <em>People v Hackett, supra, </em>we concluded that the exclusion of evidence outside the exceptions stated under the rape-shield statute may violate the Sixth Amendment with regard to an individual defendant.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-6\">We recognize that in certain limited situations, such evidence may not only be relevant, but its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>admission may be required to preserve a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. For example, where the defendant proffers evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct for the narrow purpose of showing the complaining witness\u2019 bias, this would almost always be material and should be admitted. Moreover in certain circumstances, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct may also be probative of a complainant\u2019s ulterior motive for making a false charge. <em>[Id. </em>at 348. Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">Clearly, the defendant\u2019s proffered evidence does not fall within the exceptions enumerated in the rape-shield statute.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Thus, our task is to determine whether the instant defendant\u2019s inability to introduce the complainant\u2019s sexual behavior under the rape-shield law is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The Sixth Amendment right of confrontation rests upon an accused\u2019s ability to cross-examine a particular witness in a fashion which effects an accurate perception of the witness by the trier of fact. In <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 680; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986), the Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-9\">[A] criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \"to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw infer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>enees relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">As the Confrontation Clause\u2019s inquiry is directed toward an individual defendant\u2019s right to cross-examine each witness, the critical relationship between the effective exercise of a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation and the determination of a witness\u2019 hidden animosity or prejudice has long been recognized. See <em>Alford v United States, </em>282 US 687; 51 S Ct 218; 75 L Ed 624 (1931).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">However, while the discovery of any witness\u2019 bias is unquestionably relevant, the Sixth Amendment does not prohibit a trial court from limiting the means by which a witness\u2019 bias is determined on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-8\">\"[T]he Confrontation Clause guarantees an <em>opportunity </em>for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.\u201d <em>[Van Arsdall, supra, </em>475 US 679.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">To determine whether the instant defendant was denied the opportunity for effective cross-examination, our inquiry is twofold. First, the exclusion of evidence proffered for the purpose of showing a witness\u2019 bias or motive to fabricate must rise to the level of constitutional error. Second, if constitutional error is in fact present, that error must be proved not to be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id. </em>at 683-686.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">In <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, supra </em>at 680, the Court determined that constitutional error is present where the accused is foreclosed from establishing a witness\u2019 bias or motive to fabricate on cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>We think that a criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of the witness, and thereby \"to expose to the jury the facts from which jurors . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the witness.\u201d [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">In the instant case, it is plausible that a reasonable trier of fact might have inferred that the defendant\u2019s punishment of the complainant\u2019s alleged sexual behavior would, in turn, cause an angry adolescent to lodge false charges of a sexual nature.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> However, as the trial court did not preclude the defendant from introducing significant nonsexual evidence from which the complainant\u2019s bias could be inferred, I conclude that the exclusion of her sexual history is not constitutional error violative of the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">The defendant argues that the United States Supreme Court decision in <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308, 318; 94 S Ct 1105; 39 L Ed 2d 347 (1974), is controlling here. In <em>Davis, </em>an Alaska statute prohibited the introduction of a witness\u2019 juvenile criminal record for all purposes other than a juvenile adjudication. The witness, Green, identified the defendant Davis as having discarded stolen property near his residence. Davis sought to cross-examine Green on his probationary status for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>several theft crimes both at the time of the identification and at trial, to imply his bias and susceptibility to police efforts to quickly identify any suspect so as to remove suspicion from himself. Although the trial court allowed inquiry into whether Green felt anxious or uncomfortable about the discovery of stolen property near his residence, it prohibited questioning regarding why Green may have been concerned over the authority\u2019s reaction. Davis alleged that his inability to reveal Green\u2019s juvenile criminal record as a probable basis for his bias and misidentification violated his right to confrontation and meaningful cross-examination. The United States Supreme Court agreed, finding that Davis\u2019 complete inability to place Green\u2019s alleged bias in its factual context relegated the defendant to engage in a seemingly baseless line of cross-examination. <em>Id. </em>at 318.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">The defendant asserts that, as in <em>Davis, </em>his inability to introduce the complainant\u2019s alleged sexual behavior similarly precluded him from placing before the jury the complainant\u2019s bias within its crucial factual context. I disagree. Unlike the defendant in <em>Davis, </em>the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the complainant\u2019s sexual history left the defendant with several avenues to explore the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate. Upon review of the trial transcript containing defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the complainant, it is clear she testified that the defendant had falsely accused her of theft, had slapped her face, and that the two had argued, with the complainant stating she wished to leave the family home. In addition, the complainant also testified that she viewed the defendant as a strict disciplinarian against whom she bore obvious hostility. Further, the complainant stated she had trouble with her parents because of boyfriends and her apparent failure to abide by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>family discipline. Defense counsel also questioned the complainant on her abilities as a creative writer in an apparent attempt to portray the complainant as a young adult adept in manufacturing fiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Thus, on the basis of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the complainant, it is clear the defendant was able to introduce compelling nonsexual evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias and motive to fabricate. Therefore, the exclusion of evidence regarding her sexual behavior does not rise to the level of constitutional error.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">However, even if the defendant\u2019s inability to cross-examine the complainant\u2019s sexual history were an error of constitutional magnitude, I nonetheless find that its exclusion and its effect upon the verdict obtained is an error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. It is well settled that all constitutional errors do not merit automatic reversal where they constitute error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Chapman v California, </em>386 US 18; 87 S Ct 824; 17 L Ed 2d 705 (1967). In <em>Van Arsdall, supra </em>at 684, the Court addressed the relationship between the harmless-error standard and a defendant\u2019s allegation of a Sixth Amendment confrontation violation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-7\">[W]e hold that the constitutionally improper denial of a defendant\u2019s opportunity to impeach a witness for bias, like other Confrontation Clause errors, is subject to <em>Chapman </em>harmless-error analysis. The correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the cross-examination were fully realized, a reviewing court might none<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>theless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Whether such an error is harmless in a particular case depends upon a host of factors, all readily accessible to reviewing courts. These factors include the importance of the witness\u2019 testimony in the prosecution\u2019s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength of the prosecution\u2019s case. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Applying the factors identified above, I note initially that the significance of complainant\u2019s testimony to the people\u2019s case is readily apparent. Here, as in most criminal sexual assault prosecutions, there were no witnesses to the defendant\u2019s alleged sexual abuse.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Nor was there any physical evidence such as blood or semen tending to identify the defendant as the complainant\u2019s assailant. Thus, the complainant\u2019s credibility was essential to the trier of fact\u2019s eventual verdict. Further, although it is no longer required by statute,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the complainant\u2019s statements regarding the alleged sexual abuse were corroborated by her treating psychologist, Dr. Joan Jackson Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">By contrast, on cross-examination counsel questioned the complainant and other prosecution witnesses thoroughly on the circumstances of the alleged sexual assaults, her long-term silence con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>cerning the defendant\u2019s actions, her alleged attempt to have a younger brother accuse the defendant of physical abuse, and the absence of health problems given the young age (eleven) at which the defendant allegedly began engaging in sexual intercourse with the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">Therefore, even if the exclusion of the complainant\u2019s sexual history were constitutional error, in light of the above matters brought out on cross-examination, I conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">I emphasize, however, that this holding would not preclude a future defendant from establishing a constitutional error requiring reversal, where the defendant is barred from introducing a complainant\u2019s sexual history for the purpose of inferring bias or motive for fabrication.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Defendant also argues that the exclusion of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>complainant\u2019s sexual history under MRE 404(a)(3) similarly violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. I disagree. In the committee comment to the evidentiary rule, it is clear that the commentators were aware of the potential unconstitutional application of the Michigan rape-shield statute:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-5\">In adopting Rule 404(a)(3) the Committee was aware that questions have been raised regarding the constitutionality of MCL 750.520j [MSA 28.788(10)], at least as it might be applied in certain cases. . . . The adoption of MRE 404(a)(3) does not resolve the question of whether, in a proper case charging criminal sexual conduct, exclusion of evidence of the victim\u2019s character would violate federal or state constitutional provisions. [Michigan Court Rules Annotated, Evidence Rules (West, 1979), p 182.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">However, for the reasons stated in part i-b, I conclude that the exclusion of defendant\u2019s proffered evidence under MRE 404(a)(3) did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">Second, I consider the Michigan rape-shield statute\u2019s continued validity since the passage of MRE 404(a)(3) and whether the evidentiary provision should in fact supersede the legislative exclusionary rule.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">Article 6, \u00a75 of the Michigan Constitution of 1963 grants this Court the power to establish and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>amend rules of procedure.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This constitutional provision enables this Court to stand as the final arbiter of the rules of practice and procedure.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> While the Legislature remains free to amend common-law rules of procedure, it is well settled that where any rule of practice set forth by statute by the Legislature stands in conflict with a rule of practice adopted by this Court, the former shall be deemed in effect only so long as judicial deference by this Court so allows. <em>People v Stanley, </em>344 Mich 530; 75 NW2d 39 (1956); MCR 1.104.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">In <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing), </em>373 Mich 531, 541-542; 130 NW2d 4 (1964), the Court concluded that its inherent constitutional authority with regard to practice and procedure extended to rules of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-7\">[W]e advert to what was said above\u2014that the rules of practice and procedure include the rules of evidence:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b379-8\">\"The judicial function constitutionally empowers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>the courts to make their own rules of procedure, including rules of evidence (subject only to specific constitutional limitations). . . .

I must now decide whether the Michigan rape-shield statute and its counterpart, MRE 404(a)(3), should continue to coexist or if the evidentiary rule should supersede the rape-shield statute and solely control the admission of a complainant\u2019s sexual history in criminal sexual conduct prosecutions.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AKv\">In <em>Buscaino v Rhodes, </em>385 Mich 474, 481; 189 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>NW2d 202 (1971), the Court employed a two-step procedure in resolving an apparent conflict between an evidentiary rule and a legislative provision: (1) each provision must be read according to its plain language, and (2) the common-sense meaning of the words should be given the effect most likely understood by those who adopted them. In the event the provisions conflict, the evidentiary rule is given precedence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">Initially, the conflict between the Michigan rape-shield statute and MRE 404(a)(3) is readily apparent. The plain language of the Michigan rape-shield statute excludes all evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual history regardless of the purpose for which it is introduced unless it falls within an exception enumerated under the statute and is found to be more probative than prejudicial. By contrast, MRE 404(a)(3) restricts the use of past sexual conduct as character evidence <em>only </em>where it is introduced for the purpose of showing that the complainant acted in conformity on a particular occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">Second, in giving effect to the common-sense meaning of each provision, the evidentiary rule clearly embodies the same determination made by the Michigan Legislature that a victim\u2019s sexual history is generally not probative of consent or veracity. However, the rule does not exclude such evidence when it is offered for a purpose <em>other </em>than showing that the victim acted in conformity with an alleged character trait for promiscuity at the time of the incident alleged against the defendant. Thus, in the instant case, while the statute barred the defendant\u2019s introduction of the complainant\u2019s sexual history for purposes of showing a bias or motive to fabricate, the evidentiary rule provides an avenue to introduce noncharacter evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>dence so long as it is found to be more probative than prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">Thus, it is evident that the two provisions are not redundant, but rather reflect two different approaches in addressing the delicate balance between a victim\u2019s privacy and a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. Inasmuch as the two provisions stand at odds with each other, I conclude that the evidentiary rule must be found to supersede the Michigan rape-shield statute.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b382-6\">Rape shield laws are a legislative response, and hence a response of the political process, to the failure of courts throughout the land to correct an imbalance in the rules of evidence which made it difficult to prosecute the crime of rape.

This Court is obliged to formulate reasonable rules of evidence that promote the truth-seeking process, are fair to both the defendant and the prosecution, and safeguard against abuse of complainants and other witnesses. <em>[People v Williams, </em>416 Mich 25, 50, n 5; 330 NW2d 823 (1982) (Levin, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Thus, I conclude that MCL 750.520j(l); MSA 28.788(10)(1), is superseded by MRE 404(a)(3).

The advisory committee notes to the federal counterpart of MRE 803(4) note that the exception is applicable even where the statements are made to a hospital attendant, ambulance driver, or member of the family. McCormick, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 293, p 840. In addition, the language of the provision focuses on the <em>declarant\u2019s </em>motivation in making the statement, rather than to <em>whom </em>the statement was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">The defendant also asserts that the complainant\u2019s identification of the defendant as her alleged assailant is not a statement reasonably necessary to diagnosis and treatment. The rationale for this exception to the hearsay rules rests upon the assumption that information which is accurate enough to form the basis for crucial health-care decisions merit exclusion from the hearsay rule. 4 Weinstein &amp; Berger, Evidence, \u00b6 803(4)[01], p 803-144. Further, it is presumed that most people will be truthful in informing someone of the true nature of their condition in order to receive accurate treatment and evaluation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">In <em>United States v Iron Shell, </em>633 F2d 77 (CA 8, 1980), cert den 450 US 1001 (1981), the Eighth Circuit devised a two-part test incorporating the traditional rationales supporting FRE 803(4) to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>determine whether a sexual assault victim\u2019s statements were reasonably pertinent to diagnosis and treatment.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> First, the declarant\u2019s motive in making the statement must be consistent with treatment and diagnosis.

The cause of an individual\u2019s distress has generally been excluded under this exception unless it is reasonably pertinent to the individual\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>diagnosis and treatment, McCormick, Evidence, <em>supra </em>at 841. Ordinarily, I would agree that the identity of a sexual assault victim\u2019s assailant would be inadmissible under this exception. However, in instances of parental sexual abuse, the child is victimized by an adult who has exploited the normal parent-child relationship in order to obtain sexual gratification. The victim is thus torn between conflicting emotions of guilt and anger along with a continuing need for parental affection. When this additional factor is added to the devastating trauma of sexual assault, it would appear natural for the victim, once removed from the parent, to identify the source of such pain and confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">In the instant case, although the defendant is not the complainant\u2019s biological parent, he has been a father figure to her since the age of three. The alleged sexual abuse began at age nine. The complainant testified that the defendant allegedly told her prior to two instances of sexual intercourse that his actions were \"all right because I was his stepdaughter.\u201d In addition, it is clear the complainant knew the purpose of the psychological evaluation because she had apparently requested to meet with Dr. Johnson to discuss her family\u2019s problems. Thus, I conclude that the nature of the alleged sexual abuse, the relationship between the parties, the complainant\u2019s age at the time the alleged assaults began, and her awareness of the evaluation\u2019s purpose all support the motive for the complainant\u2019s statements being reasonably necessary to diagnosis and treatment.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Secondly, I conclude that the complainant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>identification of the defendant as the perpetrator was reasonably necessary to diagnosis and treatment. Although it is apparent that the drafters of both the state and federal versions of these exceptions to the hearsay rules generally envisioned that the treatment decisions would entail physical injury, I find that the psychological scars that an individual may carry after being subjected to events as traumatic as parental sexual abuse equally demand professional assistance. In the instant case, I find that Dr. Johnson\u2019s professional qualifications enabled her to make the reasoned judgments regarding what necessitated effective treatment.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>In the instant case, Dr. Johnson opined at the motion in limine that the identification of the complainant\u2019s assailant was crucial to her providing effective psychological treatment:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-5\"><em>Q. </em>Was it necessary for an adequate diagnosis for you to know the source of the\u2014the person or the perpetrator was a member of the family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-6\"><em>A. </em>Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-7\"><em>Q. </em>Why is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\"><em>A. </em>Well, at the time that I saw her at the end of September, M_ had been removed from the home and prior to that time, I had received some information from her stepsister advising me that there was a problem and asking if I could perhaps help M_; so, in order to get a firm picture or clear picture of what was going on, M_was asked the identity of the perpetrator for family dynamics and it particularly was really important because of the impact that that had on her in terms of uprooting and unsettling her at this particular time, although it was clear that there was a lot of ambivalence because of the strong feelings regarding the maternal figure, but also fear in terms of what had happened and what would happen in the future to M__</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-15\"><em>Q. </em>Have you been involved in any way with the Probate Court case involving M_1_ in</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-17\">terms of recommendations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-18\"><em>A. </em>Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-19\"><em>Q. </em>Have you had occasion to recommend that she remain outside the home, in a foster home?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-20\"><em>A. </em>Yes.

However, I note that the admission of Dr. Johnson\u2019s testimony did not violate the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation. The complainant here was present at trial and subject to cross-examination, enabling the jury to weigh the complainant\u2019s statements on the witness stand against her statements to her treating psychologist.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Therefore, I find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>the trial court\u2019s application of MRE 803(4) to a treating psychologist for the purpose of introducing a declarant\u2019s statements concerning the sexual assault and identification of the actor accused is both correct and in keeping with the policies underlying MRE 803(4).<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">I conclude that (1) the defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation was not violated by the exclusion of the complainant\u2019s sexual history under the Michigan rape-shield statute and MRE 404(a)(3), (2) the Michigan rape-shield statute is superseded by MRE 404(a)(3), and (3) the complainant\u2019s statements to the psychologist were properly admitted under MRE 803(4).

Because there is no evidence on this record that law enforcement authorities initiated the visit which was primarily for diagnosis and treatment, MRE 803(4), I also join part m of Justice Archer\u2019s opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">Levin, J. The signers of the lead opinion state they agree, for the reasons set forth in part kb) of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Justice Archer\u2019s opinion, that the exclusion of evidence of complainant\u2019s \"sexual history\u201d did not violate Daniel James LaLone\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">The reasons given in part i(B) are that LaLone was able to introduce significant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and compelling \"nonsexual\u201d evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias and motive to fabricate and, alternatively, if there was error, it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">LaLone\u2019s conviction is reversed on other grounds, as set forth in the lead opinion, and the cause is remanded for a new trial. The Confrontation Clause issue cannot, accordingly, be resolved on the basis of harmless error. If there was error, it should not be repeated at the new trial even if it is thought this error did not warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">While we agree, for the reasons stated in part m of the lead opinion, that LaLone\u2019s conviction should be reversed and a new trial ordered, we would hold that the evidence of conflict between LaLone and the complainant concerning her efforts to have sexual relationships with teenage boys is admissible at the new trial because a \"reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> of the complainant\u2019s credibility had LaLone\u2019s counsel been permitted to introduce that evidence tending to show her bias and motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-7\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b391-8\">Part i(B) discusses <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986), but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>omits reference to the critical language in that opinion establishing a standard recently repeated in <em>Olden v Kentucky, </em>488 US \u2014, \u2014; 109 S Ct 480; 102 L Ed 2d 513, 520 (1988):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">It is plain to us that \"[a] reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness\u2019] credibility had [defense counsel] been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, supra, </em>p 680.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">In <em>Olden, </em>the Court ruled that the exclusion of evidence of the complainant\u2019s sexual relationship with a man other than the defendant was violative of the defendant\u2019s right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">Olden and a codefendant, both of whom are black, were charged with kidnapping, rape, and forcible sodomy. Asserting a defense of consent, Olden sought to introduce evidence that the complainant, a white married woman, was cohabitating with a witness who was black and married to someone other than the complainant. Olden contended that the complainant \"concocted the rape story to protect her relationship with [the witness], who would have grown suspicious upon seeing her disembark from [the codefendant\u2019s] car.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Kentucky Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision not to admit the evidence. While finding that such evidence was relevant and not barred by Kentucky\u2019s rape-shield law, the court sustained the exclusion of the evidence on the ground that its potential for unfairly prejudicing the jury outweighed its probative value. The United States Supreme Court ruled that \"[t]he Kentucky Court of Appeals failed to accord proper <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>weight to petitioner\u2019s Sixth Amendment right 'to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Alr\">The substance of what the United States Supreme Court considers to be the \"proper weight\u201d to be accorded the right of confrontation is indicated by the Court\u2019s analysis in <em>Olden. </em>Relying almost exclusively on <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, supra, </em>the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-4\">It is plain to us that \"a reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of [the witness\u2019] credibility had [defense counsel] been permitted to pursue his proposed line of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, supra, </em>at 680 ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b393-5\">While a trial court may, of course, impose reasonable limits on defense counsel\u2019s inquiry into the potential bias of a prosecution witness, to take account of such factors as \"harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness\u2019 safety, or interrogation that [would be] repetitive or only marginally relevant,\u201d <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, supra, </em>at 679, . . . the limitation here was beyond reason. Speculation as to the effect of jurors\u2019 racial biases cannot justify exclusion of cross-examination with such strong potential to demonstrate the falsity of [the complainant\u2019s] testimony.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The Court, again relying on <em>Van Arsdall, </em>added that \"we find it impossible to conclude 'beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 that the restriction on petitioner\u2019s right to confrontation was harmless.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court said that the complainant\u2019s \"testimony was central, indeed crucial, to the prosecution\u2019s case.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">The complainant in the instant case acknowledged that LaLone, her stepfather, had slapped her face when he accused her of stealing a candy bar and called her a liar. She also acknowledged that she had problems with her parents concerning boyfriends and had been disciplined. She said she wanted to get out of the house because the rules were too strict. She also said she was angry with her father because he \"hurt me,\u201d by which she meant the sexual abuse charged against La-Lone.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The excluded evidence was LaLone\u2019s testimony that he had confronted the complainant about telephone calls to teenage boys asking to give blow jobs and if they had rubbers, and that she had admitted the phone calls in front of the whole family. There was a big row. It was then that LaLone learned about the complainant being nude below the waist with a teenage boy, DJ. The complainant told LaLone \"to get fucked, that it was her business if she wanted to get laid.\u201d And then he backhanded her.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">Had LaLone been permitted to so testify, the jury might have concluded that the complainant was angry with him, not because he had \"hurt\u201d (sexually abused) her or because he had slapped her following an argument concerning an accusation of stealing a candy bar\u2014^-as the complainant asserted\u2014but because he was interfering with her efforts to have sexual relationships with teenage <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>boys. Here, as in <em>Olden, </em>the excluded testimony tended to show that the complainant may have fabricated the charge to protect her opportunity to continue or have sexual relationships.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Some persons would not testify falsely, however provoked, while others might testify falsely if provoked in one manner but not in another manner. It was for the jury, not the trial court, to decide whether the evidence that LaLone was interfering with the complainant\u2019s efforts to have sexual relationships with teenage boys motivated her to testify falsely even though the jury may not have been persuaded<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> that the \"nonsexual\u201d evidence of conflict between LaLone and the complainant motivated her to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\"><em>Olden </em>and <em>Van Arsdall </em>require examination of the <em>excluded </em>evidence to determine whether, presented with that evidence, a reasonable jury might have received a significantly different impression of the complainant\u2019s motive to fabricate charges. Part i(b) focuses rather on the <em>admitted </em>evidence. Even if, as asserted in part i(B), there was significant and compelling nonsexual evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias and motive to fabricate, the Confrontation Clause, as construed in <em>Van Arsdall </em>and <em>Olden, </em>requires the admission of the excluded evidence if a reasonable jury <em>might </em>have received a significantly different impression of the witness\u2019 credibility had the excluded evidence been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">In <em>Davis v Alaska, </em>415 US 308, 311; 94 S Ct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>1105; 39 L Ed 2d 347 (1974), the defendant\u2019s interest in developing on cross-examination an inference of bias, on the basis of the witness\u2019 \"fear or concern of possible jeopardy of his probationary]\u201d status for a juvenile criminal offense, conflicted with Alaska\u2019s interest in protecting the confidentiality of juvenile criminal determinations. There are striking similarities between the analysis in part i(B) and the error of the Alaska Supreme Court in <em>Davis. </em>The United States Supreme Court said in <em>Davis, supra, </em>pp 314-315:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">The Alaska Supreme Court affirmed petitioner\u2019s conviction, concluding that it did not have to resolve the potential conflict in th[e] case between a defendant\u2019s right to meaningful confrontation with adverse witnesses and the State\u2019s interest in protecting the anonymity of a juvenile offender since \"our <em>reading of the trial transcript convinces us that counsel for the defendant was able adequately to question the youth in considerable detail concerning the possibility of bias or motive.\u201d </em>499 P2d 1025, 1036 ([Alas] 1972). Although the court admitted that [the witness\u2019] denials of any sense of anxiety or apprehension upon the safe\u2019s being found close to his home were possibly self-serving, \"the suggestion was nonetheless brought to the attention of the jury, and that body was afforded the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the youth and pass on his credibility.\u201d <em>Ibid. The court concluded that, in light of the indirect references permitted, there was no error.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">Since we granted certiorari limited to the question of whether petitioner was denied his right under the Confrontation Clause to adequately cross-examine [the witness], <em>the essential question turns on the correctness of the Alaska court\u2019s evaluation of the \"adequacy\u201d of the scope of cross-examination permitted. We disagree with that court\u2019s interpretation of the Confrontation Clause and we reverse. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>Part i(b) parallels the Alaska Supreme Court\u2019s analysis rejected by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Davis:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b397-6\">[O]n the basis of the defendant\u2019s cross-examination of the complainant, it is clear the defendant was able to introduce compelling nonsexual evidence of the complainant\u2019s bias and motive to fabricate. Therefore, the exclusion of evidence regarding her sexual behavior does not rise to the level of constitutional error.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">The Alaska Supreme Court had viewed the admitted evidence in <em>Davis </em>to be \"adequate.\u201d part i(b) calls the evidence admitted in this case \"significant\u201d and \"compelling.\u201d Notwithstanding semantic differences, there is no meaningful distinction between the analysis of the Al\u00e1ska Supreme Court and that set forth in part i(b). Both proceed on the bases. of their own views concerning how much admitted evidence justifies barring a defendant from presenting other evidence that might persuade a jury of the falsity of a key witness\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Part i(B) states that \"[u]nlike the defendant in <em>Davis, </em>the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the complainant\u2019s sexual history left the defendant with several avenues to explore the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Defense counsel in <em>Davis </em>explored the witness\u2019 motive to fabricate testimony through the use of avenues other than the excluded evidence. On cross-examination, the witness acknowledged that the property alleged to have been stolen by the defendant was found near the witness\u2019 family home and that the idea had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>crossed his mind that the police might suspect him of the crime.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Even if the proffered distinction of <em>Davis </em>were accurate, evidence that might have provided a jury with a significantly different impression of a witness\u2019 bias is admissible although there are a number of other \"avenues\u201d available to the defendant to explore the complainant\u2019s bias or motive to fabricate.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">State courts have held that evidence tending to show the complainant\u2019s bias is admissible although the state has enacted a rape-shield law. The Supreme Court of Massachusetts ruled that <em>Davis </em>required the admission of evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior prosecutions for prostitution, tending to establish a motive to fabricate charges, that the defendant forced the complainant to engage in sexual acts in a parked automobile, related to officers who found the defendant and the complainant naked at the scene, to avoid a further prosecution for prostitution.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> A Pennsylvania appellate court held that <em>Davis </em>required that a defendant be allowed to present evidence of a thirteen-year-old complainant\u2019s alleged sexual relationship with her brother to show that the complainant was motivated to fabricate charges as a means of punishing the defendant\u2019s interference with the complainant\u2019s incestuous relationship and as a means of removing the defendant from the home so that the incestuous relationship could continue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In other states, the defendant\u2019s constitutional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>right to confrontation has been held to require, under <em>Davis, </em>admission of evidence tending to show that a ten-year-old complainant had a motive to fabricate charges because the defendant discovered the complainant having sex with third parties and threatened to report what he had seen to the complainant\u2019s parents,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> of evidence tending to show that an underage complainant had a motive to fabricate the charges because she thought she had been impregnated by a third party and was afraid to tell her mother of her sexual activity,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> and of evidence tending to show that a fifteen-year-old complainant fabricated charges to punish the defendant for refusing to consent to her marriage to a twenty-four-year-old fianc\u00e9 and for threatening to have the fianc\u00e9 arrested for statutory rape and of evidence that she had on other occasions accused other family members of sexual misconduct in retaliation for threats to have her fianc\u00e9 arrested.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">Other state court decisions noted in part i(B)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> cite <em>Davis, </em>but were decided without reference to the \"significantly different impression\u201d standard stated in <em>Van Arsdall </em>and applied in <em>Olden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">In <em>People v Hackett, </em>421 Mich 338, 348; 365 NW2d 120 (1984), this Court recognized that the concerns that prompted enactment of the rape-shield statute must in particular cases be subordinated to a defendant\u2019s right of cross-examination under the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b399-6\">The fact that the Legislature has determined that evidence of sexual conduct is not admissible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>as character evidence to prove consensual conduct or for general impeachment purposes is not however a declaration that evidence of sexual conduct is never admissible. We recognize that in certain limited situations, such evidence may not only be relevant, but its admission may be required to preserve a defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation. For example, <em>where the defendant proffers evidence of a complainant\u2019s prior sexual conduct for the narrow purpose of showing the complaining witness\u2019 bias, this would almost always be material and should be admitted. . . . Moreover in certain circumstances, evidence of a complainant\u2019s sexual conduct may also be probative of a complainant\u2019s ulterior motive for making a false charge. </em>[Emphasis added.][<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">We would hold that the excluded evidence is admissible at the new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b400-7\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Levin, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-9\"> <em>Ante, </em>p 129.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b391-11\"> <em>Delaware v Van Arsdall, </em>475 US 673, 680; 106 S Ct 1431; 89 L Ed 2d 674 (1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b392-9\"> <em>Olden, supra, </em>488 US \u2014; 102 L Ed 2d 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\"> <em>Id., </em>102 L Ed 2d 519.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b393-8\"> <em>Id., </em>102 L Ed 2d 520.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b393-9\"><em> Id., </em>102 L Ed 2d 521.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b393-10\"> <em>Id., </em>102 L Ed 2d 520.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Part i(b) recognizes the centrality of the complainant\u2019s testimony in this case, yet concludes that \"matters brought out on cross-examination\u201d render any possible error harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"AUV\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>Once it is conceded, even for the sake of argument, that there was constitutional error, it should be recognized that the error cannot be harmless beyond a reasonable doubt for the reason stated in part i(b): \"[T]he significance of complainant\u2019s testimony to the people\u2019s case is readily apparent. . . .
