However, we disagree with his resolution of the remittitur issue in section hi.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-15\">Justice Archer\u2019s opinion does not make clear whether the Court should review the trial court\u2019s decision on remittitur for an abuse of discretion or whether it should review the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>decision for clear error. In our view, the question of the excessiveness of a jury verdict is generally one for the trial court in the first instance. The trial court, having witnessed all the testimony and evidence as well as having had the unique opportunity to evaluate the jury\u2019s reaction to the proofs and to the individual witnesses, is in the best position to make an informed decision regarding the excessiveness of the verdict. Accordingly, an appellate court must accord due deference to the trial court\u2019s decision and may only disturb a grant or denial of remittitur if an abuse of discretion is shown. This standard applies whether the review is by the Court of Appeals or the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Having examined the record in the instant case and having conferred upon the trial court the requisite deference, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in remitting the jury verdict to $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">A trial court\u2019s order of remittitur is governed by MCR 2.611(E)(1):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b775-8\">If the court finds that the only error in the trial is the inadequacy or excessiveness of the verdict, it may deny a motion for new trial on condition that within 14 days the nonmoving party consent in writing to the entry of judgment in an amount found by the court to be the lowest (if the verdict was inadequate) or <em>highest (if the verdict was excessive) amount the evidence will support. </em>[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">According to the express language of the court rule, remittitur is justified if the jury verdict is \"excessive,\u201d i.e., if the amount awarded is greater than \"the highest amount the evidence will sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>port.\u201d As Justice Archer\u2019s opinion exemplifies, however, trial courts, in addition to evaluating whether a jury award is supported by the proofs, have conducted a myriad of other inquiries in determining whether remittitur would be proper in a particular case: 1) whether the verdict \"shocks the judicial conscience\u201d; 2) whether the verdict was the result of improper methods, prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy, corruption, or mistake of law or fact; 3) whether the verdict was within the limits of what reasonable minds would deem just compensation for the injury sustained; 4) whether the amount actually awarded is comparable to awards in similar cases within the state and in other jurisdictions. 22 Am Jur 2d, Damages, \u00a7\u00a7 1021-1025, pp 1067-1075. <em>Precopio v Detroit, </em>415 Mich 457, 465; 330 NW2d 802 (1982); <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, </em>376 Mich 1, 5-6; 135 NW2d 414 (1965); <em>Majewski v Nowicki, </em>364 Mich 698, 700; 111 NW2d 887 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">The only consideration <em>expressly </em>authorized by MCR 2.611(E)(1), however, is whether the jury award is supported by the evidence. While we agree with the established case law that a trial court, in making a decision on remittitur, should examine a number of factors (such as whether the verdict was induced by bias or prejudice), we believe its inquiry should be limited to <em>objective </em>considerations relating to the actual conduct of the trial or <em>to </em>the evidence adduced.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The \"shock the conscience\u201d inquiry is an inappropriate consideration since it merely involves an expression of the trial judge\u2019s personal values and subjective beliefs and in no way relates to the actual conduct of the trial. As we have learned in reviewing sentencing issues under <em>People v Coles, </em>417 Mich 523; 339 NW2d 440 (1983), what shocks the conscience of one judge does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"533\">*533</page-number>shock the conscience of another. Justice Archer\u2019s opinion seemingly advocates the continued use of the \"shock the conscience\u201d test in remittitur cases. Because we view this inquiry to be one of complete subjectivity, we hold that it is not to be undertaken in any analysis relating to remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">The other inquiries set forth above are significantly more objective than the \"shock the conscience\u201d test. Each consideration is potentially verifiable in the written record and, therefore, provides at least some basis for appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b777-7\">As Justice Archer\u2019s opinion explains, it is well established in Michigan case law that an appellate court may not disturb a trial court\u2019s order of remittitur unless it determines that there has been an abuse of discretion. <em>Hines v Grand Trunk W R Co, </em>151 Mich App 585; 391 NW2d 750 (1985); <em>Jenkins v Southeastern Michigan Chapter, American Red Cross, </em>141 Mich App 785; 369 NW2d 223 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-8\">Although no Michigan court has so stated, other jurisdictions have expressly held that once the issue of the excessiveness of a jury verdict has been squarely presented to a trial judge, who heard and considered the evidence, neither the state\u2019s highest nor its intermediate appellate court may substitute its judgment on excessiveness for that of the trial judge unless the latter is shown to be an abuse of discretion. <em>Davis v Graviss, </em>672 SW2d 928, 933 (Ky, 1984); <em>Marquardt v Kansas C S R Co, </em>358 SW2d 49, 58 (Mo, 1962) (an appellate court should be more reluctant to reduce the amount of damages awarded to a plaintiff in a personal injury action where the trial court has already acted by reducing the jury\u2019s verdict by remittitur).</p>\n<p id=\"b778-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"534\">*534</page-number>An appellate court reviewing a trial court\u2019s grant or denial of remittitur must afford due deference to the trial judge since the latter has presided over the whole trial, has personally observed the evidence and witnesses, and has had the unique opportunity to evaluate the jury\u2019s reaction to the witnesses and proofs. Accordingly, the trial judge, having experienced the drama of the trial, is in the best position to determine whether the jury\u2019s verdict was motivated by such impermissible considerations as passion, bias, or anger. Deference to the trial judge simply reflects the recognition that the trial judge has observed live testimony while the appellate court merely reviews a printed record.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-6\">In granting remittitur in the instant case, the trial court considered each of the aforementioned factors on the record and concluded that the verdict was beyond the range of evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-7\">Lastly, the Court, in reviewing this matter reviewed its notes and does not take this matter lightly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-8\">I have indicated that, because Kenneth Gibcan, communicated to counsel some of which has apparently come back in the form of briefs and pleadings. <em>It\u2019s not a matter of substituting my judgment The Court has never done that before, but in this situation, the Court could only, upon what it saw and heard in the court, cannot say an award in this Court\u2019s opinion was within the range of evidence.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-9\">It did shock the judicial conscious [sic]. The Court believes that this jury was inflamed and was angry. Perhaps it was because the hospital really offered no other witnesses other than the attending doctor. The doctor was not on trial, but the jury was angry.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-10\">The jury, I believe in my opinion, listening to that doctor found him arrogant and conceited and listening to him was inflaming the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"535\">*535</page-number>Beyond that, the Court heard the evidence. The Court finds that plaintiff\u2019s counsel has accurately quoted much of the evidence. The Court found that the plaintiff did suffer severe, acute pains at the time he had the surgeries. Some of the surgeries which, obviously, had to be performed to begin with based on other matters totally unrelated to the hospital or hospital doctor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-5\">The Court finds that he did satisfy the jury as to the point that he suffered then. But as to plaintiff\u2019s claim that he has suffered a severe disfigurement and disability, this Court observed that young man and he\u2019s not the kind of young man who has his face all scarred up or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">As a matter of fact, he is a good-looking young man. He\u2019s got a slight flattening of the jaw on one side at the most, but we are not dealing with a situation where he burned his face or somebody that if anyone looked at, would grimace.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">I heard him testify. He talked fine. He was functioning fully. He attends school. He workds [sic]. He has a very full day. This is not [a] situation of a disabled individual that can no longer function in society. He functions completely and is not the kind of person that anyone would turn their heads and might say, what happened to him. He would just blend right in with any crowd.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-8\">With regards to continuing pain, the doctors described that what he is suffering right now is a chronic type of discomfort that goes along with malocclusions. It\u2019s a nuisance problem is what they testified to.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-9\">With these considerations in mind, with what the Court heard and so forth, and with the considerations that by reducing the award to 8 hundred thousand, he still has a very nice income for the rest of his life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-10\">The Court feels that remitt[it]ur is appropriate and I will remit into the sum of $800,000. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-11\">The trial court on the record stated explicitly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"536\">*536</page-number>that the evidence did not support the $1.25 million verdict awarded in this case. In support of this decision, the judge cited the fact that Mr. Palenkas was still a very good-looking man, that his face was only slightly asymmetrical, and that he was now living a fully functional lifestyle. The court also highlighted the fact that the plaintiffs own expert testified that the discomfort that he was experiencing in his jaw was not permanently disabling or incapacitating. These evaluations regarding the permanency of the plaintiff\u2019s actual physical and emotional injuries were made possible by the trial judge\u2019s presence throughout the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The trial court was also firmly convinced that the excessive nature of the jury verdict resulted in part from the jurors\u2019 anger at Dr. Lawson. Justice Archer acknowledges this fact, but states that \"[t]he trial court points to no specific statements by Dr. Lawson or misconduct by trial counsel during his testimony that would engender the type of passion or bias necessary to interfere with a jury verdict. Nor does our review of his testimony reveal any source of undue prejudice.\u201d Post, p 564. We are unaware of any requirement that the trial judge cite specific statements which would unequivocally display a witness\u2019 perceived arrogance. Imposing such a requirement would be both impractical and imprudent. Intangible emotions like prejudice, bias, and anger are often undetectable in a written record, and it is for this precise reason that we defer to the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">In any event, our review of Dr. Lawson\u2019s testimony reveals a number of statements from which the jury could have perceived him as arrogant and conceited:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b780-6\"><em>Q. </em>Doctor, during the\u2014from January 29, 1977 (sic) to January 4, 1978, that six day period of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>time, you didn\u2019t ask anyone at Beaumont Hospital to take over the care and treatment of Mr. Palenkas\u2019 jaw fractures, did you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-5\"><em>A. </em>No, as far as I know there was nobody there competent to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-6\"><em>Q. </em>You were the one who was competent to do it; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-7\"><em>A. </em>Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-8\"><em>Q. </em>And if you were going to leave or stop treating your patient, you would make sure that there was a responsible person treating the patient?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-9\"><em>A. </em>Not necessarily. If things are going right, and there\u2019s no other indication, you don\u2019t have to come in everyday and see him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-10\">Because an appellate court has only the written record to examine, it can only speculate about the jury\u2019s actual reaction to testimony such as this. Accordingly, we are obliged to give the trial court the benefit of the doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-11\">In arguing that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering remittitur in this case, Justice Archer\u2019s opinion cites jury awards in similar cases (decided within the past ten years approximately) where plaintiffs incurred serious facial injuries. <em>Post, </em>p 561, n 26. Justice Archer, however, has refused to compare those awards to the verdict awarded in the instant case as required by recent case law, <em>Precopio, supra, </em>stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b781-12\">The question presented did not, however, allow this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact below. The cited cases, while similar, could never present the same facts and evidence as that heard by the trier of fact below. They provide insufficient justification for this Court to superimpose its will in derogation of the principle of trial by jury on the basis of the cold record here reproduced. <em>[Post, </em>p 564.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b781-13\">We recognize that none of the fifteen facial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>injury cases cited by Justice Archer presents the identical facts and evidence as that heard by the jury in the instant case. We also recognize that this Court may not substitute its judgment on damages for that of the jury. Nonetheless, a comparison of jury awards in analogous facial injury cases is warranted here. While such a comparison cannot serve as an exact indicator, it does provide an objective means of determining the range of appropriate awards in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Having examined the facial injury cases cited by Justice Archer, we find that the low end of the range hovers near $100,000-$150,Q00,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the high end near $800,000.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Most of the jury awards for analogous facial injuries fall somewhere between $275,-000 and $600,000.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b782-7\">Justice Archer\u2019s opinion cites two facial injury cases in the million-dollar-plus category. <em>Detroit Marine Engineering v McRee, </em>510 So 2d 462 (Miss, 1987) ($1,000,000 awarded); <em>Sweatt v Norman, </em>283 SC 443; 322 SE2d 478 (1984) ($1,500,000 awarded). An examination of these cases, however, demonstrates that the injuries suffered by those plaintiffs were not limited to the face and jaw and were significantly more severe than those suffered by Mr. Palenkas.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The plaintiffs in both <em>Detroit Ma</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number><em>rine </em>and <em>Sweatt </em>required more surgery and medical treatment than did the plaintiff here. Furthermore, unlike Mr. Palenkas, the plaintiffs in those cases have suffered serious and permanent disfig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>urements and will continue to suffer profound residual effects. While we do not intend to minimize the severity of Mr. Palenkas\u2019 injuries, we do mean to highlight the obvious distinctions between the instant case and those discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">Accordingly, having examined the record in the case at bar and having conferred upon the trial court the requisite deference, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in remitting this jury award to $800,000, a figure which represents the highest amount awarded in analogous facial injury cases during the past ten years.</p>\n<judges id=\"b784-7\">Levin, Brickley, Cavanagh, Boyle, and Griffin, JJ., concurred with Riley, C.J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">Archer, J. We granted leave to appeal, limited to the following issues: (a) what is the standard of review where the jury\u2019s verdict has been reduced by a trial court remittitur and reinstated by the Court of Appeals; (b) under that standard, should the jury\u2019s verdict or the remittitur stand as the judgment in the instant case; (c) was the defendant hospital improperly denied the right to fully cross-examine the defendant physician; (d) did the Oakland Circuit Court err in its decision to deny the defendant hospital\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment under the statute of limitations; and (e) if the Court of Appeals is correct that a remand for further proceedings is necessary to determine the applicability of the statute of limitations, what is the appropriate procedure to follow on remand?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-9\">Where a jury\u2019s verdict has been reduced by a trial court remittitur and reinstated by the Court of Appeals, this Court should review the case to determine whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding an abuse of discretion by the trial court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>ordering remittitur. In this case, the Court of Appeals did not err in finding an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying defendant hospital the right to cross-examine the defendant physician regarding his pretrial settlement agreement with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The Oakland Circuit Court did not err in its decision to deny defendant hospital\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment under the statute of limitations. This obviates the need to remand for further proceedings. Therefore, we do not reach the question regarding the appropriate procedure to follow on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b785-8\">On December 21, 1977, plaintiff Brian Palenkas was involved in a car accident that resulted in several serious traumatic injuries. Mr. Palenkas was taken to the emergency room at William Beaumont Hospital in Troy where he received treatment from a team of specialists who were called in by the defendant hospital. Among the physicians treating the plaintiff was Dr. James Lawson, a plastic surgeon, who was called in specifically to treat Mr. Palenkas\u2019 severely fractured lower jaw and injured teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-9\">Dr. Lawson assumed primary responsibility for treatment of plaintiff\u2019s jaw. It was undisputed at trial that during plaintiff\u2019s stay in the hospital Dr. Lawson was absent from the hospital for several days.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In this period, the plaintiff\u2019s condition worsened: his jaw began to collapse inward as a result <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>of improper immobilization; a loose tooth was left undetected inside plaintiff\u2019s jaw;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and another tooth became so loose that plaintiff, fearing he would choke on it, called a nurse to have it removed.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">Following plaintiff\u2019s January 1978 discharge from the hospital, Dr. Lawson continued to treat his jaw injuries. After several months, however, plaintiff sought the help of a dentist, Dr. Mayer.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> After his examination of the plaintiff, Dr. Mayer explained to the plaintiff that his jaw had collapsed and referred him to an oral surgeon, Dr. Osborn, for reconstructive surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Dr. Osborn first examined the plaintiff in September, 1978. He found that plaintiff had a deficient bite, a misshapened face, broken teeth that had not been removed, sequestered pieces of bone in his front lower jaw, and a tooth intruding into his jawbone. He also found that plaintiff\u2019s right lower jaw had tipped inward and that this collapse prevented proper alignment of the teeth in plaintiff\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">Over the course of the next three years Dr. Osborn performed three surgical procedures on the plaintiff. These procedures included removing the sequestered pieces of bone and the broken and loose teeth, sawing plaintiff\u2019s jaw apart and grafting a piece of bone from plaintiff\u2019s hip to his jaw, and repositioning his jaw.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The last such surgical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>procedure took place in September, 1981. Subsequently, over the next one and one-half years, Dr. Mayer, plaintiff\u2019s dentist, resumed treatment and performed prosthetic reconstruction on plaintiff\u2019s teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">On October 27, 1982, plaintiff filed a complaint in Oakland Circuit Court, alleging that Beaumont and the defendant physician had been guilty of medical malpractice. Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint alleged that he did not discover the malpractice until October, 1982. The purpose of this allegation was to avoid the two-year limitation period set forth in MCL 600.5805; MSA 27A.5805<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> by qualifying under the six-month discovery rule found in MCL 600.5838(2); MSA 27A.5838(2).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Beaumont included in its answer to the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>complaint an affirmative defense that the complaint was untimely. Beaumont did not, however, file a separate pretrial motion for accelerated judgment on the basis of the expiration of the statute of limitations. Plaintiff settled with Dr. Lawson prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">The case was tried in June, 1984. At the conclusion of plaintiff\u2019s presentation of its case in chief, the defendant hospital moved for accelerated judgment on the ground that plaintiff\u2019s proofs had failed to substantiate that the case fell within the six-month discovery rule. The trial judge reserved her ruling on the motion. In its case in chief, the hospital did not introduce any evidence to negate plaintiff\u2019s allegation that he first discovered the relationship between the defendant\u2019s negligence and his injuries in October, 1982.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">The jury reached a verdict in favor of the plaintiff, awarding damages in the amount of $1,250,-000. The court entered judgment in the amount of $1,050,000, reflecting a setoff of $200,000 previously paid to the plaintiff by Dr. Lawson in a settlement agreement prior to the trial. After the verdict was returned, defense counsel again moved for accelerated judgment on the ground that plaintiff had failed to prove that the discovery rule applied. The motion was taken under advisement and later denied on the basis of defendant\u2019s failure to raise the matter prior to the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number>In response to a posttrial motion by defendant, the court granted a remittitur of $250,000, which reduced the final judgment to $800,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">Beaumont appealed and the plaintiff cross-appealed in the Court of Appeals. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order of remittitur. It affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling that prohibited cross-examination of Dr. Lawson regarding his settlement agreement with plaintiff. The Court also remanded the case to the trial court for determination of the statute of limitations issue on its merits.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Both parties sought relief in this Court. We granted leave to appeal and cross appeal.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The first question presented is whether the trial court erred in denying the defendant hospital\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment on the ground that plaintiff did not establish in his case in chief that his discovery of the defendant\u2019s malpractice occurred within the period of limitation provided in MCL 600.5838(2); MSA 27A.5838(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b789-10\">Plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint sets forth the allegation that \"neither the plaintiff nor anyone acting on his behalf learned of or knew the exact nature of the relationship between the acts of the defendant and each of them and the condition and injuries suffered by the plaintiff until October of 1982.\u201d In response to this factual allegation by plaintiff, defendant asserted the legal conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>that \"the claims set forth [in plaintiff\u2019s amended complaint] did not accrue within the applicable limitations period under MCL 600.5805 and 600.5838 before commencement of said action and is [sic] therefore barred by the Statute of Limitations.\u201d Defendant did not include any allegations of facts to support the asserted affirmative defense, nor did defendant file a pretrial motion for accelerated judgment on the basis of the operation of the statute of limitations. It was not until the close of plaintiff\u2019s presentation of his case in chief that defendant presented this motion for accelerated judgment.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">Defendant then proceeded with its case in chief. No evidence was presented with respect to the question of plaintiff\u2019s discovery of the defendant\u2019s alleged malpractice. When the case was sent to the jury, a special verdict form was used pursuant to GCR 1963, 514. The factual question regarding plaintiff\u2019s discovery of the defendant\u2019s malpractice was not among the items submitted to the jury for special verdicts.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b790-8\">Michigan court rules and case law have treated the operation of the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.

GCR 1963, 111.7 required inclusion of all affirmative defenses in the parties\u2019 responsive pleadings under a separate and distinct heading along with facts to support the affirmative defense. <em>Thomas Industries, Inc v Wells, </em>403 Mich 466, 469-470; 270 NW2d 98 (1978). In addition, GCR 1963, 116.1 required that a demand for accelerated judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations either be in a party\u2019s first responsive pleading or be filed at the same time as the first responsive pleading:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-5\">.1 Grounds. In a party\u2019s first responsive pleading, or by motion filed not later than his first responsive pleading, a party may demand that service of process be quashed or that judgment be entered dismissing 1 or more claims asserted against him upon any of the following grounds:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b791-6\">(5) the claim is barred because of release, payment, prior judgment, <em>statute of limitations, </em>statute of frauds, infancy, or other disability of the moving party, or assignment or other disposition of the claim before commencement of the action. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>Thus, Rule 116.1 was designed to promote judicial economy through early adjudication of dispositive issues. In <em>Robinson v Emmet Rd Comm, </em>72 Mich App 623, 637-638; 251 NW2d 90 (1976), the Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-6\">A motion for accelerated judgment under [GCR 1963, 116.1] tests certain special defenses which may dispose of the case and should be heard preliminarily to determine whether a trial on the merits will be necessary, even though factual issues may have to be resolved in order to rule on the motion. A motion for accelerated judgment provides a method by which certain disputed issues can be adjudicated at an early stage with a possibility of ending the case and avoiding an expensive trial. [Accord 1 Honigman &amp; Hawkins, Michigan Court Rules Annotated (2d ed), p 336.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">The party asserting an affirmative defense had the burden of introducing evidence to support the affirmative defense. <em>Thomas Industries, supra; Pollack v Oak Office Bldg, </em>7 Mich App 173, 186; 151 NW2d 353 (1967). A party could not adequately raise the defense through mere assertion of bare legal conclusions. GCR 1963, 116.3 required a party to submit a supporting affidavit or other evidence where the grounds for the motion were not apparent from the pleadings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b792-8\">.3 Affidavit Hearing; Immediate Trial. Any defense or objection raised under this rule, whether in a responsive pleading or by motion, may be noticed for hearing by either party as if raised by motion. Affidavits or other evidence may be submitted by either party to support or oppose the grounds asserted in the pleading or motion, <em>and in every case where the grounds asserted do not appear on the face of the pleading attacked, the demand shall be supported by affidavits or other evidence ffied with the pleading or motion. </em>... As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>to defenses and objections based upon sub-rule 116.1(5), the court may order immediate trial of any disputed questions of fact, and judgment may be rendered forthwith if the proof shows that the moving party is entitled to judgment on the facts as determined; or the court may postpone the hearing on the matter until the trial on the merits, and shall postpone the hearing if a jury trial has been demanded pursuant to right on or before the day of the hearing. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">In so providing, Rule 116.3 imposed a preliminary burden of production on the party raising the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">c</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">Although Beaumont did not move for summary judgment or submit an affidavit containing facts in support of its affirmative defense, it argues that MCL 600.5838(2); MSA 27A.5838(2) placed the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show that he commenced the action on his claim within six months after he discovered or should have discovered the existence of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">Section 5838(2), as it existed at the time of trial, provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-9\">(2) The burden of proving that the plaintiff, as a result of physical discomfort, appearance, condition or otherwise, neither discovered nor should have discovered the existence of the claim at least 6 months before the expiration of the period otherwise applicable to the claim shall be on the plaintiff. A malpractice action which is not commenced within the time prescribed by this subsection is barred.[<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">This section, by its terms, placed the \"burden of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>proof\u201d regarding the discovery rule on the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">In its strict sense the term \"burden of proof\u201d refers to the necessity or duty of affirmatively proving a fact or facts in dispute on an issue raised between the parties in a case. <em>McKinstry v Valley Obstetrics-Gynecology Clinic, PC, </em>428 Mich 167, 178; 405 NW2d 88 (1987). Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5th ed), p 178. A secondary use of the term, however, denotes the burden of going forward, i.e., the obligation to respond to a prima facie case established by the opposing party. <em>Kar v Hogan, </em>399 Mich 529, 539-540; 251 NW2d 77 (1976). 29 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, \u00a7 123, pp 154-155. The burden of going forward with the evidence may shift at various times during the trial from one side to the other as evidence is introduced by the respective parties. 29 Am Jur 2d, Evidence, \u00a7 124, pp 155-156. <em>Ambrose v Wheatley, </em>321 F Supp 1220, 1222 (D Del, 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Only when evidence has been introduced tending to prove that the cause of action has been barred will the plaintiff have the burden of producing clear and decisive evidence to negate the bar. <em>Moll v Wayne Co, supra; Pollack v Oak Office Bldg, supra </em>at 186. 3 Callaghan\u2019s Michigan Pleading &amp; Practice (2d ed), Limitation of Actions, \u00a7 36.168, p 632. Accordingly, it is consistent both for the defendant to have the initial burden of production on its affirmative defense and for the plaintiff to have the ultimate burden of convincing the jury that his claim is timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">In this case, the defendant hospital, after neglecting to include factual allegations in its answer, continued to ignore its burden of production by failing to submit a pretrial motion for accelerated judgment or evidence in support thereof. Consequently, the plaintiff had no notice of any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>factual allegations by defendant requiring negation in the plaintiffs case in chief. Thus, the defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment was both untimely and without adequate factual support in the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\">Further, the defendant did not submit any evidence on the statute of limitations issue in its case in chief. The Court of Appeals found that defendant v/as denied the opportunity to submit evidence that plaintiffs claim was barred because the trial court took defendant\u2019s motion for accelerated judgment under advisement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We disagree. There is nothing in the trial court\u2019s statement regarding the motion that could be interpreted to preclude defendant from introducing evidence on the statute of limitations issue.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Also, there is no strategic reason why postponement of a decision on this defendant\u2019s motion should force the defendant to refrain from introducing facts in support of its statute of limitations defense in its case in chief.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">To summarize, Beaumont failed to raise the statute of limitations issue in a pretrial motion for accelerated judgment, failed to allege facts in its answer or to submit an affidavit or other evidence prior to trial to rebut the plaintiffs allegation regarding discovery of the defendant\u2019s malpractice, and failed to present evidence on this issue in its case in chief. Therefore, the defendant hospital abandoned its affirmative defense of the expiration of the statute of limitations and the trial judge was correct in denying the motion for accelerated judgment. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to remand this cause to the trial court for resolution of the related factual issues.</p>\n<p id=\"AXo\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">On appeal, Beaumont asserts that the trial court erred when it allegedly changed its pretrial order in limine and when it refused to permit defendant hospital to impeach Dr. Lawson at trial with respect to his alleged interest, bias, and prejudice in favor of the plaintiff. Defendant asserts that Dr. Lawson\u2019s interest sprang from a settlement agreement reached with the plaintiff prior to trial that, inter alia, called for Dr. Lawson to pay $200,000 to the plaintiff and for the plaintiff to (a) indemnify Dr. Lawson for any further liability arising out of this episode, and (b) provide counsel to defend Dr. Lawson against the hospital\u2019s cross-claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">At trial, Dr. Lawson was called to the stand by the attorney for the defendant hospital pursuant to MCL 600.2161; MSA 27A.2161, and was cross-examined as an adverse witness.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The defendant physician was asked no questions about his relationship to the plaintiff. After the defendant hospital rested its case, however, counsel for the hospital placed on the record a statement regarding the trial court\u2019s limitation of its cross-examination of Dr. Lawson.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>The Court of Appeals below noted that the permissible scope of cross-examination on a collateral matter is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Accordingly appellate review is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The Court of Appeals acknowledged that MRE 408 does not prohibit the use of settlement evidence to show bias.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court denied relief, however, primarily on the ground that there was no adequate record to permit review of this evidentiary issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b797-6\">The question whether there were implicit promises on the part of Lawson in his settlement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>plaintiff that necessarily give rise to an indication of bias toward the hospital presents a closer, more difficult issue. Insofar as in the case between plaintiff and defendant hospital, it made no difference whether defendant hospital was guilty of separate, independent negligence, any bias on the part of Lawson was irrelevant. But, insofar as plaintiff agreed in the settlement agreement to indemnify Lawson for any recovery defendant hospital might make against Lawson, Lawson\u2019s bias would appear very relevant. However, in spite of that, since we have a record that does not show exactly what defendant hospital sought in its motion in limine, does not show exactly how the trial judge originally ruled and, most importantly, does not show the questions that defendant hospital intended to put to Lawson, we decline to find that the trial judge abused her discretion in denying defendant hospital\u2019s belated effort to examine Dr. Lawson regarding his settlement with plaintiff.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that the sparsity of the trial court record precludes appellate review of the nature and treatment of Beaumont\u2019s motion in limine regarding impeachment of the defendant Dr. Lawson. We also agree that Beaumont\u2019s failure to make a more detailed offer of proof precludes this Court from making a full analysis of the potential import of Dr. Lawson\u2019s testimony. Moreover, on the basis of the trial court\u2019s analysis of Dr. Lawson\u2019s testimony wherein she stated that \"[h]e has testified now very candidly somewhat expressing more candor than one sees on the witness stand,\u201d we find that, given Dr. Lawson\u2019s lack of financial interest in the ultimate outcome of the jury\u2019s verdict regarding the defendant hospital, his testimony was sufficiently reliable. Therefore, we find no clear error in the Court of Appeals holding that the trial judge did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>abuse her discretion in denying defendant hospital the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Lawson regarding his settlement with plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">iii</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">REMITTITUR</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">Finally, defendant argues that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial court\u2019s remittitur order and reinstating the jury verdict. It is well established in Michigan law that appellate review of a grant or denial of remittitur is limited to the determination of whether an abuse of discretion occurred. <em>Majewski v </em>Nowicki, 364 Mich 698, 700; 111 NW2d 887 (1961); <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, </em>376 Mich 1, 6; 135 NW2d 414 (1965). Generally an appellate court will determine whether there has been an abuse of discretion by applying one of the following tests:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">1. Was the verdict excessive or did it fall within the scope of the testimony, i.e., was it supported by the proofs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">2. Was the verdict the result of prejudice, passion, partiality, sympathy or corruption?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">3. Does the size of the verdict shock the judicial conscience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-12\">9 Michigan Law &amp; Practice (2d ed), Damages, \u00a7 121, pp 113-114. <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, supra </em>at 5; <em>Majewski v Nowicki, supra; Pippen v Denison Div of Abex Corp, </em>66 Mich App 664; 239 NW2d 704 (1976).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">A court should be reluctant to disturb a jury verdict for personal injuries upon the ground that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>the amount is excessive. <em>McKay v Hargis, </em>351 Mich 409, 419; 88 NW2d 456 (1958); <em>Gibbons v Delta Contracting Co, </em>301 Mich 638, 653; 4 NW2d 39 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">In evaluating a jury verdict for possible remittitur, a court should review the verdict in the light most favorable to the plaintiff. <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 142; 191 NW2d 355 (1971). In <em>Precopio v Detroit, </em>415 Mich 457, 464-465; 330 NW2d 802 (1982), this Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b800-7\">[Decisions of this Court state that awards for personal injury should rest within the sound judgment of the trier of fact, particularly awards for pain and suffering, and recognize that there is no absolute standard by which to measure such awards. Such deference in part reflects recognition that the trier of fact observes live testimony, while an appellate court reviews a printed record. In a case tried to a jury, such deference may further reflect a reliance on the communal judgment of the members of the jury in awarding monetary compensation for such imponderables as pain and suffering.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">When a jury verdict is based in part upon pain and suffering, a trial court must balance all of the factors involved against the general principle that there is no absolute mathematical formula or standard by which pain and suffering can be measured; thus, the amount allowed for pain and suffering must ordinarily rest in the sound judgment of the jury. <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, supra </em>at 5; <em>Weeks v Hyatt, </em>346 Mich 479, 490; 78 NW2d 260 (1956).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aee\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>B</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">In the instant case, the plaintiff introduced substantial testimony regarding the immense pain and suffering experienced by the plaintiff during his initial treatment by Dr. Lawson and his subsequent treatment by Drs. Osborn and Mayer,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> as well as the continuing pain and suffering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>plaintiff will experience throughout his life, including the humiliation he will endure as a consequence of his asymmetrical face, all of which resulted from the irreparable damage caused by the defendant\u2019s malpractice.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Although the plaintiff admitted on cross-examination that he had dated and engaged in sports,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> the defendant did not introduce any testimony to directly rebut plaintiffs evidence regarding his injuries, pain, and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">In response, however, to a defense motion for new trial or in the alternative remittitur, the trial court reduced the jury verdict by $250,OOP.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>Although the court expressly disavows substitution of its judgment for that of the trier of fact, it is clear that that is what occurred in this case. For example, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>[T]his Court observed that young man and he\u2019s not the kind of young man who has his face all scarred up or anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b805-5\">As a matter of fact, he is a good-looking young man. He\u2019s got a slight flattening of the jaw on one side at the most, but we are not dealing with a situation where he burned his face or somebody that if anyone looked at, would grimace.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">This is obviously the court\u2019s rejection of the jury\u2019s evaluation of plaintiff\u2019s testimony regarding his feelings of self-consciousness, as well as the expert testimony regarding the extent of the irreparable damage to his face. With respect to plaintiff\u2019s pain and suffering, the trial court apparently ignores the substantial evidence presented regarding the excruciating pain endured during the course of the multiple surgical procedures on plaintiff\u2019s jaw, as well as the chronic pain that plaintiff will suffer for the rest of his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">Because the trial judge clearly substituted her judgment for that of the jury in evaluating the plaintiff\u2019s damages, the Court of Appeals was correct when it reversed the trial court\u2019s order of remittitur.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">This Court does not intend to assert that the amount of the judgment reached by the trial court is unreasonable, nor does this Court aver that the result reached by the jury is that which would have been reached by the Court in its own deliberation. In fact, we have examined awards in many similar cases where plaintiffs incurred serious head or facial injuries,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and we would probably have arrived at a figure that is different from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"564\">*564</page-number>jury verdict, just as the trial court did. The question presented did not, however, allow this Court to substitute its judgment for that of the trier of fact below. The cited cases, while similar, could never present the same facts and evidence as that heard by the trier of fact below. They provide insufficient justification for this Court to superimpose its will in derogation of the principle of trial by jury on the basis of the cold record here reproduced.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">In ordering remittitur, the trial court indicated that the jury was inflamed by Dr. Lawson\u2019s testimony. The trial court points to no specific statements by Dr. Lawson or misconduct by trial counsel during his testimony that would engender the type of passion or bias necessary to interfere with a jury verdict. Nor does our review of his testimony reveal any source of undue prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The Court in <em>Stevens v Edward C Levy Co, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number><em>supra </em>at 4, was presented a situation where it was claimed that the jury verdict resulted from passion or prejudice. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-5\">There [being] no showing of any improper conduct or language by plaintiff or her counsel, as thought by the trial judge, which would have inflamed the jury or appealed improperly to its sympathy or caused a verdict resulting from passion, prejudice, partiality, or corruption, the verdict should be upheld unless it is so excessive as to shock the judicial conscience.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">In the case at bar, the jury verdict was reasonable, given the poignant factual evidence presented by plaintiff. In reversing the trial court\u2019s remittitur, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-7\">Plaintiff testified that he experiences chronic pain that is worsened by the weather and that has not been alleviated by exercise. He claims difficulty in chewing hard foods and in speaking. The oral surgeon testified that plaintiff has a permanent disability in the form of joint disease in his jaw and that accompanies this condition. He will also have some disability with his hip as a result of the bone graft. Further, since one of the surgical procedures required manipulation of two nerves in the jaw bone, plaintiff has a permanent numbness in the lower jaw. Aside from the dental restoration plaintiff has already gone through, there was testimony that plaintiff will have to undergo further reconstructive treatment in the future at a cost of approximately $10,000 to $20,-000. In addition, plaintiff\u2019s continuing functional disability with respect to the vertical components in his jaw may necessitate further reconstructive surgery. Aside from the physical and functional disability, the jury heard plaintiff\u2019s testimony and that of his mother and a psychologist who examined him indicating that he was experienced, and will continue to experience, severe pain and suffer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>ing as a result of the malpractice. For these reasons, we believe the jury verdict was within the range of the evidence and was not so excessive as to shock the judicial conscience. On the contrary, the damages awarded related more to plaintiff\u2019s injuries than to anger at Dr. Lawson. Consequently, we would be very reluctant to disturb this verdict merely because of its size and, therefore, regarding this issue, we reverse the order of remittitur and reinstate the jury verdict. [162 Mich App 271, 292-293; 412 NW2d 709 (1987).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals analysis. The plaintiffs evidence substantially supported the jury verdict, thereby rendering trial court\u2019s order of remittitur an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">We find that defendant hospital both waived and abandoned its affirmative defense of the operation of the statute of limitations when it failed to file a pretrial motion for accelerated judgment, failed to notice such a motion for hearing prior to trial, never introduced any evidence to rebut plaintiffs initial allegation in its complaint that plaintiff neither discovered nor should have discovered the relationship between the malpractice of defendant and the injuries suffered by plaintiff more than six months prior to the commencement of the action, and failed to request a special verdict on the applicability of the discovery rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">We conclude that there was not a sufficient record created below to allow this Court to find an abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in refusing to allow defendant hospital to cross-examine the defendant, Dr. Lawson, with respect to the pretrial settlement negotiated between plaintiff and Dr. Lawson.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>Finally, the Court of Appeals was correct in finding that the trial court abused its discretion in granting remittitur. The evidence submitted by plaintiif with respect to his injuries, pain, and suffering was largely unrebutted by defendant hospital and was sufficient to support the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">Therefore, the judgment of the Court of Appeals should be affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b782-8\"> <em>Phillips v Schoenberger, </em>369 Pa Super 52; 534 A2d 1075 (1987); <em>Coulter v Michelin Tire Corp, </em>622 SW2d 421 (Mo App, 1981); <em>Gulf Life Ins Co v McCabe, </em>363 So 2d 846 (Fla App, 1978).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b782-9\"> <em>Rowan </em>v <em>Nassau Co, </em>91 AD2d 608; 456 NYS2d 418 (1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b782-10\"> <em>Brown </em>v <em>Penrod Drilling Co, </em>534 F Supp 696 (WD La, 1982); <em>Aubert v Aubert, </em>129 NH 422; 529 A2d 909 (1987); <em>Broom </em>v <em>Southeastern Hwy Contracting Co, </em>291 SC 93; 352 SE2d 302 (1986); <em>Brennan v New York City, </em>108 AD2d 834; 485 NYS2d 339 (1985); <em>Hardeman v Mendon Leasing Corp, </em>58 NY2d 892; 460 NYS2d 499; 447 NE2d 47 (1983); <em>Gasquet v Commercial Union Ins Co, </em>391 So 2d 466 (La, 1980); <em>Allied Industrial Int\u2019l, Inc v Placencio, </em>685 SW2d 364 (Tex App, 1984); <em>Armellini Express Lines of Florida v Ansley, </em>605 SW2d 297 (Tex Civ App, 1980); <em>Tomei v Bloom Associates, Inc, </em>75 Mich App 661; 255 NW2d 727 (1977).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b782-11\"> The plaintiff in <em>Detroit Marine, supra </em>at 471,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AR9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>suffered a myriad of injuries, including lacerations above his right eye and depressed fractures of the right side of his forehead, his right cheekbone, and his right orbit. In addition, his nasal bone had been broken. He underwent extensive surgery; first, to correct the pressure on his brain in which a small hole was drilled in his skull to alleviate the situation; and second, to rectify the damage to his facial area in which his skull fracture was elevated, his upper orbit repaired, the floor of his lower orbit replaced with a plastic insert, and his cheekbone moved and set. In all, McRee underwent a total of six operations, and these, coupled with the cost of his hospital stay, totaled almost $18,000.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-6\">Testimony by the surgeons and other doctors involved in McRee\u2019s case revealed that because of his injuries incurred, while extensive correctional surgery had been committed on his person, appellee would continue to experience \"an undefinable mild blunting\u201d of his judgment and a certain euphoric feeling at times in his day-to-day existence.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b783-7\">Further testimony showed that appellee had lost $17,000 in wages from being out of work as a truck driver for 13 months while recuperating, but has since returned to his former line of work, albeit with a different trucking line.

She sustained a fracture to her right kneecap and right thighbone. A rod was placed through her buttocks and down through the marrow of her right thigh and remained there for about a year. Her orthopedic surgeon estimated that she has suffered a 50 percent residual loss of function of her right leg and that she now suffers from post-traumatic arthritis. She limps and has to wear a lift in her right shoe. She sustained multiple head and facial injuries, including numerous extensive lacerations, a comminuted nasal fracture, a cheekbone fracture and fractures of her lower jaw and mandible.

It is precisely this difficulty that, in the instant case, justifies deference to the collective wisdom of members of the jury below, despite the fact that reasonable persons might properly conclude that $800,000 is the maximum verdict supported by the evidence adduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In fact, the remittitur of $250,000 represented a reduction of only twenty percent from the original verdict of $1,250,000. Such a reduction could be perfectly reasonable in the abstract, particularly when viewed in the light of a trial judge\u2019s wisdom, experience and ability to observe the presentation of evidence. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>however, defendant presented no substantive evidence to convince the jury that plaintiffs injuries were less severe than asserted. The jury verdict was within the range sustainable on the basis of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-9\">Although I find the arguments of the Chief Justice persuasive, I am constrained to conclude that the principles embodied in the tradition of trial by jury militate in favor of reversing the trial court\u2019s order of remittitur.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
