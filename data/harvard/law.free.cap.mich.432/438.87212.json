An employer may, without an express reservation of the right to do so, unilaterally change its written policy from one of discharge for cause to one of termination at will, provided that the employer gives aifected employees reasonable notice of the policy change.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-5\">i</p>\n<p id=\"b685-6\">In its order certifying the question,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit set forth the following facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b685-7\">Kenneth Bankey was employed as a salesman for Storer Broadcasting Company for thirteen years until he was discharged on March 23, 1981. The reason given by Storer Broadcasting was poor job performance. On July 15, 1982, Mr. Bankey filed a complaint in the Michigan Circuit Court for the County of Oakland alleging that throughout his employment with Storer, there existed a policy that Storer would not terminate its employees without just cause, and that in reliance upon that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>policy he remained in Storer\u2019s employ for more than twelve years. On August 24, 1982, Storer Broadcasting removed the case from the Circuit Court for Oakland County to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan on the basis of diversity jurisdiction pursuant to 28 USC 1332. This case is controlled by the substantive law of the State of Michigan.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b686-6\">Mr. Bankey successfully argued in the district court that his employment relationship with Storer was controlled by [a] 1980 Personnel Policy Digest [issued by Storer] which expressly states that \"an employee may be . . . discharged for cause.\u201d In January, 1981, Storer revised its Digest to eliminate any \"for cause\u201d requirement for discharge of its employees. The January 1981 Digest states that \"[e]mployment is at the will of the company.\u201d The district court found as a matter of law that the 1980 Digest created a \"for cause\u201d employment contract and that once such a contract is established under <em>Toussaint, </em>the employer cannot unilaterally alter the employment relationship as to <em>existing </em>employees to permit discharge at will. The court\u2019s ruling on this issue was made following the defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict at the close of plaintiffs case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b686-7\">A jury awarded Mr. Bankey $55,000 in damages on his claim that Storer had breached its obligation not to discharge without cause. Storer\u2019s appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit precipitated the certified question.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-8\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b686-9\">This Court granted the request to answer the certified question in order to resolve some of the uncertainty concerning the scope of what has come to be known as the <em>Toussaint </em>\"handbook excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>tion\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> to the employment-at-will doctrine.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Toussaint </em>modified the presumptive rule of employment at will<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> by finding that a written discharge-for-cause employment policy may become legally enforceable in contract.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-6\">In <em>Toussaint, </em>the plaintiff-employee testified that in response to his inquiry about job security at the time of hiring, he was given oral assurance that he would be with the company \"as long as I did my job,\u201d and was handed a manual of the employer\u2019s policies. The manual stated that once a probationary period had been completed, it was the company\u2019s \"policy\u201d to discharge employees \"for just cause only.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b687-7\">The Michigan Court of Appeals set aside a jury verdict for Toussaint on the ground that \"a contract for permanent employment or employment for life is a contract for an indefinite period and terminable at the will of either party\u201d and \"cannot be made other than terminable at will by a provision that states that an employee will not be discharged except for cause.\u201d <em>Toussaint v Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>79 Mich App 429, 434-435; 262 NW2d 848 (1977).</p>\n<p id=\"b687-8\">However, upon appeal this Court reinstated the jury verdict in <em>Toussaint, </em>and held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>1) a provision of an employment contract providing that an employee shall not be discharged except for cause is legally enforceable although the contract is not for a definite term\u2014the term is \"indefinite,\u201d and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-6\">2) such a provision may become part of the contract either by express agreement, oral or written, or as a result of an employee\u2019s legitimate expectations grounded in an employer\u2019s policy statements.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-7\">3) In <em>Toussaint, </em>as in <em>Ebling,[</em><footnotemark><em>8</em></footnotemark><em>] </em>there was sufficient evidence of an express agreement to justify submission to the jury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b688-8\">4) A jury could also find for Toussaint based on legitimate expectations grounded in his employer\u2019s written policy statements set forth in the manual of personnel policies.[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">Prior to terminating the employment relationship, the employer in <em>Toussaint </em>had not revoked or altered its written policy statements which indicated that employees would not be discharged except for cause. Thus the <em>Toussaint </em>Court was not required to consider the duration of the legitimacy of an employee\u2019s expectations: Do handbook provisions setting forth a personnel policy of termination for cause support only a limited expectation that the employer will adhere to that policy while it is in effect as official company policy? Or, may an employee legitimately expect that discharge for cause has become a permanent feature of his employment contract with the company?</p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">in</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">This Court indicated in <em>Toussaint, </em>supra, pp 614-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>615, that an employer\u2019s right to make unilateral policy changes survives Toussaint\u2019s holding that employer statements of policy can give rise to contractual rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-4\">We hold that employer statements of policy . . . can give rise to contractual rights in employees without evidence that the parties mutually agreed that the policy statements would create contractual rights in the employee, and, hence, although the statement of policy is signed by neither party, <em>can be unilaterally amended by the employer without notice to the employee, </em>and contains no reference to a specific employee, his job description or compensation, and although no reference was made to the policy statement in pre-employment interviews and the employee does not learn of its existence until after his hiring. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-5\">Subsequent dictum, however, can be read as requiring that employees be given advance notice, directly or indirectly, that the employer reserves the right to make changes in written policies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b689-6\">An employer who establishes no personnel policies instills no reasonable expectations of performance. Employers can make known to their employees that personnel policies are subject to unilateral changes by the employer. Employees would then have no legitimate expectation that any particular policy will continue to remain in force. [Id., p 619.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">In a brief submitted in connection with our consideration of the certified question, Storer asserts that an employer may unilaterally change or adopt new personnel policies without having explicitly reserved the right to do so because only a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>unilateral contract is formed when an employee is hired for an indefinite period. Storer reasons that when an employee continues to work following an employer\u2019s unilateral change in policy, the employee\u2019s continued employment signifies acceptance of, and provides the necessary consideration for, a new unilateral contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-6\">A unilateral contract is one in which the promisor does not receive a promise in return as consideration. 1 Restatement Contracts, \u00a7\u00a7 12, 52, pp 10-12, 58-59.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In simplest terms, a typical employment contract can be described as a unilateral contract in which the employer promises to pay an employee wages in return for the employee\u2019s work. In essence, the employer\u2019s promise constitutes the terms of the employment agreement; the employee\u2019s action or forbearance in reliance upon the employer\u2019s promise constitutes sufficient consideration to make the promise legally binding. In such circumstances, there is no contractual requirement that the promisee do more than perform the act upon which the promise is predicated in order to legally obligate the promisor. <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>pp 630-631 (separate opinion of Ryan, J.), citing <em>Adolph v Cookware Co of America, </em>283 Mich 561; 278 NW 687 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-7\">In a typical situation, where employment is for an indefinite duration, the unilateral contract framework provides no answer to the question: When will the act bargained for by the employer be fully performed? The answer to that question depends on the characterization of the \u201dact\u201d for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>which the promise is exchanged. If the \"act\u201d is simply a day\u2019s work (for a day\u2019s wage), then Storer\u2019s argument makes sense: The employer\u2019s offer is renewed each day, and each day\u2019s performance by the employee constitutes a new acceptance and a new consideration. But such a characterization can be strikingly artificial. Few employers and employees begin each day contemplating whether to renew or modify the employment contract in effect at the close of work on the previous day.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-4\">In his brief, plaintiff Bankey does not clearly state whether he relies on unilateral or a bilateral contract theory. He simply argues that any unilateral attempt by Storer to change an existing discharge-for-cause policy can be no more than a proposal for modification of the contract for which mutual assent would be required. However, Ban-key admonishes us that there must be a \"meeting of the minds\u201d upon all essential points to constitute a valid contract, citing, among others, <em>Professional Corporation v Marks, </em>373 Mich 673; 131 NW2d 60 (1964); <em>Fisk v Fisk, </em>328 Mich 570; 44 NW2d 184 (1950); <em>Universal Leaseway Systems, Inc v Herrud &amp; Co, </em>366 Mich 473; 115 NW2d 294 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">The major difficulty with such an argument as applied to the question before us is that the contractual obligation which may not be modified without mutual assent, under Bankey\u2019s theory, could have arisen without mutual assent under Toussaint\u2019s own terms: \"We hold that employer statements of policy . . . can give rise to contractual rights in employees without evidence that the parties mutually agreed that the policy statements would create contractual rights in the employee . . . .\u201d <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>pp 614-615. Under circumstances where \"contractual rights\u201d have arisen outside the operation of normal contract <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>principles, the application of strict rules of contractual modification may not be appropriate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b692-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">While a majority of jurisdictions now recognize some type of \"handbook exception\u201d to the employment-at-will doctrine,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> there is no clear consensus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>as to either the legal theory supporting the handbook exception or the scope of the exception. Some of the cases suggest that enforceability of a handbook policy turns on an individual employee\u2019s reliance upon its provisions,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> though the extent to which detrimental reliance or promissory estoppel is a necessary element is not always made clear. Other courts have employed the unilateral contract theory to find an offer and acceptance of handbook provisions as terms of an employment contract.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">The issue now before us\u2014whether a written discharge-for-cause policy may be modified by the employer without explicit reservation at the outset of the right to do so\u2014has been addressed by two other courts. In <em>Chambers v Valley Nat'l Bank, </em>3 IER Cases 1476 (Ariz, 1988); a bank employee hired in 1971 claimed that her layoff in 1987 breached a contractual obligation created by the bank\u2019s personnel manual. In 1984, following adoption by the Arizona Supreme Court of a handbook <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>exception<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> to the employment-at-will doctrine, the bank revised its manual and disclaimed any obligation to discharge only for cause. The United States District Court for the District of Arizona held that, given the 1984 disclaimer, the plaintiff could not reasonably have relied thereafter on the handbook as creating a contract guaranteeing discharge only for cause. <em>Chambers, supra, </em>p 1478. The court characterized the disclaimer as an offer of modification of a unilateral contract which the plaintiff accepted by continuing to work for the bank.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-6\">In <em>Thompson v Kings Entertainment Co, </em>653 F Supp 871 (ED Va, 1987), the plaintiff employee painted signs at a Virginia theme park. In 1980, three years after he was hired, the plaintiff was given a personnel manual which included a discharge-for-cause provision. Subsequently, the theme park changed ownership, and in July, 1985, a new manual providing for employment at will was distributed. In August, 1985, the plaintiff was discharged, and he thereafter filed a diversity action in federal court, contending that the 1980 manual and various representations of his employer rebutted the presumption of employment at will. His employer argued that even if the 1980 manual created a discharge-for-cause contract, distribution in 1985 of the new manual served to reinvoke plaintiffs employment-at-will status.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-7\">Even though the Virginia Supreme Court had not recognized a handbook exception, the federal district court nevertheless rejected the employer\u2019s motion for summary judgment, finding that the effect of the 1985 manual on plaintiffs status turned on whether he had accepted the change of status and received consideration for it. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>held that acceptance could not be inferred merely from plaintiffs continuing to work, and remanded the case for a jury determination of the questions of acceptance and consideration. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>p 876.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">In addition, courts in at least five other jurisdictions have commented in dicta on the effect under similar circumstances of an employer\u2019s modification of written employment policy statements. Four of these courts have employed unilateral contract theory to analyze the enforceability of handbook provisions. In the earliest of such cases, <em>Langdon v Saga Corp, </em>569 P2d 524, 528 (Okla Ct App, 1976), an Oklahoma appellate court concluded that a personnel manual\u2019s provision could supplant prior contractual terms and become a new contract \"which defined the employer-employee relationship <em>during the period the policy was in effect </em>and the employee performed.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This conclusion was adopted by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, applying Oklahoma law, in <em>Vinyard v King, </em>728 F2d 428, 432 (CA 10, 1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b695-5\">The Minnesota Supreme Court, in <em>Pine River State Bank v Mettille, </em>333 NW2d 622, 627 (Minn, 1983), noted that contractual obligations arising from handbooks are revocable by modification.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">In the case of unilateral contracts for employment, where an at-will employee retains employment with knowledge of new or changed conditions, the new or changed conditions may become a contractual obligation. In this manner, an original employment contract may be modified or replaced by a subsequent unilateral contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b695-7\">The Supreme Court of New Jersey suggested in a footnoted dictum that contractual obligations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>arising from handbooks are revocable for legitimate business reasons.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b696-4\">The contract arising from the manual is of indefinite duration. It is not the extraordinary \"lifetime\u201d contract explicitly claimed in <em>Savarese [v Pyrene Mfg Co, </em>9 NJ 595; 89 A2d 237 (1952)]. For example, a contract arising from a manual ordinarily may be terminated when the employee\u2019s performance is inadequate; when business circumstances require a general reduction in the employment force, the positions eliminated including that of plaintiff; when those same circumstances require the elimination of employees performing a certain function, for instance, for technological reasons, and plaintiff performed such functions; when business conditions require a general reduction in salary, a reduction that brings plaintiff\u2019s pay below that which he is willing to accept; or when any change, including the cessation of business, requires the elimination of plaintiff\u2019s position, an elimination made in good faith in pursuit of legitimate business objectives: all of these terminations, long before the expiration of \"lifetime\u201d employment, are ordinarily contemplated in a contract arising from a manual, although the list does not purport to be exhaustive. <em>[Woolley v Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc, </em>99 NJ 284, 301, n 8; 491 A2d 1257, 1266 (1985).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">In addition, the Alabama Supreme Court pointed to the revocability of handbook obligations as support for its conclusion that to enforce such provisions while they are in effect would not be unduly burdensome to employers. Quoting from Perritt, Employee Dismissal Law and Practice, p 150, the court observed that \"the unilateral offer made by the employer may be characterized . . . as follows: 'I promise I will not dismiss you without cause (or without exhausting specified procedures) unless I change this policy before you are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>discharged.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hoffman-LaRoche, Inc v Campbell, </em>512 So 2d 725, 734-735 (Ala, 1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">Finally, without relying on unilateral contract theory, a Missouri court provided comment concerning the legal ability of an employer to modify such a written policy statement. In <em>Enyeart v Shelter Mutual Ins Co, </em>693 SW2d 120, 123 (Mo App, 1985), the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, after referring to the reasoning of <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>stated that \"if an employer elects to establish policies in its relations with employees and publishes those policies in a document distributed to employees, the employer is contractually bound to observe those policies <em>until they are modi\u00f1ed or </em>withdrawn(Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">v</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">Without rejecting the applicability of unilateral contract theory in other situations, we find it inadequate as a basis for our answer to the question as worded and certified by the United States Court of Appeals. We look, instead, to the analysis employed in <em>Toussaint </em>which focused upon the benefit that accrues to an employer when it establishes desirable, personnel policies. Under <em>Toussaint, </em>written personnel policies are not enforceable because they have been \"offered and accepted\u201d as a unilateral contract; rather, their enforceability arises from the benefit the employer derives by establishing such policies.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">While an employer need not establish personnel policies or practices, where an employer chooses to establish such policies and practices and makes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>them known to its employees, the employment relationship is presumably enhanced. The employer secures an orderly, cooperative and loyal work force, and the employee the peace of mind associated with job security and the conviction that he will be treated fairly. No pre-employment negotiations need take place and the parties\u2019 minds need not meet on the subject; nor does it matter that the employee knows nothing of the particulars of the employer\u2019s policies and practices or <em>that the employer may change them unilaterally. </em>It is enough that the employer chooses, presumably in its own interest, to create an environment in which the employee believes that, whatever the personnel policies and practices, they are established and official <em>at any given time, </em>purport to be fair, and are applied consistently and uniformly to each employee. The employer has then created a situation \"instinct with an obligation.\u201d <em>[Toussaint, supra, </em>p 613. Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">Under the <em>Toussaint </em>analysis, an employer who chooses to establish desirable personnel policies, such as a discharge-for-cause employment policy, is not seeking to induce each individual employee to show up for work day after day, but rather is seeking to promote an environment conducive to collective productivity. The benefit to the employer of promoting such an environment, rather than the traditional contract-forming mechanisms of mutual assent or individual detrimental reliance, gives rise to a situation \"instinct with an obligation.\u201d When, as in the question before us, the employer changes its discharge-for-cause policy to one of employment at will, the employer\u2019s benefit is correspondingly extinguished, as is the rationale for the court\u2019s enforcement of the discharge-for-cause policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">Even though a discharge-for-cause policy may be modified or revoked, while such a policy remains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>in effect, \"the employer may not treat its promise as illusory\u201d by refusing to adhere to the policy\u2019s terms. <em>Toussaint, </em>p 619. It has been suggested that if such a policy is revocable, it is of no value, and thus is the equivalent of an illusory promise. Of course, a permanent job commitment would be highly prized in the modern work force. However, it does not follow that anything less than a permanent job commitment is without meaning or value. Indeed, the prevalence of job security provisions in collective bargaining agreements that typically expire after only a few years attests to the fact that such commitments need not be permanent to have value.</p>\n<p id=\"b699-4\">Furthermore, it is important to recognize that even though an employment policy is revocable, the <em>Toussaint </em>approach to employer obligation promotes stability in employment relations in two significant ways: by holding employers accountable for personnel policies that \"are established and official at any given time,\u201d and by requiring that such policies be \"applied consistently and uniformly to each employee.\u201d <em>Toussaint </em>holds that an employee may \"legitimately expect\u201d that his employer will uniformly apply personnel policies \"in force at any given time.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b699-5\">It is one thing to expect that a discharge-for-cause policy will be uniformly applied while it is in effect; it is quite a different proposition to expect that such a personnel policy, having no fixed duration, will be immutable unless the right to revoke the policy was expressly reserved. The very definition of \"policy\u201d negates a legitimate expectation of permanence. \"Policy\u201d is defined as \"a definite course or method of action selected (as by a government, institution, group, or individual) from among alternatives and in the light of given conditions to guide and usu[ally] determine pres<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>ent and future decisions; ... a projected program consisting of desired objectives and the means to achieve them . . . .\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged Edition </em>(1964). In other words, a \"policy\u201d is commonly understood to be a flexible framework for operational guidance, not a perpetually binding contractual obligation. In the modern economic climate, the operating policies of a business enterprise must be adaptable and responsive to change.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">Were we to answer the certified question by holding that once an employer adopted a policy of discharge for cause, such a policy could never be changed short of successful renegotiation with each employee who worked while the policy was in effect, the uniformity stressed in <em>Toussaint, supra, </em>pp 613, 619, 624, would be sacrificed. If an employer had amended its handbook from time to time, as often is the case, the employer could find itself obligated in a variety of different ways to any number of different employees, depending on the modifications which had been adopted and the extent of the work force turnover. Furthermore, were we to answer the certified question as plaintiff Bankey requests, many employers would be tied to anachronistic policies in perpetuity merely because they did not have the foresight to anticipate the Court\u2019s <em>Toussaint </em>decision by expressly reserving at the outset the right to make policy changes.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">While we hold today that an employer may make changes in a written discharge-for-cause policy applicable to its entire work force or to specific classifications without having reserved in advance the right to do so, we caution against an assumption that our answer would condone changes made in bad faith\u2014for example, the temporary suspension of a discharge-for-cause policy to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>facilitate the firing of a particular employee in contravention of that policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The principles on which <em>Toussaint </em>is based would be undermined if an employer could benefit from the good will generated by a discharge-for-cause policy while unfairly manipulating the way in which it is revoked. Fairness suggests that a discharge-for-cause policy announced with flourishes and fanfare at noonday should not be revoked by a pennywhistle trill at midnight. We hold that for the revocation of a discharge-for-cause policy to become legally effective, reasonable notice of the change must be uniformly given to affected employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">We emphasize that our answer today is necessarily limited by the wording of the certified question which asks whether an employer under the circumstances set forth may unilaterally change from a discharge-for-cause to an employment-at-will policy.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">We answer the certified question in the affirmative.

The question what relief or remedy may be awarded an employee who worked under a discharge-for-cause policy in consequence of a change from discharge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>for cause to termination at will has not been briefed or argued and hence cannot be decided.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The resolution of that question depends on the facts and circumstances of particular cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\">It has been suggested that the certified question sought an answer to the question whether a change in policy from just cause to termination at will could be made <em>without consequence to the employer </em>and therefore we should answer either yes or no and not \"it depends.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Putting aside that the majority, in requiring reasonable notice of a change of policy, has not responded simply yes or no, and has apparently thereby indicated that there may be a consequence to an employer who failed to give reasonable notice of a change in policy, it is not unusual for litigants to take extreme positions or for a court to find a resolution somewhere between the extremes. If a resolution somewhere between the extremes is the correct judicial response, it is no less correct because, before studying the question and putting pen to paper, we may have been under the impression that we could respond with a simple yes or no.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">ii</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Although Bankey\u2019s action against Storer Broadcasting has been tried to a jury verdict for Bankey, we may not, in responding to the certified question, stated as purely one of law, consider the record on appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.

It appears there is a substantial question whether the Court has jurisdiction to respond to the certified question in this case. Since that question concerns the subject matter jurisdiction of the Court, we are obliged to notice and consider it, although it has not occurred to us before to question our jurisdiction to respond to a certified question and the parties have not raised or briefed the question.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">In 1976, this Court amended the court rules to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>establish a procedure whereby it could respond to \"a question that Michigan law may resolve\u201d propounded by a federal court or a state appellate court.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The rule provides that the certifying court shall provide this Court with a certificate containing \"a factual statement\u201d and \"the question to be answered.\u201d The rule does not in terms require that the response to the certified question be determinative of the controversy, and, indeed, in the instant case it will not be.

The response will not be made effective by a final judgment, decree or process of this Court. No decision of this Court that will be binding on the parties or that will be res judicata of an issue will be entered by the Court. The response does not end the controversy, and this Court has no way of enforcing its response to the certified question by appropriate means.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">The certified question does not ask, nor does the response of the majority state, whether the judgment of the trial court shall be affirmed or reversed. The application of the response to the certified question in <em>Bankey v Storer Broadcasting Co </em>is, again, left to the judgment of the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>States Court of Appeals or the United States District Court on remand.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">It might be possible to develop a procedure akin to a declaratory judgment whereby this Court\u2019s response is determinative of the cause.

Employers have a legitimate expectation that they will be able to prospectively alter employment policies to respond to changes in the economy or to implement new business strategies. The principal and overriding concept of <em>Toussaint </em>is that an employer cannot act to defeat an employee\u2019s legitimate expectations arising from the employer\u2019s statements of policy. <em>Id., </em>599.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b703-7\"> The provisions of an employee manual may not, in a particular case, be terms of the employment contract, whether bilateral or unilateral. In <em>Bullock v Automobile Club of Michigan, </em>146 Mich App 711; 381 NW2d 793 (1985), the Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit judge denying summary disposition for aaa because it was for the trier of fact to decide whether the provisions of the manual relied on by aaa were consistent with the terms of the offer and acceptance and a part of Bullock\u2019s employment contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">Where the employment contract arises from the terms of a policy statement set forth in a manual, the terms of the employment contract will change as the terms of the policy manual are changed, subject to the legitimate expectations of a particular employee grounded in a policy statement under which he worked. Where there is no express contract and the employee relies on a manual stating a policy that employees will have a job as long as they do the job, then the contract obtains, subject to legitimate expectations, only as long as the employer has such a policy or until he changes it. The principle of promissory estoppel may be applicable where an employee, in reliance on a policy statement, leaves or refuses other employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">Where, however, the employment contract arises not from statements in a policy manual but from an express contract or representation, a change in policy cannot change the contract because the contract is not based on a policy statement but on express agreement or a representation. If an employee accepts an offer of employment as long as the employee does the job, the contract is that he will be employed as long as he does the job because the contract arose out of an express agreement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b704-7\"> Requiring that \"reasonable notice of [a] change [revoking a discharge-for-cause policy] must be uniformly given to affected employees\u201d (ante, p 457) protects legitimate expectations of employees who worked under a just-cause policy, but, depending on how the \"reasonable notice\u201d concept is applied, may do so inadequately in particular cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">Since the notice is to be given \"uniformly,\u201d it may be contended that a middle-aged employee who worked for twenty years under the discharge-for-cause policy is entitled to no more notice than a young entry-level employee who has worked for one month before the change in policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">The purpose to be served by providing notice is unclear. Most employees to whom job security may be important do not have the desire, mobility or ability to conduct a search for a discharge-for-cause employer during even a generous \"reasonable notice\u201d time span, especially if the employee does not expect that the employer may be considering discharging the employee after the \"reasonable notice\u201d expires.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">Although an employer is not required to adopt a discharge-for-cause policy and has the right to change such a policy whether or not he reserved the right to do so, if he has adopted such a policy, he has promised more to employees who served under the discharge-for-cause policy than reasonable notice of a change in policy. The legitimate expectations of particular employees grounded in the discharge-for-cause policy may require some other relief or remedy.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b704-11\"> The preliminary and central question of what the terms of the employment contract in fact are is clearly a question for the trier of fact, a jury where one has been requested. Contract interpretation may present a question of law. Once the trier of fact has determined what are the terms of the employment contract, the separate question of what legitimate employee expectations were generated by employer policy statements found to be a part of the contract is a question of law for the Court. <em>[Bullock, supra, </em>p 507.

In two cases concerning its jurisdiction to issue a writ of habeas corpus, the United States Supreme Court defined \"appellate jurisdiction\u201d as \"the revision of a decision of an inferior court.\u201d <em>Ex parte Bollman </em>[8 US] (4 Cranch) 75, 101; 2 L Ed 554 (1807) (Marshall, C.J.); <em>Ex parte Watkins </em>[32 US] (7 Pet) 568, 573; 8 L Ed 786 (1833) (Story, J). Interpreting its constitution, the Oklahoma Supreme Court stated: \"Appellate jurisdiction is that power and jurisdiction to review and correct those proceedings of inferior courts . . . .\u201d Other state courts have made nearly identical comments concerning the meaning of \"appellate jurisdiction\u201d in their constitutions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-9\">\"Appellate jurisdiction\u201d obviously connotes review of the action of an <em>inferior court. </em>\"Inferior court\u201d has been appropriately defined as \"any court subordinate to the chief appellate tribunal in the particular judicial system.\u201d Federal courts are not \"inferior courts\u201d to this Court. Consequently, this Court\u2019s answer to a certified question in a case that originated in or is to be adjudicated in a federal court is not an exercise of \"appellate jurisdiction\u201d within the meaning of the Utah Constitution. [Emphasis in original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-10\">To be sure the Supreme Court of Utah, in distinguishing the decisions of other courts recognizing a power to respond to a certified question, observed that its constitution granted it \"appellate jurisdiction only,\u201d while the constitutions of the other states did not include the limiting \"only.\u201d The Constitution of 1908, in describing the jurisdiction of this Court, after referring to the power of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>superintending control and to issue writs of various kinds stated, \"[i]n all other cases it shall have appellate jurisdiction <em>only.\u201d </em>Const 1908, art 7, \u00a74. The omission of the word \"only\u201d might be regarded as significant if the Legislature had passed a statute, as have some state legislatures, authorizing this Court to respond to certified questions. It is not questionable, however, whether the Michigan Legislature could constitutionally enact such legislation, since the Michigan Constitution provides that this Court shall have \"appellate jurisdiction <em>as provided by rules of the supreme court.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The question thus remains: What is meant by \"appellate jurisdiction?\u201d It appears rather clear that appellate jurisdiction does not include responding to a certified question, because in responding to a certified question, the Court is not reviewing, revising, or correcting the proceedings or decisions of an inferior court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b709-7\"><em> In re Richards, </em>223 A2d 827, 833 (Me, 1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">In subsequent cases, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine stated that \u201c '[djeterminative of the cause\u2019 encompasses <em>any </em>disposition by which the Federal controversy <em>is terminated.\u201d Hiram Ricker &amp; Sons v Students Int\u2019l Meditation Society, </em>342 A2d 262, 264 (Me, 1975) (emphasis in original); <em>White v Edgar, </em>320 A2d 668 (Me, 1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\"> The Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act speaks, in \u00a7 1, of \"questions of law of this state which may be determinative of the cause then pending in the certifying court . . . .\u201d 12 ULA 52.
