The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, held that the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment was not appealable in light of Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, and dismissed the appeal. We shall reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">Prior to setting forth the facts and arguments in the present controversy, it would be useful to review briefly some of the pertinent statutory procedural requirements which must be followed before the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development is entitled to raze a condemned building.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">The Building Code, Baltimore City Code (2000 Repl.Vol.), Art. 32, contains a comprehensive statutory scheme aimed at ensuring the legal use and occupancy of buddings in the City of Baltimore. The Department of Housing and Community Development is the administrative agency charged with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>administration, interpretation, and enforcement of the Building Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 105 of the Building Code prescribes the duties and powers of the \u201cBuilding Code Official,\u201d stating that whenever any part of a building \u201cbecome[s] dangerous, unsafe, or a menace to public health and safety, the Building Code Official may condemn it and take any other appropriate action to rectify or eliminate the dangerous or unsafe condition.\u201d \u00a7 105.2.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Nevertheless, before the Building Code Official may take any action on a Building Code violation, the Official must give notice of the code violation to the person legally responsible for the maintenance of the building. <em>See </em>\u00a7 116.2. If the violation is not abated or the notice not complied with, the Official may then institute legal proceedings. <em>See </em>\u00a7 116.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">Under \u00a7 119, if a structure is deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cunfit\u201d for authorized use, the Building Code Official may require the owner to rehabilitate the building, or, if rehabilitation is not feasible, the Official may require the owner to raze the building. An order to raze is not final, however. Subsections 119.3.2.1 and 119.3.2.2 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-7\">\u201c119.3.2.1 Appeal: The recipient of an order to raze ... may request administrative review of the order under \u00a7 123.5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b209-8\">\u201c119.3.2.2 Timetable for rehabilitation: The Building Code Official may rescind or modify the order to raze if the owner demonstrates the financial ability and requisite expertise to rehabilitate the structure within a reasonable time, as determined by the Building Code Official, and agrees to comply with a specified timetable. Failure to comply with an agreed timetable reinstates the order to raze.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>Various actions are authorized under the Building Code to address the failure to comply with an order to rehabilitate or raze an unsafe building. These are listed in \u00a7\u00a7 119.7 and 119.7.1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">\u201c119.7 Remedial action by Building Code Official: The Building Code Official may take action under this [section] whenever the owner ... cannot be found or fails to comply with a notice:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">a. to repair, rehabilitate, stabilize, or raze an unsafe budding or structure,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-8\">b. to clean, close, board, or otherwise safeguard a vacant building, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-9\">c. to remove high grass and weeds or litter, trash, and debris from the premises of a vacant building.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-10\">\u201c119.7.1 Actions authorized: Under the circumstances described in \u00a7 119.7, after giving notice as required by this Code, the Building Code Official may proceed to do any 1 or more of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-11\">a. condemn the building,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-12\">b. have a receiver appointed, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-13\">c. complete all or any part of the required work through officers, agents, employees, or contractors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">Thus, under \u00a7 119.7.1, the Building Code Official must give notice prior to razing a building that is deemed \u201cunsafe\u201d or \u201cunfit\u201d for authorized use. After receiving an order to raze or a condemnation notice, the owner of the building may seek administrative review under \u00a7 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-15\">Section 123 sets forth, <em>inter alia, </em>the right to administrative review of notices and orders, the procedural requirements for the administrative hearings, and the right to judicial review of administrative decisions. The detailed procedures for the administrative hearings can be found in \u00a7 123.6, which states in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">\u201c123.6 Procedure for hearings: The Building Code Official shall conduct all hearings held, under this Code in accordance with this \u00a7 123.6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u201c123.6.1 Hearings open to the public: All hearings shall be open to the public.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-5\">\u201c123.6.2 Notification of complainants: Before any hearing, the Building Code Official shall notify all persons who the Building Code Official knows are interested in the hearing of its scheduled date, t\u00edme, place, and purpose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-6\">\u201c123.6.4 Presiding Officer: The Building Code Official presides at all hearings.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201c123.6.6 Decision of Building Code Official: Within 30 days after a hearing is completed, the Building Code Official shall render a written decision that includes the reasons for the decision.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">\u201c123.6.7 Records: The Department shall keep a complete record of all papers filed in connection with any hearing, together with a copy of the Building Code Official\u2019s written decision.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-10\">Turning to the facts of this case, on August 17, 1992, the Department of Housing issued two notices of housing code violations to the petitioner Murrell for the buildings located at 562 Gold Street and 566 Gold Street.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The notices advised the petitioner to (1) \u201cremove all trash and debris, high grass and weeds within ten (10) days of the date of this notice and keep in clean and sanitary condition at all times\u201d; (2) \u201cboard up all accessible openings within ten (10) days of the date of this notice and notify inspector when this is done\u201d as well as to \u201c[k]eep these openings boarded until the building is razed or rehabilitated\u201d; and, finally, to (3) \u201c[rjepair and rehabilitate or raze after securing approval from the building official.\u201d The notices stated that \u201cconditions must be corrected by 9/17/92 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>unless otherwise noted.\u201d The record in this case does not disclose what actions, if any, by either the petitioner or the Department, took place between August 17, 1992, and 1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On February 2, 1999, Alvin Waters, an inspector for the Department of Housing, inspected the three properties located at 562 Gold Street, 566 Gold Street, and 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue. As a result of his inspection, Mr. Waters posted a condemnation notice upon each of the properties. Each notice of condemnation advised that the owner had a right to appeal. There is nothing in the record indicating that a condemnation notice was posted on the petitioner\u2019s property located at 564 Gold Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">A week later, on February 9, 1999, Mr. Waters prepared a report for the Department of Housing describing the alleged code violations in detail, recommending that the three properties be condemned as a safety hazard, and stating that, if the conditions were not corrected or the braidings rehabilitated, the buildings should be razed. Specifically, his report noted as follows with respect to 562 Gold Street:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">\u201cThis building has been abandoned, it is rodent infested, dilapidated. Lacks proper sanitation, heating, plumbing and utilities. Adjacent to a vacant building on either side and the braiding is a fire hazard; stress cracks in the side and rear masonry walls.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-8\">\u201cAbove deteriorating conditions of damage and decay cause the braiding to be unsafe and unfit for human habitation. [Section 119.0, 119.1, and 119.1.1 of the 1997 Baltimore City Bldg Code] Recommend building be condemned as a SAFETY HAZARD. If the above conditions are not corrected or the structure rehabilitated, building should be razed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">Next, regarding 566 Gold Street, Mr. Waters\u2019s report stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AtM\">\u201cThis building has been abandoned, it is rodent infested, dilapidated. Lacks proper sanitation, heating, plumbing and utilities. Adjacent to a vacant building on either side and the building is a fire hazard; missing doors and windows, stress cracks in the side masonry wall.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u201cAbove deteriorating conditions of damage and decay cause the building to be unsafe and unfit for human habitation. [Section 119.0, 119.1, and 119.1.1 of the 1997 Baltimore City Bldg Code] Recommend building be condemned as a SAFETY HAZARD. If the above conditions are not corrected or the structure rehabilitated, building should be razed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Finally, his report recited the following for 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">\u201cThe rear masonry wall has severe vertical and horizontal stress cracks with loose and bulging bricks, which appears to be in imminent danger of collapsing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cAbove deteriorating conditions of damage and decay cause the building to be unsafe and unfit for human habitation. [Section 119.0, 119.1, and 119.1.1 of the 1997 Baltimore City Bldg Code] Recommend building be condemned as a SAFETY HAZARD. If the above conditions are not corrected building should be razed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">The record does not contain an inspection report for 564 Gold Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">On the same day, the Department of Housing mailed to the petitioner a letter for each of the condemned properties (562 Gold Street, 566 Gold Street, and 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue), which enclosed a copy of the condemnation notice. The Department of Housing also sent to the petitioner letters notifying him of the impending charges and liens for the cost of razing the condemned properties. The Department of Housing sent four letters \u2014 they referred to (1) 562 Gold Street; (2) 566 Gold Street; (3) 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue; and (4) 564 Gold Street. The letters, which were identical except for the property address referenced, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-10\">\u201cIn accordance with the Condemnation Notice issued on February 2,1999, this is to advise that the above-mentioned property, owned by you is to be razed. The work will be performed under emergency orders of the Director of Construction and Buildings Inspection. Under provisions of the Baltimore City Code, funds expended by the City to per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>form this work are chargeable against the owner and constitute a lien against the property.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">\u201cA bill covering the services performed by the City will be forwarded to you shortly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">\u201cThe purpose of this letter is to notify you of the impending bill and lien. Upon receipt of the bill for such emergency work, these charges must be paid within thirty (30) days to avoid further legal action. It is suggested that arrangements be made to satisfy this lien prior to the expiration of the thirty (30) days.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This was the first document referring to a problem with the 564 Gold Street property. Although the letters advised the petitioner that \u201c[t]he work will be performed under emergency orders,\u201d the Department of Housing later stated: \u201cWhile petitioner ... claims that these properties did not involve an emergency, [the Department of Housing] never claimed that their demolition did in fact constitute an emergency.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">A month later, on March 8, 1999, the petitioner met with Mr. Harris, who was also an inspector from the Department of Housing. The petitioner related to Mr. Harris that he planned to renovate the buildings in question. Mr. Harris advised him to contact the Department of Housing, which, in turn, advised him to take an appeal. By letter dated March 15, 1999, the petitioner requested an appeal from the Department\u2019s determination and condemnation order. The petitioner then applied for permits to paint the exterior walls and to install windows for each of the properties on Gold Street, as well as to remove and replace the rear brick wall for the 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue warehouse. These applications were received by the Department of Housing on April 1,1999, and were each denied on April 6, 1999. Notably, an internal memorandum from the Department of Housing, dated the same day, stated in reference to the 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue warehouse: \u201cThis is the building the Mayor ask[ed] the Commissioner to take down at the ribbon cutting on 3/31/99.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b215-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>The petitioner then hired Derrick Burnett, an architect, to perform a building survey on the four subject properties. Mr. Burnett inspected the buildings and submitted a report to the petitioner on April 13, 1999. With respect to the three Gold Street properties, the report essentially stated that the structural integrity of the buildings was sound, but that some aesthetic improvements should be made. The report noted that the rear wall of the Pennsylvania Avenue warehouse should be repaired, but that the overall structural integrity of the building \u201cappears to be sound and in good standing condition.\u201d A copy of this report was forwarded to the Department of Housing on April 14,1999.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">On April 13, 1999, the Department of Housing sent a letter to the petitioner granting his request for a hearing. The letter stated, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">\u201cPlease be advised that ... your request for an Administrative Hearing has been granted relative to the City Condemnation and order to raze the subject property. The Hearing has been scheduled for:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-7\">Date: April 26,1999</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABb\">Time: 10:30 a.m.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-8\">Location: 417 E. Fayette Street, Room \u2014 1301\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">The hearing took place as scheduled and was attended by the petitioner, his counsel, Mr. Burnett, and several officials from the Department of Housing. Mr. Dennis Taylor, who apparently had been designated by the Commissioner of Housing and Community Development as the \u201cBuilding Code Official,\u201d <em>see </em>n. 2, <em>supra, </em>presided over the proceeding. According to an affidavit of Mr. Murrell later filed in the Circuit Court, Mr. Burnett at the hearing discussed the findings in his architectural report. In addition, Mr. Murrell stated in his affidavit that, at the hearing, he</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-10\">\u201cadvised Mr. Taylor that the rear wall to the warehouse at 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue could be repaired within two weeks and that the remaining work on all the properties, including 562-566 Gold Street, could be repaired within sixty days. Mr. Taylor advised me that this plan was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>acceptable and that I should follow through and get the necessary construction permits.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">The only \u201crecord\u201d of the hearing is a single page of paper containing some handwritten notes. The notes recite that the petitioner intended to \u201crestore the properties] within 90 days,\u201d that he intended to \u201cencapsulate [the] lead paint,\u201d and, referring to the 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue property, that the \u201cwarehouse repairs will be made in two weeks.\u201d Nevertheless, Mr. Murrell stated in his affidavit, \u201c[a]fter the meeting that day, April 26, 1999, I attempted to obtain construction permits for the properties but was advised by Shawn Karimian, at the Department of Housing ... that he would not authorize their issuance and that no matter what I did, the properties would be demolished.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">On the same day as the hearing, the Commissioner of the Department of Housing, Mr. Daniel Henson, sent a letter to the petitioner stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-7\">\u201cThis letter will serve as formal notification to you of the results of the hearing and my concurrence with the decision reached by the Hearing Officer. The results and decision are as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-8\">1) The Hearing Panel determined by City records that you failed to repair and rehabilitate or raze your properties at the subject addresses which have severely deteriorated and constituted a threat to the public health and safety and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-9\">2) Proper procedures were followed to notify you of the City Condemnation and order to raze the subject properties and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-10\">3) Pursuant to 119.2 of Article 32 of the Baltimore City Building Code (as amended) the notice ordering you to raze the properties will remain in effect as issued and;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-11\">4) City demolition of the properties after your failure to do so will result in a lien being placed against them for the demolition work performed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>The record shows that this letter was returned \u201cunclaimed\u201d and was not received by the petitioner. In addition, although Commissioner Henson\u2019s letter refers to \u201cthe decision reached by the Hearing Officer,\u201d the record contains no such decision. Furthermore, the record contains nothing confirming that such a decision by the designated \u201cBuilding Code Official,\u201d who conducted the hearing, was ever made.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">On the following day, Commissioner Henson sent to the petitioner\u2019s counsel a letter stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-6\">\u201cI am in receipt of your letter ... which included a report by an architectural firm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-7\">\u201cAfter reviewing this report, I have determined that the condemnation notice will remain in effect based on the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-8\">1. The submitted report is not stamped by a licensed structural engineer; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-9\">2. according to the Baltimore City Building Code, a structure can be condemned for reasons other than its structural integrity.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-10\">On May 4, 1999, Mr. Karimian from the Department of Housing approved the Department\u2019s application to raze the three properties located at 562, 564, and 566 Gold Street. Several days later, the Department\u2019s application to raze the warehouse located at 2201-2203 Pennsylvania Avenue was also approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-11\">On May 21, 1999, the petitioner filed, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, an action to review the Department\u2019s decision. Named as defendant was \u201cThe Department of Housing and Community Development of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore.\u201d In an accompanying memorandum, the petitioner argued that the Department of Housing had failed to comply with the mandated procedures set forth in the Building Code. Additionally, the petitioner argued that the Department\u2019s actions violated Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights and Article III, \u00a7 40, of the Maryland Constitution. Following a hearing, the Circuit Court issued an order affirming the decision of the Department of Housing. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>Within seven days after the Circuit Court\u2019s decision, the petitioner filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment of the Circuit Court pursuant to Maryland Rule 2-584. While this motion was pending, the Department of Housing razed the properties and assessed the costs to the petitioner. The petitioner\u2019s motion was denied by the Circuit Court on June 1, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The petitioner then filed a timely notice of appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. The respondent filed a motion to dismiss for lack of appellate jurisdiction, asserting that Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, precluded an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, granted the motion to dismiss, agreeing that \u00a7 12-302(a) precluded the appeal. With regard to the petitioner\u2019s contention that the action in the Circuit Court was \u201cin the nature of a mandamus proceeding\u201d and that, therefore, an appeal was authorized by \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Judicial Proceedings Article, the Court of Special Appeals stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-5\">\u201cThe facts do not support appellants\u2019 claim that the review in circuit court was not a judicial review action, but actually a mandamus action....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-6\">\u201cIn this case, appellants sought judicial review of the decision of an administrative agency, [the Department of Housing], in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. In their petition for judicial review, appellants requested that the circuit court \u2018reverse the decision of the Department of Housing and Community Development.\u2019 At no time did appellants style their review in circuit court as a mandamus action or request relief appropriate to a mandamus action, such as ordering [the Department of Housing] to mail conforming notices to appellants or to conduct an administrative hearing following the appropriate procedures. Instead, appellants sought review of the administrative procedures employed and factual and legal issues decided. In all respects, the circuit court action was an ordinary statutory judicial review action.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-7\">The petitioner filed in this Court a petition for a writ of certiorari, arguing that the action in the Circuit Court was \u201cin substance a common law mandamus action\u201d and was appeal-able under the principles set forth in <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, </em>345 Md. 477, 485-500, 693 A.2d 757 (1997), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1053, 118 S.Ct. 702, 139 L.Ed.2d 645 (1998). The petitioner further argued that the respondent failed to comply with both statutory and constitutional requirements. The respondent, on the other hand, contended that the appeal was properly dismissed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court granted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>the certiorari petition, <em>Murrell v. Baltimore, </em>365 Md. 472, 781 A.2d 778 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">This is the most recent in a line of cases involving the application of Maryland Code (1974, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which, <em>inter alia, </em>creates an exception to the general appeals statute for statutory actions in the circuit courts seeking judicial review of adjudicatory administrative decisions.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The general appeals statute, which is \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, broadly authorizes appeals from final judgments in civil cases decided by the circuit courts. Section 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, however, provides that \u201c\u00a7 12-301 does not permit an appeal from a final judgment of a court entered ... in the exercise of appellate jurisdiction in reviewing the decision of ... an administrative agency----\u201d This Court in <em>Kant v. Montgomery County, </em>365 Md. 269, 274, 778 A.2d 384, 387 (2001), explained \u00a7 12-302(a) as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>\u201cAlthough \u00a7 12-302(a) refers to a circuit court exercising \u2018appellate jurisdiction\u2019 in reviewing the decision of an administrative agency or local legislative body, the word \u2018appellate\u2019 is a misnomer in this context. As we have often pointed out, a circuit court action reviewing the adjudicatory decision of an administrative agency or local legislative body is not an \u2018appeal.\u2019 Instead, it is an original action for judicial review. The above-quoted language in \u00a7 12-302(a), creating an exception to the general appeals statute, \u2018refers to an original circuit court action, authorized by statute, judicially reviewing an adjudicatory decision of an administrative agency or an adjudicatory decision of a local legislative body when it acts in a quasi-judicial capacity.\u2019 \u201d Quoting <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta, </em>358 Md. 166, 175, 747 A.2d 647, 652 (2000).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">Since \u00a7 12-301 does not authorize an appeal from a circuit court judgment in a statutory action for judicial review of an adjudicatory administrative decision, any right of appeal in such a case must be found in some other statute. Where no other statute authorizes an appeal in the type of case covered by \u00a7 12-302(a), the Court of Special Appeals is not authorized to entertain the appeal and must dismiss it. <em>See Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta, supra, </em>358 Md. at 180-183, 747 A.2d at 654-656.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">As the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined, \u00a7 123.7 of the Building Code limits judicial review of a decision of the Department of Housing to the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. It does not provide for an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. Furthermore, no other statute which has been called to our attention expressly provides for such an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-7\">Consequently, the critical question in this case is whether the suit is a statutory judicial review action encompassed by \u00a7 12-302(a) or whether the suit can legitimately be treated as a common law mandamus action. If it is the former, as held by the Court of Special Appeals, then the intermediate appellate court correctly dismissed the appeal. If it is the latter, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>argued for by the petitioner, then the Circuit Court\u2019s judgment was appealable under \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Although we have in some recent cases set forth the history of \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, <em>see </em>n. 6, <em>supra, </em>it would be useful to review again some of that history. The historical background of a statute often casts light on the meaning or scope of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The principle embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) began as a judicially created exception to the broad general appeals statute. The first Maryland case adopting the principle appears to be <em>Wilmington &amp; Susquehanna Railroad Company v. Condon, 8 </em>G. &amp; J. 443 (1837). That case involved an Act of the General Assembly authorizing the condemnation of property for a railroad, authorizing the sheriff to summon a jury to fix the value of the property condemned, and providing for judicial review in the County Court<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> of the decision by the sheriffs jury. An appeal to this Court was taken from the County Court\u2019s judgment affirming the jury\u2019s decision, but, in a brief one paragraph opinion, this Court held that the judgment was not appealable, reasoning as follows (8 G. &amp; J. at 448, emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-8\">\u201cFrom the nature and course of their proceedings, this power of review [of the decision by the sheriffs jury] is a fit subject for litigation in a County Court, but <em>it is wholly inappropriate to the jurisdiction of this Court. </em>It is a special limited jurisdiction given to the County Court, from the decision of which no appeal lies to any other tribunal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH7\">While the Court in <em>Condon </em>pointed out that the statute authorizing judicial review of the sheriffs jury\u2019s decision did not expressly provide for an appeal to the Court of Appeals, the <em>Condon </em>opinion did not discuss or even cite the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>appeals statute in effect at the time, the broad language of which would appear to authorize an appeal to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The next case to dismiss an appeal under the principle announced in <em>Condon </em>appears to have been <em>Savage Manufacturing Co. v. Owings, </em>3 Gill 497 (1846). In that case, an enactment of the General Assembly provided for a proceeding before a Commission if individuals petitioned for the opening of a public road, and the statute further provided for \u201cconfirmation\u201d proceedings before a County Court. In the <em>Savage </em>case, the Commission ordered a public road to be opened, and the court confirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. An appeal to this Court was dismissed, with the Court stating (3 Gill at 498):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">\u201cJurisdiction of this proceeding is not exercised by the County Court, in virtue of its general powers, as a Court of common law; it is vested by a special delegation of power and by the terms of the Act which confers it, to be exercised, not according to the forms and course of the common law, but in a special and peculiar mode.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">The Court went on to hold that neither a writ of error nor an appeal will lie \u201cto a Court vested with special jurisdiction, and which does not proceed according to the forms of the common law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-8\">In <em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, supra, </em>345 Md. at 487-488, 693 A.2d at 762, we summarized the applications of the <em>Condon </em>and <em>Savage </em>rule as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-9\">This rule of construction was subsequently applied by this Court in a variety of contexts, including judgments of county courts or circuit courts reviewing decisions by justices of the peace, <em>Herzberg v. Adams, </em>39 Md. 309, 312 (1874); <em>Hough v. Kelsey &amp; Gray, </em>19 Md. 451, 455-456 (1863); <em>State v. Mister, </em>5 Md. 11, 15 (1853); <em>Crockett v.

State, Use of Boyd, </em>223 Md. 456, 460-461, 165 A.2d 464, 466 (1960); <em>Johnson v. Board of Zoning Appeals, </em>196 Md. 400, 406-407, 76 A.2d 736, 738 (1950).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">We went on in the <em>Gisriel </em>opinion to point out that, in more recent times, the rule has been most frequently applied to preclude appeals in statutory actions for judicial review of administrative adjudicatory decisions (345 Md. at 488, 693 A.2d at 762-763):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b224-6\">\u201cThe rule precluding, under the general appeals statute, appeals from circuit court judgments in cases of special limited statutory jurisdiction, persisted despite several recodifications of the general appeals statutes by the Legislature containing no mention of the rule. Furthermore, in later years, the rule was frequently applied to limit appeals from circuit court judgments reviewing decisions of administrative agencies. <em>See, e.g., Prince George\u2019s Co. v. AFSCME Council 67, </em>289 Md. 388, 397-400, 406, 424 A.2d 770, 774-776, 779 (1981); <em>Urbana Civic v. Urbana Mobile, </em>260 Md. 458, 461, 272 A.2d 628, 630 (1971) (\u2018 \u201cThe rule is that where an inferior court exercises a special limited jurisdiction which is conferred by statute, no appeal from its decision in such cases lies to this [C]ourt unless expressly given by the statute\u201d \u2019); <em>Md. Pharmacy Board v. Peco, Inc., </em>234 Md. 200, 202, 198 A.2d 273, 274 (1964) (\u2018the provisions of [the general appeal statute] do not apply to cases where the trial court exercises a special or limited jurisdiction conferred by statute\u2019); <em>Hart v. Commr. of Motor Vehicles, </em>226 Md. 584, 587, 174 A.2d 725, 726 (1961); <em>Simpler v. State, Use of Boyd, supra, </em>223 Md. at 460-461, 165 A.2d at 466; <em>Bd. of Med. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>Examiners v.

Administrative Hearing Board, </em>33 Md.App. 681, 685-686, 366 A.2d 756, 759 (1976), <em>cert. denied, </em>280 Md. 727 (1977); <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Fahey, </em>28 Md.App. 312, 315-316, 345 A.2d 102, 104-105 (1975).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">Finally, we pointed out in <em>Gisriel </em>that the General Assembly in 1973 abolished most applications of the rule, but for the first time, embodied the rule in a statute with regard to judicial review actions of adjudicatory administrative decisions and adjudicatory local government decisions. We further pointed out that the practical impact of the rule is almost entirely with regard to adjudicatory decisions by local government administrative agencies and governmental bodies (345 Md. at 488-490, 693 A.2d at 763, footnotes omitted):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-6\">\u201cIn 1973, the General Assembly recodified the appeals statutes in its enactment of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article of the Code, which became effective on January 1, 1974. With its enactment of \u00a7 12-301, the Legislature retained the broad, general grant of the right to appeal. In addition, \u00a7 12-301 partially abrogated the above-discussed rule by expressly stating that the right of appeal existed \u2018from a final judgment by a court in the exercise of original, special, limited, statutory jurisdiction\u2019 unless expressly denied by law. Thus the Legislature abolished a large part of the doctrine disallowing appeals from circuit court judgments entered pursuant to the exercise of special limited statutory jurisdiction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b225-7\">\u201cThe Legislature, however, expressly retained a portion of the doctrine by its enactment of \u00a7 12-302(a), which makes \u00a7 12-301 inapplicable to appeals from final judgments of circuit courts reviewing decisions of the District Court, administrative agencies, or local legislative bodies. Nevertheless, judgments of the circuit courts reviewing decisions of the District Court are generally subject to further discretionary appellate review by petitions for writs of certiorari filed in the Court of Appeals. <em>See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 12-305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>and 12-307(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Moreover, appeals to the Court of Special Appeals from judgments of the circuit courts reviewing decisions of most <em>state </em>administrative agencies are generally authorized by the Maryland Administrative Procedure Act, Code (1984, 1995 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-223(b) of the State Government Article. Consequently, the viability of the non-appealability principle adopted in ... <em>Condon, supra, </em>8 G. &amp; J. at 448-449, and partially embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, is today largely limited to circuit court judgments in cases involving statutory judicial review of adjudicatory or quasi-judicial decisions by <em>local </em>government administrative agencies and legislative bodies.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9l\">Because the impact of \u00a7 12-302(a) is chiefly upon actions for judicial review of local government adjudicatory administrative decisions, the right to appeal a circuit court\u2019s decision in these judicial review actions is primarily dependent upon local laws. Some subdivisions, such as Montgomery County, broadly authorize appeals to the Court of Special Appeals from circuit court judgments reviewing local administrative adjudicatory decisions. Other subdivisions, such as Prince George\u2019s County, do not broadly authorize such appeals. Thus, the right to an appeal in a large group of cases is dependent upon a person\u2019s geographical situation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>c.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">As shown by the historical background reviewed above, the rule that is now reflected in \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article was based upon this Court\u2019s nineteenth century aversion to entertaining statutory causes of action which were not in accord with \u201cthe forms and course of the common law,\u201d <em>Savage, </em>3 Gill at 498. While \u201ca fit subject for litigation in a County Court,\u201d such statutory causes of action were deemed \u201cwholly inappropriate to the jurisdiction of this Court.\u201d <em>Condon, </em>8 G. &amp; J. at 448. <em>See also Williams v. Williams, </em>5 Gill 88, 90 (1847) (\u201cThis is no case, either of law, or of equity. There can be no right of appeal in such a case as this\u201d); <em>Crockett v. Parke, </em>7 Gill 237, 240 (1848) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>(reaffirming <em>Condon </em>and <em>Savage, </em>and refusing to accord a \u201cliteral construction to the [general appeals] Act of 1785\u201d); <em>Hamilton v. Annapolis and Elk Ridge Rail Road Company, </em>1 Md. 553, 567 (1852) (\u201cthe county court ... [had] final jurisdiction\u201d as the \u201ccounty court was the proper place\u201d for such statutory jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">Consequently, we have applied \u00a7 12-302(a) in light of its historical background. Thus, we have not applied it to preclude appeals in actions, however styled or captioned, which are essentially common law mandamus actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\"><em>Gisriel v. Ocean City Elections Board, supra, </em>345 Md. 477, 693 A.2d 757, was a circuit court action challenging a decision by the Ocean City Board of Supervisors of Elections, affirmed by the City Council of Ocean City, refusing to place a recent zoning ordinance on the ballot for the next election. The refusal was based on the Board\u2019s and Council\u2019s determination that the referendum petition did not contain the signatures of 20% of the City\u2019s \u201cqualified voters\u201d as required by the Ocean City Charter. This determination was in turn based on the Board\u2019s and Council\u2019s refusal to strike from the list of registered voters certain names of persons who, according to the plaintiff, were not \u201cqualified voters.\u201d If the names of these persons had been stricken from the registration list, as argued for by the plaintiff, the number of signatures on the referendum petition would have met the 20% requirement. The plaintiff Gisriel purported to bring his circuit court action pursuant to a provision of the Ocean City Charter authorizing appeals from decisions of the Board of Elections to the City Council, and further authorizing judicial review in the circuit court of decisions by the City Council on such appeals. The provision did not, however, authorize an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from the circuit court\u2019s decision. The circuit court in the <em>Gisriel </em>case agreed with the plaintiffs position; the court ordered the Board to remove from the voter registration list the names of those persons whom the plaintiff contended were not \u201cqualified voters\u201d before determining whether the referendum petition contained the requisite number of signatures. The Court of Special Appeals entertained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>the appeal and reversed, on the merits, the circuit court\u2019s decision. This Court held that the Court of Special Appeals had jurisdiction over the appeal and affirmed the judgment of the intermediate appellate court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">In holding that \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article did not bar the appeal in <em>Gisriel, </em>this Court initially pointed out that \u00a7 12-302(a) is applicable \u201cwhen a circuit court proceeding <em>in substance </em>constitutes <em>ordinary judicial review </em>of an adjudicatory decision by an administrative agency or local legislative body, pursuant to a statute, ordinance, or charter provision,\u201d 345 Md. at 496, 693 A.2d at 766-767, emphasis added. We next explained in <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 496-497, 693 A.2d at 767, that the manner in which a plaintiff styled the action, and the plaintiffs reliance upon a statutory judicial review provision, did not determine \u201cthe nature of his action\u201d or whether it was \u201ca statutory judicial review action unknown to the common law at the time when the principle embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) was first adopted by this Court in ... <em>Condon ... </em>and Savage.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">The Court went on to hold that \u201cGisriel\u2019s action in substance was a traditional common law mandamus action\u201d which was appealable under \u00a7 12-301 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. 345 Md. at 497, 693 A.2d at 767. We stated that the purpose of a traditional common law mandamus action is \u201cto compel ... public officials or administrative agencies to perform their function, or perform some particular [non-discretionary] duty imposed upon them,\u201d <em>ibid., </em>quoting <em>Goodwill v. Nolan, </em>343 Md. 130, 145-148, 680 A.2d 1040, 1047-1049 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted). We pointed out that the theory of the plaintiff Gisriel\u2019s action was \u201cthat the Board had a non-discretionary duty to delete from the Ocean City registered voter list the names of unqualified voters before determining the percentage of voters who had signed the petition,\u201d that \u201c[a]ny issues requiring the resolution of disputed facts would not arise until the Board begins to perform this duty,\u201d and that the case did not at that time involve \u201cthe substantiality of the evidence supporting factual findings, the reasonableness of inferences and conclusions, etc. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>[that] would constitute a judicial review action authorized by ... the Ocean City Charter.\u201d 345 Md. at 497-498, 693 A.2d at 767-768.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">The Court concluded in <em>Gisriel, </em>345 Md. at 499-500, 693 A.2d at 768, that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-6\">\u201cwhether sound or not, the non-appealability principle [of \u00a7 12-302(a)] was based entirely on the conclusion that the trial court was exercising a statutory type of jurisdiction unknown to the common law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-7\">\u201cConsequently, the principle embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) has no application to common law actions. Both before and after the enactment of \u00a7 12-302(a), this Court has regularly exercised appellate jurisdiction in mandamus actions against administrative agencies and officials.\u201d <em>See, e.g., Goodwich v. Nolan, supra, </em>343 Md. 130, 680 A.2d 1040; <em>Board v. Secretary of Personnel, supra, </em>317 Md. at 45-49, 562 A.2d at 705-707; <em>Tabler v. Medical Mut. Liab.

Beretta, supra, </em>358 Md. 166, 747 A.2d 647, further explained the distinction between a statutory judicial review action covered by \u00a7 12-302(a), and a common law action appealable under \u00a7 12-301. <em>Beretta </em>was clearly a statutory judicial review action, involving an employee\u2019s claim of discrimination in violation of local law, an administrative hearing at which evidence was introduced and transcribed, administrative findings of fact and conclusions of law, and judicial review pursuant to a local ordinance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>The plaintiff-employer in the circuit court argued that the administrative agency\u2019s \u201cfinding of retaliation discrimination was not supported by substantial evidence,\u201d that the employee \u201chad failed to introduce sufficient evidence in support of the award of back pay,\u201d that the \u201caward of damages for humiliation and embarrassment was unsupported by substantial evidence,\u201d that procedural errors were committed by the agency, and that other legal errors occurred. <em>Beretta, </em>358 Md. at 171, 747 A.2d at 649. The Court of Special Appeals held that an appeal as to some issues was barred by \u00a7 12-302(a), but that the circuit court\u2019s decision as to other issues was appealable because the latter issues could have been raised in a common law mandamus action or a declaratory judgment action.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">In holding that the circuit court\u2019s judgment was not appeal-able at all, this Court stated <em>(Beretta, </em>358 Md. at 177, 747 A.2d at 653):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201cSection 12-302(a) does not relate to what issues may be considered on appeal and what issues may not be considered. Rather, the language of the statute, and the case law on which the statute was based, preclude any appeal to the Court of Special Appeals in a particular type of case.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ANr\">We later pointed out that \u201c[tjhere is also no exception to the non-appealability doctrine embodied in \u00a7 12-302(a) for issues which could have been litigated in some alternative judicial proceeding.\u201d 358 Md. at 182, 747 A.2d at 656. We concluded that the non-appealability rule of \u00a7 12-302(a) depended upon the overall \u201csubstance\u201d of the circuit court action. The issue is whether the action, as a whole, \u201cshould in substance be viewed as a ... mandamus action\u201d or whether it more resembles \u201ca typical statutory judicial review action.\u201d 358 Md. at 183, 747 A.2d at 656.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>D.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The present case, in substance, is like <em>Gisriel </em>and not <em>Beretta. </em>The gist of the petitioner\u2019s complaints, at this stage, is a failure of the Department of Housing to perform several non-discretionary mandatory duties under the Baltimore City Code and principles of Maryland administrative law. The complaints concern the failure to give required notices, failure to render findings of fact and conclusions of law after the hearing, the failure of the designated \u201cBuilding Code Official\u201d who presided at the hearing to render the decision, and the failure to make an adequate \u201crecord\u201d of the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">There could be no issue at this stage of the ease as to whether the administrative findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence because, in a real sense, there were no such findings of fact. There was also no record of the evidence introduced at the hearing in order for a reviewing court to determine whether findings of fact, if they had been made, were supported by substantial evidence. There were no real conclusions of law for a reviewing court to determine if errors of law had been made. Finally, there was no proper final administrative decision to be judicially reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">To reiterate, all of these asserted failures were of a non-discretionary type. They were ministerial procedural duties which were mandated by the Baltimore City Code and principles of Maryland administrative law. The petitioner correctly argues that the substance of the circuit court action was a common law mandamus action. <em>See also Maryland Transportation Authority v. King, </em>369 Md. 274, 287, 799 A.2d 1246, 1253 (2002) (\u201cmandamus or other traditional actions may lie to enforce administrative compliance with procedural requirements or duties\u201d). Accordingly, the decision by the Circuit Court for Baltimore City was appealable to the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Special Appeals under \u00a7 12-801 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">The petitioner has also demonstrated that the Department\u2019s failure to comply with mandatory procedural duties requires that the Department\u2019s decision be reversed and that the case be remanded to the Department for further administrative proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">The facts of the case, reviewed in Part II of this opinion, clearly show that some required notices were not given, although the record is not sufficient for a judicial determination of whether the petitioner was prejudiced by the notice deficiencies. <em>Cf. Pollock v. Patuxent Institution Board of Review, </em>374 Md. 463, 823 A.2d 626 (2003); <em>Maryland Transportation Authority v. King, supra, </em>369 Md. at 286, 799 A.2d at 1252-1253.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">In addition, \u00a7 123.6 of the Baltimore City Code requires that the \u201cBuilding Code Official,\u201d who may be either the Commissioner of Housing or his duly authorized representative, preside at the hearing and render the written decision. The statute clearly contemplates that the same person who presided at the hearing also render the written decision. The record shows that this was not done in the present case. Moreover, this may well be the type of structural error whereby prejudice is presumed. The obvious purpose of the requirement is to have the person who heard the witnesses, read the documentary evidence, and listened to the arguments, render a written decision. The petitioner was denied a written decision by the person who did hear the testimony, read the documentary evidence, and heard the arguments. Such denial is presumptively prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Most significantly, the Baltimore City Building Code requires that the hearing officer\u2019s decision contain \u201cthe reasons for the decision.\u201d This is in accord with the general requirement of Maryland administrative law that, following an adjudicatory hearing, there must be adequate findings of fact and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>conclusions of law. In <em>Harford County v. Earl E. Preston, Jr., Inc., </em>322 Md. 493, 505, 588 A.2d 772, 778 (1991), Judge Karwacki for the Court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b234-5\">\u201cThis requirement is in recognition of the fundamental right of a party to a proceeding before an administrative agency to be apprised of the facts relied upon by the agency in reaching its decision and to permit meaningful judicial review of those findings.

Parker, </em>369 Md. 689, 718, 802 A.2d 1029, 1046 (2002) (\u201cfindings of fact by an administrative agency \u2018must be meaningful and cannot simply repeat statutory criteria, broad conclusory statements, or boilerplate resolutions\u2019 \u201d); <em>Bucktail, LLC v.

The written administrative decision in the case at bar was virtually devoid of any meaningful findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">Finally, \u00a7 123.6.7 of the Baltimore City Building Code requires a \u201ccomplete record\u201d of all documentary evidence introduced at the hearing. Moreover, substantial evidence judicial review obviously requires a transcript or some other record of the testimony at an adjudicatory hearing. <em>Cf </em>Code (1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>1999 Repl.Vol.), \u00a7 10-215 of the State Government Article (\u201cAll or part of a proceeding in a contested case shall be transcribed ... \u201d).

In this case, the governmental action did not comply with such procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED, AND CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT WITH FURTHER DIRECTIONS TO REVERSE THE DECISION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND REMAND THE CASE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY THE RESPONDENT.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">Dissenting opinion by WILNER, J., in which HARRELL, J., joins.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">With respect, I dissent. I agree with most of the Court\u2019s Opinion. Indeed, my disagreement is principally limited to the conclusion reached in Part III \u2014 D, that this action is in the nature of a mandamus action. There is no basis, in my view, for such a conclusion. Apart from the fact that it is flatly inconsistent with <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta, </em>358 Md. 166, 747 A.2d 647 (2000), the fact is that this action was not filed as an action for mandamus. It was filed, by experienced counsel, as an action for judicial review pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>\u00a7 128.7 of the Baltimore City Building Code.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was treated throughout as an action for judicial review. Only when petitioner lost in the Circuit Court and realized that, because of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-302, no appeal was permissible did this suddenly become an action for mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">In order to save petitioner from the clear legal effect of the form of action he quite properly chose to pursue, the court now concludes that the action was <em>not </em>what petitioner said it was and not what the Circuit Court and the Court of Special Appeals correctly regarded it as being, but something else. The effect of treating this action as one for mandamus is to render nugatory that part of Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 12-302, disallowing appeals from judgments of a Circuit Court rendered in judicial review actions, absent some other statutory basis for an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">The underlying complaint here, which appears to be well-founded, is that the Baltimore City Department of Housing and Community Development failed to comply with certain procedures that governed the administrative process \u2014 it failed to give proper notice, it failed to make and keep a proper record of the proceeding, it failed to make proper findings of fact and conclusions of law. Those claims are cognizable in the traditional judicial review action that petitioner filed in this case. Indeed, those are the kind of claims often made in actions for judicial review. To make those failures, fully correctable in a judicial review action, subject to the extraordinary writ of mandamus, on the theory that an agency has no discretion to violate those kinds of requirements, is to stretch the reach of mandamus far beyond what it ever was intended to be and, at the same time, render unnecessary statutory judicial review actions. Why file an action for judicial review, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>especially if there is no appeal from the ruling of the Circuit Court, when one can get precisely the same review and relief, with an appeal, in a mandamus action?</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">The use of a mandamus action to review administrative decisions was always intended to be limited, especially when statutory judicial review exists. Prior to the enactment of general statutes allowing judicial review of administrative agency decisions, mandamus was necessary to preserve the authority of the courts to protect against arbitrary and capricious governmental action. In <em>Heaps v. Cobb, </em>185 Md. 372, 379, 45 A.2d 73, 76 (1945), we pointed out that administrative agencies were not clothed with judicial authority and that the Legislature was \u201cwithout authority to divest the judicial branch of the government of its inherent power to review actions of administrative boards shown to be arbitrary, illegal or capricious, and to impair personal or property rights ...\u201d <em>Id. See also Hecht v. Crook, </em>184 Md. 271, 40 A.2d 673 (1945).</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">That principle still applies, but once statutory judicial review actions became widely authorized and available to correct both substantive and procedural errors committed by administrative agencies, mandamus actions became largely unnecessary. There was no need to resort to what had always been regarded as an extraordinary writ in order to provide judicial review. Virtually every legally cognizable complaint made about an administrative proceeding is subject to review in a traditional statutory judicial review action, and certainly every complaint made by petitioner in this case was subject to review in the statutory judicial review action that he filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">The only reason the Court insists on ramming this action into the mandamus mold is that the Mayor and City Council have omitted to provide for an appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court and, under \u00a7 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, that omission precludes such an appeal in a statutory judicial review action. There is no inherent right of appeal, however. We have often made clear that the right of appeal is statutory and that, subject only to limited supervening Constitutional mandates, which do not exist here, there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>is no right of appeal absent some statutory authority. <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 785 A.2d 1275 (2001); <em>Pack Shack, Inc. v. Howard County, </em>371 Md. 243, 808 A.2d 795 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">The Court, in retrospect, may not like the policy decision made by the Legislature, but the fact is that the Legislature, consistent with the then-current view of this Court, made a conscious choice to stop judicial review of administrative decisions at the Circuit Court level unless it, or some authorized local legislative body, expressly provided otherwise. The General Assembly has, for the most part, provided otherwise, through the Administrative Procedure Act and other statutes dealing with specific kinds of administrative proceedings not subject to the APA. Local legislative bodies have provided for appeals from the Circuit Court in some instances, but not in others. If there is some perceived deficiency, it is easily correctable by legislation. It should not be corrected by this Court\u2019s creative, but unwarranted, stretching of the common law mandamus action. Perhaps this is a hard case, in the sense that the Circuit Court made a mistake, but we should not allow that to make bad law, which is precisely what the Court is doing.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">I would affirm the order of the Court of Special Appeals dismissing the appeal.

The County Courts were the predecessors of the present Circuit Courts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b226-5\">. Thus, if a person in Montgomery County is discriminated against in violation of local law, he or she is entitled to institute an adjudicatory administrative action, to bring a circuit court suit for judicial review of an adverse final administrative decision, to appeal an adverse circuit court decision to the Court of Special Appeals, and to request that this Court issue a writ of certiorari to review the matter. A similarly situated person in Prince George\u2019s County who is discriminated against in violation of local law has the same type of remedies until the decision of the circuit court. The person in Prince George\u2019s County, however, is not entitled to appeal to the Court of Special Appeals or to request that this Court issue a writ of certiorari. <em>Compare Kant v. Montgomery County, supra, </em>365 Md. 269, 778 A.2d 384, with <em>Prince George\u2019s County v. Beretta, supra, </em>358 Md. 166, 747 A.2d 647.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">Consequently, as a result of \u00a7 12-302(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the availability of a remedy in Maryland\u2019s statewide intermediate appellate court and in its supreme court, for identi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>cal causes of action, by persons who are otherwise identically situated, is entirely dependent upon where in Maryland the persons are located.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">No prior case in this Court, to the best of our knowledge, has involved an equal protection challenge to the above-described operation of \u00a7 12-302(a), based upon the equal protection component of Article 24 of the Maryland Declaration of Rights. In this connection, <em>compare, Frankel v. Board of Regents, </em>361 Md. 298, 312-318, 761 A.2d 324, 331\u2014 334 (2000); <em>Verzi v.

Nevertheless, the petitioner at the present time does not appear to make an equal protection argument with regard to \u00a7 12-302(a). Regardless of the nature of the constitutional arguments which are made, however, we need not at this time decide any constitutional issues because of our resolution of this case on grounds of statutory interpretation and application. \"[T]his Court adheres to the established principle that a court will not decide a constitutional issue when a case can properly be disposed of on a non-constitutional ground.\u201d <em>Jordan v. Hebbville, </em>369 Md. 439, 461 n. 20, 800 A.2d 768, 781 n. 20 (2002), quoting earlier cases with internal quotation marks omitted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\">. We readily acknowledge that the test set forth in <em>Gisriel </em>and <em>Beretta, </em>for determining whether \u00a7 12-302(a) bars an appeal, may be difficult to apply in many cases and is quite unsatisfactory. This results from the flawed basis for the doctrine set forth in the early cases. Both in the nineteenth century, and today, court actions to review determinations by government officials and agencies presented, and still present, issues which common law courts have traditionally decided as well as non<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>traditional statutory issues. Making appealability, under a broad general appeals statute, depend upon what an appellate court in 1837 wanted to hear, is somewhat absurd. If the judge-made principle had not been embodied in a statute in 1973, this Court could abrogate it as an unsound example of nineteenth century judicial activism.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b236-7\">.
