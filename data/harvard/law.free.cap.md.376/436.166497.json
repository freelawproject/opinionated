State, </em>320 Md. 605, 579 A.2d 265 (1990), this Court considered, in the context of a prosecution for welfare perjury, the appropriate limitations period for misdemeanor prosecutions, and, in particular, those involving \u201cpenitentiary misdemeanors.\u201d When that case was decided, the general statute of limitations for misdemeanors was contained in Md.Code (1974, 1989 RepLVol.), \u00a7 5-106 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Pursuant to that section, except <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>as it otherwise provided, \u201ca prosecution for a misdemeanor not made punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute shall be instituted within one year after the offense was committed.\u201d Therefore, the statute of limitations for a misdemeanor was one year, unless another period of limitations was specifically provided or the misdemeanor was \u201cmade punishable by confinement in the penitentiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 579 A.2d at 268.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As this Court put it, \u201c[misdemeanors punished by confinement in the penitentiary are excluded from the [one year limitation] provisions of this section of the statute, and are placed along with felonies.\u201d <em>Id., </em>(quoting <em>Schaumloeffel v. State, </em>102 Md. 470, 472, 62 A. 803, 804 (1906) and citing <em>Archer v. State, </em>145 Md. 128, 137-138, 125 A. 744, 747 (1924) (noting that these misdemeanors are \u201cclass[ed] ... with felonies\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Moreover, the Court noted that it was the fact that imprisonment in the penitentiary was statutorily authorized, rather than the sentence actually imposed, that determined whether limitations was unlimited or one year. <em>Id. </em>at 611-12, 579 A.2d at 268, (citing, <em>inter alia, Archer, </em>145 Md. at 136, 138, 125 A. at 747-748).</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">Pursuant to (1957, 1985 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.), Art. 88 A, \u00a7 62(a), welfare perjury was defined by reference to the offense of perjury, and a person committing the offense, \u201cupon conviction therefor is subject to the penalties provided by law for perjury.\u201d Md.Code (1957, 1987 ReplVol.) Article 27, \u00a7 439 prescribed, as the penalty for perjury, \u201cimprisonment in the jail or penitentiary for not more than ten years.\u201d Consequently, the Court of Special Appeals, to which the State appealed the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the welfare perjury charge against Massey, concluded that welfare perjury was a penitentiary misdemeanor and, for that reason, excluded from the one year limitation for misdemeanors generally. <em>Massey, </em>320 Md. at 609, 579 A.2d at 267. And because there was not otherwise provided in \u00a7 5-106 a specified period of limitations applicable to that offense, a prosecution for welfare perjury was not subject to any limitations period. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">We granted Massey\u2019s petition for writ of certiorari challenging the propriety of an unlimited period of limitations for welfare perjury when allegedly greater offenses arising out of the same acts were subject to a specified, and therefore shorter, limitations period. We added two questions, one of which addressed the meaning of the phrase, \u201cnot made punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute\u201d in light of Article 27, \u00a7 690, governing the sentencing and confinement of persons convicted of crime. <em>Id. </em>at 609-10, 579 A.2d at 267. As enacted by Ch. 556 of the Acts of 1916, Article 27, \u00a7 654, the predecessor of \u00a7 690, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-7\">\u201cWhen any person is convicted, before any Circuit Court of any County, or the Criminal Court of Baltimore, of any crime ... punishable by any imprisonment whatsoever ... said Court may, in its discretion, sentence such person to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>imprisonment in jail or in the Maryland House of Correction or in the Maryland Penitentiary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">\u201cIt is expressly provided, however, that nothing in this Section shall be construed to add to, alter or change the class of crimes, as they existed before this Act takes effect, with respect to the right of challenge or with respect to the fees in criminal cases, or to make any crime infamous, by reason of any sentence to the Maryland Penitentiary, or transfer thereto, which would not have been an infamous crime before this Act takes effect....\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">We explained that the first paragraph gave trial judges discretion in the sentencing of a defendant convicted of a crime for which imprisonment was an option, to specify the institution in which the defendant would be confined, thus, permitting a defendant convicted of a crime for which the statute specified confinement in the penitentiary, to be sentenced to imprisonment elsewhere. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 579 A.2d at 268.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">The second paragraph, the Court pointed out, indicated that the sentencing flexibility given the judges \u201cshould not affect the classification of crimes based upon the statutorily prescribed place of confinement,\u201d <em>id., </em>and \u201cwas largely the reason for this Court\u2019s holding in <em>Archer v. State, supra, </em>145 Md. at 137, 125 A. at 747. In that case, the Court held that the 1916 statute was not intended to change the operation of Art. 57, \u00a7 11 [the predecessor of \u00a7 5 \u2014 106(a)], concerning the periods of limitations for misdemeanor prosecutions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Specifically, the Court said (145 Md. at 137-38, 125 A. at 747):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-8\">\u201cThere is certainly nothing in either the titles or the bodies of the Acts of 1916 and 1918 to indicate that in passing those Acts the Legislature meant to practically repeal section 11 of article 57 of the Code, which would be the result of the construction contended for by the State. On the contrary, it is perfectly obvious that its purpose was to create a new agency to deal with the State\u2019s penal institutions, and to provide for the convenient shifting of convicts from one to the other without regard to the grade of the crime.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-9\">\u201cSection 654 expressly provides</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>\u2018that nothing in this section shall be construed to add to, alter or change the <em>class </em>of crimes as they existed before this act takes effect, with respect to the right of challenge or with respect to the fees in criminal cases, or to make any crime infamous by reason of any sentence to the Maryland Penitentiary, or transfer thereto, which would not have been an infamous crime before the act takes effect.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">\u201cThe words, \u2018and punishable by any imprisonment whatsoever or by fine and imprisonment (other than imprisonment in default of fine)\u2019 show that it was not intended to change the grade of any crime, but to leave that as it was already fixed by existing law or might be fixed by future legislation. \u201cArticle 57, section 11, in excepting from the amnesty given after one year to ordinary misdemeanors those punished by confinement in the penitentiary, clearly meant to <em>class </em>these with felonies; and in <em>Schaumloeffel v. State, </em>102 Md. 470, 62 A. 803, that intention was recognized. But the provisions of section 654 of article 27 expressly negative the idea that <em>that </em>section was intended to \u2018place along with felonies\u2019 misdemeanors not so classed by the then existing law or by subsequent legislation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Although there were amendments to \u00a7 654 over the years, and the section was renumbered \u00a7 690, the changes were rather minor and, in any event, the second paragraph remained unchanged. 320 Md. at 613, 579 A.2d at 269. A constant was \u201cthe concept of sentences to and confinement in specific state institutions. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">Major changes in \u00a7 690 occurred in 1967 with the passage of Ch. 695 of the Acts of 1967. <em>Id. </em>Section (b) of new \u00a7 690 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-8\">\u201c(b) Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Article or any other law to the contrary, on and after June 1, 1967, judges, in the sentencing of convicted persons (a) for any offense for which the provisions of this Article or any other law requires the imprisonment to be served at any one of those institutions enumerated in Section 689 of this Article <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>or (b) any offense for which prior to June 1, 1967, the sentence was made for whatever reason to one of those institutions in Section 689, shall in all such cases sentence such persons to the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction. All such persons shall be committed to the custody of the Commissioner of Correction and delivered to him for imprisonment. Thereafter all such persons shall be held, confined in, assigned to or transferred to such of the institutions and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department as the Department from time to time may order. \u201cAny person sentenced prior to June 1, 1967 to any one of the institutions and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department may, after such date, and not withstanding such sentence, be held, confined in, assigned to or transferred to such of these institutions and facilities as the Department may from time to time order.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">In addition to limiting the length of sentences permitted to be made to the Department of Correction, the legislation amended sections of Article 27 relating to the Department of Correction by deleting references to the various state institutions and replacing them with \u201cJurisdiction of the Department of Correction,\u201d \u201cDepartment of Correction,\u201d etc. <em>Id </em>at 614-15, 579 A.2d at 269-70. Having repealed the second paragraph of former \u00a7 690, no similar language was included in the new section. <em>Id. </em>\u201c[P]erhaps the most significant change,\u201d <em>id., </em>was the enactment of new \u00a7 690(d), employing a commonly used drafting device to amend every statutory provision relating to the sentencing and confinement options. <em>Id. </em>at 615, 579 A.2d at 270. Pursuant to that section,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-6\">\u201cWhenever in this Article or any other law reference is made to the sentencing or confinement of prisoners to any of the institutions enumerated in Section 689, such reference shall after June 1, 1967, be construed to mean sentencing or confinement to the jurisdiction of the Department rather than to any particular institution or facility of the Department.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">The Court described the effect of the legislation as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>\u201cCh. 695 repealed old Art. 27, \u00a7 690, and enacted an entirely new Art. 27, \u00a7 690. The new statute largely removed from judges a role in deciding where a person sentenced to imprisonment should be confined. Moreover, in place of the concept of a sentence to a particular state institution, or a confinement in a particular state institution, the new statute substituted the concepts of sentence to and confinement under \u2018the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction\u2019 or \u2018the custody of the Commissioner of Correction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 614, 579 A.2d at 269. Also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">\u201cThe conclusion is inescapable that Ch. 695 of the Acts of 1967 effected a substantial change with respect to the appropriate period of limitations for misdemeanor prosecutions. As previously discussed, under former Art. 57, \u00a7 11, and present \u00a7 5-106(a) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, a misdemeanor is subject to a one year limitations period unless it is \u2018punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute.\u2019 After Ch. 695 of the Acts of 1967 became effective on June 1, 1967, no misdemeanors were \u2018punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute.\u2019 Although persons could and still can be confined in the penitentiary as a matter of fact, the sentence and confinement \u2018by statute\u2019 was to the \u2018jurisdiction of the Department of Correction\u2019 after June 1, 1967. This was the thrust of Ch. 695 as a whole. More importantly, new Art. 27, \u00a7 690(d), now \u00a7 690(e), had the effect of amending every statute referring \u2018to the sentencing ... of prisoners to\u2019 the penitentiary and substituting for \u2018the penitentiary\u2019 the words \u2018jurisdiction of the Department of Correction.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b480-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 617, 579 A.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">The State argued that the limitations statute and \u00a7 690 serve different and distinct functions, the former dealing with the time for initiating a prosecution and the latter with sentencing and confinement. We rejected that argument, noting their significant interrelationship in one respect:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>\u201cThe operation of the exception to the one year period of limitations for misdemeanor prosecutions, contained in \u00a7 5-106(a), is entirely dependent upon the sentencing provisions in criminal statutes. There is no statute, and never has been one, classifying offenses as \u2018penitentiary misdemeanors\u2019 for limitations purposes, which is independent of the statutory sentencing provisions associated with particular offenses.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 618, 579 A.2d at 271.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">The Court held that welfare perjury, like perjury, also a misdemeanor, has no specific limitations period and, therefore, is subject to the one year period of limitations prescribed by \u00a7 5-106. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 579 A.2d at 273. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-7\">\u201cThe statutory provision concerning perjury, as presently set forth in Art. 27, \u00a7 439, of the 1957 edition of the Annotated Code of Maryland, literally reads that one convicted of perjury is subject \u2018to imprisonment in the ... penitentiary for not more than ten years.\u2019 If that codified provision had literally read that one convicted of perjury is subject \u2018to imprisonment ... under the jurisdiction of the Division of Correction for not more than ten years,\u2019 this case would likely not be here. It is doubtful that the State would have appealed from the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the welfare perjury charges. Nevertheless, as a matter of law, the statute punishing perjury does provide that one convicted of the offense is subject \u2018to imprisonment ... under the jurisdiction of the Division of Correction for not more than ten years.\u2019 The former reference to the \u201cpenitentiary\u201d is not simply unamended language which has become obsolete for sentencing purposes. Rather, the word \u2018penitentiary\u2019 has been amended out of the statute. Art. 27, \u00a7 690(e), formerly \u00a7 690(d), states that \u2018[wjhenever in this article or any other law reference is made to the sentencing or confinement of prisoners to [the penitentiary] ..., such reference shall be construed to mean sentencing or confinement to the jurisdiction of the Division [of Correction]----\u2019 As previously discussed, this is a drafting technique regularly used by the General Assembly to change statutes. Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>fusal to give effect to this drafting technique could have grave consequences in the application of a multitude of statutory provisions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 620-21, 579 A.2d at 272-73.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">The General Assembly at its 1991 session, being dissatisfied with the Court\u2019s interpretation of its action in amending the provisions pertaining to the sentencing and confinement of persons convicted of crimes, enacted Ch. 371 Acts 1991, \u201c[for] the purpose of ... establishing that notwithstanding Article 27, \u00a7 690(e) of the Code or the decision of the court in <em>Massey v. State, </em>320 Md. 605, 579 A.2d 265 (1990), if a statute provides that a misdemeanor is punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, the State may institute a prosecution for the offense at any time.\u201d Section 2 of that Chapter, provided that \u201cthere is no statute of limitations for a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary, notwithstanding any holding or dictum to the contrary in <em>Massey v. State, </em>320 Md. 605, 579 A.2d 265 (1990).\u201d To accomplish that result, \u00a7 1 of Chapter 371 repealed each of the statutes which <em>Massey </em>said had effectively been amended to excise the word \u201cpenitentiary\u201d and re-enacted each of them with the word \u201cpenitentiary\u201d put back in. It also provided that \u201cthis Act shall take effect July 1,1991.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">David Erwin Stowe, the appellee, on March 13, 2000, was charged, pursuant to Maryland Code (1957, 1998 Repl.Vol.), Article 27,'\u00a7 554,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> with one count of unnatural and perverted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>sexual practices.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> He moved to dismiss the criminal information <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> arguing that it \u201cis barred by the Statute of Limitations.\u201d The trial court granted the motion and dismissed the criminal information, ruling that, the crime charged having occurred over forty years ago, its prosecution was precluded by limitations, which, for that offense and under the circumstances, was one year. It explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-5\">\u201cAt the time the events [charged] occurred, there was no statute of limitations for this penitentiary misdemeanor; In 1967, legislative action resulted in the creation of a one-year statute of limitations for penitentiary misdemeanors <em>(see Massey v. </em>State, 320 Md. 605, 579 A.2d 265 (1990)); Curative legislative action in 1991 removing the one-year statute of limitations on penitentiary misdemeanors cannot support prosecution of this case because it would violate <em>ex post facto </em>prohibitions. The one-year statute of limitations applicable to this charge has run.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">The State timely noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals and also filed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 8-301,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>petition for writ of certiorari with this Court. Before any proceedings in the intermediate appellate court, this Court granted the petition, <em>State v. Stowe, </em>362 Md. 624, 766 A.2d 147 (2001), to consider whether \u201cthe crime of unnatural and perverted sexual practices [is] subject to a one-year statute of limitations where the crime occurred between March 1, 1958 and July 31,1960?\u201d We shall affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">In this Court, the appellant, the State, notes that, between 1958 and 1960, when the appellee\u2019s conduct, the alleged criminal acts occurred, no limitations period was applicable to the misdemeanor crime of unnatural and perverted sexual practice. Moreover, in 2000, when the appellee was charged, there likewise was no applicable statute of limitations. Thus, the State argues, to apply either the law in force when the alleged crime was committed or the current law puts the appellee in no different position than he was in some forty years ago. In refutation of the applicability of the <em>ex post facto </em>principle, it asserts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">\u201cTo try Stowe today does not subject him to criminal liability for something that was not criminal at the time of his conduct, the crime has not been aggravated, the punishment has not increased, and no less evidence is required to convict him now than would have been required in 1960.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">The appellee, on the other hand, relies on <em>Massey, supra, </em>320 Md. 605, 579 A.2d 265. As a result of that case, he argues that, after 1967, and until the Legislature amended the statutory scheme effecting that result, all misdemeanors, whether penitentiary misdemeanors or not, were subject to a one-year <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>statute of limitations. Moreover, he contends, the Legislature applied that one-year limitations period retrospectively to all sentences imposed prior to June 1,1967. Therefore, as of that date, 1967, the crime of unnatural and perverted practice was subject to a one-year period of limitations. Accordingly, as of that date, the State had one year to prosecute him for the acts he allegedly committed between 1958 and 1960. \u201cAs neither the complainant nor the State came forward to charge [respondent] within that one year, they are now barred from initiating a prosecution 32 years later, he concludes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">It is true, to be sure, that, at the time the conduct, with which the appellee has been charged, allegedly occurred, the statute then in effect permitted the court to sentence a defendant convicted of committing an unnatural or perverted sexual act against a minor to \u201cimprison[ment] in jail or in the House of Correction or in the Penitentiary.\u201d As the Court pointed out in <em>Massey, </em>then, it was the rule that judges would prescribe both the length of the sentence to be served and the place at which that service was to occur, 320 Md. at 610, 579 A.2d at 267, and that it was the authorization in the statute for the judge to designate the penitentiary as a place for service of the sentence, not the sentence itself, that determined the nature of the offense; \u201cwhat the Legislature considered to be the most serious misdemeanors were made punishable by confinement in the state penitentiary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 610-11, 579 A.2d at 267. It was thus a \u201cpenitentiary misdemeanor,\u201d <em>Massey, </em>320 Md. at 609, 579 A.2d at 267; <em>In re Anthony R., </em>362 Md. 51, 73, n. 11, 763 A.2d 136, 148 n. 11 (2000), as to which there was no statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">As we have seen, in 1967, the ability of trial judges to designate the place of confinement was terminated and the length of the sentences to the Department of Correction curtailed. And this, without a disclaimer as had accompanied the legislation .that had given them this flexibility. After June <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>1 of that year, pursuant to the amendments to the sentencing and confinement provisions of \u00a7 690, they could only sentence a defendant to the \u201cjurisdiction of the Department of Correction,\u201d <em>Massey, </em>320 Md. at 614, 579 A.2d at 269, and only for a term, since increased, of three (3) months or more. The Department of Correction, therefore, was charged with the sole responsibility of deciding where a particular defendant would be confined, both before June 1, 1967, notwithstanding the designation of the sentencing judge, and after. <em>Id. </em>In addition, using a common drafting technique, <em>id. </em>at 615-16, 579 A.2d at 269-70, the Legislature, in effect amended every statutory provision relating to the sentencing to, or confinement of persons in, the penitentiary, house of correction, etc., and substituted the words \u201cjurisdiction of the Department\u201d for the words \u201cpenitentiary,\u201d \u201chouse of correction,\u201d and the like. As a result, the <em>Massey </em>Court concluded that since, \u201c[ajfter Ch. 695 of the Acts of 1967 became effective on June 1, 1967, no misdemeanors were \u2018punishable by confinement in the penitentiary by statute,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 617, 579 A.2d at 271, there was no longer a distinction between ordinary misdemeanors and penitentiary ones. <em>Id. </em>at 621, 579 A.2d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Applying that reasoning to the case <em>sub judice </em>produces the same result. When the Legislature made the amendments detailed in <em>Massey, </em>as in the case of welfare perjury, the unnatural and perverted practices statute no longer authorized punishment by confinement in the penitentiary and the trial judges lost the authority to designate the place of confinement for defendants convicted of unnatural and perverted sex acts. As a result, as of June 1, 1967, the statute of limitations for the crime of unnatural and perverted sex act was one year, which, in the absence of the initiation of a prosecution, as in this case, expired June 1,1968.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Relying on <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 694, 701, 120 S.Ct. 1795, 1801 146 L.Ed.2d 727, 736 (2000) (\u201cAbsent a clear statement of that intent, we do not give retroactive effect to statutes burdening private interests.\u201d), the State argues that the 1967 amendments do not operate retroactively to affect the statute of limitations for acts occurring prior to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>effective date. It notes that \u00a7 690(b) stated expressly that \u201con or after June 1, 1967, judges ... shall in all such cases sentence such persons to the jurisdiction of the Department of Correction.\u201d Aware of the significance that the <em>Massey </em>Court placed on the enactment of \u00a7 690(d), a new section, the State calls attention to the fact that, in that section, the substitution of the Department of Correction for the references to the various institutions was made to occur \u201cafter June 1, 1967.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">The State is wrong. The appellee directs our attention to the second paragraph of \u00a7 690(b). That provision, as we have seen addresses the situation in which the defendant was sentenced prior to the effective date of the statute to \u201cany one of the institutions and facilities under the jurisdiction of the Department.\u201d As to such defendants, \u201cafter such date, and notwithstanding such sentence, [they may] be held, confined in, assigned to or transferred to such of these institutions and facilities as the Department may from time to time order.\u201d The appellee thus submits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">\u201cThus, the legislature clearly made the new law retroactively applicable to all sentences imposed prior to June 1, 1967. In other words, to the extent that any sentence of any judge, in the future or in the past, assigns a defendant to a particular institution or penitentiary, such sentence shall now be construed as being to the Division of Correction. The law had to be retroactive for a very practical reason. The judicial system could not have judges and the Division of Correction independently deciding where inmates shall be held.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">The State next asserts that the <em>Massey </em>analysis was wrong and that, therefore, at the next legislative session, the General Assembly \u201coverruled\u201d the decision and \u201cre-affirmed that misdemeanors punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary are not subject to any statute of limitations.\u201d While the Legislature did revisit the issue of the limitations period for penitentiary misdemeanors and made amendments that resulted in such amendments having no statute of limitations and, thus, permitting them to be prosecuted at any time, it is not true that <em>Massey </em>was overruled. To the contrary, the Legisla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ture actually accepted the <em>Massey </em>analysis. To achieve the result of ensuring that penitentiary misdemeanors was not subject to any limitations period, it repealed each of the statutes once authorizing a judge to order imprisonment in the penitentiary, in which the reference to \u201cpenitentiary\u201d had been replaced with \u201cDepartment of Correction\u201d as a result of the 1967 amendments and reenacted them with the word, \u201cpenitentiary\u201d put back in. Thus, in point of fact, the effect of the 1991 amendment was curative, <em>i.e., </em>it recognized the effect of what the legislature did in 1967, and acted to reinstate the original \u201cno statute of limitations.\u201d Nevertheless, from 1967 to 1991, penitentiary misdemeanors had the same statute of limitations as all other misdemeanors, one year.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">We agree with the appellee, considering how inextricably the sentencing and limitations provisions are intertwined, the result would be the same even if the 1967 amendments were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>prospective only. After June 1, 1967, in any case, the sentencing authority of trial judges with respect to the length and place of confinement to the penitentiary did not any longer exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">We turn now to whether the 1991 amendment of the statute of limitations applies to this case. That question implicates the issue of whether the statute effecting the amendment was intended to be applied retrospectively or prospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\"><em>Blocker v. Harlow, </em>268 Md. 571, 303 A.2d 395 (1973), is instructive on the issue. There, this Court was faced with whether the statute of limitations had run when, for the first time, more than three years after an accident and more than 33 months after appointment as administrator, the administrator of an estate was named a party defendant. The dispute involved the 1957 version of Maryland Code, Art. 93, \u00a7 112, which provided that any \u201caction for injuries to the person to be maintainable against an executor or administrator must be commenced within six calendar months after the date of the qualification of the executor or administrator of the testator or intestate,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 575, 303 A.2d at 397, and its 1966 amendment which permitted such an action \u201cagainst the estate of a testator or intestate [to] be instituted after the expiration of six months but within the statute of limitation....\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The Court noted, 268 Md. at 579, 303 A.2d at 399, that \u201cif the pre 1966 section applied the action had to be filed by June 10, 1966, while if the 1966 amendment, effective June 1, 1966, applied, the declaration filed September 28, 1966, was timely.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">Quoting <em>Janda v.

Humphrey, </em>139 Wash.2d 53, 983 P.2d 1118 (1999) is an example of the application of a non-remedial statute. In that case, the Supreme Court of Washington addressed the correct application of an amendment to a statute which raised the amount of a victim penalty assessment from $100 to $500. The defendant had committed his offense prior to the effective date of the amendment, but upon his conviction after the effective date, he was assessed the $500 penalty, rather than the $100 penalty that was in effect when he was charged. <em>Id. </em>at 55, 983 P.2d at 1119. Telling in the court\u2019s analysis was the fact that the size of the increase in the victim penalty assessment indicated that the amendment was not remedial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">\u201c[I]n deciding whether the increase is remedial or substantive, we look to the effect, not the form of the law.

An amendment is like any other statute and applies prospectively only.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 60, 983 P.2d at 1121-22. Noting that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>language of the amendment did not indicate whether it was to be applied to offenses committed before its enactment and prospective application of criminal statutes meant application to offenses committed on, or after, the effective date of the statute, the court declined to construe the amendment as applying retrospectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">The 1991 amendment in the case <em>sub judice </em>is akin to a non-remedial statute. The increase in the statute of limitations period from one year to infinity, operated \u201cmore in the nature of a new liability than a remedial increase in an already existing [punishment].\u201d <em>Humphrey, </em>at 63, 983 P.2d at 1123.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Other courts have reached similar conclusions regarding the general rule of prospectivity. <em>Oxford Tire Supply, Inc. v.

Trial judges would sentence convicted defendants to the particular institutions in accordance with the statutory authorization.

Sentences for misdemeanors apparently deemed less serious were by statute to be served in the county jails or state institutions such as the house of correction.\u201d <em>Massey </em>v. <em>State, </em>320 Md. 605, 610-11, 579 A.2d 265, 267 (1990).</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b482-9\">.

Upon a finding of constructive civil contempt for failure to pay spousal or child support, the court shall issue a written order that specifies (A) the amount of the arrearage for which enforcement by contempt is not barred limitations, (B) any sanction imposed for the contempt, and (C) how the contempt may be purged. If the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>contemnor does not have the present ability to purge the contempt, the order may include directions that the contemnor make specified payments on the arrearage at future times and perform specified acts to enable the contemnor to comply with the direction to make payments.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b493-11\">.

There, unlike in this case, there was clear evidence that the Legislature intended the new, extended statute of limitations to apply retrospectively. The Court pointed out that the amended limitations period \"applies to a cause of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>action arising before, on, or after January 1, 1994, the effective date of this subdivision\" and that \"[t]he 1996 amendment also made explicit the Legislature's intent to \"revive any cause of action barred by Section 800 or 801.\" 88 Cal.Rptr.2d 312, 982 P.2d at 186.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">Moreover, <em>Frazer </em>is no longer good law. <em>Stogner v. California, </em>- U.S. -, 123 S.Ct. 2446, 156 L.Ed.2d 544 (2003). In that case, referring to the statute at issue in <em>Frazer, </em>the Supreme Court opined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6A\">\"The Constitution's two <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clauses prohibit the. Federal Government and the States from enacting laws with certain retroactive effects. See Art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 3 (Federal Government); Art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1 (States). The law at issue here created a new criminal limitations period that extends the time in which prosecution is allowed. It authorized criminal prosecutions that the passage of time had previously barred. Moreover, it was enacted after prior limitations periods for Stogner's alleged offenses had expired. Do these features of the law, taken together, produce the kind of retroactivity that the Constitution forbids? We conclude that they do.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b496-10\"><em>Id. </em>at-, 123 S.Ct. at 2449, 156 L.Ed.2d at-.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
