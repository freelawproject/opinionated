Mateen\u2019s Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus. We must consider whether the Circuit Court\u2019s pronouncement of Mateen\u2019s 1973 sentence for first degree murder was for 50 years, or for life with all but 50 years suspended, whether subsequent off-the-record communications between the sentencing judge and the chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, in the absence of notice to Mateen or an opportunity to be heard, could have constituted a valid correction of Mateen\u2019s 1973 sentence, and finally, whether the State<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> has the right on appeal to challenge the legality of a flat 50-year sentence, if that was what the trial judge pronounced, for first degree murder. For the reasons discussed herein, we shall conclude that Mateen\u2019s sentence was for 50 years, that, although illegal, his sentence was not corrected in accordance with the Maryland Rules, and that the State did not have the right to challenge the legality of the sentence on appeal. Consequently, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case with directions that the intermediate appellate court remand <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>the case to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">On November 30, 1972, Mateen (a/k/a Jerome Allen Williams)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was convicted in the Criminal Court of Baltimore of first degree murder. At the time of the murder, Maryland law provided that \u201c[e]very person convicted of murder in the first degree ... shall suffer death, or undergo a confinement in the penitentiary of the State for the period of their natural life, in the discretion of the court before whom such person may be tried.\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.). Because discretionary death sentences like that provided for in Section 413 had been struck down by this Court as unconstitutional by the time of Mateen\u2019s sentencing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Marshall A. Levin declared that, \u201cthe law [left him with] no alternative\u201d other than to impose a life sentence. Consequently, on January 5, 1973, Judge Levin sentenced Mateen \u201cto the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction\u201d commencing September 9, 1972, and continuing for the \u201cbalance of his natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Thereafter, however, in <em>State v. Wooten, </em>277 Md. 114, 116-18, 352 A.2d 829, 831 (1976), this Court determined that Article 27, Section 413 was subject to Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641A (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.), which empowered courts to \u201cimpose a sentence for a specified period and provide that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>lesser period be served in confinement [and to] suspend the remainder of the sentence.\u201d Subsequently, in <em>Williamson v. State, </em>284 Md. 212, 215, 395 A.2d 496, 497 (1979), we concluded that a trial judge erred when he \u201cdid not exercise the discretion that he possessed under <em>Wooten </em>despite [an] appellant\u2019s request that he consider suspending part of the life sentence imposed upon her.\u201d In light of these decisions, Mateen filed a petition for post conviction relief with the Criminal Court of Baltimore, in which he asserted that his life sentence was illegal because Judge Levin, in 1973, \u201cfailed to consider a suspension of the sentence as a possible alternative to incarceration.\u201d The post conviction judge agreed and ordered that the case be \u201cremanded to the trial court for resentencing.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">On March 19, 1982, a new sentencing hearing was held before Judge Levin. The parties represent that there is no transcript available of that hearing. A docket entry for the date of the hearing, however, states: \u201cChange of sentence hearing. Judgment. Fifty (50) years c/o DOC dating from 9-9-72.\u201d In addition, a Criminal Court of Baltimore Commitment Record, dated March 19, 1982, states: \u201cPrisoner is committed to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction commencing on 9-9-72 for a period of Fifty (50) years.\u201d A Division of Correction Sentence and Detainer Status Change Report also states that Mateen\u2019s sentence was \u201creduced on 3-19-82 to 50 years from life,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is total sentence now reads: 50 [years] from 9-9-72.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">Seven months after the resentencing hearing, in a letter dated October 28, 1982, the Chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission sought clarification of Mateen\u2019s sentence from Judge Levin. The Chairman wrote in a letter to Judge Levin that \u201cthe Annotated Code of Maryland mandates if a person is found guilty of First Degree Murder the sentence must be fife imprisonment.\u201d The Chairman then asked Judge Levin whether it was his \u201cintention to sentence [Mateen] to life imprisonment and suspend all but 50 years or was [Mateen] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>found guilty of a lesser count and sentenced to 50 years incarceration?\u201d \u201cClarification of the correct sentence structure,\u201d the Chairman reasoned, \u201cis necessary in determining whether [Mateen] receives parole consideration after serving one-fourth of his sentence or whether he has to serve 15 years less good conduct time and industrial time if he was sentenced to life imprisonment, with a portion suspended.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Judge Levin responded by letter dated November 3, 1982, in which he wrote: \u201cPlease forgive my inartistic sentencing. It was my intention to sentence [Mateen] to life and suspend all but fifty years.\u201d After receiving Judge Levin\u2019s letter, the Division of Correction issued a second Sentence and Detainer Status Change Report on November 16, 1982, stating that Mateen\u2019s \u201ctotal sentence now reads: Life suspend 50 yrs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Amys\">By letter dated April 1, 1984, Mateen sought clarification from Judge Levin of his sentence. Three days later, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> issued another Commitment Record stating, \u201cSentence changed to read: Balance of Natural Life and all but Fifty (50) years suspended,\u201d and two days after that, Judge Levin wrote to Mateen that, \u201cThe sentence I gave you at your resentencing on March 19, 1982 was life with all but fifty years suspended.\u201d Judge Levin also wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AEs\">Under Maryland law when a person is found guilty of first degree murder the judge <em>must </em>sentence him to life imprisonment. However, the judge can suspend part of that sentence, which I did in your case. Your commitment order has been rewritten by the clerk\u2019s office in order to reflect what I stated above and to remove any confusion that exists about your sentence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b427-6\">Mateen wrote another letter to Judge Levin in November of 1984 again seeking clarification of his sentence and an expla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>nation as to his eligibility for parole. Judge Levin responded by letter dated December 13,1984, in which he wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b428-5\">I imposed a life sentence. However, I suspended all but 50 years. That means that your actual sentence is 50 years. If you are released on parole and any part of your sentence is thus \u201csuspended\u201d (meaning that you have not served the entire 50 years) then the suspended amount can be reimposed if you violate parole.... Parole is predicated on 50 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">In 1986, Mateen became eligible for, but was denied, parole. In 1987, he was transferred to a Pre-Release unit, eventually began to participate in family leave and work release programs, and was again considered for, but denied, parole. Parole was also denied in 1988 and in 1989. In 1990, Mateen wrote another letter to Judge Levin, again seeking clarification of his sentence and an explanation as to his eligibility for parole. Judge Levin responded to Mateen in a May 15, 1990 letter, reiterating that his \u201cactual sentence was amended in 1982 from \u2018life,\u2019 to \u2018life, with all but 50 years suspended.\u2019 \u201d The judge also explained that according to the Parole Commission, Mateen became eligible for parole in 1986, but that parole was denied that year, as well as in 1987,1988, and 1989, and that Mateen was scheduled to appear before the Parole Commission again in June of 1990. The Judge then noted that the Parole Commission was treating Mateen\u2019s \u201celigibility for parole properly\u201d and explained that \u201celigibility does not mean you are automatically <em>released </em>... you must satisfy the Parole Commission that you are a suitable candidate for parole.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">In 1993, the Commissioner of Correction cancelled family leave and work release programs for inmates serving life sentences and ordered that all such inmates be classified to no less than medium security, except under certain conditions. As a result, Mateen was removed from family leave and work release programs and returned to a medium security facility. Division of Correction Directives 100-005, 100-508 and 100-543, which reflected these policies, were issued later.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>On September 14, 1993, Mateen appeared before the Maryland Parole Commission, parole was denied, and Mateen\u2019s case was to be reheard in one year. One year later, Mateen again appeared before the Parole Commission, and the Commission recommended that Mateen be paroled. In 1995, Governor Glendening denied parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Two years later Mateen filed, <em>pro se, </em>a Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City seeking, \u201cDeclaratory Judgement for Suspended Life sentence, Release on Parole and/or to Participate in Pre-Release, Work Release, and Family Leave Programs.\u201d On October 31, 2000, without a hearing and prior to the deadline for Mateen\u2019s reply to the State\u2019s response to his Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus, the Circuit Court issued an Order denying Mateen\u2019s Petition on the basis that \u201cthe individual confined or restrained is not entitled to any relief.\u201d Mateen was never served with a copy of that order. Mateen eventually retained counsel who, after learning of the Court\u2019s order denying Mateen\u2019s Petition, wrote a July 31, 2001, letter to the post conviction judge. In that letter, Mateen\u2019s counsel explained that \u201csince neither [Mateen] nor his attorney were informed of the Court\u2019s final judgment in this case, [Mateen] has lost his right of appeal.\u201d Therefore, Mateen\u2019s counsel requested that the Court reissue and refile <em>nunc pro tunc </em>its October 31, 2000, Order so that Mateen could exercise his right of appeal. Two months later, the Circuit Court issued an Order for <em>nunc pro tunc </em>relief, and thereafter, Mateen filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the dismissal of Mateen\u2019s petition for habeas corpus relief in <em>Mateen v. Galley, </em>146 Md.App. 623, 807 A.2d 708 (2002). The intermediate appellate court determined that on March 19, 1982, Mateen was resentenced to an illegal term of 50 years imprisonment. The Court also concluded, however, that the illegal sentence was corrected by extrajudicial communications between the sentencing judge and the Chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission, which prompted amendments to a Division of Correction Sentence and Detainer Status Change Report and a Circuit Court Commitment Record, so that those records <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>indicated that Mateen\u2019s sentence was life with all but 50 years suspended. We granted certiorari, 372 Md. 763, 816 A.2d 111 (2003), to consider the following questions presented in Ma-teen\u2019s petition, which he filed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-5\">I. Was Judge Levin\u2019s sentence ambiguous and under the rule of lenity should [it] be construed as fifty years from September 9,1972?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">II. Was petitioner deprived of due process rights and a hearing on his writ of habeas corpus based on court errors?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Mateen also raised a third question: \u201cCan petitioner raise a claim in a habeas corpus proceeding?\u201d After filing his petition for certiorari, however, Mateen retained counsel who withdrew this question. Mateen\u2019s counsel then raised the following question in Mateen\u2019s brief: \u201cDo the Division of Correction\u2019s classification rules making parole more difficult to obtain violate the Ex Post Facto provisions of the federal and Maryland constitutions?\u201d Counsel asserts that the question, although not specifically named as a question presented in Mateen\u2019s petition for certiorari, was nonetheless raised in other parts of the petition, and that, in any event, we should exercise our discretion to address the issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">We need not reach the preservation, habeas corpus, or due process issues because, for the reasons discussed herein, we shall conclude that Mateen\u2019s properly entered sentence was for 50 years, commencing on September 9, 1972, not life with all but 50 years suspended, and that the State is unable to challenge the legality of this sentence in this proceeding or otherwise at this juncture. Consequently, we shall vacate the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to the intermediate appellate court with directions that it remand to the Circuit Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-9\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b430-10\">Mateen contends that his sentence should be construed as a flat 50 years, rather than life with all but 50 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>suspended, because the pronouncement of his sentence by Judge Levin on March 19, 1982 was ambiguous, and under the rule of lenity he is entitled to the less severe sentence. Mateen also claims that, contrary to the decision of the Court of Special Appeals, it was not mere \u201charmless error\u201d when the Circuit Court violated Maryland Rule 4-345(d) by failing to correct the sentence on the record, in open court, and after hearing from the parties. Mateen further contends that if his sentence is in fact life with all but 50 years suspended, then two Division of Correction Directives violate the ex post facto provisions of the federal and Maryland Constitutions. Those directives, DCD 100-005 and DCD 100-508, provide, respectively, that inmates serving life sentences with all but a specific term of years suspended cannot be classified below medium security except under certain conditions, and that such inmates are ineligible for work release. Mateen claims that because the Maryland Parole Commission \u201chas a long standing policy requiring inmates to successfully complete work release and other forms of leave prior to recommending parole to the Governor,\u201d the combination of that policy along with the DOC Directives prevents him from obtaining release on parole. The result of this, according to Mateen, is an \u201cimpermissible] increase [in] the quantum of punishment imposed on [him] at the time of his original sentencing in violation of ex post facto principles.\u201d Finally, Mateen argues that the trial court violated his due process rights \u201cby denying his petition for writ of habeas corpus without a hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqZ\">The State urges us to reject Mateen\u2019s assertion that his sentence should be construed as 50 years because \u201c[s]uch a sentence is illegal\u201d and \u201cis not what the circuit court imposed when it resentenced [Mateen] in 1982.\u201d The State also claims that Mateen\u2019s ex post facto argument has not been preserved for review because \u201cneither his brief in the Court of Special Appeals, nor the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari he filed with this Court, contains such an argument.\u201d Even if we choose to review Mateen\u2019s ex post facto argument, the State asserts, we should reject it because Division of Correction Directives are not \u201claws\u201d within the meaning of the ex post facto clauses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>the federal and Maryland Constitutions, because such directives do not \u201clengthen\u201d Mateen\u2019s period of incarceration, and \u201cthe Parole Commission does not condition a parole recommendation on an inmate\u2019s work release or leave status.\u201d Finally, the State asserts that Mateen\u2019s due process challenge to the Circuit Court\u2019s dismissal of his habeas petition should be rejected because Mateen produced no evidence that the Circuit Court did not consider his \u201creply and other papers filed in support of his habeas petition,\u201d and also because Mateen \u201cdid not ask for a hearing\u201d when he requested the Court to reissue its October 31, 2000, order dismissing his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Our analysis begins with Mateen\u2019s resentencing, which occurred over twenty years ago, on March 19,1982, and for which no transcript of the proceeding is available. We agree with the Court of Special Appeals that Mateen\u2019s sentence was a flat 50 years, rather than life with all but 50 years suspended. <em>See Mateen, </em>146 Md.App. at 646, 807 A.2d at 721. As was pointed out by the intermediate appellate court, a Criminal Court of Baltimore Commitment Record, dated March 19, 1982, the day of the resentencing hearing, states: \u201cPrisoner is committed to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction commencing on 9-9-72 for a period of Fifty (50) years.\u201d Also, a Division of Correction Sentence and Detainer Status Change Report states that Mateen\u2019s sentence was \u201creduced on 3-19-82 to 50 years from life,\u201d and that \u201c[h]is total sentence now reads: 50 [years] from 9-9-72.\u201d In addition, subsequent to the proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, the State discovered a docket entry for March 19, 1982 that states: \u201cChange of sentence hearing. Judgment. Fifty (50) years c/o DOC dating from 9-9-72.\u201d Although admittedly terse, \u201c[t]he value of a simple docket entry which ... makes clear to everyone the disposition of each and every claim in a case cannot be overemphasized.\u201d <em>Jones v. Hubbard, </em>356 Md. 513, 523, 740 A.2d 1004, 1010 (1999). Docket entries are \u201c \u2018made under the eye of the court, and by its authority,\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. State, </em>68 Md.App. 679, 688, 515 A.2d 768, 773 (1986)(quoting <em>Weighorst v. State, </em>7 Md. 442, 450 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1855)), and are presumed to be \u201ctrue until corrected.\u201d <em>Coleman v. State, </em>231 Md. 220, 222-223, 189 A.2d 616, 618 (1963) citing <em>Roberts v. State, </em>219 Md. 485, 488, 150 A.2d 448 (1959). Furthermore, we also note that \u201c[f]undamental fairness dictates that the defendant understand clearly what debt he must pay to society for his transgressions. If there is doubt as to the penalty, then the law directs that his punishment must be construed to favor a milder penalty over a harsher one.\u201d <em>Robinson v. Lee, </em>317 Md. 371, 379-80, 564 A.2d 395, 399 (1989). Thus, we agree with the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that the sentence imposed upon Mateen during his resentencing on March 19, 1982 was for 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">We also acknowledge, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that a straight 50-year sentence for first degree murder was \u201cillegal.\u201d <em>Mateen, </em>146 Md.App. at 646, 807 A.2d at 722. The statute in effect at the time of Mateen\u2019s conviction in the present case, prescribing the penalties for first degree murder, stated: \u201cEvery person convicted of murder in the first degree, his or her aiders, abettors and counsellors, shall suffer death, or undergo a confinement in the penitentiary of the State for the period of their natural life----\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (1957, 1971 ReplVol.). Similarly, the statute in effect at the time of Mateen\u2019s resentencing that prescribed punishment for first degree murder directed: \u201cA person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced to either death or to imprisonment for life.... \u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b) (1957, 1976 Repl-Vol., 1980 Supp.). Thus, a judge had only two options when rendering a sentence for first degree murder: death, or imprisonment for life. A sentence of 50 years is \u201cillegal\u201d in the sense that it does not comport with either of those two sentencing options.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">An illegal sentence, as was properly recognized by the Court of Special Appeals, may be corrected by a court at any time, even on its own initiative. <em>Mateen, </em>146 Md.App. at 647-49, 807 A.2d at 722-23. <em>See also State v. Griffiths, </em>338 Md. 485, 496, 659 A.2d 876, 882 (1995)(recognizing that Maryland Rule 4-345(a) allows a court to correct an illegal sentence at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>any time and stating that the Rule \u201cdoes not preclude action by the trial court on its own initiative.\u201d) We differ, however, with the intermediate appellate court\u2019s assessment that the \u201ccumulative effect\u201d of \u201cJudge Levin\u2019s November 1982 and April 1984 letter[s]\u201d along with the \u201cDOC[\u2019s] revision of] its sentence change report and the courtfs] revision] of its commitment record\u201d constituted a \u201cde facto correction\u201d of Mateen\u2019s 50 year sentence to life with all but 50 years suspended. <em>Mateen, </em>146 Md.App. at 649, 807 A.2d at 722-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">When Mateen was resentenced on March 19, 1982, Maryland Rule 774 governed the revisory power of the court with respect to sentencing. That Rule provided the court with broad powers to correct an illegal sentence, stating in part that \u201c[t]he court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.\u201d Md. Rule 774(a). The court\u2019s power to correct an illegal sentence, however, was not unlimited, for the Rule also stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATh\">A modification or reduction or striking of sentence shall be made on the record in open court after notice to the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney. A new sentence specifying the modification or reduction made shall be entered of record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">Md. Rule 774(c). In the instant case, no hearing was held on the record in open court, and no notice was given to Mateen or to the State. Rather, seven months after Mateen was resen-tenced to 50 years, the Chairman of the Maryland Parole Commission sent a letter to Judge Levin pointing out that the Maryland Code required a sentence of life imprisonment for first degree murder, and seeking clarification as to whether the judge meant to sentence Mateen to life in prison with all but 50 years suspended. Judge Levin responded in a letter to the Chairman that it was his \u201cintention\u201d to impose a sentence of life with all but 50 years suspended.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Based upon these off-the-record communications, the Division of Correction\u2019s Sentence Change Report and eventually, the Circuit Court\u2019s Com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>mitment Record, were revised to reflect a sentence of life with all but 50 years suspended. For the next two decades, Mateen was treated as a \u201clifer,\u201d the consequences of which included restrictions on work release and family leave programs, and parole. Mateen\u2019s sentence, however, was never corrected properly because there was never a hearing on the record or notice provided to the parties, as was required by Maryland Rule 744(c). <em>See Dotson v. State, 321 </em>Md. 515, 523, 583 A.2d 710, 714 (1991)(stating that the Maryland Rules \u201chave the force of law\u201d). Consequently, the Circuit Court\u2019s commitment order and the DOC\u2019s sentence change report indicating that Mateen\u2019s sentence is life with all but 50 years suspended, are of no legal force or effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The State, however, urges us not to conclude that the appropriate sentence was 50 years because such a sentence for first degree murder was \u201cillegal.\u201d Even if the 50-year sentence was illegal, however, that does not necessarily mean that the State has the right to challenge it here. We explain.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">In <em>State v. Green, </em>367 Md. 61, 79, 785 A.2d 1275, 1283 (2001), we established \u201conce and for all that there is now no common law right of appeal under Maryland law.\u201d Indeed, the right to appeal \u201cin either a civil or criminal case, must find its source in an act of the legislature.\u201d <em>State v. Bailey, </em>289 Md. 143, 147, 422 A.2d 1021, 1024 (1980). <em>See also Jones v. State, </em>298 Md. 634, 637, 471 A.2d 1055, 1057 (1984) (\u201cUnder Maryland law the State\u2019s right to appeal in a criminal case is limited; it may do so only when authorized by statute.\u201d). Thus, we must determine if any statute provided the State with the right to challenge on appeal the legality of Mateen\u2019s 50 year sentence for first degree murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Maryland Code, \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1973, 2002 RepLVol.), is the only statute that could empower the State to appeal here. It provides that the State may appeal from a final judgment \u201cif the State alleges that the trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the Code.\u201d The question, then, is whether a sentence of life for first degree murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>under the relevant statutory provisions is \u201cspecifically mandated by the code.\u201d For the following reasons, we conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">When a sentencing judge has the discretion to suspend a sentence, or similarly, to grant probation before judgment, the sentence is not specifically mandated by the Maryland Code. In <em>Green, swpra, </em>we concluded that the State had the right to appeal because the sentencing provisions of Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 643B(c) (1957,1992 Repl.VoL), were mandatory. <em>Id. </em>at 82, 785 A.2d at 1287. In so concluding, we reasoned that the statute specifically directed \u201cthat courts may not suspend \u2018all or part\u2019 of such sentences.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also noted that the statute was entitled \u201cMandatory sentences for crimes of violence,\u201d and that it employed the term \u201cshall.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">In <em>State v. Hannah, </em>307 Md. 390, 392, 514 A.2d 16, 17 (1986), Hannah pled guilty to common law robbery and to the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony in violation of Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol., 1985 Cum.Supp.). For the robbery charge, the circuit court sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment, of which, he was to serve two. <em>Id. </em>The rest of his confinement was suspended, with Hannah being placed on probation upon his release from custody. <em>Id. </em>Thereafter, the circuit court struck its previous finding of guilt on the handgun charge and gave Hannah probation before judgment, pursuant to Art. 27, \u00a7 641, which provided in part that \u201cwhen ever a person pleads guilty\u201d to an offense, the court may stay the entering of judgment and \u201cplace the person on probation subject to reasonable terms and conditions as appropriate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 393-94, 514 A.2d at 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">The State appealed, arguing that it had the right to do so pursuant to \u00a7 12-302 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 514 A.2d at 18. We granted certiorari before any proceedings in the Court of Special Appeals, and concluded that the State had a right to appeal. In so concluding, we stated that \u201cthe State\u2019s right to appeal rises or falls on CJ \u00a7 12-302(c)(2),\u201d which conferred a \u201cspecial right of appeal\u201d for the State when \u201cit contends that a trial judge had failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>impose the sentence specifically mandated by the General Assembly.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 397, 514 A.2d at 19. We then observed that the statute governing the penalties for the use of a handgun in the commission of a felony specifically prohibited a court from suspending a sentence or entering judgment of probation before a verdict. <em>See </em>Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 36B(e)(2) and (3) (1957, 1982 Repl.Vol.)(declaring that \u201cno court shall suspend a mandatory minimum sentence prescribed in this subheading\u201d and that \u201cno court shall enter a judgment of probation before or without verdict with respect to any case arising under this subheading\u201d). Thus, because the judge\u2019s probation disposition violated a \u201cmandatory sentencing law,\u201d we concluded that Section 12-302(c)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provided the State with the ability to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 402, 514 A.2d at 21-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Four years later, in <em>Shilling v. State, </em>320 Md. 288, 577 A.2d 83 (1990), we concluded that Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 641(a)(2) (1987 Repl.Vol.), was a mandatory sentencing statute and, as a result, the State had a right to appeal. Shilling was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle while intoxicated in violation of Maryland Code, \u00a7 21-902(a) of the Transportation Article (1987 Repl.Vol., 1989 Cum.Supp.). The circuit court judge, despite the fact that Shilling had been previously found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol and given probation before judgment for that crime, stayed the entry of judgment, granted Shilling probation before judgment, and fined him $250.00. <em>Id </em>at 290, 577 A.2d at 84. Section 641(a)(2) provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, a court may not stay the entering of judgment and place a person on probation for a second or subsequent violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) of the Transportation Article if the second or subsequent violation occurred within 5 years of the previous violation. A person is in violation of \u00a7 21-902(a) or (b) if that person receives probation under this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b437-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 291, 577 A.2d at 84. We determined that this language \u201cspecifically\u201d eliminated \u201cthe possibility of probation\u201d under the circumstances of the case, and that the trial judge, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>fore, imposed a disposition contrary to that specifically mandated by statute. <em>Id. </em>at 294, 577 A.2d at 86. Indeed, we stated that \u201ca sentence is specifically mandated when the legislature prohibits probation before judgment or suspension of the imposition of sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294, 577 A.2d at 86. Although under previous case law and versions of Section 12-302, the State had a right to appeal from an \u201cillegal\u201d sentence, we observed that the version of Section 12-302(c)(2), which is substantially the same as the law at issue in the present case, \u201cseeks to specify that the State may appeal when the trial court does not impose a sentence the legislature has clearly mandated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because the Legislature had prohibited probation under the circumstances of this case in Section 641(a)(2), we concluded that it \u201cmandated\u201d that \u201csome sentence, however minimal, be imposed,\u201d and that the State, therefore, had a right to appeal. <em>Id. </em>at 293, 577 A.2d at 85.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">In enacting the law prescribing the penalties for first degree murder, which were in effect at the time of Mateen\u2019s conviction and when he was resentenced, it is clear that the Legislature did not specifically prohibit sentencing judges from exercising their discretion to suspend a life sentence. The statute in effect at the time of Mateen\u2019s conviction in the present case prescribing the penalties for first degree murder stated: \u201cEvery person convicted of murder in the first degree, his or her aiders, abettors and counsellors, shall suffer death, or undergo a confinement in the penitentiary of the State for the period of their natural life____\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (1957, 1971 Repl.Vol.). Similarly, the statute in effect at the time of Mateen\u2019s resentencing that prescribed punishment for first degree murder directed: \u201cA person found guilty of murder in the first degree shall be sentenced either to death or to imprisonment for life.\u201d Maryland Code, Art. 27, \u00a7 412(b) (1957, 1976 Repl.Vol., 1980 Supp.). Neither of those statutes specifically prohibit a sentencing judge from suspending a life sentence. Furthermore, this Court has determined that sentencing judges do, in fact, have the discretion to suspend all or part of life sentences for first degree murder, <em>State v. Wooten, </em>277 Md. at 116-18, 352 A.2d at 831-32, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>that the failure to exercise such discretion is error. <em>Williamson v. State, </em>284 Md. at 215, 395 A.2d at 497 (concluding that a trial judge erred when he \u201cdid not exercise the discretion that he possessed under <em>Wooten </em>despite [an] appellant\u2019s request that he consider suspending part of the life sentence imposed upon her\u201d); <em>but see State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 825 A.2d 452 (2003). Because a sentencing judge has the discretion to suspend a life sentence for first degree murder, that sentence has not been \u201cspecifically mandated\u201d by the Legislature. Consequently, the State has no right to appeal the legality of Mateen\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">Nor may the State circumvent the limitations of Section 12-302(c)(2) by insisting, in an argument suggestive of a motion to correct an illegal sentence under Maryland Rule 4-345(a), that we not construe Mateen\u2019s sentence as 50 years because that sentence was \u201cillegal.\u201d Our decision in <em>Telak v. State, </em>315 Md. 568, 556 A.2d 225 (1989), is instructive on this point. In that case, Telak was found guilty in the District Court of Maryland, Baltimore County, of driving while intoxicated and negligent driving. <em>Id. </em>at 569, 556 A.2d at 225. On July 24, 1986, the District Court entered an order striking the guilty verdicts and imposing probation before judgment, 2 years supervised probation, a fine, and a requirement of alcohol-related treatment. <em>Id. </em>Neither party filed a notice of appeal within 30 days of this order. <em>Id. </em>On August 15, 1986, however, the State filed a \u201cMotion to Correct an Illegal Sentence,\u201d which was denied by the District Court on September 18, 1986. <em>Id. </em>Twelve days later, but 68 days after the District Court\u2019s July 24 order, the State filed a notice of appeal to the Circuit Court for Baltimore County. <em>Id. </em>Telak filed a motion to dismiss the State\u2019s appeal on the ground that it was not filed within the 30 day time frame mandated by Maryland Code, \u00a7 12-401(e)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (1974, 1984 Repl.Vol.).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at 570, 556 A.2d at 225-26. The Circuit Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>denied Telak\u2019s motion, entered a mandate granting the State\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence, and remanded the case to the District Court. <em>Id. </em>at 570, 556 A.2d at 226. We granted certiorari to consider whether the State\u2019s appeal was timely filed, and held that it was not. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">The State argued that its appeal was timely even though the notice was filed more than 30 days after the July 24, 1986 order of the District Court disposing of the case. <em>Id. </em>In support of that argument, the State relied on Chapter 49 of the Acts of 1976, which enacted both Section 12-401, providing the State with the right to appeal from a final judgment in a district court criminal case, and Section 12-302(c)(2), giving the State the right to appeal from a final judgment in a circuit court criminal case. <em>Id. </em>at 573, 556 A.2d at 228. According to the State, Chapter 49 codified our decision in <em>State ex rel. Sonner v. Shearin, </em>272 Md. 502, 325 A.2d 573 (1974), where we indicated that the State could take an appeal from the order denying the motion to correct an illegal sentence, and that the thirty-day period for filing an appeal ran from that order. <em>Id. </em>at 574, 556 A.2d at 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">We rejected the State\u2019s argument, instead concluding that the language of Sections 12-401 and 12-302 clearly demonstrated that the State could take an appeal only from a \u201cfinal judgment\u201d in a district or circuit court criminal case, and that the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence is not a final judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 575-76, 556 A.2d at 228-29. A final judgment in a criminal case, we noted, \u201cconsists of the verdict and, except where there is an acquittal, the sanction imposed, which is normally a fine or sentence of imprisonment or both.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that a motion to correct an illegal sentence, on the other hand, \u201cis in the nature of a collateral attack\u201d and \u201c[a]n appeal from its denial is not a direct appeal from the original sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 576, 556 A.2d at 229. In Chapter 49 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>of the Acts of 1976, the General Assembly \u201clegislated with respect to direct appeals from judgments in criminal cases;\u201d it did not \u201cauthorize an appeal from the denial of a motion to correct an illegal sentence\u201d filed pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a). <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that under Section 12-401 of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the only order of the District Court from which the State could appeal was the July 24,1986 order imposing sanctions upon Telak, not the later order denying the State\u2019s motion to correct an illegal sentence filed pursuant to the Maryland Rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\"><em>Telak </em>demonstrates that the State may not circumvent the legislatively-mandated 30 days for noting an appeal from a final judgment in a criminal case by filing, beyond thirty days after entry of the final judgment, an appeal from an order denying a motion to correct an illegal sentence. Similarly, in the present case, the State may not evade the limitations placed upon its ability to appeal Mateen\u2019s sentence in Section 12 \u2014 301(c)(2) by challenging the legality of his sentence on appeal with an argument that is in the nature of a motion to correct an illegal sentence pursuant to Maryland Rule 4-345(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">Our inquiry, however, is not at an end, for it is well established that a court may correct an illegal sentence on its own initiative and at any time, even upon appeal. <em>See Ridgeway v. State, </em>369 Md. 165, 171, 797 A.2d 1287, 1290 (2002); <em>Griffiths, </em>338 Md. at 496, 659 A.2d at 882. Indeed, in <em>Boyd v. State, </em>321 Md. 69, 73-74 n. 2, 581 A.2d 1, 3 n. 2 (1990), this Court <em>ex mero motu </em>ordered the trial court to correct an illegal sentence upon remand. The defendant in that case was convicted of first degree murder, attempted murder, and conspiring to dynamite her husband\u2019s car. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 581 A.2d at 3. She was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole on the murder conviction and was given concurrent life sentences for the remaining convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 581 A.2d at 3. The issue before us was whether the trial judge erred in refusing to recuse himself. <em>Id. </em>at 71, 581 A.2d at 1. In dicta, we pointed out, even though the petitioner had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>not raised the issue, that \u201cthe sentence of life imprisonment for the crime of attempting to dynamite a vehicle exceeds the statutory maximum of 20 years imprisonment ... and is, therefore, an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 73-74 n. 2, 581 A.2d 1, 3 n. 2. We then stated that we expected the trial court to correct the sentence \u201cafter the case is remanded pursuant to our mandate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The imposition of the illegal sentence in <em>Boyd </em>was appealable by the defendant because it would have subjected her to greater punishment than was allowed under the law for the crime that she committed. Contrastingly, Mateen\u2019s 50-year sentence in the present case is an illegal sentence, but one for which, as previously discussed, the State has no right to challenge on appeal. We cannot do indirectly what the State could not ask for directly.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">We have concluded that Mateen\u2019s sentence is 50 years in prison. The Circuit Court\u2019s commitment order and the DOC\u2019s sentence change report indicating that Mateen\u2019s sentence is life with all but 50 years suspended, are of no legal force or effect. Upon remand, the Circuit Court must issue a new commitment order indicating the length of Mateen\u2019s sentence as 50 years, commencing September 9, 1972, and the DOC must respond accordingly, by considering Mateen as an inmate with a 50 year sentence, rather than as an inmate with a life sentence \"with all but 50 years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">\n<em>JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED. CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH INSTRUCTIONS TO REVERSE THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR BALTIMORE CITY AND TO REMAND THE CASE TO THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS CONSISTENT WITH THIS OPINION. RESPONDENTS TO PAY COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b443-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>Dissenting opinion by WILNER, J., in which RAKER and CATHELL, JJ.Join.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">With respect, I dissent. The Court in this case mandates a sentence that it acknowledges is flat-out illegal. That, alone, is extraordinary. Stranger yet are the bases on which it reaches that result. It seemingly applies the rule of lenity to wipe away a legal sentence in favor of an illegal one, for which there is utterly no authority or logic.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In substituting its judgment on a purely factual matter for that of the trial court \u2014 what sentence was actually imposed by the judge \u2014 it gives greater credence to the shorthand hearsay script of an unknown clerk than to the recorded statement of the judge who imposed the sentence. And, ignoring the fact that the Circuit Court denied relief to the defendant, who is the appellant here, it holds that the illegal sentence, which the trial court found was never imposed, must be sustained because the State is not allowed to appeal it.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The relevant facts are really quite simple. In January, 1973, having been convicted of first degree murder, Muhsin R. Mateen, then known as Jerome Williams, was sentenced by Judge Marshall Levin to life imprisonment, the sentence to date from September 9, 1972. The governing statute at the time allowed only two possible sentences for a person convict<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>ed of first degree murder \u2014 death and life imprisonment. A death sentence was not possible because the statute allowing it had been declared unconstitutional by this Court. Accordingly, only one sentence was legally permissible \u2014 the one he received. Judge Levin said at sentencing, \u201cMr. Williams, the law leaves me no alternative. There is no longer the death penalty. Accordingly, the sentence ... is you be sentenced ... for the rest of your natural life.\u201d The sentence, as recorded by the clerk, was that Mateen be committed to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction commencing on September 9,1972 for the \u201cbalance of his natural life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">It is not clear whether Mateen appealed his conviction\u2014 there is nothing in the record to indicate that he did.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> At some point, however, he began filing post conviction applications. His third one was filed in 1981. In that application, he complained that Judge Levin had failed to consider whether any part of his life sentence should be suspended, which, in <em>State v. Wooten, </em>277 Md. 114, 352 A.2d 829 (1976), we held was permissible. In October, 1981, Judge Pines granted the application in order to permit Judge Levin to consider whether any part of the life sentence he had imposed should be suspended. The case was returned to Judge Levin for one purpose and one purpose only \u2014 to consider whether, in light of <em>Wooten, </em>any part of the life sentence should be suspended. Life imprisonment remained the only legally permissible sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The Legislature had not changed the statute to allow any lesser sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">There is no longer available a transcript of the subsequent proceeding before Judge Levin. All that we have to indicate what happened are two documents emanating from the clerk\u2019s office. The actual docket entry, of which only a second-hand reference appears in the record extract, recites, \u201cChange of sentence hearing. Judgment. Fifty (50) years c/o DOC dating from 9-9-72.\u201d From that docket entry, the clerk of the court signed a commitment record stating that Mateen was committed to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction commencing on September 9, 1972, for a period of \u201cFifty (50) years.\u201d Who prepared the docket entry, from which the commitment record was taken, is unclear. In conformance with the commitment record, the Division of Correction initially, and probably routinely, prepared a \u201cSentence and Detainer Status Change Report\u201d showing that Mateen\u2019s sentence had been \u201creduced\u201d on March 19, 1982, from life to 50 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Only two possible conclusions can flow from these facts. Either the docket entry, and thus the commitment record that was prepared from it, was incorrect or Judge Levin \u2014 an experienced, competent trial judge, well-versed in criminal sentencing, who had already acknowledged that he had no authority to impose any sentence other than life imprisonment \u2014 nonetheless took leave of his senses and imposed a 50-year sentence that he knew was illegal. Given these two possibilities \u2014 even if that were <em>all </em>that the record revealed \u2014 I would have not the slightest hesitation in concluding that the docket entry was clearly in error. But that is not all that the record reveals.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">In October, 1982, the Chairman of the Parole Commission, puzzled by the Division of Correction\u2019s change of status report, wrote to Judge Levin seeking clarification. In his letter, the Chairman noted that the Code required a life sentence for first degree murder, and he inquired whether it was Judge Levin\u2019s intent \u201cto sentence [Mateen] to life imprisonment and suspend all but 50 years or was [Mateen] found guilty of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>lesser count and sentenced to 50 years incarceration?\u201d Judge Levin replied, stating clearly that \u201cit was my intention to sentence him to life and suspend all but fifty years.\u201d Based on Judge Levin\u2019s letter, the Division of Correction prepared a new, corrected change report to reflect the sentence as \u201cLife suspend 50 yrs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">Mateen, of course, was not happy, so, on April 1, 1984, he wrote to Judge Levin, inquiring about the sentence. Judge Levin responded five days later, again making very clear what he had done:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-6\">\u201cThe sentence I gave you at your resentencing on March 19, 1982 was life with all but fifty years suspended. Under Maryland law when a person is found guilty of first degree murder the judge <em>must </em>sentence him to life imprisonment. However, the judge can suspend part of that sentence, which I did in your case. Your commitment order has been rewritten by the clerk\u2019s office in order to reflect what I stated above and remove any confusion that exists about your sentence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">A copy of Judge Levin\u2019s letter was filed with the clerk and, based on it, the Clerk prepared a new, corrected Commitment Record, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b446-8\">\u201cAs result of a Post Conviction Proceedings ruled on by Judge Pines, that, Jerome A. Williams be remanded to this court for <em>Re-Sentencing </em>by Judge Levin in this case, the following sentence was handed down[:] Prisoner is committed to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner of Correction commencing on 9 September 1972 for a period of SENTENCE CHANGED TO READ: Balance of Natural Life and all but Fifty (50) years suspended.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">Not satisfied, Mateen again wrote to Judge Levin, on November 23, 1984, seeking clarification. Judge Levin responded on December 13 that clarification really was not needed. He reiterated that he had imposed a life sentence and suspended all but 50 years. In 1990, Mateen wrote to Judge Levin for the third time, and, for the third time, Judge Levin responded that \u201cyour actual sentence was amended in 1982 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>from \u2018life,\u2019 to \u2018life, with all but 50 years suspended,\u2019 to commence on September 9,1972.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Four times, Judge Levin, in writing, made absolutely clear that the effective sentence was life imprisonment, with all but 50 years suspended. Based on that pronouncement, the clerk issued a revised commitment showing that to be the sentence. In so doing, the Court effectively corrected the clearly erroneous docket entry, as this Court acknowledges the trial court had the authority to do. It is the only possible construction consistent with (1) law, (2) common sense, and (3) what Judge Levin said he had done. Yet this Court, raising to the height of Mt. Sinai the initial cryptic and clearly erroneous docket entry of an unknown clerk, does not believe Judge Levin. It gives no weight to what he said four times he had done. It gives no weight to the fact that, if indeed, he actually imposed the illegal sentence of 50 years in 1982, that illegal sentence the erroneous docket entry was corrected when, in conformance with Judge Levin\u2019s letter to Mateen, which was filed in the record, the clerk issued a revised commitment record in 1984. In some form of misguided empathy for a first degree murderer, this Court concludes that Judge Levin either was not telling the truth or that he did not know what he was doing. That, to me, is unacceptable. There is no rational basis in this record to conclude that Judge Levin imposed a sentence of 50 years \u2014 a sentence he knew would be illegal and a sentence that, on four separate occasions, he said he did not impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">The Court\u2019s descent into Wonderland proceeds further with its analysis of why the illegal sentence that was never, in fact, imposed cannot be corrected \u2014 because the State has no right to appeal from it. The Court acknowledges that \u00a7 12-302(c)(2) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article permits the State to appeal from a final judgment in a criminal case if \u201cthe trial judge failed to impose the sentence specifically mandated by the code.\u201d Notwithstanding its recognition that the only legally permissible sentence, in both 1972 and 1982, was life imprisonment, the Court holds that, because the law permitted Judge Levin to suspend all or part of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>sentence, it really was not a sentence \u201cspecifically mandated by the code.\u201d That, to me, is utter sophistry. The fact that <em>execution </em>of the only permissible sentence, or part of that sentence, may be suspended does not make the sentence itself any less mandated. When a judge imposes a sentence and suspends execution of all or part of it, the effective sentence is and remains what the judge has imposed. Suspension of execution merely allows the defendant to serve part of that sentence outside the prison walls. <em>See Moats v. Scott, </em>358 Md. 593, 594-97, 751 A.2d 462, 463-64 (2000). The effect of the Court\u2019s pronouncement in this case is that, unless the Legislature has specifically precluded suspension of a sentence, there are no more mandated sentences in Maryland for purposes of \u00a7 12-302(c)(2). In its convoluted reasoning, the Court has effectively repealed that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Judges Cathell and Raker have authorized me to state that they join in this dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b424-9\">.

The Court states that it granted <em>certiorari </em>to consider two issues raised in Mateen\u2019s <em>pro se </em>petition and one question added by the Public Defender. It never does address the issue raised by the Public Defender, which challenged certain Division of Correction classification rules as being <em>ex post facto </em>enactments. The questions raised in Mateen\u2019s petition were: (I) \"Was Judge Levin\u2019s sentence ambiguous and under the rule of lenity should [it] be construed as fifty years from September 9, 1972,\u201d and (2) \"Was petitioner deprived of due process rights and a hearing on his writ of habeas corpus based on court errors.\u201d The Court states that it is not reaching the due process issue because of its holding that the \"properly entered sentence was for 50 years.\u201d As the only basis for reaching that conclusion under the grant of <em>certiorari </em>was <em>that </em>the <em>sentence </em>was ambiguous and, under the rule of lenity, should be construed as a sentence of 50 years and as the Court did not add any other issue on its own initiative, I presume that the Court applied the rule of lenity in reaching that conclusion, even though it never again mentions that rule. That is another of the many puzzling glitches in the majority Opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-6\">. In his reply to the State\u2019s answer to his petition for habeas corpus, Mateen claims that, \u201d[i]n the original criminal case,\u201d he was tried with a co-defendant, Roosevelt Sneed, and references an appeal, <em>Williams v. State, </em>50 Md.App. 255, 437 A.2d 665 (1981). Although that case did involve someone by the name of Jerome Williams, it is not likely that Mateen was the Jerome Williams involved in that case. The appellants' brief in <em>Williams </em>indicates that the murder of which Williams and Sneed were convicted was committed in May, 1979, and that the two were tried, the first time, by Judge (now Chief Judge of this Court) Robert M. Bell, in April, 1980, and, following a mistrial, by Judge Dorf in June, 1980. Unless Mateen somehow escaped, of which there is no evidence, he would have been in prison under Judge Levin\u2019s 1973 sentence at the time of those events. If Mateen is confused about which murder he committed, when he committed it, and who tried him, his confusion regarding Judge Levin\u2019s sentence is not remarkable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b448-6\">RAKER, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AUA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">The dissenting opinion written by Judge Wilner sets out a full basis for rejecting the holding and analysis of the majority. I join his opinion in full. I write separately to add a few observations about the majority analysis and also to emphasize that the rule of lenity is inapplicable to what I believe is a mandatory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">Without answering the certiorari questions,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the majority holds that the State may not challenge this illegal sentence on appeal and that the Circuit Court\u2019s commitment order and DOC sentence change is of no legal force or effect. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 23. I believe this holding is both wrong and unfair. It is unfair because without a hearing and without giving the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>State the opportunity to argue the issue or to even respond, the Court, <em>sua sponte, </em>determines that the State does not have a right to appeal this admittedly illegal sentence. The majority is wrong because the sentence of life is a mandatory sentence; if a trial court imposes anything but a life sentence under the circumstances presented herein, the sentence is unlawful and the State has a right to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">A mandatory sentence is one where, regardless of any other circumstance, a judge is required to impose a particular sentence. In Maryland, the Legislature has mandated that the required sentence for first degree murder shall be life imprisonment. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957,1971 Repl.Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 413 (re-codified at Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 2-201 (b) of the Criminal Law Article). The trial judge is forced to impose that sentence. As Judge Wilner points out, \u201c[t]he fact that <em>execution of </em>the only permissible sentence, <em>or </em>part of that sentence, may be suspended does not make the sentence itself any less mandated.\u201d Diss. op. at 6-7. The fact that this Court has said that a trial judge may suspend a portion of that sentence does not transform the sentence into one that is discretionary. <em>See State v. Chaney, </em>375 Md. 168, 825 A.2d 452 (2003) (pointing out that \u201cone must pass a sentence before one can suspend it\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">The mandatory sentence in this case may be contrasted with a mandatory-minimum sentence. <em>See e.g., </em>Maryland Code (2002) \u00a7 4-205 of the Criminal Law Article, captioned \u201cOther limitations on sentencing.\u201d A sentence that is a mandatory minimum sentence is one in which the judge has no authority to make a downward departure from a statutory minimum. Therefore, the trial judge may not suspend a portion of such a sentence if doing so would reduce it below the mandatory minimum. It is true, therefore, that a trial judge has more latitude with regard to the execution of a mandatory sentence than the execution of a mandatory minimum sentence. Although execution may be subject to the trial court\u2019s deference, the sentence itself is nonetheless mandatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Moreover, to the extent that the majority relies on the rule of lenity to justify its result, the majority is wrong because the rule of lenity has no application whatsoever to the issue before the Court. <em>See </em>maj. op. at 397 (stating that \u201c[i]f there is doubt as to the penalty, then the law directs that his punishment must be construed to favor a milder penalty over a harsher one\u201d). The rule of lenity is inapplicable to a mandatory sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b448-9\">.
