The Montgomerys timely filed suit in the Circuit Court for Frederick County against the Remsburgs alleging trespass and negligence. Remsburg Jr. settled with the Montgomerys and was dismissed from the suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">Remsburg Sr. filed a Motion for Summary Judgment. He contended that there were no material facts in dispute and that the Montgomerys failed to assert properly the existence of a legally cognizable duty owed by Remsburg Sr. to the Montgomerys to protect them from the negligent acts of a third party, namely Remsburg Jr. The Montgomerys filed a timely opposition. A hearing was held on 15 April 2001, at which time summary judgment was entered for Remsburg Sr. on all counts. The Montgomerys appealed to the Court of Special Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">The Court of Special Appeals issued a reported opinion on 1 November 2002 affirming the Circuit Court judgment as to the trespass count, but vacating with respect to the negligence claim. <em>Montgomery v. Remsburg, </em>147 Md.App. 564, 810 A.2d 14 (2002). As to the latter, the intermediate appellate court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"574\">*574</page-number>held that \u201cthere were factual disputes material to determining whether Remsburg Sr. owed the Montgomerys a special duty to take preventive measures, either by informing them that they [the Remsburgs] intended to hunt in that area, or by giving Remsburg Jr. enough information to alert him to the possibility that other hunters might be present that morning.\u201d <em>Montgomery, </em>147 Md.App. at 572, 810 A.2d at 19. Remsburg Sr. then filed a petition for writ of certiorari with this Court, which we granted on 12 March 2003 to determine whether Remsburg Sr. owed such a duty to the Montgomerys. <em>Rems-burg v. Montgomery, </em>373 Md. 406, 818 A.2d 1105 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">At approximately 4:30 a.m. on the morning of 28 November 1998, Brian Montgomery arrived at the Frederick, Maryland, house of his father, Charles Montgomery. Brian, an avid hunter, and Charles, who previously had hunted only smaller animals, proceeded to the northerly edge of the father\u2019s property where they hid themselves in underbrush awaiting the official start of deer hunting season.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At approximately 6:00 a.m. the two heard what they determined to be the sound of another hunter taking a position in a nearby tree stand. In order to avoid scaring away any deer in the area, and because legal hunting time did not commence for approximately 20 minutes, the Montgomerys prepared to leave the area without alerting any nearby deer or the newly arrived hunter to their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">At or about 6:15 a.m., while preparing to depart from his hidden position, Charles Montgomery moved to massage a leg <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>cramp and was immediately struck by a single projectile. The shotgun slug first grazed Brian\u2019s neck, causing a severe abrasion on his neck and temporary deafness, then passed through Charles\u2019 upper right arm (injuring the humerus bone, severing the main artery to the upper right arm, and damaging surrounding nerves), before finally lodging in Charles\u2019 upper right torso. The Montgomerys soon learned that the shot had been fired by Remsburg Jr., an experienced hunter who, before properly identifying his target and prior to the legal inception of the deer hunting season, had fired from his position in a nearby tree stand. Remsburg Jr., a 27 year old emancipated adult who had participated in over 550 previous hunting outings, was a member of a hunting party organized by his father, Remsburg Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-5\">After realizing his mistake, Remsburg Jr. called to his father who was positioned in another tree stand approximately 250 yards away, off the Montgomery property. Remsburg Sr. and other members of the Remsburg hunting party responded to the call. Upon arriving at the scene of the accident, Remsburg Sr. commented, \u201cI guess that rules out telling Jamie [Remsburg Jr.] to shoot at the first thing that moves,\u201d and also indicated to Charles Montgomery that he should have been wearing more orange outerwear.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">Although the Montgomerys and the Remsburgs respectively were unaware that the members of the other group planned to hunt on that particular section of the Montgomery property on the morning of <em>28 </em>November 1998, the two families were well acquainted and had a long history of interactions regarding hunting rights on the Montgomery property. For a number of years prior to the pertinent incident, Remsburg Sr. leased hunting rights on the property from James Montgomery, Charles Montgomery\u2019s father. This right was granted in exchange for $500, which was paid annually by way of services performed by Remsburg Sr. on the Montgomery farm.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> After James Montgomery\u2019s death in 1995, control of the Montgom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"576\">*576</page-number>ery farm and property passed to his children, including Charles Montgomery. In the years following James Montgomery\u2019s death, Charles Montgomery gave Remsburg Sr. verbal permission to hunt on the Montgomery property; however, Charles asserted in the Circuit Court in this case that he intended to deny Remsburg Sr. permission to hunt on the Montgomery property for the 1998 hunting season, but had not done so because Remsburg Sr. never contacted him prior to 28 November 1998 to secure permission to hunt on the Montgomery property for the approaching deer season.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">Whatever the status of his understanding with the Montgomery family, Remsburg Sr. also entered into a written agreement with Howard Payne, in or about 1997, that provided Remsburg Sr. with rights to hunt on Payne\u2019s property adjacent to the Montgomery property. On the morning of the accident in this case, all members of Remsburg Sr.\u2019s hunting party, with the exception of Remsburg Jr., were positioned on the Payne property. As noted <em>swpra, </em>Remsburg Jr. was positioned in a tree stand located on the Montgomery property, which stand had been built years earlier by Remsburg Jr.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">In their complaint, the Montgomerys alleged generally that Remsburg Sr. was liable to the Montgomerys for the injuries they sustained as a result of a member of Remsburg Sr.\u2019s hunting party trespassing on the Montgomery property and negligently hunting there. The Montgomerys further alleged that the trespass was at the direction of Remsburg Sr., that Remsburg Sr. negligently breached his duty of care to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"577\">*577</page-number>Montgomerys by failing to instruct properly his son in hunting safety and otherwise encouraging his son to participate in unsafe hunting practices, and that Remsburg Sr. negligently entrusted his son with a gun.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Additionally, the Montgomerys charged that Remsburg Sr. owed a duty of care to the Montgomerys by virtue of his joint enterprise and concerted actions with Remsburg Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">The Circuit Court granted Remsburg Sr. summary judgment on all counts. In dismissing the negligence action, the judge observed that the element of \u201cduty would have to arise out of a special relationship under Maryland law, and there just simply is no \u2014 its not a factual matter, but there\u2019s not any relationship that\u2019s proffered or pled or presumed under any theory in Maryland law that would support a finding of liability.\u201d The judge also noted that there was no Maryland precedent supporting an action for bodily damages as a result of a trespass action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">On appeal, the Montgomerys argued to the Court of Special Appeals that the Circuit Court judgment was erroneous as a matter of law because a duty was imposed by both Maryland\u2019s hunting laws and the long term relationship between Rems-burg Sr. and the Montgomery family. Additionally, the Mont-gomerys contended that the existence of such a relationship \u201cis a matter of factual determination to be decided by the trier of fact,\u201d and may not be resolved, therefore, in a motion for summary judgment. They further maintained that summary judgment was granted erroneously because the trial judge drew factual inferences favoring the moving party, Remsburg Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"578\">*578</page-number>While refusing to hold that Remsburg Sr. owed a <em>per se </em>duty to the Montgomerys, the Court of Special Appeals concluded that a duty may exist if Remsburg Sr. actively induced his son to believe there would be no other persons present in the vicinity on the morning of the accident. <em>Montgomery, </em>147 Md.App. at 595-96, 810 A.2d at 33. The Court of Special Appeals found that there were material facts in genuine dispute regarding this issue to prevent entry of summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">Petitioner presents the following questions for our consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-6\">(1) whether the Co\u00fart of Special Appeals applied an incorrect standard of review for summary judgment by considering and relying upon factual proffers that were not supported by, and in some cases were contradicted by, admissible evidence on record;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-7\">(2) whether the Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that Remsburg Sr. could owe a duty in tort to the Mont-gomerys to protect them from the negligent acts of a third party, experienced hunter; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-8\">(3) whether, even if Remsburg Sr. owed a duty to the Montgomerys, the independent act by Remsburg Jr. of shooting was a superceding cause of the Montgomerys\u2019 injuries, which relieved Remsburg Sr. of liability.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b614-9\">Because we find the answer to the second question dispositive of this matter, we reach and decide only that question. We conclude as to that, under the undisputed, material facts of the case <em>sub judice, </em>Remsburg Sr. had no duty in tort to protect the Montgomerys from the negligent acts of Remsburg Jr. Accordingly, we shall reverse the judgment of the Court of Special Appeals and remand the case to that court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>directions that it affirm in full the judgment of the Circuit Court for Frederick County.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Maryland Rule 2-501(e)(2001) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-7\">\u201cthe court shall enter judgment in favor of or against the moving party if the motion and response show that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact <em>and </em>that the party in whose favor judgment is entered is entitled to judgment as a matter of law\u201d <em>(emphasis </em>added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">An appellate court reviews a trial court\u2019s grant of a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo.

Co. </em>366 Md. 201, 210, 783 A.2d 194, 199 (2001). \u201cThe trial court will not determine any disputed facts, but rather makes a ruling as a matter of law. The standard of appellate review, therefore, is whether the trial court was legally correct.\u201d <em>Williams v. Mayor &amp; City Council of Baltimore, </em>359 Md. 101, 114, 753 A.2d 41, 48 (2000) <em>(internal citations </em>omitted) (quoting <em>Baltimore Gas &amp; Elec. Co. v.

The standard for appellate review of a summary judgment is whether it is \u2018legally correct\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">When reviewing a grant of summary judgment, we must make the threshold determination as to whether a genuine dispute of material fact exists, and only where such dispute is absent will we proceed to review determinations of law. <em>See Todd, </em>373 Md. at 154-55, 816 A.2d at 933; <em>Beyer, </em>369 Md. at 359-60, 800 A.2d at 721; <em>Schmerling, </em>368 Md. at 443, 795 A.2d at 720. In so doing, we construe the facts properly before the court, and any reasonable inferences that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>may be drawn from them, in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Todd, </em>373 Md. at 155, 816 A.2d at 933 (citing <em>Okwa v. Harper, </em>360 Md. 161, 178, 757 A.2d 118, 127 (2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">We have held that neither general denials nor proffered facts which lack detail and precision are sufficient to defeat a properly plead motion for summary judgment. <em>Beatty v. Trailmaster, </em>330 Md. 726, 737-38, 625 A.2d 1005, 1011 (1993)(citing <em>Lynx, Inc. v. Ordnance Products, Inc., </em>273 Md. 1, 7-8, 327 A.2d 502, 509 (1974)); <em>see also Goodwich v. Sinai Hospital of Baltimore, Inc., </em>343 Md. 185, 207, 680 A.2d 1067, 1078 (1996) <em>(citations </em>omitted). To oppose properly a motion for summary judgment, the facts presented must not only be detailed, but also admissible in evidence. <em>See Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 737-38, 625 A.2d at 1011 (citing <em>Hoffman Chev. v. Wash. Co. Nat\u2019l Sav., </em>297 Md. 691, 711-15, 467 A.2d 758 (1983); <em>Shaffer v. Lohr, </em>264 Md. 397, 404, 287 A.2d 42 (1972); <em>Broadfording Church v. Western Md. Ry., </em>262 Md. 84, 89, 277 A.2d 276 (1971)). Furthermore, the mere presence of a factual dispute in general will not render summary judgment improper. <em>See Beatty, </em>330 Md. at 738, 625 A.2d at 1011 (quoting <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 247-48, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2509-10, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). As we explained in <em>Lippert v. Jung, </em>366 Md. 221, 783 A.2d 206 (2001), \u201ca dispute as to facts relating to grounds upon which the decision is not rested is not a dispute with respect to a <em>material </em>fact and such dispute does not prevent the entry of summary judgment.\u201d 366 Md. at 227, 783 A.2d at 209 (quoting <em>Salisbury Beauty Schs. v. State Bd. of Cosmetologists, </em>268 Md. 32, 40, 300 A.2d 367, 374 (1973)) (Emphasis in original). \u2018Where the record shows that there was no such genuine dispute as to any material fact necessary to resolve the controversy as a matter of law, and it is shown that the movant is entitled to judgment, the entry of summary judgment is proper.\u201d <em>Lynx, </em>273 Md. at 8, 327 A.2d at 509 (citing <em>Selected Risks Ins. Co. v. Willis, </em>266 Md. 674, 296 A.2d 424 (1972); <em>S.L. Hammerman Organization, Inc. v.

Montgomery Co., </em>370 Md. 447, 472, 805 A.2d 372, 387 (2002) (quoting <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 549, 727 A.2d 947, 949 (1999)); <em>see also Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 716, 697 A.2d 1371, 1376 (1997) (\u201cThe existence of a duty is a matter of law to be determined by the court and, therefore, is an appropriate issue to be disposed of on motion for dismissal\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">The case <em>sub judice </em>presents a matter of first impression in this Court. The essential question is whether, under the facts of this case, a hunter who organizes a hunting party may be held liable in negligence for injuries caused to others as a result of the negligent acts of another member of his or her hunting party. Remsburg Sr. argues that under Maryland law, no duty is imposed upon him to protect persons from the negligent acts of other hunters in his or her hunting party. Therefore, Remsburg Sr. contends that because he may not be held liable for the acts of Remsburg Jr., he was under no legal duty to protect the Montgomerys from injuries resulting from Remsburg Jr.\u2019s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-6\">The Montgomerys counter that where a special relationship exists, a duty is owed not only to the parties involved in the relationship, but also to third parties. They argue that Rems-burg Sr.\u2019s status as father of Remsburg Jr. and \u201corganizer\u201d of the hunting party, as well as his encouragement of his son to hunt in a manner dangerous to others, provide the necessary elements to support a determination that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed between Remsburg Sr. and his son whereby Remsburg Sr. was obligated to control his son\u2019s conduct. In the alternative, Respondents argue that a special relationship existed between Remsburg Sr. and the Montgomerys by virtue of a history of contractual and other relations between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the parties, and also Maryland statutes regulating hunting practices.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">We have said that for a plaintiff to state a prima facie claim in negligence, he or she must allege facts demonstrating \u201c(1) that the defendant was under a duty to protect the plaintiff from injury, (2) that the defendant breached that duty, (3) that the plaintiff suffered actual injury or loss, and (4) that the loss or injury proximately resulted from the defendant\u2019s breach of the duty.\u201d <em>Muthukumarana v. Montgomery Co., </em>370 Md. 447, 486, 805 A.2d 372, 395 (2002) (quoting <em>Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 549, 727 A.2d at <em>949)(citations </em>omitted). As first established in Maryland nearly a century ago:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b618-5\">there can be no negligence where there is no duty that is due; for negligence is the breach of some duty that one person owes to another. It is consequently relative and can have no existence apart from some duty expressly or impliedly imposed. In every instance before negligence can be predicated of a given act, back of the act must be sought and found a duty to the individual complaining, the observance of which duty would have averted or avoided the injury----As the duty owed varies with circumstances and with the relation to each other of the individuals concerned, so the alleged negligence varies, and the act complained of never amounts to negligence in law or in fact; if there has been no breach of duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b618-8\"><em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 714, 697 A.2d 1371, 1375 (1997) (quoting <em>West Virginia Cent. &amp; P.R. v. State ex rel. Fuller, </em>96 Md. 652, 666, 54 A. 669, 671-72 (1903)). Thus, our analysis of a negligence cause of action usually begins with the question of whether a legally cognizable duty existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-9\">When assessing whether a tort duty may exist, we often look to the definition in <em>Prosser and Keeton on Torts </em>\u00a7 53 (W. Keeton 5th ed.1984), which characterizes \u201cduty\u201d as \u201can obligation, to which the law will give recognition and effect, to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\u201d <em>See Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 486, 805 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>395 <em>(quoting Ashbum v. Anne Arundel Co., </em>306 Md. 617, 627, 510 A.2d 1078, 1083 (1986)). In determining the existence of a duty, we consider, among other things:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"azg-dedup-0\">the foreseeability of harm to the plaintiff, the degree of certainty that the plaintiff suffered the injury, the closeness of the connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct and the injury suffered, the moral blame attached to the defendant\u2019s conduct, the policy of preventing future harm, the extent of the burden to the defendant and consequences to the community of imposing a duty to exercise care with resulting liability for breach, and the availability, cost and prevalence of insurance for the risk involved.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-5\"><em>Ashburn, </em>306 Md. at 627, 510 A.2d at 1083 (quoting <em>Tarasoff v. Regents of University of California, </em>17 Cal.3d 425, 434, 131 Cal.Rptr. 14, 22, 551 P.2d 334, 342 (1976)). While foreseeability is often considered among the most important of these factors, its existence alone does not suffice to establish a duty under Maryland law. As we further clarified in <em>Ashbum:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"AC73\">[t]he fact that a result may be foreseeable does not itself impose a duty in negligence terms. This principle is apparent in the acceptance by most jurisdictions and by this Court of the general rule that there is no duty to control a third person\u2019s conduct so as to prevent personal harm to another, unless a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d exists either between the actor and the third person or between the actor and the person injured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083 <em>(citations </em>omitted); <em>see also Scott v.

As noted, <em>supra, </em>the Montgomerys allege that such special relationships exist in the case <em>sub judice </em>sufficient to allow liability to attach to Rems-burg Sr. for the negligent acts of Remsburg Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">In <em>Bobo v. State, </em>346 Md. 706, 697 A.2d 1371 (1997), we held that such a \u201cspecial duty\u201d to protect another from the acts of a third party may be established \u201c(1) by statute or rule; (2) by contractual or other private relationship; or (3) indirect<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>ly or impliedly by virtue of the relationship between the tortfeasor and a third party.\u201d 346 Md. at 715, 697 A.2d at 1376 <em>(internal citations </em>omitted). We address in turn these three possibilities with regard to the existence of such a relationship between the Montgomerys and Remsburg Sr., or between Remsburg Sr. and Remsburg Jr., which could place Remsburg Sr. under a duty to protect the Montgomerys from the negligent acts of Remsburg Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">We first examine whether Maryland statutes or regulations regarding hunting create a duty in tort upon Remsburg Sr. to protect the Montgomerys. Evidence of negligence may be established by the breach of a statutory duty \u201cwhen the plaintiff is a member of the class of persons the statute was designed to protect and the injury was of the type the statute was designed to prevent.\u201d <em>Erie Ins.

Res. Art., \u00a7 10-301 et. seq. and the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR), 08.03, et. seq.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>After an exhaustive review of these sources in their entireties, we find no support for the Montgomerys\u2019 argument. The statutes and regulations alluded to by the Montgomerys address many things, such as the procedures for the issuance of hunting licenses and the number and type of wildlife and game that may be hunted, the definition of open seasons, and protecting endangered species. Absent from these statutes and regulations is any specific mention of a duty placed upon a leader of a hunting party, by virtue of his or her position as such, to protect all other hunters or landowners from the negligent acts of members of his or her hunting party. Of these \u201cauthorities,\u201d the only one with arguable relevance to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>the case <em>sub judice </em>is McLCode, Nat. Res. Art. \u00a7 10-411, which regulates hunting on privately owned land. That provision states in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b622-5\">[ejxcept as otherwise provided, a person may not come to hunt upon any pretense whatever on lands owned by another person without the permission of the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee. Any person hunting on private property shall be liable for any damage he causes to the private property while hunting. The landowner is not liable for accidental injury or damage to the person, whether or not the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee gave the permission to hunt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">Regarding deer hunting specifically, the statute provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADg\">[i]n Allegany, Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Charles, Garrett, Frederick, Wicomico, Somerset, Howard, or Worcester counties, a person may not enter or trespass upon land owned by another person for the purpose of hunting deer on the land with gun, rifle, bow and arrow, or any other means without first securing the written permission of the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee. Any person hunting deer on land owned by another person shall exhibit written permission upon the request of any Natural Resources police officer, any law enforcement officer, the landowner, or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee. The Natural Resources police officer or any law enforcement officer shall arrest any person hunting without -written permission upon the request of the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">This statute, like the other provisions cited by the Mont-gomerys, does not serve to impose either an explicit or implicit duty upon Remsburg Sr. to protect the Montgomerys from the negligent acts of Remsburg Jr. Explicit in this statute is a duty placed upon hunters to gain written permission from landowners prior to hunting on privately owned land, and also a duty upon law enforcement officers, upon the request of the landowner or his or her representative, to arrest any person without such permission. While the statute is framed so as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>indicate a legislative desire to protect landowners, a class of persons which would include Charles Montgomery at least, the statute may not be read reasonably to create a tort duty upon Remsburg Sr. to protect the Montgomerys. The general provision of the statute is designed to protect landowners from liability for injuries to parties hunting on their land and also to place liability on those who damage private property. Notably, the assignment of liability ends there and the statute makes no mention of assigning liability for the negligence of third parties. Furthermore, the statutory provision concerning deer hunting guards only against trespass and does not extend the general protection of the statute in any way so as to place liability on a hunter for the negligence of another hunter. That provision speaks only to the liability of an individual hunter for his or her own failure to obtain the requisite written permission. As such, the Montgomerys\u2019 contention that this statute creates a duty in tort upon Rems-burg Sr. fails under the second leg of the test described <em>supra, </em>in that the injury to the Montgomerys, not being an injury to property, was not an injury or damage of the type the statute intended to prevent. Remsburg Sr. was neither directly responsible for the personal injury to the Montgomerys, nor a hunter on the Montgomery property at the time of the accident. Remsburg Sr.\u2019s alleged actions and inactions, therefore, were outside the scope of the statute. As the Court of Special Appeals correctly determined \u201cthese laws do require a hunter to control <em>his or her own conduct, </em>by conforming it to the established legal parameters for hunting; but we see nothing in them to broadly require all hunters to ensure that their hunting companions do the same.\u201d <em>Montgomery v. Remsburg, 147 </em>Md.App. 564, 598-99, 810 A.2d 14, 34 (2002) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">We turn next to the question of whether a contractual relationship existed in the case <em>sub judice </em>that would place a special duty upon Remsburg Sr. It is undisputed that no contract existed between Remsburg Sr. and Remsburg Jr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>The Montgomerys repeatedly deny that any contractual agreement existed between Remsburg Sr. and Charles Montgomery that would include the land where the accident occurred. Assuming the truth of all well-plead factual aver-ments in the Montgomerys\u2019 complaint and drawing reasonable inferences in their favor, the Montgomerys allege at most that a contractual relationship previously existed between James Montgomery, Charles\u2019s father, and Remsburg Sr. The Mont-gomerys contend, however, that a special duty should be placed upon Remsburg Sr. arising out of the ten years of \u201cbusiness relations\u201d between the parties, including previous and present lease agreements concerning nearby property.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">In support of their contention, the Montgomerys look to <em>Griesi v. Atlantic General Hospital Corp., </em>360 Md. 1, 756 A.2d 548 (2000). The facts of and legal analysis employed in that case are inapposite to the case <em>sub judice. </em>In <em>Griesi </em>we examined whether Griesi, a jobseeker, had a valid claim of negligent misrepresentation resulting in economic loss where he rejected other offers of employment based upon affirmative statements made to him during pre-employment negotiations with the hospital, a prospective employer. We examined whether the requisite intimate nexus existed between the parties such that a negligent misrepresentation claim could be maintained. In this regard, we observed that \u201cMaryland law has found the equivalent of contractual privity in special relationships consummated during the course of pre-contract negotiations.\u201d 360 Md. at 12, 756 A.2d at 554. We found that evidence of extensive and detailed communications between the parties was sufficient for a jury to find that the hospital \u201cfailed to exercise reasonable care\u201d in its communication of information to Griesi, that the hospital\u2019s chief executive officer responsible for making the statements knew or should have known that they would be relied upon to Griesi\u2019s detriment, and that Griesi in fact relied on those statements of information and was injured as a result when the hospital denied him employment after he refused alternative offers of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">The case <em>sub judice </em>does not involve an examination of the relationship between the parties in order to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>viability of a negligent misrepresentation cause of action. None of the parties here were engaged in any sort of pre-contractual negotiations, nor was there any evidence of reliance by the Montgomerys upon any affirmative statements of Remsburg Sr. Rather, the Montgomerys contend that there was no communication between the parties regarding the 1998 shotgun deer hunting season. Furthermore, the injury in <em>Griesi </em>involved economic loss which could be linked directly to the extensive negotiations between the parties. The personal injuries in the instant case could not be attributed directly to any present contractual or pre-contractual relations between Remsburg Sr. and the Montgomerys. As our determination regarding the existence of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d in <em>Griesi </em>was based upon the entirely different theory of recovery of negligent misrepresentation, that decision offers no succor for the Montgomerys\u2019 argument in the case <em>sub </em>judice.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Finally, we examine whether, on the alleged material facts, a special duty was created between Remsburg Sr. and the Montgomerys by virtue of the implied or indirect relationship between Remsburg Sr. and Remsburg Jr. or, alternatively, between Remsburg Sr. and the Montgomerys. Our review of the relevant case law reveals that the creation of a \u201cspecial duty\u201d by virtue of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties can be established by either (1) the inherent nature of the relationship between the parties; or (2) by one party undertaking to protect or assist the other party, and thus often <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>inducing reliance upon the conduct of the acting party. We conclude that the Montgomerys did not establish a triable issue as to the existence of a special relationship by either of these methods.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">In <em>Lamb v. Hopkins, </em>303 Md. 236, 492 A.2d 1297 (1985), we discussed in detail the inherent nature of the relationship between parties which could give rise to liability for the actions of a third party. In <em>Lamb, </em>we found that the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>was applicable to analysis of negligence liability for third party actions. Regarding the Restatement, we observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-6\">[s]ection 315 is a special application of the general rule set forth in \u00a7 314. Section 314 states that \u201c[t]he fact that the actor realizes or should realize that action on his part is necessary for another\u2019s aid or protection does not of itself impose upon him a duty to take such action.\u201d In turn, \u00a7 315 articulates the general rule that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-7\">[t]here is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-8\">(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b626-9\">(b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">303 Md. at 242, 492 A.2d at 1300. In reviewing our history of both citation and reference to \u00a7 315, we found that our decision in <em>Scott v. Watson, </em>278 Md. 160, 359 A.2d 548 (1976), \u201csuggests that \u00a7 315, which reflects the common law of this State, outlines the appropriate analytical framework for determining whether an actor has a duty to control a third person.\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>303 Md. at 245, 492 A.2d at 1302.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">We continued by examining in further detail the class of special relationships giving rise to a duty to control a third person\u2019s conduct based on the <em>relationship between the third </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number><em>person and the actor. </em>We found such relations were described in Restatement \u00a7\u00a7 316-19, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-4\">[s] ection 316 provides that a parent has a duty to control the conduct of his minor child; \u00a7 317 establishes a master\u2019s duty to control the conduct of his servant; \u00a7 318 sets forth the duty of a possessor of land or chattels to control the conduct of a licensee; and \u00a7 319 deals with the duty of those in charge of persons having dangerous propensities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b627-5\"><em>Lamb, </em>303 Md. at 243, 492 A.2d at 1300-01; <em>see also Hartford Ins. Co. v. Manor Inn of Bethesda, Inc., </em>335 Md. 135, 150, 642 A.2d 219, 226 (1994) (\u201c[although section 315 of the Restatement states the general rule, section 319 addresses a particular exception to that general rule\u201d). We expressly adopted as Maryland common law \u00a7 319, which provides: \u201c[o]ne who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.\u201d <em>Lamb, </em>303 Md. at 243, 492 A.2d at 1301. Delineating the boundaries of \u00a7 319, we stated that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-6\">[t] he operative words of this section, such as \u201ctakes charge\u201d and \u201ccontrol,\u201d are obviously vague, and the Restatement makes no formal attempt to define them. The comment to \u00a7\u00a7 319, however, indicates that the rule stated in that section applies to two situations. First, \u00a7\u00a7 319 applies to those situations where the actor has charge of one or more of a class of persons to whom the tendency to act injuriously is normal. Second, \u00a7\u00a7 319 applies to those situations where the actor has charge of a third person who does not belong to such a class but who has a peculiar tendency so to act of which the actor from personal experience or otherwise knows or should know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b627-7\">Illustrations appended to \u00a7\u00a7 319, which concern the negligent release of an infectious patient from a private hospital for contagious diseases and the escape of a homicidal maniac patient through the negligence of guards employed by a private sanitarium for the insane, provide further guidance regarding the scope of \u00a7\u00a7 319. Because there are degrees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>of being \u201cin charge\u201d and having \u201ccontrol,\u201d these illustrations are obviously not by way of limitation. <em>See McIntosh v. Milano, </em>168 N.J.Super. 466, 488 n. 11, 403 A.2d 500, 508-09 n. 11 (1979). These illustrations suggest, however, that \u00a7\u00a7 319 has peculiar application to <em>custodial situations. </em>See Prosser and Keeton, supra, \u00a7\u00a7 56 &amp; n. 16, at 383 (indicating that the relationships discussed in \u00a7\u00a7 319 \u201care custodial by nature\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">303 Md. at 243-44, 492 A.2d at 1301 <em>(emphasis added).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">The Montgomerys have not alleged any evidence which would establish sufficiently that any of the above relationships existed between Remsburg Sr. (the actor) and Remsburg Jr. (the third person). Section 316 does not apply as Remsburg Jr. was an emancipated adult, not a minor child, and thus Rems-burg Sr. was under no duty to control his son\u2019s behavior. Section 319 is also inapplicable for a number of reasons. The Montgomerys allege that Remsburg Sr. should have known that his son would have the tendency to act injuriously. This contention, however, is unsubstantiated. They point to no evidence in the record even suggesting that Remsburg Sr. knew or should have known of such. It is undisputed that Remsburg Jr. was an experienced hunter who had been on over 550 previous hunting trips. Remsburg Jr. had been hunting numerous times before with his father, and the Mont-gomerys have not alleged any evidentiary facts that Remsburg Jr. ever acted negligently at any time prior to the day of the accident in question here.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The Montgomerys further allege that Remsburg Sr.\u2019s comment after the accident, \u201cI guess that rules out telling Jamie [Remsburg Jr.] to shoot at the first thing that moves,\u201d evidenced his knowledge of Remsburg Jr.\u2019s tendency to act injuriously. While inappropriate at best, this comment may not be viewed reasonably in context as an indication of any knowledge as to Remsburg Jr.\u2019s tendencies. Had Remsburg Sr. commented that Remsburg Jr. \u201calways shoots the first thing that moves\u201d or such other similar admissions, it would more likely support an inference of prior knowledge on the part of Remsburg Sr.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>Even if such knowledge were shown, however, the relationship between Remsburg Jr. and Remsburg Sr. still would fail to establish a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d within the sweep of \u00a7 319 because the Montgomerys did not allege sufficiently that Remsburg Sr. was \u201cin charge\u201d of Remsburg Jr. As we noted in <em>Lamb, </em>\u00a7 319 has distinctive application to custodial situations. We do not find that Remsburg Sr.\u2019s status as the \u201cleader\u201d of a hunting party creates a <em>custodial </em>relationship between himself and the members of his party. We decline to find such a broad relationship under these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">A special relationship nonetheless may be found to exist under the second class of relations described by the Restatement, <em>relations between the actor and the third party </em>that create a duty upon the actor to protect another from the third party. These relations are described in \u00a7\u00a7 314 A and 320 of the Restatement. <em>Lamb, </em>303 Md. at 243, 492 A.2d at 1301, n. 5. We have adopted previously as Maryland common law \u00a7 314A of the Restatement, entitled \u201cSpecial Relations Giving Rise to a Duty to Aid or Protect,\u201d which provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-5\">(1) [a] common carrier is under a duty to its passengers to take reasonable action</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-6\">(a) to protect them against unreasonable risk of physical harm....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-7\">(2) An innkeeper is under a similar duty to his guests.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-8\">(3) A possessor of land who holds it open to the public is under a similar duty to members of the public who enter in response to his invitation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b629-9\">(4) One who is required by law to take or who voluntarily takes the custody of another under circumstance such as to deprive the other of his normal opportunities for protection is under a similar duty to the other.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 314A (1965)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark>; <em>see Southland Corp. v. Griffith, </em>332 Md. 704, 719, 633 A.2d 84, 91 (1993). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>While this list was not intended to provide an exhaustive or inclusive description of the relationships between two parties such that it might give rise to a duty, a review of our previous cases reveals that the type of relationships where we have found such a duty require an element of dependence not present in the case <em>sub judice. See, e.g., Todd v. MTA, </em>373 Md. 149, 165, 816 A.2d 930, 939 (2003) (finding that an employee of a common carrier has a legal duty to take affirmative action for the aid or protection of a passenger under attack by another passenger); <em>Southland, </em>332 Md. at 720, 633 A.2d at 91 (finding that a convenience store, through its employee and by virtue of special relationship between the business and its customers, owed a legal duty to a customer being assaulted in store parking lot to call the police for assistance when requested to do so). While we have permitted some flexibility in defining this limited exception, such as including the employer-to-employee relationship and also that of the business owner-to-patron, we have been careful not to expand this class of \u201cspecial relationships\u201d in such a manner as to impose broad liability for every group outing.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>there is no relationship of dependance between Remsburg Sr. and the Montgomerys sufficient to establish a duty to protect. The fact that Remsburg Sr. had a history of interactions with the Montgomery family regarding hunting rights and work arrangements does not make Charles or Brian Montgomery dependent upon Rems-burg Sr. for protection against the negligent \u2022 acts of third parties. The Montgomerys, as the landowners, had complete control of their property and chose to hunt upon it. The Montgomerys contend that they lacked even the knowledge that the Remsburgs intended to hunt on the property that morning. Thus, there clearly was no dependence upon Rems-burg Sr. to protect the Montgomerys from the negligent acts of other hunters. Remsburg Sr.\u2019s presence on the neighbor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>ing Payne property did not affect the Montgomerys\u2019 control of their property.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">We also have found that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d may be created in limited circumstances by virtue of a party\u2019s actions. In determining whether a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between the parties has been created as a result of one party\u2019s actions, we have declined to adopt a formulaic test, preferring instead to review each case in light of the general standard formulated in <em>Ashbum. Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. at 495, 805 A.2d at 401. In <em>Ashbum, </em>the plaintiff filed suit against a law enforcement officer who failed to prevent an allegedly drunk driver from continuing to operate his vehicle which ultimately collided with plaintiff. 306 Md. at 619-20, 510 A.2d at 1079. The officer allegedly encountered John Millham in the driver\u2019s seat of his pickup truck outside of a convenience store. Noticing his intoxicated condition, the officer instructed Millham to park his truck and discontinue driving for the rest of the evening; however, after the officer left, Millham drove the truck out of the parking lot and subsequently hit and injured a pedestrian, Ashburn.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">After first recognizing the general rule that an officer\u2019s duty to protect is a public duty, and \u201cabsent a \u2018special relationship\u2019 between police and the victim, liability for failure to protect an individual citizen against injury caused by another citizen does not lie against police officers,\u201d we went on to examine whether the actions of the police officer or Maryland statute created a \u201cspecial duty.\u201d 306 Md. at 628, 510 A.2d at 1083. We explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-7\">This \u201cspecial duty rule,\u201d as it has been termed by the courts, is nothing more than a modified application of the principle that although generally there is no duty in negligence terms to act for the benefit of any particular person, when one does indeed act for the benefit of another, he must act in a reasonable manner.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number><em>Ashbum, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085 (citing <em>Scott v.

Thus, we stated that in order for a special relationship to be created between the officer and Ashburn, \u201cit must be shown that the local government or the police officer affirmatively acted to protect the specific victim or a specific group of individuals like the victim, thereby inducing the victim\u2019s specific reliance upon the police protection.\u201d <em>Id. (citations omitted). </em>We found that the officer\u2019s act of approaching the intoxicated individual in his truck and instructing him to discontinue driving was insufficient to establish an affirmative act specifically for Ashburn\u2019s benefit or to induce his reliance upon the officer; thus, no special relationship existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">In <em>Muthukumarana, </em>370 Md. 447, 805 A.2d 372 (2002), we recently applied the <em>Ashbum </em>standard in our evaluation of two consolidated negligence claims against emergency telephone system operators. In the first of the consolidated cases, a communications officer with the Harford County Sheriffs Office received a call reporting a female laying semiconscious in the woods behind the K Court buildings in the Harford Square residential development. Upon dispatching the information to police officers on patrol, the communications officer erroneously reported that the female was lying to the rear of J Court, instead of K Court. The two responding police officers searched the areas behind the J Court and J1 Court townhomes, but did not locate the female. Later that night, the unconscious female died from hypothermia at the location behind K Court. The decedent\u2019s mother, Ms. Fried, filed suit against the communications officer and her supervisors, arguing that they owed a duty of care to the decedent \u201cbased on the fact that the [decedent] was an individual and a member of the class of persons who are the subjects of 911 or emergency calls, ... and injury to her from failing to give correct location information was readily foreseeable,\u201d 370 Md. at 462, 805 A.2d at 381 <em>(quoting Fried v. Archer, </em>139 Md.App. 229, 243, 775 A.2d 430, 438, <em>cert. granted, </em>366 Md. 246, 783 A.2d 221 (2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>In the second of the consolidated cases, the appellee, a 911 operator at the Montgomery County Emergency Communication Center, received a distress call from appellant, Ms. Mu-thukumarana, reporting that her husband was trying to kill her. At that time, the emergency operator dispatched the police, but continued to talk to Ms. Muthukumarana in an attempt to gain information from her, including her name, the address and nature of the emergency, the name and location of the attacker, and whether any weapons were in the home. During this telephone conversation, which lasted approximately one minute and forty seconds, the husband, armed with a gun, entered the room and shot his two children, who were huddled with their mother, and then shot himself. Both children and Mr. Muthukumarana died as a result of these wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">Appellant, Ms. Muthukumarana, filed a wrongful death and survival action for her two children against the emergency dispatch operator. Appellant argued that the emergency operator \u201cnegligently and carelessly failed to discharge her responsibilities,\u201d by failing to advise her to leave the premises in a timely manner. She further maintained that even if the emergency operator typically was protected by a qualified immunity, a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d existed between Ms. Muthu-kumarana and the operator by virtue of certain affirmative actions taken by the operator upon which Ms. Muthukumara-na relied to her detriment. Thus, a special duty arose. In addition, Ms. Muthukumarana maintained that a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d was created between herself and the 911 operator because Montgomery County government previously acted to send her, as a victim of prior domestic violence, a pamphlet instructing her to call 911 in the event of a future attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">After consolidation of the cases on appeal, the question before this Court was whether the lower courts erred in <em>Fried </em>and <em>Muthukumarana </em>\u201cin applying the special relationship test to 911 employees, specifically to operators, dispatchers, and managers, and in subsequently determining that the employees in questions had no special relationship with or special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>duty owed to the individual victims.\u201d 370 Md. at 471, 805 A.2d at 386. We concluded that they had not erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">Initially, we determined that emergency assistance operators enjoy a qualified immunity under the public duty doctrine and, absent a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d with a caller, held that no such special relationship was established in either case. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b634-6\">Under [the <em>Ashbwm </em>] test, in order for a special relationship between a 911 employee and a person in need of assistance to exist, it must be shown that the 911 employee affirmatively acted to protect or assist the specific individual, or a specific group of individuals like the individual, in need of assistance, thereby often inducing the specific reliance of the individual on the employee. <em>See Ashbwm, </em>306 Md. at 631, 510 A.2d at 1085. Absent the existence of those factors, a special relationship may not be found to exist between the employee and the individual, and a 911 employee may not be held liable in tort to an individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">370 Md. at 496, 805 A.2d at 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Applying the <em>Ashbwm </em>analysis to the facts of the <em>Fried </em>case, we found no evidence that the emergency operator handled the telephone call at issue any differently than other calls received; thus, there was no action taken by the operator sufficient to impose a special duty in tort upon her. Furthermore, with regard to the emergency operator\u2019s supervisor, we found that no evidence was provided \u201cof any action taken by [the supervisor] in this case in excess of or substantially different than his actions towards other individuals in need of 911 assistance.\u201d 370 Md. at 500, 805 A.2d at 404. As such, we found it unnecessary to determine the applicability of the second prong of the special relationship test.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">In the <em>Muthukumarana </em>case, we held that the emergency operator was not negligent because the undisputed facts indicated that she had not deviated from the proper protocol for dealing with emergency telephone calls. Additionally, we stated that, even if the 911 operator had been deemed negligent, Ms. Muthukumarana could not prevail because the un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>disputed facts did not support a conclusion favorable to her under the first prong of the special relationship test. We emphasized that the mere receipt of the call did not in itself create a special duty between the 911 officer and the victims, nor did the operator take any action to protect or assist the victims directly which would result in the creation of a special relationship. Finally, we concluded that the receipt of the instructional pamphlet also did not create a special duty, as it served only as a reminder of the services available to the general public through the emergency telephone system.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">We conclude that Remsburg Sr. did not owe a duty to the Montgomerys to protect them from the negligent acts of Remsburg Jr. While our previous cases examining the existence of a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d created by a party\u2019s actions or inactions involve public officials for the most part, we extract from them the general principle that we examine whether such a relationship exists on a case-by-case basis, looking especially for the existence of conduct by one party that ordinarily induces reliance by the injured party upon the acting party. In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we find no conduct by Remsburg Sr. to protect the Montgomerys, or a class of persons including them, which induced their reliance upon him. Remsburg Sr.\u2019s previous relations with the Montgomer-ys concerning hunting on their property did not constitute an act to protect the Montgomerys under the facts of this case. Furthermore, nothing in the record to which our attention has been directed by the Montgomerys supports the allegation that Remsburg Sr. told Remsburg Jr. to take a position in the tree stand on the Montgomery property. Regardless, even such an instruction, had it been given, would not constitute conduct taken for the protection of the Montgomerys sufficient to induce their reliance.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The Montgomerys finally argue that the nature of hunting makes it inherently dangerous and, as such, a heightened duty must be attached to those who undertake it. Maryland precedent does not support such a heightened duty under the circumstances present in this case. It is the inherent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>danger of the instruments used in the hunt which makes hunting any more inherently dangerous than a wide variety of other recreational activities and sports. In <em>Valentine v. On Target, Inc., </em>353 Md. 544, 727 A.2d 947 (1999), we addressed the inherent danger of guns, and declined to assign a heightened duty to gun dealers to protect all persons that may be harmed by guns sold by or stolen from the dealers. Similarly, placing a duty upon the \u201cleader\u201d of a hunting party to protect other persons from the negligent acts of all members of the hunting party, by virtue of the inherent danger in hunting and the potential use (or mis-use) of guns alone, would impose liability upon far too broad a class of persons. <em>See Valentine, </em>353 Md. at 553, 727 A.2d at 951 (no special relationship between gun retailer and victim of shooting crime perpetrated with weapon stolen from retailer, because \u201c[t]he class of persons to whom a duty would be owed under these bare facts would encompass an indeterminate class of people, known and unknown\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Finally, it is worthwhile to mention briefly that the only other state court seemingly confronted with a comparable situation to that presented in the present case reached a conclusion similar to that reached here. In <em>Kramschuster v. Shaum E., </em>211 Wis.2d 699, 565 N.W.2d 581 (Wis.Ct.App.1997), the Court of Appeals of Wisconsin granted summary judgment to the leader of a hunting party, finding he was not liable for the death of the plaintiffs husband, who was shot and killed as a result of the negligence of a minor who was a member of the hunting party.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In that case, a 15-year old, Shawn E., was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>invited to join a hunting party consisting of Mr. McClelland and his 12-year old son. In anticipation of the start of deer-hunting season, the party stayed at a cabin located on land owned by McClelland. The following morning, the party proceeded to adjacent land, not owned by McClelland, and McClelland instructed Shawn where to position himself and also in which general direction he should shoot in order to drive any potentially injured deer toward the other members of the party. Before sunrise, and prior to the legal inception of the deer hunting season, Shawn fired his gun at what he thought to be a group of deer, but was in fact a group of other hunters walking on a nearby path. Allen Kramschuster was struck and killed as a result of this negligent action.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">The <em>Kramschuster </em>court first observed that although Shawn was a minor, he had completed hunting safety courses and was familiar with hunting safety regulations. Using this knowledge, he had made an independent determination as to where and when to fire his weapon. 211 Wis.2d at 707, 565 N.W.2d at 584. While McClelland had failed to instruct Shawn regarding the presence of the path and the initiation of the hunting season, the court concluded that \u201cfailure to reiterate basic hunting rules to an independent member of the hunting party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>does not create a foreseeably unreasonable risk of injury to another person under these facts.\u201d 211 Wis.2d at 707, 565 N.W.2d at 585. The <em>Kramschuster </em>court then rejected the allegation that McClelland had a duty to supervise Shawn as a member of his hunting party, finding that McClelland \u201caccepted no responsibility of supervision by merely inviting ... Shawn to join them in the hunt.\u201d 211 Wis.2d at 707-08, 565 N.W.2d at 585. Lastly, the court found no evidence that McClelland actively mislead Shawn into firing before the start of the hunting season or induced the erroneous belief that no other hunters would be present in the area. The court observed that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-5\">[t]he record does not show that McClelland ever told Shawn that there would be no other humans in the area. Even if McClelland had made such a statement, Shawn had seen other people in the area and was aware that the trail could be utilized by other hunters. Therefore, Shawn could not have reasonably relied on any statement that no humans would be in the area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b638-6\">The evidence also does not support any suggestion that McClelland communicated to Shawn a time to start shooting. Shawn had independently, although incorrectly, concluded what time the hunting season began in his area and admittedly shot before the start of the season, as he believed it to be. Therefore, there is no evidence that McClel-land actively induced Shawn to fire before it was safe.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"amc-dedup-0\">211 Wis.2d at 708-09, 565 N.W.2d at 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b638-7\">Like Shawn, Remsburg Jr. was an experienced hunter who was familiar with the land on which he was hunting. Rems-burg Jr. made an independent determination as to the appropriate time and direction to fire his weapon. The record in the case <em>sub judice </em>shows no evidence that Remsburg Sr. acted to induce Remsburg Jr. into believing that there would be no other persons hunting on the property, or that he should fire his gun at any time prior to the legal inception of the deer hunting season. Maryland law, like Wisconsin law, does not support the creation of a duty to supervise or control the actions of another experienced hunter merely by inviting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>person to join a hunting party. Moreover, unlike Shawn, a minor, Remsburg Jr. was a fully emancipated adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-4\">VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-5\">For the above reasons, we conclude that Remsburg Sr., as a matter of law, was not liable for the injuries to the Montgom-erys arising out of Remsburg Jr.\u2019s negligent conduct. Rems-burg Sr. was under no duty to the Montgomerys to control the acts of Remsburg Jr. or to protect them from the acts of Remsburg Jr. Without a duty there can be no actionable negligence and, as such, the trial court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Remsburg Sr. was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED; CASE REMANDED TO THAT COURT WITH DIRECTIONS TO AFFIRM THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR FREDERICK COUNTY; COSTS IN THIS COURT AND IN THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS TO BE PAID BY RESPONDENTS.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">Chief Judge BELL concurs in the result only.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b610-8\">. Shotgun deer hunting season officially began at 12:01 a.m. on 28 November 1998; however, hunting at night is prohibited by statute, which, at the time of the accident involved in this case, defined \"night\u201d as one-half hour after sunset through one-half hour before sunrise.

Respondents, in their Brief (at 14 and 17), refer apparently to the entirety of Subtitle 3 (Hunting Licenses) of Title 10 (Wildlife) of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>Natural Resources Article of the Md.Code, as well as Title 8 (Department of Natural Resources), Subtitle 3 (Wildlife), Chapters 10 (General Wildlife Hunting Regulations), 11 (Reptile and Amphibian Possession and Permits), and 12 (Wildlife Rehabilitations) of COMAR. Yet, nowhere in their Brief do they identify any particular section or subsection within these \"authorities\u201d as supporting their argument. Rather, Respondents elsewhere cite specifically only \u00a7 10-411 of the Natural Resources Article of the Md.Code, a provision in a succeeding Subtitle ((4)(Hunting Restrictions \u2014 in general)) to the one to which they otherwise refer.

I agree with the Court that, as a general rule, a person who organizes a hunting party is not liable in negligence for injuries caused solely by the negligence of another member of the party. I agree that Remsburg, Sr. was not in \u201ccontrol\u201d of his adult son, Remsburg, Jr., although there is no evidence that the son would not have obeyed a reasonable directive of the father. Finally, I agree that neither \u00a7 10-411 of the Natural Resources Article nor any other statute cited by the Montgomerys provides direct liability for personal injury to the Montgomerys on the part of Remsburg, Sr. for the negligent conduct of his son.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-10\">I do believe, however, that a limited duty does exist under \u00a7 10-411 from which liability on Remsburg, Sr.\u2019s part could be found in this case. The conduct at issue here occurred in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>Frederick County, making applicable \u00a7 10-411(b) and (c). Section 10-411(b)(l) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b640-5\">\u201cA person may not upon any pretense come to hunt on the lands owned by another person without the written permission of the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee. Any person hunting on this private property is liable for any damage the person causes to the private property while hunting on the private property. The landowner may not be liable for accidental injury or damage to the person whether or not the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent gave permission to hunt on the private property.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">Section 10-411(c) deals specifically with deer hunting and contains a similar provision. In certain counties, including Frederick County, a person \u201cmay not enter or trespass upon land owned by another person for the purpose of hunting deer on the land ... without first securing the written permission of the landowner or the landowner\u2019s agent or lessee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">The Court correctly construes the second sentence of \u00a7 10-411(b)(1) as applying only to damage to the property, not to personal injuries, and it correctly construes the third sentence as dealing with the liability of the landowner, not the hunter. It dismisses \u00a7 10-411(c) and the first sentence of \u00a7 10-411(b)(1) as merely statutory trespass provisions, from which no liability for personal injury can flow. That is where I disagree. These <em>are </em>trespass provisions, of course, but they have a purpose beyond merely prohibiting a trespass. A statute is not necessary to preclude trespass. The common law has done that quite well for hundreds of years. These statutes are not in the Real Property Article of the Code. They are in a subtitle of the Natural Resources Article dealing solely with restrictions on hunting, which, because of the very nature of the activity, is exceedingly dangerous, often more dangerous to other persons in the area than to the animals being hunted.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-8\">What is the purpose of requiring written permission from a landowner before a stranger can enter his/her land to hunt? The Court seems to infer that the only purpose is to create <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>some documentary evidence that permission has been granted. That inference may be permissible with respect to \u00a7 10-411(c), which requires the hunter to exhibit the written permission on demand of a game warden, but there is no basis for such an inference under \u00a7 10-411(b)(l). Both statutes, I believe, but particularly \u00a7 10-411(b), have a broader purpose, and that is to make sure that landowners are aware that hunters will be on their land, so that they can take the proper precautions. The Legislature may well have had in mind the prospect of landowners, or their children, walking innocently across fields or through woods on their own property, unaware that hunters have entered on to the property, and being shot. Those statutes are safety measures, not just property laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">It is undisputed that Remsburg, Sr. was, in fact, the leader and organizer of the hunt. There was clear, competent, admissible evidence that he did not have written permission from Charles Montgomery to hunt on his land and that he knew, or should have known, that no other member of his hunting party, including his negligent son, had such permission. Although he, himself, was not on Montgomery\u2019s land when the errant shot was fired, he knew that his son was on that land, perhaps at his direction and certainly with his acquiescence. Whether or not, as leader of the hunt, he had any duty to ascertain the whereabouts of the other members of the party, it seems to me that he at least had the duty to make sure that a member of the party whom he <em>knew </em>was illegally trespassing, whom he knew or should have known may thereby be endangering other people, and whom he presumably could cause to move, relocated to a lawful place.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Although a violation of \u00a7 10-411 may not, of itself, create liability for negligent conduct by another person, it does impose a duty on the organizer of hunts (and really on each hunter) to obtain written permission from the landowner. Because the purpose of that requirement \u2014 or at least a principal purpose of that requirement \u2014 is to protect the safety of the landowner and his/her family and guests, I believe that a violation of that duty can create liability for foreseeable harm arising from the violation. On this record, there was enough <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>evidence to make summary judgment improper. The real question was whether the harm that resulted was proximately caused by the failure to advise Montgomery of the intended invasion of his property, and, on this record, that was a jury issue.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
