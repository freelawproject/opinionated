Cafferty (\u201cRespondent\u201d) was admitted to the Maryland Bar on 19 December 1985 and the District of Columbia Bar in October 1986. On 3 July 2002, Respondent was disbarred in the District of Columbia by Order of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. <em>In re Glenn H. Carlson &amp; Diane E. Cafferty, </em>802 A.2d 341 (D.C.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b737-15\">The Attorney Grievance Commission of Maryland, acting through Bar Counsel, filed with this Court a petition for reciprocal disciplinary action against Respondent. Bar Counsel attached to its petition a certified copy of the District of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019s opinion in support of Bar Counsel\u2019s allegation that, because of Respondent\u2019s disbarment from the practice of law in the District of Columbia for engaging in conduct involving misappropriation and failure to render ac-countings promptly to clients upon request, Respondent should be disbarred also in Maryland. Based on the District of Columbia order disbarring Respondent, Bar Counsel alleges, under Maryland Rule 16-773,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> violations of the Maryland Rules of Professional Conduct (\u201cMRPC\u201d), including MRPC 1.15(a),1.15(b), and 1.15(c),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 8.4(c) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>8.4(d),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and Md. Rule 16-609.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Bar Counsel asks this Court to impose corresponding discipline to that imposed by the District of Columbia. This Court ordered that Respondent show cause why she should not be disbarred in Maryland. Respondent filed a response, and we heard argument in this matter on 5 June 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">As a preliminary matter, we observe that Md. Rule 16-773(g) addresses the conclusive effect of a prior disciplinary adjudication as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b739-5\">Except as provided in subsections (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this Rule, a final adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity in any proceeding under this Chapter. The introduction of such evidence does not preclude the Commission or Bar Counsel from introducing additional evidence or preclude the attorney from introducing evidence otherwise showing cause why no discipline or lesser discipline should be imposed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">We therefore accept the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\u2019s conclusion that Respondent recklessly misappropriated client funds and failed to render accountings promptly to her condominium clients upon request.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">On 30 December 1997, District of Columbia Bar Counsel filed a specification of charges against Respondent alleging that she violated D.C. Rules of Professional Conduct 1.15(a), 1.15(b), 8.4(b), and 8.4(c). D.C. Bar Counsel filed identical charges against Respondent\u2019s law partner, Glenn H. Carlson, and moved to consolidate both cases because they arose out of the Carlson &amp; Cafferty law firm\u2019s representation of owners of condominium units located at 1927 17th Street, N.W., in the District of Columbia. Respondent objected to the proposed consolidation claiming that consolidation would \u201ctaint\u201d her due to Mr. Carlson\u2019s individual conduct in these matters and his failure to cooperate with D.C. Bar Counsel. The D.C. Board on Professional Responsibility determined that Respondent would not be prejudiced by the consolidation and that consolidation was appropriate. Four days of testimony were received in 1998 and, approximately two years later, the D.C. Hearing Committee issued its Report, which the D.C. Board on Professional Responsibility reviewed and modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized the factual record as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b740-9\">\u201cDocuments in the record and the Board\u2019s Report reveal that in February 1985, during the last year of her law school studies, Ms. Cafferty worked as a law clerk at the firm of Kenny, Carlson &amp; Warren. After her graduation from law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>school and admission to the Maryland Bar, Ms. Cafferty joined the firm as an associate; she worked almost exclusively for Mr. Carlson. Around 1988, Mr. Carlson, Ms. Cafferty and Mr. Daniel Ferris left Kenny, Carlson &amp; Warren and established their own firm, Carlson, Cafferty &amp; Ferris. Mr. Ferris managed the firm\u2019s client trust fund. The firm became Carlson &amp; Cafferty after Mr. Ferris\u2019s departure to practice law in another jurisdiction, and Mr. Carlson assumed the position of managing partner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-4\">\u201cThe firm maintained a client trust fund at the Riggs Bank (\u201cthe Riggs Escrow Account\u201d), an operating account at the First Liberty National Bank between March 1992 and September 1995, and an account for Commercial Quest, Inc. at Riggs Bank, which was used as an operating account beginning around September 1995. Ms. Cafferty served as President of Commercial Quest, \u2018a separate business venture.\u2019 Both Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty had signatory authority on all of the firm\u2019s accounts. Ms. Hammond handled day-to-day management of the Riggs Escrow Account until she left the firm in 1993. The Board found that Ms. Cafferty \u2018regularly transferred moneys between the Riggs Escrow Account and the various accounts maintained by the law firm, generally at the direction of [Mr.] Carlson.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b741-5\">\u201cAround May 1989, Thomas Fritz, owner of a condominium unit at the 17th Street condominium, contacted Ms. Cafferty and asked her to represent him in his dispute with his condominium association over services and repairs at the condominium complex. She agreed, and Mr. Fritz decided to send his monthly condominium fee payments of $148.33 to Carlson &amp; Cafferty. These payments were made from around May 1989, through March 1996, and were sent with a letter addressed either to Ms. Cafferty, or to Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty. Each transmittal specified that the check should be put into the law firm\u2019s escrow account. Commencing in early 1990, at least two other residents of the 17th Street condominium sent monies to the law firm; these funds also were earmarked for the firm\u2019s escrow account. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>Other persons connected to the 17th Street condominium transmitted funds to the firm for the escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-4\">\u201cIn addition to making payments for the law firm\u2019s escrow account, Mr. Fritz and two other owners of condominium units in the 17th Street condominium retained Carlson &amp; Cafferty under a contingency fee arrangement, in March 1991, to take legal action against the principal officer of the 17th Street condominium\u2019s management company. Approximately ten months after the lawsuit was filed, the parties entered into a settlement agreement, and the settlement funds were placed in the Riggs Escrow Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-5\">\u201cAfter settlement, Carlson &amp; Cafferty continued to represent Mr. Fritz and other residents of the 17th Street condominium. In May 1992, Mr. Fritz and others retained the firm, at the hourly billing rate of $225, to \u2018prepare and update all condominium documents and to take steps necessary to have the [condominium association] in full compliance with the law and all governing documents.\u2019 Furthermore, when one of the persons whom the firm represented assumed responsibility for the management of the 17th Street condominium, bills of the condominium were sent to the firm for payment from escrow funds; some monthly condominium fees also were transmitted for deposit in the firm\u2019s escrow account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b742-6\">\u201cAfter retaining the firm in May 1992, the 17th Street condominium clients began to request billing statements, bylaws, and information about services that the firm had rendered. Responses to oral and written requests made between May 1992 and December 1994 were delayed. One accounting was received in October 1993, and at a February 1994 condominium association meeting, attended by Ms. Cafferty and Mr. Carlson, amended bylaws were submitted, as well as an accounting for funds received and paid on behalf of the association since 1989. The accounting showed that \u2018[Carlson &amp; Cafferty] had received over $60,000[,] ... had expended approximately $40,000, including $11,948.86 paid to the firm in fees and expenses\u2019 and $21,000 remained in escrow. Following the February 1994 meeting, Mr. Fritz <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>repeatedly asked the firm for additional accountings. An accounting was submitted in June 1995, and thereafter, no requested accounting was forthcoming until July 1997. By that time, two of the condominium clients had filed an ethical complaint against Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-4\">\u201cAround February and April of 1994, the Washington Federal Savings Bank, which had foreclosed on three of the 17th Street condominium units, began paying monthly condominium fees on these units to Carlson &amp; Cafferty for deposit into the firm\u2019s escrow account. When the 17th Street condominium was sold around March 1996, Washington Federal Savings Bank asked Mr. Carlson to disburse the funds held in the Riggs Escrow Account. Mr. Carlson sent a letter to Washington Federal Savings Bank on March 25, 1996, agreeing to disburse funds, except for $8,000 to be retained for potential liabilities. After the sale closed, Mr. Fritz and others repeatedly requested disbursement of the Riggs Escrow Account funds. Mr. Carlson did not honor these requests in a timely manner, undoubtedly because there were insufficient funds in the escrow account. In fact, the Board found that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-5\">By the Summer of 1996, when Carlson &amp; Cafferty were required to disburse to the condominium owners the more than $40,000 that they had received to hold in trust, only approximately $2,000 of the funds remained in the Riggs Escrow Account. The missing funds of the [condominium association] had been used by [Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty], without their clients\u2019 knowledge or consent, to pay themselves and other payees unrelated to the [condominium association], at times when the balance in the Riggs Escrow Account had fallen below the amount that [Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty] were required to hold in trust for the [condominium association].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b743-6\">\u201cThe reason for the shortage of funds in the escrow account is that beginning around April 1992, and continuing to around September 1995, Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty commingled the Riggs Escrow Account funds with other accounts and used the escrow funds for purposes not associ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ated with the affairs of the condominium clients or the condominium association. During the 1992 to 1995 period, \u2018numerous checks\u2019 that Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty wrote on their First Liberty National Bank operating account were dishonored due to insufficient funds. The Board found that bank records for the operating account \u2018reflected only three monthly periods in which the account was not overdrawn.\u2019 The Board also determined that: \u2018[Mr.] Carlson and [Ms.] Cafferty regularly wrote checks using funds from the Riggs Escrow Account to pay firm expenses at times they both knew that the law firm had a shortage of funds in its operating account at First Liberty Bank.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-4\">\u201cAfter the bank closed Carlson &amp; Cafferty\u2019s operating account, Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty \u2018transferred thousands of dollars in funds from the Riggs Escrow Account to the Commercial Quest account,\u2019 and began to use that account as its operating account. Between September 1995, and December 1995, $35,425.30 was deposited into the Commercial Quest account, and less than $1,000 of that sum was traceable to a source other than the Riggs Escrow Account. During the September to December 1995 period, Mr. Carlson did not spend much time in Carlson &amp; Cafferty\u2019s office and did not attend to the affairs of the law firm. Consequently, \u2018[Ms.] Cafferty signed many of the checks that were drawn on the Riggs Escrow Account that transferred these funds\u2019 to the Commercial Quest account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-5\">\u201cEven before the close of Carlson &amp; Cafferty\u2019s First Liberty National Bank operating account, Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty were using funds from the Riggs Escrow Account to pay themselves and office expenses. Bank records revealed that this practice began around November 1991 and continued through 1996, and into 1997. Indeed, some 94 checks signed by Ms. Cafferty in 1995 alone, were written on the Riggs Escrow Account and were made payable to \u2018cash\u2019 in sums ranging from $50.00 to $7,615.06. Funds from one \u2018cash\u2019 check for $678.00 were used to pay a Carlson &amp; Cafferty employee\u2019s rent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201cFunds deposited in the Commercial Quest account, which included monies transferred from the Riggs Escrow Account, also were used by Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty for cash purposes. During the period September to December 1995, Ms. Cafferty wrote checks to cash on the Commercial Quest account which totaled $3,294.15.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-4\">\u201cWhen she testified before hearing committee Number Five, Ms. Cafferty was asked about the checks made out to \u2018cash\u2019 that she wrote on the Riggs Escrow Account. She replied:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-5\">Well, ... [Mr.] Carlson told me to take the cash out of the account; that he had plenty of money in the account ... If the operating account were low, he\u2019d say take the money out of that and put the cash in the operating account so that it gets credited immediately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">She denied taking any of the condominium clients\u2019 funds, \u2018to [her] knowledge.\u2019 Instead, she maintained that funds for the checks made out to cash came out' of Mr. Carlson\u2019s father\u2019s estate money. She thought that Mr. Carlson \u2018had an abundance <em>of money.\u2019 </em>She also asserted that at the time, Mr. Carlson had obtained about $39,000 from his wife to put into the account.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-7\">\u201cMs. Cafferty acknowledged during her testimony before the hearing committee that one of the reasons Mr. Carlson, Mr. Ferris and she left their prior firm was because an attorney in that firm sought to use money from a client trust account to pay office expenses. She admitted knowing \u2018that [such use] was wrong at the time[.]\u2019 She also confirmed that she had personally deposited some of the condominium clients\u2019 money into the firm\u2019s client escrow account periodically. When Bar Counsel inquired whether she paid herself \u2018compensation out of the [client] trust account,\u2019 she responded:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b745-8\">Yes. When [Mr. Carlson] had his money in there, and I needed to get paid, he would say write it for cash, and he was loaning it to the firm from his money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>She added that she \u2018always thought that there were trusts within trusts that were theoretically insulated from each other.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b746-4\">\u201cBy June 1997, Carlson &amp; Cafferty still had not presented a final accounting to the condominium clients, and had not disbursed the condominium association funds that were supposed to be in the Riggs Escrow Account. Therefore, two of the condominium clients filed an ethical complaint against Carlson &amp; Cafferty. Mr. Carlson informed Ms. Cafferty of the shortage of funds in the Riggs Escrow Account, but stated that he would obtain $39,000 from his wife to replace the funds. He put the funds from his wife, as well as smaller sums, into an account that he had opened in July 1997 at the First Liberty National Bank, to bring the Liberty account up to $40,624.39. Then he deposited $40,536.05 of that amount in the Riggs Escrow Account, and paid that sum to the condominium clients and the Washington Federal Savings Bank.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">802 A.2d at 343-47 (internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-6\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals considered the report and recommendation of the D.C. Board on Professional Responsibility under a standard of review requiring the court to \u201caccept the findings of fact made by the Board unless they are unsupported by substantial evidence of record, and [to] adopt the recommended disposition of the Board unless to do so would foster a tendency toward inconsistent dispositions for comparable conduct or would otherwise be unwarranted.\u201d 802 A.2d at 347 (quoting D.C.Bar. R. XI, \u00a7 9(g)). The court, however, also observed that its review of whether Ms. Cafferty recklessly misappropriated client funds was a legal question which it reviewed <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b746-7\">The District of Columbia court noted that the definition of \u201cmisappropriation\u201d in D.C. was \u201cany unauthorized use of client\u2019s funds entrusted to [the lawyer], including not only stealing but also unauthorized temporary use for the lawyer\u2019s own purpose, whether or not [she] derives any personal gain or benefit therefrom.\u201d 802 A.2d at 347-48 (quoting <em>In re </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number><em>Harrison, </em>461 A.2d 1034, 1036 (D.C.1983)). The court noted further that \u201cmisappropriation occurs whenever the balance in [the attorney\u2019s escrow] account falls below the amount due to the client\u201d and is \u201cessentially a <em>per se </em>offense.\u201d 802 A.2d at 348. Because of the serious nature of a misappropriation offense, the District of Columbia \u201cadhered to a standard of presumptive disbarment,\u201d except in cases of negligent misappropriation or extraordinary circumstances. 802 A.2d at 348. The District of Columbia classifies misappropriation cases into three categories: (1) intentional misappropriation; (2) reckless misappropriation; and (3) negligent misappropriation. The principle of presumptive disbarment applies only to the first two categories. <em>Id,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-4\">In the District of Columbia, Ms. Cafferty argued that if the facts of her case fell into any of the categories it was the negligent misappropriation category, and merited therefore only a six month suspension. <em>Id. </em>The D.C. Board, however, found her actions to constitute reckless misappropriation, meriting disbarment. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-5\">In that regard, the District of Columbia court opined that: The central issue in determining whether a misappropriation is reckless is <em>how </em>the attorney handles entrusted funds, whether in a way that suggests the unauthorized use was inadvertent or the result of simple negligence, or in a way that reveals either an intent to treat the funds as the attorney\u2019s own or a conscious indifference to the consequences of his [or her] behavior for the security of the funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-6\"><em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>In re Anderson, 778 </em>A.2d 330, 339 (D.C.2001)). In the District of Columbia, the examination of <em>how </em>the attorney handled entrusted funds and whether reckless misappropriation occurred entails examination of \u201ca pattern or course of conduct demonstrating an unacceptable disregard for the welfare of entrusted funds, such as (1) the indiscriminate commingling of entrusted and personal funds, (2) the failure to track settlement proceeds, (3) the disregard of the status of accounts into which entrusted funds were placed, or (4) per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>mitting the repeated overdraft condition of an account.\u201d 802 A.2d at 348-49. The court also noted that \u201cthe indiscriminate movement of monies between accounts\u201d and the \u201cdisregard of inquiries concerning the status of funds\u201d were other factors indicating recklessness. 802 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The court distinguished Ms. Cafferty\u2019s case from another misappropriation case, <em>In re Anderson, </em>stating that <em>Anderson </em>involved a single act of misconduct and a finding of negligent misappropriation, whereas Ms. Cafferty \u201cengaged in a pattern of course or conduct demonstrating an unacceptable disregard for the welfare of entrusted funds.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). The court continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-5\">This pattern extended over several years, including substantial periods of time in which Mr. Carlson was not paying attention to the affairs of the firm, thus calling into question Ms. Cafferty\u2019s insistence that she acted only at the direction of Mr. Carlson, and that the entire blame for the misappropriation falls squarely on him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">802 A.2d at 349. The District of Columbia court observed that in <em>Anderson, </em>although there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Anderson engaged in reckless misappropriation and related violations involving a single failure to pay a client\u2019s medical bill from settlement funds, the court noted that \u201c[i]f in fact Mr. Anderson ignored or willfully blinded himself to ... reminders [by the client that the bill had not been paid], then we would have no difficulty sustaining the [hearing committee\u2019s] determination of recklessness.\u201d <em>Id.' </em>(quoting <em>Anderson, </em>778 A.2d at 341). The court found that precise situation in Ms. Cafferty\u2019s case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Ms. Cafferty ignored repeated requests by the 17th Street condominium clients for an accounting of client trust funds. She also willfully blinded herself to Mr. Carlson\u2019s improper transfer of funds from the Riggs Escrow Account to Carlson &amp; Cafferty\u2019s operating accounts, as well as to the consequences of her own improper use of the Riggs Escrow Account by writing checks to \u201ccash\u201d for personal payments. As the Board noted in another reckless misappropriation case, \u2018this is not a case where all of the conduct resulting in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number>a misappropriation was caused by someone else.\u2019 <em>In re Gregory, </em>790 A.2d 573, 578 n. 1 (D.C.2002). Indeed, the record clearly and convincingly demonstrates Ms. Cafferty\u2019s active and reckless involvement in the misappropriation of client trust funds.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b749-4\">802 A.2d at 349.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">Ms. Cafferty\u2019s culpable behavior was described as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AZy\">\u201cMs. Cafferty was a signatory on the firm\u2019s accounts, including the Riggs Escrow Account. She was well-attuned to the impropriety of using client funds to pay for personal expenses, and she had left a prior firm because a partner had engaged in the practice. Nonetheless, bank records reveal that at least from late 1991, and continuing through mid-1996, Ms. Cafferty personally wrote numerous checks on the Riggs Escrow Account that were made out to cash, in amounts ranging from $50.00 to $7,615.06. During this period of time, Carlson &amp; Cafferty\u2019s operating account at the First Liberty National Bank was overdrawn repeatedly, to such an extent that the bank closed the account in 1995. To create another operating account, Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty transferred thousands of dollars from the Riggs Escrow Account to the Commercial Quest, Inc. account, designed initially for a business venture headed by Ms. Cafferty. The Board specifically found that \u2018[Ms.] Cafferty signed many of the checks that were drawn on the Riggs Escrow Account that transferred these funds\u2019 to the Commercial Quest account, despite the fact that she personally deposited some of the funds sent to the law firm by the 17th Street condominium clients into the escrow account and thus knew that the Riggs Escrow Account contained client trust funds. After transferring funds from the escrow account to the Commercial Quest account, Ms. Cafferty wrote checks out to \u2018cash\u2019 on that account in the amount of $3,294.15. By mid-1996, when the condominium clients were seeking disbursement of approximately $40,000.00 in client trust funds, less than $2,000.00 remained in the Riggs Escrow Account.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>\u201cFurthermore, Ms. Cafferty acknowledged that she even paid herself with funds from the Riggs Escrow Account, but again sought to shift the blame to Mr. Carlson. As she asserted during her testimony before the hearing committee, in response to a question about her receipt of compensation from the client trust fund: \u201cWhen [Mr. Carlson] had his money in there, and I needed to get paid, he would say write it for cash, and he was loaning it to the firm from his \u25a0 money.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b750-4\">\u201cMs. Cafferty wrote checks on the Riggs Escrow Account, made out to cash, when she knew about requests from the condominium clients for accountings. She attended meetings of the 17th Street condominium association and became aware that repeated requests had been made for an accounting of the client trust funds. Even though she may not have prepared or seen the reports, she was present at the condominium association meetings when inaccurate and misleading accounting reports were distributed to her clients. She also knew that she and Mr. Carlson were the only lawyers in the firm; that personal funds from Mr. Carlson were being placed in the client trust fund; and that beginning in or around 1994, Mr. Carlson was not paying proper attention to the affairs of the law firm due to personal problems, including protracted problems with his marriage and heavy drinking, leaving substantial responsibility for the affairs of the firm to her. Yet, she took no steps to ensure the \u2018safety and welfare of entrusted funds.\u2019 <em>In re Anderson, </em>778 A.2d at 338. Instead, she personally displayed \u2018an unacceptable disregard for the security of the client funds,\u2019 <em>id. </em>(citation omitted) and \u2018a conscious indifference to the consequences of [her] behavior for the security of these funds[,]\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 339 (reference omitted). In short, her actions relating to the Riggs Escrow Account were not inadvertent or negligent. Rather, the record contains clear and convincing evidence that she recklessly misappropriated client trust funds. The record also supports the Board\u2019s determination that Ms. Cafferty failed to render accountings promptly to her condominium clients upon request. She <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>attended meetings of the condominium association, including one in February 1994, and many of the written requests for accountings were addressed to her. Hence, Ms. Cafferty was aware of the requests for accountings, but made no effort to see that they were rendered in a timely fashion. For example, despite repeated requests, after the delayed submission of an accounting in June 1995, for an additional accounting, none was forthcoming until two of the condominium clients filed an ethical complaint against Mr. Carlson and Ms. Cafferty. Thus, the record contains clear and convincing evidence that Ms. Cafferty failed to render ac-countings promptly to her condominium clients upon request.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b751-5\">802 A.2d at 349-51 (internal footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b751-6\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals also addressed Ms. Cafferty\u2019s contention that the consolidation of her case with Mr. Carlson\u2019s case violated her due process rights. The court noted the importance of judicial economy in consolidating the cases because they both arose out of their joint representation of the 17th Street condominium clients, and concluded that the record revealed that no prejudice accrued to Ms. Cafferty. 802 A.2d at 351.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b751-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b751-9\">Ms. Cafferty argues that this Court should find compelling her enumeration of \u201cundisputed\u201d facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>\u201cIt is undisputed that, throughout her entire professional career (since 1985), Respondent Cafferty never managed the accounts of the firm and in particular the trust account, as the Hearing Committee and the Board correctly concluded;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-5\">\u201cIt is undisputed that Respondent Cafferty never wrote a single check except at the express direction of Carlson;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-6\">\u201cIt is undisputed that Respondent Cafferty, on a number of occasions during the time period Bar Counsel maintains misappropriations were being made, asked complainants to take possession and control of the funds at issue;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-7\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the complainants never dealt with Cafferty concerning the sale of the condo; they had nothing to do with her for more than a year prior to the sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-8\">\u201cIt is undisputed that, after the closing(s), the complainants never asked Respondent Cafferty to [disburse] the funds nor did they inform her that Carlson had failed to do so upon request;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-9\">\u201cIt is undisputed that Carlson prepared all the account-ings;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-10\">\u201cIt is undisputed that Cafferty did not have the data necessary to generate an accounting;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-11\">\u201cIt is undisputed that throughout the representation, complainants received periodic accountings from Carlson;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-12\">\u201cIt is undisputed that although Fritz [a condominium association client] wanted accountings more frequently, complainants continued to retain the firm, specifically Mr. Carlson;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-13\">\u201cIt is undisputed that the primary accounting issue had to do with Mr. Thompson\u2019s abject failure to make timely payments in the proper amount; [and]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b752-14\">\u201cIt is undisputed that Respondent Cafferty has never been the subject of any disciplinary action, prior to this matter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b752-15\">Respondent asks us to disregard the findings and conclusions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and instead rely on the conclusions drawn by the D.C. Hearing Committee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the D.C. Board of Professional Responsibility that she had not acted dishonestly as alleged by D.C. Bar Counsel. Ms. Caf-ferty argues that it was inconsistent for the D.C. Hearing Committee and D.C. Board to each find that she had not acted dishonestly, but nonetheless recommend that she be disbarred from the District of Columbia Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">Respondent analogizes her case to that of <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Powell, </em>328 Md. 276, 614 A.2d 102 (1992), a case involving the alleged misappropriation of funds in which we found that there was a lack of clear and convincing evidence of \u201cdishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation.\u201d 328 Md. at 292, 614 A.2d at 110. Respondent notes that Mr. Powell was the only attorney responsible for the trust account and that he was aware that there was a probability that his client\u2019s funds might be mis-deposited. 328 Md. at 295, 614 A.2d at 112. Powell also had arranged a \u201cloan\u201d from a client and subsequently bounced the repayment check although the funds were ultimately repaid. <em>Id. </em>This Court found that the misappropriation had been unintentional and suspended Powell for six months. Respondent notes that we took into account that Powell had been in practice for twenty years with no prior occurrences of misconduct. 328 Md. at 301, 614 A.2d at 115. Respondent contends that, like Powell, she engaged in no prior instances of misconduct in her fifteen years as a member of the D.C. Bar. Respondent points out she fully cooperated with Bar Counsel, unlike Powell, who was found to have been \u201cless than cooperative and reasonable in his responses to Bar Counsel\u2019s investigation.\u201d 328 Md. at 299, 614 A.2d at 114. Respondent also relies on <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Ober, </em>350 Md. 616, 714 A.2d 856 (1998), where we took note of Mr. Ober\u2019s spotless record when determining his sanction.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-6\">She lastly urges us to find that she is not a threat to the public and that disbarring her from the practice of law in the State of Maryland would be a solely punitive action and thus inconsistent with one of our self-avowed purposes in imposing disciplinary sanctions. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Awuah, </em>346 Md. 420, 435, 697 A.2d 446, 454 (1997) (noting that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>\u201c[t]he public is protected when sanctions are imposed that are commensurate with the nature and gravity of the violations and the intent with which they were committed\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-6\">We conclude that Ms. Cafferty\u2019s conduct, as found by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, is more analogous to that found in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001), and <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 810 A.2d 996 (2002), than to <em>Powell </em>or <em>Ober. </em>The misconduct in <em>Powell </em>involved the disbursement of various settlement funds to a single client. Mr. Powell maintained two bank accounts in connection with his law practice. The first was maintained at Sovran Bank, and the second was maintained at Fund for Government Investors, Inc. (\u201cFGI\u201d). The FGI account was intended as the sole depository of the pertinent settlement funds. 328 Md. at 281, 614 A.2d at 105. Of the nine settlement checks Powell received, he deposited three into the Sovran account and six into the FGI account. <em>Id. </em>Powell and his client had numerous telephone conversations and exchanged several letters involving the settlement funds between 23 March 1988 and 17 May 1989. 328 Md. at 283-85, 614 A.2d at 106-07. Arrangements were made to defer Powell\u2019s payment of the owed settlement proceeds for Powell\u2019s use in the form of a personal loan. 328 Md. at 284, 614 A.2d at 106. Powell ultimately gave his client a promissory note in the amount due to her from the settlement proceeds. 328 Md. at 285, 614 A.2d at 107. Although the principal of the promissory note, together with accrued interest, was due on 2 January 1989, Powell did not send his client anything until a check for interest only on 14 April 1989. That check was returned for insufficient funds. 328 Md. at 285, 614 A.2d at 107. After receiving notice of the dishonored check, Powell told his client, by letter dated 17 May 1989, to redeposit the check, which she did. <em>Id. </em>The client filed a complaint with the Attorney Grievance Commission in August of 1989 because she had not heard from Powell again since the 17 May 1989 letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>We found that Powell unintentionally misappropriated $52,000 of his client\u2019s funds by depositing them into the Sovran account. After discovering this mis-deposit, Powell calculated what was due him in fees and expenses and determined that transferring the money into the FGI account and then back into the Sovran account would be pointless. 328 Md. at 300, 614 A.2d at 114-15. We concluded that although Powell\u2019s conduct came perilously close to gross negligence, the unintentional misappropriation was not grossly negligent. <em>Id. </em>In meting out the appropriate sanction, we reasoned as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-4\">We are aware that Powell has been in private practice for over twenty years and that this is the first time he has been charged with professional misconduct. We also are aware that the funds in this case are those of a single client. The record also is replete with the many personal and familial problems confronting Powell during this period of time. Yet, despite the many problems that confronted Powell, the trial court found that Powell was a more than capable attorney during this period.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b755-5\">After careful consideration of this matter, we have determined that a substantial suspension is called for. Accordingly, Robert Dominick Powell will be suspended indefinitely from the practice of law with the right to reapply not less than six months from the date of the filing of this opinion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8K\">328 Md. at 302, 614 A.2d at 115.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-6\">Unlike Powell, who committed a single infraction, Respondent was found by the District of Columbia court to have engaged in a pattern of misappropriation. She ignored repeated requests by the 17th Street condominium clients for an accounting of client trust funds and willfully blinded herself to Mr. Carlson\u2019s improper transfer of funds from the Riggs Escrow Account to Carlson <em>&amp; </em>Cafferty\u2019s operating accounts, as well as to the consequences of her own improper use of the Riggs Escrow Account by writing checks to \u201ccash\u201d for personal payments. In comparison, Powell kept in contact with his client and regularly responded to the client\u2019s requests for accountings, although his responses were not always satisfac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>tory. Moreover, the District of Columbia court also found that the record indicated Respondent\u2019s active and intentional involvement in misappropriating client trust funds. Respondent\u2019s reliance on <em>Ober </em>is likewise misplaced because Mr. Ober was found to have engaged in unintentional misappropriation, unlike Ms. Cafferty.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">In <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 414, 418, 773 A.2d at 485, 488, Ms. Vanderlinde was charged with violating Rule 8.4 as a result of embezzling funds from her employer over a period of time. We stated in <em>Vanderlinde </em>that disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction \u201cin cases of stealing, dishonesty, fraudulent conduct, the intentional misappropriation of funds or other serious criminal conduct.\u201d 364 Md. at 414, 773 A.2d at 485. We observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-5\">Upon reflection as a Court, in disciplinary matters, we will not in the future attempt to distinguish between degrees of intentional dishonesty based upon convictions, testimonials, or other factors. Unlike matters relating to competency, diligence, and the like, intentional dishonest conduct is closely entwined with the most important matters of basic character to such a degree as to make intentional dishonest conduct by a lawyer almost beyond excuse. Honesty and dishonesty are, or are not, present in an attorney\u2019s character.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b756-6\">Disbarment ordinarily should be the sanction for intentional dishonest conduct____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">364 Md. at 418, 773 A.2d at 488.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">We disbarred an attorney in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Gallagher, </em>371 Md. 673, 810 A.2d 996 (2002), for unmitigated and intentional misappropriation of client funds. Mr. Gallagher established an escrow account for his client and then proceeded to \u201cintentionally and consistently\u201d deplete the funds of that account without the permission of his client. 371 Md. at 706, 810 A.2d at 1016. Even after the client demanded the return of the money, Gallagher continued to deplete the account. When Gallagher did return the entire amount due his client from the proceeds received in another transaction, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"721\">*721</page-number>he failed to keep that money in trust after it was deposited in the account and before it was disbursed to his client. 371 Md. at 706-07, 810 A.2d at 1016. We disbarred Gallagher after noting our \u201cconsistent practice of disbarment of lawyers who misappropriate client funds absent mitigation or extenuating circumstances.\u201d 371 Md. at 715, 810 A.2d at 1021.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">We found that Mr. DiCicco in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. DiCicco, </em>369 Md. 662, 686, 802 A.2d 1014, 1027 (2002), commingled funds and misused trust money in violation of MRPC 1.15(a) <em>&amp; </em>(c), MRPC 8.4(a)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, and Md. Rules 16-607(a)<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and 16-609. We imposed a ninety-day suspension. The hearing judge found that DiCicco failed to deliver funds owed to his client\u2019s medical provider until two years after the settle<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>ment of a negligence claim, although he did so on the instruction of his client. 369 Md. at 674, 802 A.2d at 1020-21. Throughout the course of DiCicco\u2019s representation of his client, DiCicco did not keep the disputed funds separate from his own personal funds and on numerous occasions the balance of the escrow account fell below the $3,500 DiCicco ultimately-paid the medical provider. <em>Id. </em>Thus, DiCicco violated Rules 1.15(a) &amp; (c) by failing to hold property of clients or third persons separate from his own. We agreed with the hearing judge\u2019s assessment that DiCicco \u201cused [the escrow account] as if it also served as his personal bank account.\u201d 369 Md. at 676, 802 A.2d at 1022. In deciding on an appropriate sanction, we noted that although misappropriation usually mandates disbarment, \u201c[w]here there is no finding of intentional misappropriation, however, and where the misconduct did not result in financial loss to any of the respondent\u2019s clients, an indefinite suspension ordinarily is the appropriate sanction.\u201d 369 Md. at 687, 802 A.2d at 1028. We imposed suspension rather than disbarment based on the respondent\u2019s absence of fraudulent intent, lack of evidence that any client suffered financial loss, and the lack of evidence of any prior disciplinary problems in respondent\u2019s thirty-eight year membership at the Maryland Bar. 369 Md. at 688, 802 A.2d at 1028.</p>\n<p id=\"b758-4\">We noted the importance of the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of fact regarding allegations of attorney misappropriation in <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Santos, </em>370 Md. 77, 87, 803 A.2d 505, 511 (2002). In the <em>Santos </em>case, the attorney was found, in addition to other offenses, to have engaged regularly in the practice of depositing all funds received from his clients, including unearned fees and expenses, into his operating account, in violation of MRPC 1.15 and Md. Rule 16-604. 370 Md. at 83, 803 A.2d at 508. Santos failed to return unearned fees to his clients. <em>Id. </em>We noted that disbarment was the preferred sanction in cases involving misappropriation, but declined to impose that sanction because the hearing judge did not find Santos\u2019 behavior to be \u201cdishonest or fraudulent or done with intent to defraud,\u201d referring instead to the conduct as \u201cneglect.\u201d 370 Md. at 87-88, 803 A.2d at 511. Based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"723\">*723</page-number>the finding by the hearing judge of misappropriation through neglect, we indefinitely suspended Santos with the right to apply for readmission no sooner than ninety days.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-4\">In <em>Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Seiden, </em>373 Md. 409, 818 A.2d 1108 (2003), the hearing judge found that Mr. Seiden, in his representation of one client, Ms. Mentlik, engaged in various acts of misappropriation of that client\u2019s funds. Seiden was hired by Mentlik to represent the estate for which she was the Personal Representative, and Seiden attended the settlement of some real property that was part of the decedent\u2019s estate. 373 Md. at 413, 818 A.2d at 1110. A check was tendered and made payable to Mentlik that Seiden then deposited into his account by signing Mentlik\u2019s name to the check. <em>Id. </em>The hearing judge did not find that Seiden had signed his client\u2019s name without her authority. <em>Id. </em>Seiden then wrote Ms. Mentlik a check from his own escrow account for the amount of the settlement, minus a sum representing his legal fee, but without submitting a fee petition to the Orphan\u2019s Court and without Mentlik\u2019s written consent to that fee. <em>Id. </em>We observed that the relationship between Seiden and Mentlik was troubled to such a degree that, although he never hid his actions from Mentlik, Seiden \u201cwas presented with an extremely difficult situation, in which he likely knew that it would be nearly impossible to procure his fee,\u201d and so \u201ctook the \u2018easy\u2019 shortcut to obtaining his fee.\u201d 373 Md. at 420, 818 A.2d at 1114. We noted that this type of conduct was not theft or \u201cthe type of dishonest conduct for which we consistently issue severe sanctions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that his misappropriation of client funds was not intentional and, therefore, imposed an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for readmission no sooner than thirty days. 373 Md. at 423, 425, 818 A.2d at 1117.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-6\">As noted above, Respondent asks us to disregard the factual findings and legal conclusions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals and instead rely on the findings of the D.C. Hearing Committee and the D.C. Board of Professional Re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>sponsibility. Maryland Rule 16-773(g), as noted above, addresses the conclusive effect of a prior final adjudication in a reciprocal disciplinary matters: \u201c[a] <em>final </em>adjudication in a disciplinary or remedial proceeding by another court, agency, or tribunal that an attorney has been guilty of professional misconduct or is incapacitated is conclusive evidence of that misconduct or incapacity----\u201d Md. Rule 16-773(g) (emphasis added). Therefore, we accept the final adjudication of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals as conclusive. There is no basis for us to consider the findings or conclusions of the intermediate D.C. Board on Professional Responsibility or the D.C. Hearing Committee. Only the final factual findings and legal conclusions of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals are relevant to our inquiry under Md. Rule 16-773(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b760-7\">Maryland does not recognize the three-tiered categorization of misappropriation misconduct employed by the District of Columbia. Instead, as <em>Vanderlinde </em>elucidates, disbarment is presumed to be the appropriate sanction for any intentional dishonest misconduct, including the intentional misappropriation of client funds. Taken as a whole, the Maryland cases discussed above provide us with an analytical framework we shall employ to classify Respondent\u2019s behavior for purposes of reciprocal discipline. We decline to compare the District of Columbia\u2019s three categories of misappropriation to the two categories in our analytical framework for misappropriation cases; instead, we shall apply our analytical framework to the factual findings of the District of Columbia court.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-8\">Our caselaw distinguishes between the intentional misappropriation of client funds and the misappropriation of client funds resulting from negligent or otherwise unintentional behavior. When there has been a finding of intentional misappropriation we have recognized as mitigating factors only \u201cthe most serious and utterly debilitating mental or physical health conditions, arising from any source that is the \u2018root cause\u2019 of the misconduct <em>and </em>that also result in an attorney\u2019s utter inability to conform his or her conduct in accordance with the law and with the MRPC.\u201d <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. at 413-14, 773 A.2d at 485. <em>See Attorney Griev.

The District of Columbia court described reckless misappropriation as encompassing acts of \u201cconscious indifference\u201d towards the use and management of client funds. 802 A.2d at 348. Although Maryland does not recognize three distinct and separate categories of misappropriation, we do distinguish between negligent and intentional misappropriation.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-5\">Respondent\u2019s \u201cconscious indifference\u201d in the use and management of the client trust account constitutes intentional misappropriation under Maryland law. Respondent\u2019s acts of misappropriation fall into what our cases have determined to be \u201cintentional\u201d behavior sanctionable by disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b761-6\">The District of Columbia Court of Appeals found Respondent was \u201cwell-attuned to the impropriety of using client funds to pay for personal expenses,\u201d and concluded that the record revealed that her actions regarding the Riggs Escrow Account were \u201cnot inadvertent or negligent,\u201d and instead demonstrated her \u201cactive and reckless involvement in the misappropriation of client trust funds.\u201d 802 A.2d at 349-50. The court construed the record as indicating that Ms. Cafferty knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>her behavior was wrong because of her association with a prior firm where one of the partners was engaging in such activity, and yet, she engaged in misappropriation activities including, at times, paying herself a salary out of the client trust account. 802 A.2d at 350. \u201cMs. Cafferty wrote checks on the Riggs Escrow Account, made out to cash, when she knew about requests from the condominium clients for ac-countings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b762-4\">In <em>Gallagher, </em>the attorney was disbarred for his unmitigated and intentional misappropriation of client funds. 371 Md. at 706, 810 A.2d at 996. We found that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"a-b-dedup-0\">[W]hen respondent established the Escrow Account for Mr. Lobo, he intentionally and consistently depleted the funds of said account without the permission of Mr. Lobo. Nearly every disbursal was directly to respondent himself, with the exception of the funds wired to Anglo American in England.

The missing funds were used by Respondent, without her clients\u2019 knowledge or consent, to pay herself and other payees unrelated to the condominium association or its business, at times when the balance in the Riggs Escrow Account had fallen below the amount required to be held in trust. 802 A.2d at 345. The District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed with the D.C.

The District of Columbia Court of Appeals, in discussing the impact on the public when an attorney steals client money, noted that the court\u2019s treatment of such offenses affects public confidence much more than the offense itself. <em>See In re Addams, </em>579 A.2d 190, 194 (D.C.1990). \u201cArguments for lenient discipline overlook this effect as well as the overriding importance of maintaining that confidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). We reiterate for our part that the purpose of sanctions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>includes the preservation of public confidence in the legal profession and the need to make clear to the bar that the invasion of and misappropriation of client funds will not be tolerated. As a result, we conclude that the disciplinary sanction imposed in the District of Columbia in the present case is appropriate also in Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">We stated in <em>Hayes </em>that the general rule is \u201cdisbarment will inevitably follow any unmitigated misappropriation of client, or any third party\u2019s funds.\u201d 367 Md. at 512-13, 789 A.2d at 124. <em>See, e.g., Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Vlahos, </em>369 Md. 183, 186, 798 A.2d 555, 556 (2002) (\u201cIt has long been the rule in this State that absent compelling extenuating circumstances, misappropriation by an attorney is an act infected with deceit and dishonesty and ordinarily will result in disbarment\u201d). We reasoned that \u201c[c]learly, one who acts with deliberation and calculation, fully cognizant of the situation and, therefore, fully intending the result that is achieved is more culpable than one who, though doing the same act, does so unintentionally, negligently or without full appreciation of the consequences.\u201d <em>Hayes, </em>367 Md. at 516-17, 789 A.2d at 127.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">In this matter, we do not find any circumstances mitigating Respondent\u2019s violations, nor do we find any exceptional circumstances as contemplated by Rule 16-773(e). Respondent, although without disciplinary blemish in the District of Columbia or Maryland prior to these proceedings, has been found to have participated in active and reckless involvement in the misappropriation of client trust funds. Additionally, the gravity of Respondent\u2019s conduct is compounded by other rule violations: failing to render prompt accountings to her condominium clients, and withdrawing funds from the escrow account payable to cash. In similar situations, we have disbarred other attorneys who have committed such misconduct. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Attorney Griev. Comm\u2019n v. Bernstein, </em>363 Md. 208, 768 A.2d 607 (2001) (disbarring attorney for willfully misappropriating funds from his client trust account and commingling his personal funds with those of his clients); <em>Vanderlinde, </em>364 Md. 376, 773 A.2d 463 (2001) (disbarring attorney for intentional misappropriation of the funds of another); <em>Galla</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number><em>gher, </em>371 Md. 673, 810 A.2d 996 (2002) (attorney disbarred for numerous violations when this Court followed its consistent practice of disbarment of lawyers who misappropriate client funds absent mitigation or extenuating circumstances). We conclude that the appropriate sanction in this case is that imposed by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, namely, disbarment.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">IT IS SO ORDERED; RESPONDENT SHALL PAY ALL COSTS AS TAXED BY THE CLERK OF THIS COURT, INCLUDING THE COSTS OF ALL TRANSCRIPTS, PURSUANT TO MARYLAND RULE 16-761, FOR WHICH SUM JUDGMENT IS ENTERED IN FAVOR OF THE ATTORNEY GRIEVANCE COMMISSION OF MARYLAND AGAINST DIANE E.
