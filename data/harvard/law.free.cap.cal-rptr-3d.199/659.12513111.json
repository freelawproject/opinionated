(SGI), and Gilbane/SGI, a joint venture (the Joint Venture), seeking to void management contracts with all three entities, and to require that they disgorge all sums that Sweetwater paid them under the contracts, pursuant to Government Code section 1090(Section 1090).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sweetwater alleges that certain\n   representatives of the defendant entities engaged in a \"pay to play\" scheme with several Sweetwater officials that involved paying for expensive dinners, tickets to entertainment and sporting events, and travel expenses, and making contributions to political campaigns and charities, in an effort to influence the officials to award defendants certain construction contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Gilbane and the Joint Venture (jointly, defendants) brought a special motion to strike (or \"anti-SLAPP motion\") under Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16(the SLAPP Act).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court denied the motion on the ground that the conduct underlying the complaint was illegal as a matter of law, and therefore, was not protected by the constitutional guarantees of free speech and petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Defendants contend that the trial court erred in denying their anti-SLAPP motion. Defendants assert that Sweetwater's complaint is based on actions that are protected under the First Amendment, and that Sweetwater failed to proffer\n   <em>\n    admissible\n   </em>\n   evidence demonstrating that the conduct at issue was illegal, as a matter of law, such that it is not protected by the First Amendment. Defendants further contend\n   that Sweetwater proffered no admissible evidence to demonstrate that it has a probability of prevailing on the merits of the case. Defendants maintain that this court must reverse the trial court's order and remand the case with directions that the trial court grant their anti-SLAPP motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the evidence proffered by Sweetwater, including signed plea forms and transcripts from grand jury testimony in criminal cases against many of the individuals involved in the alleged \"pay to play\" contracting scheme. Such evidence is, in all material respects, indistinguishable from evidence presented by way of a declaration. Based on the proffered evidence, we conclude that Sweetwater has sufficiently demonstrated a probability of prevailing on the merits. We therefore affirm the trial court's denial of defendants' anti-SLAPP motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In November 2006, voters in the Sweetwater Union School District approved Proposition O, which authorized up to $644 million in bond sales, the proceeds of which were to be used to renovate and build schools. Sweetwater requested proposals from contractors to manage construction of the Proposition O projects. Although the request for proposal that a Sweetwater official prepared for use in soliciting vendor proposals initially included a \"no contact\" clause prohibiting bidders and Sweetwater officials from having any contact with each other during the bidding process, Dr. Jesus Gandara, Sweetwater's then superintendent, had the \"no contact\" clause removed from the request for proposal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Sweetwater received seven timely proposals, including one from the Joint Venture. Sweetwater appointed a screening committee to review the proposals. Members of the screening committee included Ramon Leyba, chief operating officer; Katy Wright, director of planning; and Iva Butler, facilities accounting supervisor. The screening panel determined that all seven proposals met Sweetwater's requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Sweetwater then appointed an interview committee, consisting of Leyba; Dianne Russo, chief financial officer; Wes Braddock, a high school principal; Aerobel Banuelos, outside counsel; and Lou Smith, an outside consultant. The interview committee interviewed teams sent by all seven bidders and rated them against a common set of requirements. The interview committee narrowed the field to three finalists, one of which was the Joint Venture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Sweetwater appointed a final review committee, consisting of Gandara, Leyba, Banuelos, and Ralph Munoz, the \"capit[a]l project manager.\" The committee determined that the Joint Venture was the \"top applicant.\" On this basis, Gandara requested that the Sweetwater School Board (Board) grant him authority to negotiate a contract with the Joint Venture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In May 2007, the Board approved an \"Interim Program Management Agreement\" that contained the terms pursuant to which the Joint Venture would provide management for Proposition O projects. Trustees Pearl Quinones, Arlie Ricasa, and Greg Sandoval participated in the approval of this agreement. That same month,\n   Sweetwater contracted for the Joint Venture to take over and complete management services on projects that had been funded through a separate initiative, Proposition BB.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Quinones, Ricasa, and Sandoval participated in this decision.\n   In January 2008, the Board approved the \"Program Management Agreement for Proposition 'O' Modernization Program and Other Facilities Master Plan Services,\" which would govern the Joint Venture's provision of services for the Proposition O work. Quinones, Ricasa, and Sandoval also participated in this decision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Sometime later, a criminal investigation was launched into the relationships between certain Sweetwater officials and representatives of Gilbane, SGI, and the Joint Venture. The investigation ultimately led to the filing of criminal charges against Henry Amigable, who was Gilbane's Program Director during the relevant period; Rene Flores, the Chief Executive Officer of SGI during the relevant period; and Sweetwater officials Gandara, Sandoval, Quinones, and Ricasa, among others. The charges filed against these individuals involved allegations that Amigable and Flores had bribed Sweetwater officials with gifts, such as expensive dinners, tickets to entertainment and sporting events, payment of travel expenses, and contributions to political campaigns and charities, in an attempt to win the construction management contracts at issue. The charges included allegations of violations of various provisions of the Education Code, Government Code, and Penal Code. Many of the individuals who were prosecuted in relation to the alleged bribery scheme ultimately entered pleas of guilty or no contest to at least one criminal offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Sweetwater filed this action, seeking to void three contracts with Gilbane, the Joint Venture, and/or SGI, pursuant to Section 1090. Sweetwater alleged that defendants' employees had provided Gandara, Quinones, Ricasa and Sandoval with lavish dinners, trips, and other gifts in order to induce those officials to vote to award the contracts to defendants. Specifically, the complaint alleged that representatives of defendants provided the following \"financial inducements\" to these public officials, as well as to their family and friends: (1) \"Numerous dinners at expensive restaurants,\" (2) \"Tickets to the theater and sporting events, including Charger games and to see The Jersey Boys,\" (3) \"Hotel accommodations, food, and tickets to the Rose Bowl in Pasadena,\" (4) \"Airfare, hotel accommodations, wine tasting, and a hot air balloon ride in Napa Valley,\" and (5) \"Monetary contributions to beauty pageants, charities, and campaigns on behalf of District officials.\" The complaint further alleged that the named Sweetwater Board members and representatives of defendants had pled guilty to various felony and/or misdemeanor offenses, and set forth the factual basis for each individual's plea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In response to Sweetwater's complaint, Gilbane filed an anti-SLAPP motion, seeking to strike the first and second causes of\n   action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Joint Venture joined in the motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Gilbane and the Joint Venture argued that Sweetwater's causes of action against them arose from defendants' rights of free expression and petition. Specifically, Gilbane and the Joint Venture maintained that the allegations rested on claims that employees of defendants had made political contributions, charitable donations, and provided gifts to political officials, and that this conduct constitutes political expression and petitioning, which is protected by the First Amendment. Gilbane and the Joint Venture further argued that Sweetwater could not proffer admissible evidence to demonstrate a probability of prevailing on its causes of action against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In response to the anti-SLAPP motion, Sweetwater relied on statements included in documents from the criminal cases filed against Amigable, Flores, and former Sweetwater officials Gandara, Quinones, Ricasa, and Sandoval, including written narratives that were incorporated into these individuals' plea forms as the factual bases of their pleas, as well as testimony and documents from grand jury proceedings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Defendants objected to virtually all of Sweetwater's evidence, arguing that the evidence was not properly authenticated and that much of it was inadmissible hearsay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court denied defendants' anti-SLAPP motion, concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   \"Here the anti-SLAPP statute does not apply. The conduct that Defendant's [\n   <em>\n    sic\n   </em>\n   ] employees are accused of is payment in the form of gifts that were made with the intent to influence the Board's decisions in granting construction contracts from Sweetwater Union High School District to the defendant firms. This conduct, which forms the basis for the underlying civil claims by the District, is shown to be unlawful by the change of plea forms in the related criminal matters.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   After denying the anti-SLAPP motion, the trial court ruled on defendants' evidentiary objections. The court sustained eleven of defendants' objections to Sweetwater's evidence, and overruled the remainder.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Defendants filed a timely notice of appeal from the order denying their anti-SLAPP motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    Anti-SLAPP motion standards\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Code of Civil Procedure\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   section 425.16establishes a procedure for striking a pleading that is brought primarily to \"chill\" the valid exercise of the constitutional rights of freedom of speech and petition for redress of grievances.

Defendants argue that the plea forms detailing the guilty and no contest pleas entered by individuals who were criminally prosecuted in connection with the Sweetwater contracts, as well as the factual narratives supporting those pleas, certain grand jury testimony, and documents presented to the grand jury, all constitute inadmissible hearsay, in that all of this evidence comprises out of court statements being offered for their truth. However, the law clearly permits courts to consider evidence presented in hearsay form for purposes of deciding pretrial motions, as long as that evidence is not otherwise barred by another substantive rule of evidence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   We therefore conclude that to the extent that Sweetwater proffered evidence that meets the material requirements of a declaration or affidavit that could be presented in opposition to defendants' anti-SLAPP motions, the trial court could consider this evidence in the same manner that it would consider evidence proffered by a party by way of a declaration or affidavit. We now turn to the question whether the trial court erred in considering the evidence that Sweetwater proffered in opposition to defendants' anti-SLAPP motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Amigable pled either no contest or guilty\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   to a violation of\n   Education Code section 35230in March 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Flores pled no contest to one count of aiding in a misdemeanor, a violation of Penal Code section 659, the misdemeanor being a violation of Government Code section 87203, in April 2012.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Ricasa pled guilty to one misdemeanor count of violating Government Code section 89503in December 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   In 2014, the other Sweetwater officials also entered guilty pleas.

For example, the typewritten narrative incorporated into Amigable's plea form provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   \"Between March 9, 2007 and June 22, 2010 I provided gifts, meals and tickets to entertainment events directly to Jesus Gandara, Superintendent, Greg Sandoval, elected Board member, Arlie Ricassa, elected Board member, and Pearl Quinones, elected Board member, of the Sweetwater Union High School District. I provided the meals, tickets and gifts upon my initiative as sanctioned and encouraged by my employers. I also provided meals, tickets and gifts at the request of the elected board members and the Superintendant. The meals, tickets and gifts\n   were made on behalf of my employers with the intent to influence the boards' decisions in granting construction contracts from the Sweetwater Union High School District to the firms for which I was working. My expenses were generated with the endorsement of my employers and they were reimbursed to me by my employers. At no time did the elected board members or Superintendent reimburse\n   me or my employers for the meals, tickets or gifts I gave them on behalf of my employers.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Similarly, the typewritten narrative incorporated into Sandoval's plea form provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   \"Government Code \u00a7 89503: I received, reviewed, understood and biannually voted on Sweetwater's conflict of interest code delineating the Form 700 reporting requirements sent to the Sweetwater Board by the Superintendent. In 2008, I was an elected School Board Member for the Sweetwater Union High School District. I accepted gifts from Henry Amigable of Gilbane in 2008 with a total value of more than $2,770 and I did not report them. The maximum amount of gifts one may receive from one source per year as of 2008 was four hundred twenty dollars ($420). Henry Amigable provided these gifts with the intent to influence my vote on business awarded to Gilbane, his employer.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Boldface omitted.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Each plea form includes language to the effect that the individual entering the plea attests to the truth of the statements made in the plea under penalty of perjury and under the laws of the State of California, and is signed and dated by that individual. For example, Amigable's plea form states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   \"I declare under penalty of perjury, under the laws of the State of California, that I have read, understood, and initialed each item above, and any attached addendum, and everything on the form and any attached addendum is true and correct.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The plea forms of Flores, Quinones, Gandara and Sandoval all contain the identical \"under penalty of perjury\" language.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Ricasa's plea form includes the following language, which is substantively identical, but presented in a slightly different format:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"I DECLARE UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY, under the laws of the State of California, that: (a) I have read, understood, and initialed each applicable item above and any attached addendum; and (b) everything on the form and any attached addendum is true and correct.\" (Boldface omitted.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   As Sweetwater points out, the plea forms that it submitted in opposition to defendants' anti-SLAPP motion \"meet all requirements of declarations which are admissible as a hearsay exception under [Code of Civil Procedure section] 2009.\" Section 2009 of the Code of Civil Procedureoutlines how and when an affidavit or declaration may be used, despite its hearsay nature: \"An affidavit may be used to verify a pleading or a paper in a special proceeding, to prove the service of a summons, notice, or other paper in an action or special proceeding, to obtain a provisional remedy, the examination of a witness, or a stay of proceedings, and in uncontested proceedings to establish a record of birth, or\n   <em>\n    upon a motion,\n   </em>\n   and in any other case expressly permitted by statute.\" (Italics added.) In addition to\n   Code of Civil Procedure section 2009, Code of Civil Procedure section 2015.5explains that an individual making a statement by affidavit or declaration must attest to its truth under penalty of perjury pursuant to California law:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   \"Whenever, under any law of this state or under any rule, regulation, order or requirement made pursuant to the law of this state, any matter is required or permitted to be supported, evidenced, established, or proved by the sworn statement, declaration, verification, certificate, oath, or affidavit, in writing of the person making the same (other than a deposition, or an oath of office, or an oath required to be taken before a specified official other than a notary public), such matter may with like force and effect be supported, evidenced, established or proved by the unsworn statement, declaration, verification, or certificate, in writing of such person which recites that it is certified or declared by him or her to be true under penalty of perjury, is subscribed by him or her, and (1), if executed within this state, states the date and place of execution, or (2), if executed at any place, within or without this state, states the date of execution and that it is so certified or declared under the laws of the State of California.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   This provision states that, if executed within California, the \"certification or declaration may be in substantially the following form:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \" 'I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct':\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   (Date and Place)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   (Signature)'\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   or, if executed anywhere in or outside of California, in the following form:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \" 'I certify (or declare) under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct':\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   (Date)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   (Signature)'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Each plea form submitted by Sweetwater with respect to the anti-SLAPP motion meets the requirements set forth in section 2015.5 of the Code of Civil Procedure. Specifically, each individual who signed and dated a plea form attested to the truth of the contents, including the factual basis of his or her plea, under penalty of perjury under the laws of California. For this reason, we conclude that the forms reflecting the guilty and no contest pleas, including the written factual narratives incorporated into the pleas, are in all material respects indistinguishable from declarations or affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Given that declarations and/or affidavits are admissible for purposes of pretrial motions (\u00a7 2009), and because the statements in the plea forms are materially indistinguishable from statements that could be made in a declaration, in that the statements are based on the declarants' personal knowledge and the declarants have attested to the truth of the statements under penalty of perjury under the laws of California, we conclude that the court may consider the statements in the guilty pleas in the same way that it could consider declarations and/or affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   The court in\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

In\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   the court permitted the use of prior testimony from an earlier case for purposes of a summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) The court observed that, although prior testimony from the earlier case \"could not be received in this case [at trial] over a hearsay objection on the ground that it is admissible under the 'former testimony' exception\" because there had been no showing that the declarant was\n   unavailable as a witness, the recorded testimony from the earlier case \"serves effectively as a declaration\" and may be treated as such for purposes of a summary judgment motion. (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) We agree with the\n   <em>\n    Williams\n   </em>\n   court on this point, and conclude that the trial court did not err in considering for their truth out of court statements that otherwise meet the material requirements of a declaration or affidavit, even if those statements were not presented in the form of a declaration or affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   We recognize that the plea forms and incorporated written factual narratives may not be admissible at trial, unless they meet the evidentiary rules for\n   evidence that may be admitted despite its hearsay nature.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   However, declarations and affidavits, which are a cornerstone of civil motion practice, are also typically not admissible at trial. A trial court should be able to consider out of court statements that meet the material requirements of a declaration and/or affidavit for purposes of deciding a pretrial motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   For similar reasons, we conclude that the trial court may properly consider the transcripts of the grand jury testimony of Flores, Amigable, and former Sweetwater representatives Wright, Leyba, Bruce Husson, Jaime Mercado, Rafael Munoz, and Jaime Ortiz, in opposition to defendants' anti-SLAPP motion since they, too, are materially indistinguishable from declarations. (See\n   <em>\n    Williams, supra,\n   </em>\n   225 Cal.App.3d at p. 149, fn. 3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=274%20Cal.%20Rptr.%20901\">\n    274 Cal.Rptr. 901\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) Although the transcripts of the grand jury testimony are hearsay, and therefore inadmissible at trial unless they meet an exception to the hearsay rule, the transcripts are of the same nature as a declaration in that the testimony is given under penalty of perjury.

In doing so, the\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court failed to appreciate the distinction between the substantive rules that govern the admission of evidence at trial and the rules that permit the use of evidence in hearsay form for purposes of motion practice. Evidence Code section 1292governs the use of prior testimony as substantive evidence\n   <em>\n    at trial,\n   </em>\n   in the place of live testimony. Under those circumstances, the need for the safeguards of \"unavailability\" and \"similar interest and motive\" is substantial, given that the party is seeking to use the prior testimony\n   <em>\n    in the place of live testimony at trial\n   </em>\n   . However, as with declarations filed in support of or in opposition to any pretrial motion, a party seeking to use prior testimony in support of or in opposition to a pretrial motion is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   seeking to use that testimony in the place of live testimony\n   <em>\n    at trial\n   </em>\n   . Rather, for purposes of supporting or opposing a pretrial motion, as here, the party is attempting to demonstrate to the court that that there is relevant and competent evidence that supports the party's claim(s). We see no reason why this cannot be done through the use of a statement by a witness made under oath or certified under penalty perjury under the laws of California in a plea form, or in grand jury testimony, rather than in a declaration, which is simply an out of court statement by a witness, verified as to its truth and made under penalty of perjury under the laws of California.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   We reject the\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court's suggestion that the party proffering a declaration as evidence with respect to a pretrial motion must demonstrate that the\n   declarant is willing and available to testify at trial, and that this is a reason to treat prior testimony\n   differently from a declaration, for purposes of a pretrial motion. (\n   <em>\n    Gatton, supra,\n   </em>\n   64 Cal.App.4th at p. 696,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20523\">\n    75 Cal.Rptr.2d 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .) The\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court noted the general rule that \"for an affidavit to meet summary judgment standards, the affiant must show that if sworn as a witness he or she can testify competently to the evidentiary facts contained in the affidavit.\" (\n   <em>\n    Ibid.\n   </em>\n   ) However, the\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court transmuted this into a requirement that the party provide some assurance that the witness would actually testify at trial in the case at issue, complaining that \"[a] deposition from another case does not provide such assurance [that the affiant can testify competently] and is not readily subject to use in the action,\" that \"there are questions whether the witness, even if alive,\n   <em>\n    can testify competently\n   </em>\n   to the deposition's contents,\" and that \"[i]n our record, we also have only a representation by counsel that the witness Woodrow was 'still alive,'\n   <em>\n    not that he was well enough or willing to testify.\n   </em>\n   \" (Ibid.italics added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   In our view, in assessing the requirement that an affiant show that if sworn as a witness he or she \"can\" testify competently to the matters contained in his or her affidavit, the\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court was concerned about the wrong issue. The concept that an affiant demonstrate that he or she \"can\" testify competently to the facts in an affidavit derives from the requirements for summary judgment set forth in Code of Civil Procedure section 473c, subdivision (d), which provides in relevant part: \"Supporting and opposing affidavits or declarations shall be made by a person on\n   <em>\n    personal knowledge,\n   </em>\n   shall set forth admissible evidence, and\n   <em>\n    shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated in the affidavits or declarations.\n   </em>\n   \" (Italics added.) Thus, the summary judgment requirement for a witness declaration is not that the declarant be required to state that he or she\n   <em>\n    would\n   </em>\n   testify at trial if called in this action and demonstrate his or her competency as a witness, but rather, that the witness be able to provide a proper foundation for his or her testimony-i.e., demonstrate that the testimony is based on the declarant's own first-hand knowledge, such that he or she\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   provide competent testimony. Persons who attest to the facts underlying their own guilty or no contest pleas in a criminal case, and persons who testify before a grand jury as to matters within their personal knowledge, have demonstrated that they are \"competent to testify to the matters\" (\u00a7 473c, subd. (d)) that are the subject of the statements in their plea forms and/or grand jury testimony. The significance is not that the person demonstrates that he or she is likely to actually testify at trial and can do so competently, but rather, that the person is competent to testify as to the substance of his or her statements. The\n   <em>\n    Gatton\n   </em>\n   court focused on the contention that prior testimony should not be treated as equivalent to a declaration because it cannot provide assurances that the witness\n   <em>\n    would actually be able and/or willing to testify\n   </em>\n   in the current\n   action. However, no such showing is required of declarations that are offered in support of or in opposition to summary judgment or other pretrial motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Further, admitting sworn documents and testimony in relation to an anti-SLAPP motion may be particularly warranted, in view of the discovery hurdles imposed by the filing of an anti-SLAPP motion. Given the automatic stay on discovery when an anti-SLAPP motion is filed (see \u00a7 425.16, subd. (g)[\"[U]pon the filing\" of an anti-SLAPP motion, \"[a]ll discovery proceedings\" shall be stayed unless the court orders otherwise \"for good cause\"] ), there is a strong argument that a party should be permitted to oppose the motion\n   with evidence that has all of the material characteristics of a declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Finally, we reject the contention that because defendants did not have an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses during their grand jury testimony, or with respect to their plea forms, this somehow makes it unfair for the trial court to consider the testimony or plea forms for purposes of an anti-SLAPP motion. Defendants are in precisely the same position they would be in if Sweetwater had submitted declarations by these witnesses-i.e., defendants would have had no opportunity to question the witnesses about the statements in their declarations. Indeed, the indicia of reliability and trustworthiness of statements made with respect to guilty and/or no contest pleas, as well as in testimony presented to a grand jury,\n   <em>\n    is at least as substantial, if not more substantial,\n   </em>\n   than that of statements included in a self-serving declaration prepared expressly for the purpose of supporting or opposing a pretrial motion. Like declarations, such evidence demonstrates that there are witnesses who could testify as to the events at issue, and provides an indication of the manner in which those witnesses may testify. For this reason, the trial court should be able to consider such evidence, in the same way it would consider a declaration, for purposes of assessing a pretrial motion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering the plea forms, including the incorporated plea narratives, the grand jury testimony, and grand jury exhibits in addressing defendants' anti-SLAPP motion. We therefore affirm the trial court's evidentiary rulings with respect to the evidence challenged by defendants on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Analysis of the anti-SLAPP motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Prong 1: Arising from protected activity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   a.\n   <em>\n    The complaint arises from protected activity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   To satisfy the initial burden of demonstrating that Sweetwater's complaint arises from protected activity, defendants must show that the act or acts underlying the claims fit one or more of the categories described in section 425.16, subdivision (e).

Even when a plaintiff alleges that the conduct at issue is unlawful, a defendant can satisfy his or her burden to show that he or she was engaged in conduct in furtherance of the right of free speech under the anti-SLAPP statute if the court cannot determine that the conduct at issue is illegal as a matter of law.

Defendants contend that Sweetwater has failed to demonstrate that the\n   <em>\n    Flatley\n   </em>\n   illegal conduct exception, which requires either a concession by a defendant or conclusive proof of illegality as a matter of law, applies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Sweetwater suggests that defendants have conceded the illegality of the conduct at issue by \"attaching the pleas to their anti-SLAPP moving papers and making an argument based upon the contents of these plea documents.\" However, it is clear that defendants have not conceded this issue. Defendants have argued in the trial court and on appeal that the guilty and/or no contest pleas do not establish that the conduct complained of in Sweetwater's complaint was illegal as a matter of law. We therefore consider whether the evidence presented with respect to the anti-SLAPP motion conclusively establishes the illegality of the defendants' conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Sweetwater's argument that the conduct is illegal as a matter of law is based on its assumption that because some of the individuals whose conduct is at issue in this case \"ha[ve] a criminal conviction,\" they must necessarily have \"engaged in illegal conduct\" and therefore, the\n   <em>\n    Flatley\n   </em>\n   illegal conduct exception applies. However, the question is not whether an individual engaged in any illegal conduct. Rather, the question for our purposes is whether the\n   <em>\n    specific conduct that gives rise to the plaintiff's cause of action\n   </em>\n   is, as a matter of law, illegal, such that it is not entitled to the protections of the anti-SLAPP statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Although Sweetwater would have the court conclude that all of the conduct on which its complaint is based is illegal because many of the individuals involved entered pleas of guilty or no contest to certain criminal activity, the admitted illegal conduct evidenced by the guilty and no contest pleas does not necessarily overlap with the alleged violations of Section 1090at issue in this case. None of the individuals pled guilty or no contest to a violation of Section 1090.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, they entered pleas to single counts of other criminal offenses, leaving open the question whether much of the alleged conduct on which Sweetwater bases its claims was \"illegal.\" While the evidence may establish that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   of the conduct may have been illegal, the evidence does not establish that\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   of the conduct at issue was illegal as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   For example, many of the former Sweetwater officials pled guilty to violating Government Code section 89503, which prohibits state and local elected officers from \"accept[ing] gifts from any single source in any calendar year with a total value of more than [the amount set by the Fair Political Practices Commission].\" However, some of the conduct Sweetwater alleges constitutes a violation of Section 1090was the making of \"[m]onetary contributions to beauty pageants, charities, and campaigns on behalf of District officials.\" These contributions were provided to entities other than the Sweetwater officials, and thus may not qualify as gifts \"accepted\" by the Sweetwater officials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is possible that\n   the alleged contributions to pageants, charities and campaigns therefore did not form the\n   basis of the guilty pleas entered by the Sweetwater officials to the charge of accepting gifts worth more than the requisite amount. The pleas by the Sweetwater officials to accepting gifts valued at more than the amount set by the Fair Political Practices Commission thus are not necessarily sufficient to establish that all of the conduct on which Sweetwater relies in attempting to void the contracts, which includes the making of contributions to third parties, was illegal as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   As another example, Amigable pled guilty to a single violation of Education Code section 35230, a misdemeanor, which makes it illegal to \"offer[ ] ... any valuable thing to any member of the governing board of any school district, with the intent to influence his action in regard to the granting of any teacher's certificate, the appointment of any teacher, superintendent, or other officer or employee, the adoption of any textbook, or the making of any contract to which the board of which he is a member is a party....\" However, the complaint in this case describes much more conduct than a single violation of this statute. Amigable's plea thus can support a finding that only a single instance of offering a \"valuable thing\" to one of the former Sweetwater officials was done illegally, leaving open the question whether the other alleged acts of \"offering\" valuable things were done with the requisite illegal intent-i.e., with the intent of \"influenc[ing] [the official's] action\" (Ed.

Sweetwater vehemently disagrees with defendants' contention that Section 1090\"requires evidence of a quid pro quo relationship between a public\n   official's vote and the gifts he or she received.\" It is not necessary for us to determine whether a plaintiff asserting a Section 1090claim must demonstrate the existence of a quid pro quo arrangement in every instance, because we conclude that even if such a showing is required, Sweetwater presented evidence from which one could reasonably infer that a quid pro quo arrangement existed, even if there is no direct evidence that the parties explicitly discussed such an arrangement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The evidence of the plea forms detailing the guilty and no contest pleas by various former Sweetwater officials and former employees of defendants, as well as the grand jury testimony of a number of the individuals involved, is circumstantial evidence from which one could reasonably conclude that the gifts and contributions were made in order to sway the board members to vote in favor of awarding contracts to Gilbane and the Joint Venture. Amigable, a Gilbane employee, stated under penalty of perjury that he \"provided the meals, tickets and gifts upon [his] initiative as sanctioned and encouraged by [his] employers,\" and that these \"meals, tickets and gifts were made on behalf of [his] employers with the intent to influence the boards' decisions in granting construction contracts from the Sweetwater Union High School District to the firms for which [he] was working.\" SGI's CEO, Flores, stated that he provided donations, meals, gifts, and tickets to entertainment events to certain Sweetwater officials, \"as requested by these public officials,\" and admitted that none of the officials reimbursed him for the meals, gifts, tickets, or donations. Many of the same officials to whom Amigable and Flores admitted giving meals, tickets and gifts admitted that they received the gifts. For example, Quinones and Sandoval acknowledged not only that they received gifts from Amigable, but that they were aware that Amigable \"provided these gifts with the intent to influence\n   my vote on business awarded to Gilbane, his employer.\" Ricasa admitted that in 2009, she accepted gifts from Flores with a value of more than $2000, and that she was aware that Flores \"provided these gifts with the intent to influence my vote on business awarded to Seville Group, Inc.\" Gandara also admitted to accepting gifts of significant value from Flores, and that he was aware that Flores had provided the gifts \"with the intent to influence my decision on business awarded to SGI, his company.\"\n   In addition, there is evidence that Sweetwater, through the actions of its Board, which at the time included the members whose conduct is at issue here, not only awarded the Proposition O construction work to defendants, but also replaced the contractor that had been the program manager on Proposition BB construction projects with the Joint Venture, despite the fact that the original contractor had been performing well, and that hiring a different contractor to do the Proposition O work would cause a significant delay. The evidence presented in opposition to the anti-SLAPP motion demonstrates that the Sweetwater Board had hired Harris/Gafcon to be the program manager for the Proposition BB construction projects. There is also evidence that Harris/Gafcon \"finished the Prop[osition] BB projects that they were managing ahead of time,\" and \"[t]heir work quality was very good.\" Katy Wright, Sweetwater's Director of Planning and Construction, and at one point Interim Assistant Superintendent, who \"was directly involved with the management of the Proposition BB construction bond,\" attested that when she heard that Gandara was not planning to use Harris/Gafcon for the new Proposition O construction work, she informed Gandara that \"the District would essentially lose a year because it would take a while for a new team to get up to speed and understand what happened at each of the campuses.\" She also \"relayed\" to Gandara \"the good quality of work that [Harris/Gafcon] performed for the District on Proposition BB.\" In addition, despite Wright's expertise \"with respect to managing the work done under the bond measures,\" she was \"not asked to participate or provide the criteria by which the program manager was to be selected,\" and was \"not allowed to participate\" in the decision to select the Joint Venture even after she asked to participate. Sweetwater officials, including the officials whose conduct is alleged to have been unlawful, ultimately voted to replace Harris/Gafcon with the Joint Venture to manage the bond projects.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   One could reasonably infer from the chronology of campaign contributions and excessive gift giving, together with Sweetwater's action in awarding to the Joint Venture the contract for management of the Proposition O projects, as well as removing management of the Proposition BB projects from Harris/Gafcon in favor of the Joint Venture, that the former Sweetwater officials identified in the complaint were influenced to award contracts to the Joint Venture as a result of the gifts and contributions that Gilbane and the Joint Venture provided to them. Sweetwater has thus made a prima facie showing of facts sufficient to sustain a favorable judgment in its favor.
