CCC's writ petition requested the trial court to order the City of Upland and city clerk, Stephanie Mendenhall, (collectively, the City) to hold a special election on CCC's medical marijuana dispensary initiative (Initiative).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   CCC contends the trial court erred in ruling CCC's Initiative could not be voted on during a special election under Article XIIIC (Article 13C), section 2 of the California Constitution, because the Initiative imposes a charge on medical marijuana dispensaries, which in effect is a general tax rather than a regulatory fee. CCC objects to the trial court requiring the Initiative to be placed on the next general election ballot, instead of presenting it to the voters earlier by holding a special election. CCC further argues the City council prematurely determined, before the election on the Initiative, that the Initiative constituted a tax rather than a regulatory fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   CCC requests this court reverse the trial court judgment and order the trial court to issue a writ of mandate compelling the City to hold a special election on the Initiative. CCC suggests, in the interest of expediency, this court treat the instant appeal as a writ petition and directly order the City to call a special election on the Initiative, to be consolidated with the June 7, 2016 primary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We conclude Article 13C, section 2 does not apply to CCC's Initiative. Article 13C, sections 1 and 2 refer to taxes imposed by local government. Article 13C is silent as to taxes imposed by initiative. Article 2, sections 8and 11 of the California Constitutionand Elections Code sections 1405and 9214, on the other hand, provide the people with initiative powers and state procedures for holding elections on initiatives. Under Article 2 and Elections Code section 1405and 9214, the City is required to place the Initiative on a special election ballot. The trial court's ruling and judgment denying CCC's writ petition is therefore reversed, and the trial court is directed to issue a writ of mandate compelling\n   the City to place the Initiative on a special ballot in accordance with Article 2, sections 8\n   and 11, and Elections Code sections 1405and 9214. We reject CCC's request to treat this appeal as a petition for writ of mandate so that this court can issue a writ directly to the City directing it to place the initiative on the next ballot, because CCC has not cited any persuasive authority, and we are not aware of any, allowing this court to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   FACTS AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On March 19, 2015, CCC filed a petition for writ of mandate and motion for peremptory writ of mandate (writ motion). The facts alleged in the writ petition are undisputed. CCC alleges in the writ petition the following facts. CCC is a California nonprofit corporation. CCC sponsored and drafted a proposed medical marijuana initiative petition. The key provisions of the Initiative are that the Initiative would repeal existing City code provisions prohibiting medical marijuana dispensaries and would adopt regulations permitting and establishing standards for the operation of medical marijuana dispensaries within the City. The proposed Initiative allows the City to permit a maximum of three medical marijuana dispensaries. An applicant must obtain a business license and applicable City permits. According to the Initiative, a medical marijuana dispensary must pay the City an \"annual Licensing and Inspection fee\" of $75,000 (Initiative \u00a7 17.158.100). Initiative proponents, Nicole De La Rosa and James Velez, presented the Initiative petition to the City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Before circulating the Initiative petition, Nicole De La Rosa and James Velez filed with the City a notice of intention to circulate the Initiative petition. The City attorney prepared a title and summary for the Initiative. Thereafter, a notice of intention to circulate the Initiative petition was published and circulated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The Initiative requested it be considered at a special election. At least 5,542 signatures (15 percent of registered voters) were needed for the Initiative to qualify for a special election, which would be held sooner than the next regular election. The County of San Bernardino Registrar reported there were 6,865 signatures on the Initiative petition. On February 9, 2015, the City council accepted the county certificate of sufficiency from the San Bernardino County Registrar of Voters and ordered an Agency Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    The City Agency Report\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Agency Report dated March 4, 2015 (Agency Report), was prepared jointly by City departments under Elections Code section 9212, to address\n   the anticipated impacts of the Initiative on the City. The Agency Report concluded the Initiative's $75,000 licensing and inspection fee exceeded the estimated actual costs incurred from issuing a license for a medical marijuana dispensary and conducting annual inspections of the dispensary. The City estimated the actual annual costs would total $15,014.28. Because the $75,000 licensing and inspection fee imposed by the Initiative exceeded the anticipated costs of licensing and inspection of a medical marijuana dispensary, the City concluded in the Agency Report that the $75,000 fee is a general tax, which must be presented to voters at a regularly scheduled election under Article 13C. In reaching this conclusion, the City relied on the reports provided by the City's departments, which are included in the Agency Report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The City Attorney reported in the Agency Report that the annual $75,000 licensing and inspection fee was a general\n   tax, which under the California Constitution, must be submitted to voters at a regularly scheduled election and cannot appear on a special election ballot. The Development Services Department (Development Services) reported in the Agency Report that the estimated cost of processing a typical permit for a medical marijuana dispensary was $9,379.28, with an estimated $7,000 in cost-recovery from additional fees charged for processing the application. Development Services estimated the annual inspection cost for a single medical marijuana dispensary totaled $4,000. Development Services estimated a medical marijuana dispensary would generate $84,480 per year in sales tax revenue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The City Administrative Services Director, Stephanie Mendenhall, summarized in the Agency Report the City departments' reported costs for obtaining a medical marijuana dispensary permit and for an annual permit inspection as follows. The fire department determined its initial costs for processing a typical medical marijuana dispensary permit would be $1,443, with the additional annual cost of $292 for two biannual inspections to ensure compliance with the Uniform Fire Code. Development Services estimated an initial cost of $9,279.28 for processing a typical permit and $4,000 annually for an annual permit inspection by the Building and Planning Divisions. The total estimated cost for obtaining a medical marijuana permit amounted to $10,722.28. The total estimated cost for annual permit inspections was $4,292. Mendenhall further reported in the Agency Report that the estimated cost of a standalone special election was $179,800. The estimated cost of placing the Initiative on the 2016 Statewide Election (regularly scheduled election) was $25,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    March 9, 2015 City Council Meeting\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On March 9, 2015, the City council met. The City received the Agency Report and the City attorney provided additional information contained in the\n   Agency Report. The City council discussed whether the Initiative's $75,000 licensing and inspection fee is a tax and whether it must be placed on a special or general election ballot. The City council adopted Resolution No. 6267, finding the Initiative's $75,000 fee is actually a tax because it exceeds the actual licensing and inspection costs, and the Initiative does not specifically provide any legally binding mandate for use of the excess revenue generated from the $75,000 fee. The excess revenue would thus by default be deposited into the City's general fund used for general governmental purposes. The City determined the Initiative did not qualify for a special election under Elections Code sections 1405and 9214, because under Article 13C the Initiative imposed a general tax. Resolution No. 6267 therefore provides notice and direction for ordering the Initiative submitted to the voters at the next general election on November 8, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Writ Petition Allegations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   CCC alleges in its writ petition that the Initiative is not subject to Article 13C because the Initiative fee is not a tax and is not imposed by a local government. Rather, if adopted, the Initiative fee would be imposed by the voters by initiative. CCC also alleges that, even if the $75,000 licensing and inspection fee is a tax, the remedy would be to allow the Initiative to go on the special election ballot. Then, if erroneously approved, the court could strike the Initiative or strike only the section imposing the $75,000 fee. CCC concludes that the City's failure to place the Initiative on a special ballot therefore violates Elections Code section 9214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   CCC further alleges the City refuses to allow CCC to participate in any discussion or hearing determining whether the Initiative imposes a general tax. In addition, Initiative section 17.158.100 allegedly is only a minor part of the overall Initiative and would only affect the three proposed medical marijuana dispensaries. CCC asserts in its writ petition the City took the position the Initiative imposes a general tax because the City is against the Initiative. CCC further alleges the City's position allegedly is a pretext and serves no legitimate purpose. CCC concludes the City's refusal to place the Initiative on a special election ballot violates CCC's rights under the Elections Code and California Constitution. CCC's writ petition therefore requests the trial court to issue a writ of mandate compelling the City and City clerk to place the Initiative on a special election ballot in compliance with Elections Code section 9214.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Hearing on Writ Motion and Petition\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The City filed an answer and amended answer to CCC's writ petition and opposition to CCC's writ motion. The City argued CCC's writ motion was\n   premature and procedurally improper, and the Initiative imposes a tax, requiring placing the Initiative on a general election ballot. The City also lodged materials with the trial court in support of the City's opposition to CCC's writ motion. The materials included a binder of information entitled \"Marijuana and the Drug Cartels,\" and an accountant report dated February 22, 2015, entitled \"Compliance Summary &amp; Checklist for Lawful Operation of medical marijuana dispensary in the City of Upland California\" (accountant report). These materials were submitted to the City council for consideration regarding the Initiative during the March 9, 2015 City council meeting.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The accountant report was prepared by New Era Certified Public Accountants, LLP (New Era), which specializes in accounting and tax preparation services for medical marijuana dispensaries. The accountant report provided a list of compliance areas, including licensing and permits, and estimated related costs incurred by cities and counties. New Era estimated the total annual cost of the enforcement procedures itemized in the accountant report totaled $56,540 per dispensary, plus an additional annual $10,000 per dispensary to cover possible fees resulting from a noncompliant dispensary failing to comply with applicable regulations and guidelines, which could lead to revocation or suspension of a license.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On May 19, 2015, the trial court heard oral argument on CCC's writ motion. Without addressing whether Article 13C, section 2 applies to initiatives that impose a tax, the trial court denied CCC's writ petition and motion, finding that the $75,000 fee imposed by the Initiative qualified as a tax and therefore the Initiative was required to be placed on the next general election ballot. On June 5, 2015, the trial court entered judgment in favor of the City and against CCC on each allegation in CCC's writ petition. Although CCC filed a premature notice of appeal of the May 19, 2015, ruling before entry of judgment, this court ordered the premature notice of appeal construed as an appeal of the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   THE APPEAL IS NOT MOOT\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"Generally, an appeal will be dismissed as 'moot when any ruling by this court can have no practical impact or provide the parties effectual relief.

However, by\n   the time this decision becomes final, it may be too late to place the Initiative on the June 2016 ballot. (Elect.Code, \u00a7 1405.) CCC has requested, and this court granted on January 6, 2016, expedited review and calendar preference. Even if it is too late to place the Initiative on the June 7, 2016 election ballot, this appeal would not be moot because the issue will remain as to whether Article 13C applies to the Initiative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   When reviewing the trial court's ruling denying CCC's petition for a writ of mandate to compel a special election on the Initiative, this court \" ' \"need only review the record to determine whether the trial court's findings are supported by substantial evidence.\" ' [Citations.] However, we review questions of law independently.

The issues raised here, of whether imposition of the Initiative's $75,000 fee is a tax or a fee and whether pursuant to Article 13C, section 2, the Initiative must be placed on a special election ballot, are questions of law for this court to decide on an independent review of the facts.
