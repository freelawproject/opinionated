ORCP 21 A(8). The issue is whether defendant Multnomah County may be held liable for the harm plaintiffs suffered at the hands of Charlesworth, a parolee, based on section 319 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1974), or because defendant\u2019s actions created a reasonably foreseeable risk that plaintiffs would suffer such harm. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Previously, we affirmed the dismissal of plaintiff Robert McAlpine\u2019s complaint against defendants City of Portland and Regional Organized Crime Narcotics Agency. <em>McAlpine v.

We accept as true the allegations in the complaint and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from them. <em>Glubka v. Long, </em>115 Or App 236, 238, 837 P2d 553 (1992). A pleading that contains an allegation of material fact as to each element of the claim for relief, even if vague, is sufficient to survive a motion to dismiss. <em>Mazurek v. Rajnus, </em>253 Or 555, 557-58, 456 P2d 83 (1969); <em>Erikson v.

Defendant moved to dismiss plaintiffs\u2019 complaints pursuant to ORCP 21 A(8). The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion because, in the court\u2019s view, the crimes that led to Charlesworth\u2019s arrest in Washington County \u2014 possession <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>of a controlled substance, carrying a concealed weapon, driving under the influence of intoxicants, and criminal mischief \u2014 did not make it reasonably foreseeable that Charles-worth would assault plaintiffs.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b516-4\">In their sole assignment of error, plaintiffs argue that the trial court erred in dismissing their complaints because, according to plaintiffs, both contain facts sufficient to state a claim for negligence. Plaintiffs articulate two theories of liability that they contend are supported by the facts specifically alleged in the complaints. First, plaintiffs argue that the facts alleged are sufficient to establish that defendant\u2019s agent, a parole officer, failed to exercise the requisite care in controlling Charlesworth, as defined by section 319 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1974).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Alternatively, plaintiffs argue that the facts alleged are sufficient to establish that the parole officer\u2019s conduct \u201cunreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell the plaintifi[s].\u201d <em>Fazzolari v. Portland School Dist. No. 1J, </em>303 Or 1, 17, 734 P2d 1326 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">Defendant responds that our review in this case is controlled by <em>McAlpine I </em>under the doctrine of the law of the case. Alternatively, defendant argues that plaintiffs\u2019 complaints do not state claims for negligence. Specifically, defendant contends that plaintiffs failed to allege the elements of a claim under section 319 and that plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the principles of general foreseeability are precluded by <em>Restatement </em>section 315.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">Defendant argues first that, under the doctrine of the law of the case, we may not consider assertions of fact contrary to our findings in <em>McAlpine I </em>where we \u201cmade specific findings regarding allegations made against defendants.\u201dSee <em>Deyoe v. Holloway, </em>96 Or App 105, 106, 771 P2d 652 (1988), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number><em>rev den </em>308 Or 158 (1989) (holding that an earlier appellate decision, interpreting a partnership agreement, was binding on the same parties in the later appeal). However, any allegations made against Multnomah County in <em>McAlpine I </em>were not reviewed by this court because, as defendant acknowledges, Multnomah County was not party to that appeal <em>McAlpine </em>1, 131 Or App at 138 n 1. Moreover, plaintiffs have amended their complaints, alleging substantially different facts from those reviewed in <em>McAlpine I. </em>Because defendant was not a party to <em>McAlpine </em>I, and because the complaints now at issue differ substantially from the one reviewed previously, the law of the case doctrine plays no role here.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-4\">We proceed to defendant\u2019s alleged liability under <em>Restatement </em>section 319. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-5\">\u201cOne who takes charge of a third person whom he knows or should know to be likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled is under a duty to exercise reasonable care to control the third person to prevent him from doing such harm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">To state a claim under section 319, plaintiffs must plead facts as to three elements. <em>Mazurek, </em>253 Or at 557-58. Those elements are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b517-7\">\u201c(1) [T]he defendant had \u2018taken charge\u2019 of [Charlesworth]; (2) the defendant knew or should have known that [Charlesworth] was likely to cause bodily harm to others if not controlled; and (3) the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care to control [Charlesworth] to prevent [him] from doing harm to others.\u201d <em>Brown v. Washington County, </em>163 Or App 362, 370, 987 P2d 1254 (1999).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Under section 319, a person \u201ctakes charge\u201d of another when a custodial relationship exists. <em>Buchler v. State of Oregon, </em>316 Or 499, 506, 853 P2d 798 (1993) (stating that section 319 defines a custodian\u2019s duty in Oregon). Probation officers, acting in their supervisory capacity, are not custodians for the purpose of section 319 liability because, in that role, they do not exert the requisite degree of control over their charges. <em>Kim v. Multnomah County, </em>328 Or 140, 147-48, 970 P2d 631 (1998). That principle extends to parole officers acting in their supervisory capacity. Plaintiffs argue, nevertheless, that section 319 liability should attach here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>because Charlesworth was in custody at the Washington County Jail and was released only as a result of the parole officer\u2019s negligence. That argument is foreclosed by <em>Kim. Id. </em>(the risk of liability under section 319 attaches to the actual custodian). Because Charlesworth was not in the parole officer\u2019s custody when the alleged negligence occurred, defendant had not \u201ctaken charge\u201d of Charlesworth within the meaning of section 319. Thus, plaintiffs\u2019 complaints do not allege facts as to the first element of section 319, and the trial court\u2019s dismissal on that point was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">We turn to plaintiffs alternative <em>theory </em>\u2014 i.e., that even if liability could not be based on a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d under section 319, defendant could nevertheless be liable because its conduct \u201cunreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell the plaintiff.\u201d <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 17.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant responds that, even if <em>Fazzolari </em>could be read to endorse such an alternative theory of \u201cgeneral foreseeability\u201d liability in the context of custodial relationships, the Supreme Court repudiated that approach in <em>Buckler. </em>In particular, it is defendant\u2019s position that, when the Supreme Court expressly adopted section 319 <em>in Buchler, </em>316 Or at 506, it necessarily adopted section 315 as the law of Oregon. Section 315 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-5\">\u201cThere is no duty so to control the conduct of a third person as to prevent him from causing physical harm to another unless</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-6\">\u201c(a) a special relation exists between the actor and the third person which imposes a duty upon the actor to control the third person\u2019s conduct, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">\u201c(b) a special relation exists between the actor and the other which gives to the other a right to protection.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">Defendant contends that the Supreme Court could not have intended to adopt section 319 \u2014 an exception to section 315, <em>Buchler, </em>316 Or at 505 \u2014 without also adopting section 315, reasoning that exceptions do not exist in a vacuum and that, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>in the absence of the general rule, any exception to that rule would lack force. Thus, according to defendant, section 315 is the law in Oregon and, as such, operates to preclude recovery under plaintiffs\u2019 alternative theory of general foreseeability.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><em>Buchler, </em>on which defendant\u2019s position depends, stands for precisely the opposite proposition: In <em>Buckler, </em>the court, after addressing some of the plaintiffs\u2019 claims under the rubric of section 319 and finding no liability, proceeded to assess liability with respect to other claims under a \u201cgeneral foreseeability\u201d analysis. <em>Buchler, </em>316 Or at 507-14. That is, the absence of liability based on a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d under section 319 did <em>not </em>foreclose resort to general foreseeability. <em>Id. </em>That analysis would have been unnecessary\u2014 and, indeed, erroneous \u2014 if defendant\u2019s understanding of <em>Buckler </em>were correct.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">We note, moreover, that <em>Fazzolari </em>itself recognized third-party liability under the principles of general foreseeability and that we have previously and explicitly rejected the view that <em>Buckler </em>somehow repudiated resort to those principles in cases encompassed by the general rule of nonliability posed in section 315. In <em>Faverty v. McDonald\u2019s Restaurants, </em>133 Or App 514, 521-22, 892 P2d 703 (1995), <em>rev dismissed </em>326 Or 530 (1998), we affirmed an award of damages against the defendant employer for injuries to a motorist caused by an off-duty employee, observing that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-6\"><em>\u201c[t\\hree members </em>of the court [in Buckler] suggested that <em>Fazzolari </em>simply ought to be overruled. However, the majority of the court expressly declined to do that. Accordingly, at least until one more vote emerges on the Supreme Court to overrule <em>Fazzolari, </em>we are constrained to apply it.\u201d (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">We adhere to that conclusion.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>Defendant argues next that, even if plaintiffs\u2019 resort to general foreseeability is not precluded by section 315, their complaints fail to allege facts sufficient to state such a claim. <em>Fazzolari </em>requires a determination of whether defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cunreasonably created a foreseeable risk to a protected interest of the kind of harm that befell the plaintiff.\u201d 303 Or at 17. In <em>Buchler, </em>the Supreme Court said that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b520-4\">\u201c[w]hile it is generally foreseeable that crimin\u00e1is may commit crimes, * * * <em>that level of foreseeability </em>does not make the criminal\u2019s acts the legal responsibility of everyone who may have contributed in some way to the criminal opportunity.\u201d 316 Or at 511 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Implicit in the court\u2019s statement is the idea that <em>some </em>level of foreseeability does make a supervisee\u2019s criminal act the supervisor\u2019s legal responsibility. According to defendant, that level is reached only when the harm-producing crime is rationally related to the crime underlying the supervisory relationship. Defendant cites two cases in support of this proposition. In <em>Washa v. DOC, </em>159 Or App 207, 979 P2d 273, <em>rev allowed </em>329 Or 479 (1999), we affirmed a judgment for damages because it was foreseeable that an offender who absconded from parole, imposed for a previous violent sexual assault, would sexually assault the plaintiffs decedent. In <em>Zavalas v. Dept. of Corrections, </em>106 Or App 444, 809 P2d 1329 (1991), a woman on probation for drug possession killed two children in a traffic accident. She later tested positive for cocaine, heroin, and prescription drug use. We reversed the trial court, holding that summary judgment was precluded by issues of material fact concerning whether the offender\u2019s probation officer was negligent in failing to report earlier known drug violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">However, nothing in <em>Washa </em>or <em>Zavalas </em>limits our consideration to the underlying crime. It happened in those cases that, based on the underlying crime, a factfinder could reasonably find that each supervisor knew enough to foresee the resulting harm. However, in <em>Buchler, </em>the Supreme Corut examined the nonviolent nature of the offender\u2019s entire criminal history before concluding that the murder of two people was not a reasonably foreseeable consequence of leaving the keys in the vehicle used to escape. Similarly, this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>recently held that a third-party defendant could be found liable for negligence under the principles of general foreseeability based on a defendant\u2019s knowledge of an offender\u2019s violent criminal history. <em>Brown, </em>163 Or App at 375 (a reasonable jury could find that failure to warn plaintiffs decedent of offender\u2019s escape unreasonably created a foreseeable risk that he would be violently assaulted).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">Defendant acknowledges that the concept of foreseeability refers to generalized risks of the type of incidents rather than the predictability of the actual sequence of events. <em>Fazzolari, </em>303 Or at 21. In paragraph four of their respective complaints, plaintiffs allege that the parole officer knew or had reason to know of Charlesworth\u2019s violent history, which includes, <em>inter alia, </em>armed robbery, armed bank robbery, possession of a gas bomb, and assault in the first degree. In paragraph nine, plaintiffs allege that defendant knew or had reason to know that Charlesworth presented a danger to the community. Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints adequately allege facts as to the element of foreseeability, <em>Mazurek, </em>253 Or at 557-58, and we cannot say as a matter of law that the harm plaintiffs suffered as a result of Charlesworth\u2019s assaultive conduct was not reasonably foreseeable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Therefore, the trial court erred in dismissing plaintiffs\u2019 complaints.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b512-12\"> Plaintiff Judith McAlpine\u2019s second amended complaint differs only in the particulars related to Charlesworth\u2019s assault on her and the damages sought, neither of which affects our review under ORCP 21 A(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b516-8\"> The basis for the trial court\u2019s ruling was stated orally at the conclusion of the hearing on defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. The trial court did not address, orally or in writing, plaintiffs\u2019 argument that defendant was liable under section 319 of the <em>Restatement (Second) of Torts </em>(1974).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b516-9\"> Although Charlesworth was a state parolee, Multnomah County does not argue that it is an improper party. In paragraph seven of their complaints, as recited above, plaintiffs allege that, before any negligence occurred, a change in the law transferred the parole officer responsible for supervising Charlesworth from state employment to Multnomah County employment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b518-9\"> As the Supreme Court observed in <em>Buckler, Fazzolari\u2019s </em>reference to liability in negligence \u201cbased on the foreseeability of harm alone\u201d is <em>dictum. Buchler, </em>316 Or at 508. Rather, \u201c[t]he actual holding in <em>Fazzolari </em>was based on a special relationship between school officials and students required to attend that school.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b519-8\"> In <em>Kim, </em>a third-party negligent supervision case that followed <em>Buckler, </em>the Supreme Court declined to address the plaintiffs general foreseeability claim because it was not argued below, not because section 315 precluded it. <em>Kim, </em>328 Or at 147 n 2.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b519-9\"> The continuing viability of common-law negligence in the context of third-party liability was recently affirmed in <em>Grady v.
