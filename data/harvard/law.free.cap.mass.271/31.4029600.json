The case is bare of evidence of any care for their safety upon his part or the part of his companion plaintiffs. Not one paid any attention to the risk of collision with any street car which might be close by. Their cases are governed by the decision in <em>Birch </em>v. <em>Athol &amp; Orange Street Railway, </em>198 Mass. 257. The circumstances of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>accident were in evidence. No statutory presumption of due care (G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 85) was to be weighed with them. <em>Bagnell </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>247 Mass. 235, 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">The plaintiff Wilmur Motors, Inc., the owner of the machine driven by Harding, is not affected by the lack of care of the other plaintiffs, none of whom were its agents. It could recover if the damage to its motor vehicle was due to negligence of the defendant\u2019s servant. <em>Nash </em>v. <em>Lang, </em>268 Mass. 407. There is no sufficient evidence of such negligence. If his testimony was believed, manifestly he used all requisite care. If it was disbelieved, there was nothing to show lack of care. His speaking to a passenger with reference to her place of alighting even if, momentarily, it took his eyes from the track, was part of his duty in operating the street car; and, unless more were shown, could not be found to be negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The judge was right in directing verdicts for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
