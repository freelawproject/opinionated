Brackett; that Mary E. Brackett sold the remaining interest \u201cin her land appurtenant to said Millville Lake\u201d to Bessie M. Morrison from whom the plaintiffs took their title; that the plaintiffs obtained all the rights \u201cin tho reservations specified in the deed of\u201d Brackett to the defendant \u201cto wit: the right of bathing, boating, fishing and watering of five stock in the waters of any pond which may flow any of the land conveyed to said Arlington Mills by deed of said Mary E. Brackett.\u201d It is further alleged that \u201cin accordance with the plan contemplated in the deed of\u201d Brackett to the defendant \u201cand in furtherance of the contract between the parties thereto,\u201d a dam was erected on the defendant\u2019s land, and \u201cin consequence thereof the lake was created or enlarged\u201d; that the defendant, without right, is \u201cvoluntarily and maliciously\u201d turning the water through the gate in the dam, in order to drain the lake; that the lake \u201cis nearly dry,\u201d that the defendant has created \u201ca nuisance from smell and odor, and in consequence thereof the defendant has also created a fire hazard.\u201d The plaintiffs asked that the defendant be restrained from diverting the water from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>lake, that it be ordered to restore the dam to its former height and to desist from interfering with the plaintiffs\u2019 rights \u201cin the said body of water acquired through their deeds.\u201d The bill also alleges that the plaintiffs are residents of Lawrence in our county of Essex, and that the defendant has its usual place of business in that city.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">In the Superior Court the. defendant demurred. One of its grounds of demurrer was: \u201cThis court has no jurisdiction to order the performance, outside the Commonwealth, of the acts necessary to give the relief prayed for in the bill of complaint.\u201d The demurrer was sustained on this ground. The plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">Want of jurisdiction in* equity such as is here alleged properly is raised by demurrer. <em>Kansas &amp; Eastern Railroad Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Topeka, Salina &amp; Western Railroad, </em>135 Mass. 34. It was decided in <em>Rothstein </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>258 Mass. 196, and <em>Weiscopf </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>258 Mass. 199, that want of jurisdiction should be raised by demurrer. See also <em>Eastman Marble Co. </em>v. <em>Vermont Marble Co. </em>236 Mass. 138, 148; <em>Reilly </em>v. <em>Selectmen of Blackstone, </em>266 Mass. 503, 507.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">The Superior Court had jurisdiction of the parties. In an appropriate case it could enjoin the defendant from the performance of an act in a foreign territory. A court of equity acts <em>in personam </em>and can enforce its decrees against a resident of the Commonwealth or one actually present, prohibiting him from doing an act in another country. Gray, J. in <em>Hart </em>v. <em>Sansom, </em>110 U. S. 151. <em>Philadelphia Co. </em>v. <em>Stimson, </em>223 U. S. 605. See <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Desmond, </em>100 Mass. 267, 269. Ordinarily our courts decline to take jurisdiction where performance of a positive act is to be carried out in another State. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co. of New York, </em>14 Allen, 336. <em>Kansas &amp; Eastern Railroad Construction Co. </em>v. <em>Topeka, Salina &amp; Western Railroad, supra. Kimball </em>v. <em>St. Louis &amp; San Francisco Railway, </em>157 Mass. 7. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Security Mutual Life Ins. Co. </em>230 Mass. 320. <em>Arizona Commercial Mining Co. </em>v. <em>Iron Cap Copper Co. </em>233 Mass. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">Applying these principles to the case before us, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>plaintiffs seek to compel the defendant to perform certain acts in the State of New Hampshire. They allege that by its conduct the defendant has created a nuisance; that it has lowered the water in the pond; that it should be required by a decree of our courts to hold back the water so that the pond may be flooded, and to close the gate or place flash boards on the dam in order that the plaintiffs\u2019 rights of bathing, boating, fishing and watering stock may be protected. To protect adequately and fully the rights of the plaintiffs, positive acts must be done by the defendant in the State of New Hampshire. These rights can be fully protected in the courts of New Hampshire which have jurisdiction of the land and the water rights involved. The alleged nuisance can be abated and the flooding of the pond can be ordered by these courts. This is the relief sought by the plaintiffs. They also ask that the defendant be ordered to desist from further interference with their rights in the \u201cbody of water acquired through their deeds\u201d and prohibited from permitting the water to be diverted. Merely to restrain the defendant from these future acts would not give the plaintiffs suitable relief. The alleged nuisance would remain and the pond would continue to be \u201cnearly dry\u201d as alleged in the bill. The plaintiffs cannot have their interests and rights fully administered and complete justice done them except by the execution of positive acts by the defendant in holding back the water so as to fill the pond.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The acts complained of and the relief sought are of such nature that, under the authority of the cases cited, we decline to take jurisdiction, and we leave the parties to the relief to be afforded by the courts of the sister State of New Hampshire.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">The allegations of malice have no bearing on the question of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\"><em>Penn </em>v. <em>Lord Baltimore, </em>1 Ves. Sr. 444, and the cases relied on by the plaintiffs are to be distinguished on the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-8\">The decrees sustaining the demurrer and dismissing the bill were right.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-9\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
