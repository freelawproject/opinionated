L. c. 152, a decree was entered in the Superior Court ordering the payment of compensation for partial incapacity for work to the claimant, Alberta Emery, as an employee of the National Wood Heel Company, a corporation, and the insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-12\">The insurer states that the \u201conly issue in this case is' whether the said Alberta Emery may be found to be an employee under the workmen\u2019s compensation act when at the time of the injury she, as a stock holder and treasurer of the corporation, was engaged in the manual and mechanical operation of a machine owned by the corporation, and when at said time the remuneration received by the said. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>Alberta Emery was not included in the audit upon which the premium was computed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\">The findings of the reviewing board upon this issue were as follows: \u201cAlberta Emery, was an employee of the corporation ... of which she was a stockholder; . . . she was expressly included within the terms of the policy of insurance toward the latter part of June, 1928, she took upon herself the duties of a \u2018workman\u2019 within the meaning of Paragraph A of the policy of insurance, working in the \u2018turning room\u2019 on a hand-concaving machine until September 19,1929, (during which time she was carried on the books of the corporation as a \u2018workman\u2019 at a weekly wage of $30) when the knife connected with the machine took off the end of her left middle finger . . ; . . . this injury arose out of and in the course of her employment; ...\u201d The reviewing board made no finding as to the claimant being the treasurer of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">If these findings were warranted by the evidence the decree entered thereon was proper. No one of them is inconsistent with the finding that the claimant \u201cwas an employee of the corporation.\u201d According to the statutory definition, the word \u201cemployee\u201d includes \u201cevery person in the service of another under any contract of hire, express or implied, oral or written,\u201d with exceptions not material here. G. L. c. 152, \u00a7 1 (4). Holding stock or office in a corporation is not necessarily inconsistent with being an \u201cemployee\u201d thereof. <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Dewey Fuel Co. </em>210 Mich. 370. <em>Skouitchi </em>v. <em>Chic Cloak &amp; Suit Co. </em>230 N. Y. 296. <em>Hubbs </em>v. <em>Addison Electric Light &amp; Power Co. </em>230 N. Y. 303. Compare <em>Kolpien </em>v. <em>O\u2019Donnell Lumber Co. </em>230 N. Y. 301. In the absence of special circumstances, a stockholder or officer of a corporation in its service is \u201cin the service of another\u201d within the meaning of the statute, since the corporation is a legal entity distinct from any of its stockholders or officers. <em>McAlevey </em>v. <em>Litch, </em>234 Mass. 440, 441. <em>Star Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Flynn, </em>237 Mass. 213, 217. There is nothing contrary to this principle in <em>Cashman\u2019s Case, </em>230 Mass. 600. See, however, as to a partnership, <em>Ellis </em>v. <em>Joseph Ellis &amp; Co. </em>[1905] 1 K. B. 324, 328, 330. The finding that the claimant \u201ctook upon herself <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the duties of a \u2018workman, \u2019 \u201d read in connection with the finding that \u201cshe was carried on the books of the corporation as a \u2018workman,\u2019 \u201d is not inconsistent with the existence of a \u201ccontract of hire.\u201d The finding that \u201cshe was expressly included within the terms of the policy of insurance\u201d distinguishes the case from <em>Cashman\u2019s Case, supra, </em>which was decided in favor of the insurer on the ground that the claimant there was excluded from the policy because his remuneration was not considered in determining the premium to be paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">The evidence warranted the findings of the reviewing board. The claimant testified, in substance, as follows: At the time of the accident she owned seventy-four shares in the corporation, her husband, two shares, and one Eliot seventy-four shares. Her husband did not work for the corporation. She \u201cwas employed by the National Wood Heel Company and at the time of her injury . . . was receiving $30 a week.\u201d She worked in the office up to June, 1928. In the latter part of that month, on account of business conditions, she went to the \u201cturning room\u201d and ran a \u201chand concaving machine\u201d until she was injured. She went to work there after consulting with Eliot. She \u201ctook on the job she wanted\u201d to and \u201cwas on the payroll.\u201d The report of the accident gave her occupation as \u201cTreasurer of the Corporation,\u201d but there was no other testimony to this effect. From this and other evidence the inference was warranted that the claimant, when injured, was running the machine as an \u201cemployee\u201d of the corporation, and that her weekly wage was paid to her as such \u201cemployee\u201d and not as a stockholder or officer. The evidence does not show special circumstances which preclude a finding that she was an \u201cemployee.\u201d This is true even if the statement in the report of the accident that she was treasurer of the corporation is accepted as correct. See <em>Dewey </em>v. <em>Dewey Fuel Co. supra. Hubbs </em>v. <em>Addison Electric Light </em>&amp; <em>Power Co. supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">The finding that the claimant \u201cwas expressly included within the terms \u00f3f the policy of insurance\u201d was justified. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>The policy covered the period from May 28, 1928, to May 28, 1929. It provided that it should apply to \u201cinjuries . . . sustained by the President, any Vice-President, Secretary or Treasurer of this Employer, if a corporation,\u201d and that the \u201cpremium is based upon the entire remuneration earned ... by all employees . . . ; excepting however the remuneration of the President, any Vice-President, Secretary or Treasurer of this Employer, if a corporation, but including the remuneration of any one or more of such designated officers who are actually performing such duties as are ordinarily undertaken by a superintendent, foreman or workman.\u201d When the policy was issued the premium was estimated, but it contained a provision for adjustment of premium at the end of the period on the basis of remuneration actually earned by employees. No estimate of remuneration for the treasurer as \u201cworkman\u201d was included in the policy as issued, and, according to the claimant\u2019s testimony, remuneration for her was excluded from the audit of May, 1928, upon which the estimated premium was based. It did not follow, however, from the exclusion of remuneration for her from this audit and from the estimate, that, if she later performed the duties of a \u201cworkman,\u201d her wages therefor were to be excluded from the remuneration actually earned, upon the basis of which the premium was to be adjusted at the end of the period covered by the policy. According to the evidence her wages as a \u201cworkman\u201d were included in the corporation payroll. At the time of the hearing no audit for the purpose of adjusting the premium had been made, but it could have been found that, according to the terms of the policy, in such an adjustment her wages should be included in the remuneration actually earned, and that she was covered by the policy. In this respect the case differs from <em>Cashman\u2019s Case, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
