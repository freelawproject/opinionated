There was testimony also that at different times she swept the sidewalk in front of her store and cleaned it of snow and ice. It was agreed by the parties at the trial that the defendant was covered by liability insurance against loss arising from claims, among others, by \u201cpersons not employed by the assured while within or upon the premises ... or upon the sidewalk, ways or premises adjacent thereto,\u201d with exceptions not here material.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>The defendant was not responsible to the plaintiff for the defect unless she had control of the iron frame and consequently, as to the public, was under the duty of keeping it in repair. <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Cambridge Savings Bank, </em>138 Mass. 480, 481. <em>Grasselli Dyestuff Corp. </em>v. <em>John Campbell &amp; Co. </em>259 Mass. 103, 108.. <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rubin, </em>259 Mass. 379. It could not have been found that she had such control. Her lease, unlike that in <em>Boston </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>144 Mass. 53, and that in <em>Kelley </em>v. <em>Rubin, supra, </em>did not in terms cover anything but the \u201cstore,\u201d and the evidence did not warrant a finding that the cellar was a part of the \u201cstore.\u201d See <em>Raynes </em>v. <em>Stevens, </em>219 Mass. 556, 557. (The \u201cstore\u201d was not the entire structure as in <em>Hooper </em>v. <em>Farnsworth, </em>128 Mass. 487.) Whatever right, if any, the defendant had to occupy the cellar, it was not shown that it was exclusive so as to give her control. See <em>Shipley </em>v. <em>Fifty Associates, </em>106 Mass. 194, 200; <em>Larue </em>v. <em>Farren Hotel Co. </em>116 Mass. 67; <em>Flanagan </em>v. <em>Welch, </em>220 Mass. 186, 191, 193. It could have been found that the iron frame was a part of the cellar <em>(Boston </em>v. <em>Gray, supra), </em>but not that it was a part of the \u201cstore.\u201d The defendant\u2019s agreement to make outside repairs did not apply to premises not covered by the lease, and her agreement as to the removal of snow and ice was not broad enough to give her control, in other respects, of the iron frame of the \u201cHyatt Light,\u201d under the doctrine of <em>Wixon </em>v. <em>Bruce, </em>187 Mass. 232. Since the defendant\u2019s liability insurance against loss arising from claims by persons on the sidewalk had ample scope for operation apart from liability for defects in the iron frame, the case is distinguishable from <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Rice, </em>187 Mass. 28, in that the existence of such insurance was not evidence, as an admission by her or otherwise, that she had control of the iron frame. See <em>Enman </em>v. <em>Trustees of Boston University, </em>270 Mass. 299. Nor was the fact that she swept the sidewalk and cleaned it of snow and ice evidence of such control. No question arises upon the record as to the defendant\u2019s liability to an invited person entering or leaving her \u201cstore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It follows that the exceptions must be sustained and judgment for the defendant entered under G. L. c. 231, \u00a7 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
