L. c. 156, \u00a7 46, on May 6, 1929, the plaintiff made a demand on the defendant corporation for payment for his stock; that such demand was- made within thirty days after the date of said meeting; that the plaintiff has been ready and willing and has offered to take such further action as is prescribed by G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 46, for valuation or appraisal of the plaintiff\u2019s said shares but the defendant corporation has neglected and refused and still neglects and refuses to take any action in connection therewith and refuses to recognize the rights of the plaintiff in the premises in any way whatsoever; and that on or about May 11, 1929, the plaintiff appointed an appraiser in accordance with the statute above referred to, and has duly notified the defendant to that effect, but the defendant has refused to appoint an appraiser or to pay the plaintiff the value of his shares.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">The prayers of the bill are (1) that the plaintiff\u2019s claim against the defendant be established, the amount thereof to be established, and the defendant be ordered to pay the same; and (2) that the defendant be ordered to appoint an appraiser and otherwise comply with the provisions of G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The defendant demurred on the ground that the bill \u201cdoes not set forth or allege that the change in or amendment of the agreement of association and articles of organization of, the defendant corporation, of which the plaintiff complains, ever became effective by filing with the com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>missioner within thirty days of the meeting held April 8, 1929, the articles of amendment required by the provisions of section 43 of chapter 156 of the General Laws.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">The bill nowhere alleges that the adopted amendment was within thirty days of the meeting held on April 8, 1929, or thereafter submitted to the commissioner of corporations for examination; that the commissioner examined the adopted articles of amendment signed and sworn to by the president, treasurer and a majority of the directors; that he found that they conformed to the requirements of law and indorsed his approval thereon. Nor does the bill allege that the articles of amendment were filed in the office of the State secretary with the payment of the fee provided in G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 54 or \u00a7 55, as the case may be.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">The question raised by the demurrer is, Must a minority stockholder, to enforce the remedy given him by G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 46, prove, as a material fact and therefore allege in his bill of complaint, not only that the articles of amendment were adopted in accordance with G. L. e. 156, \u00a7 42, but also that they were approved by the commissioner and filed as is provided shall be done in G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 43. We think the question is answered affirmatively by the concluding clause of \u00a7 43 which reads: \u201cNo such amendment or alteration shall take effect until such articles of amendment shall have been filed as aforesaid.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">The contention of the plaintiff, that so far as the rights of stockholders under G. L. c. 156, \u00a7 46, are concerned the vote of the stockholders in accordance with \u00a7 42 results in a <em>de facto </em>if not a <em>de jure </em>amendment of the agreement of association, and therefore gives the dissentient stockholder a right for payment of his stock, is unsound, for the reason, if no other, that the amendment does not take effect, and therefore is not \u201cduly voted,\u201d until the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43 are fully complied with. However it may be as to creditors, we think it plain that dissentient stockholders have no enforceable right of action or claim to relief under the provisions of G. L. c. 156, \u00a7\u00a7 42, 43 and 46, until there shall have been a <em>de jure </em>change in the articles of organiza<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>tion. There is nothing in the decision of <em>Olympia Theatres, Inc. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Mass. 374, <em>Cunningham </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Banks, </em>249 Mass. 401, <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>v. <em>Wasserman, </em>251 Mass. 514, <em>Commissioner of Banks </em>v. <em>Cosmopolitan Trust Co. </em>253 Mass. 205, <em>Commissioner of Banks </em>v. <em>Tremont Trust Co. </em>259 Mass. 162 or <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Mitchell, Woodbury Co. </em>263 Mass. 160, which supports the contention of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-3\">\n<em>Decrees affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
