Bakin et als. (10 Cal., 312) affirmed.</history>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-9\">Appeal from the District Court of the Fifth Judicial District, County of Tuolumne.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">This was an action brought by plaintiffs to recover damages for the diversion, by defendants, of the waters of the South Fork of the Stanislaus River, to which plaintiffs claimed to be entitled by priority of possession. Also, for a perpetual injunction restraining defendants from further interference with said water.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-11\">Plaintiffs obtained a judgment for damages, and also for one hundred and forty \u201ctom streams\u201d of water; from which they appeal, on the ground that the amount of water awarded, through the admission of improper evidence and erroneous rulings of the Court, was not more than half the amount to which they were entitled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-12\">On the trial, Dr. Pownall, one of the plaintiffs, was called as a witness by defendants. On the close of his examination-in-chief, plaintiffs proceeded to examine him in regard to \u201cvarious matters pertinent to the issue.\u201d Defendants\u2019 counsel objected, and the Court sustained the objection. Plaintiffs' counsel excepted. The case turned in this Court on this point, which was the fourth error assigned by appellants\u2019 counsel.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b405-13\"><em>H. P. Barber and Tod Robinson </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-14\">Section four hundred and twenty-one of the Practice Act pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>vides that a party examined as a witness by an adverse party, may be examined on his own behalf \u201cin respect to any matters pertinent to the issue.\u201d</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b406-6\">This right was denied to us by the Court, and the ruling was erroneous. Drake <em>v. </em>Eakin, 10 Cal., 312.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b406-7\"><em>James W. Coffroth </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AWpF\">Terry, C. J., delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AxF\">Field, J., and Baldwin, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-9\">It is unnecessary to examine the various errors assigned in the brief of counsel, as the fourth exception is fatal to respondents\u2019 case, under the decision of Drake <em>v. </em>Eakin, at the present term. On the authority of that case, the judgment is reversed, and a new trial ordered.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
