LIDDELL, AND MARY, HIS WIFE.</parties>\n<syllabus data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-8\">Where T. and 0. executed a joint lease to L., of certain premises, and it was specified in the lease that $20 rent should be paid to T. and $20 to 0.\u2014and on breach of the terms of the lease on the part of the lessee, T. and 0., the lessors, brought a joint suit to recover restitution of the premises, and damages for their detention: <em>Held, </em>that there was no misjoinder of parties plaintiff.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b312-9\">By failing to pay rent when demanded, the contract under the lease was determined, and the possession of the defendants was from that time tortious.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b312-10\">Appeal from the County Court of the County of San Francisco</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">This was an action of unlawful detainer, to recover possession of leased premises, and for damages for their detention.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-12\">The premises were leased by the plaintiffs to the defendant John H. Liddell, at <em>$40 </em>per month\u2014$20 payable to plaintiff Treat, and $20 payable to Edward Carpenter, since deceased.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-13\">The action was originally commenced in a Justice\u2019s Court, where defendants had judgment. Plaintiffs appealed to the County Court, where the cause was tried by the intervention of a jury, who returned a verdict for the plaintiff, and $40 per month from the first of February, 1856, and judgment was entered thereon for restitution of the premises, and for damages, from which judgment the defendants appealed to this Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-14\"><em>M. T. O\u2019 Connor </em>for Appellants.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b312-15\"><em>Samuel </em>_H. <em>Brodie </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AOUD\">Terry, C.

By failing to pay rent when demanded, the contract under the lease was determined, and the possession of the defendants was, from that time, tortious.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">The question of title to the property does not arise ; the lease is evidence, not of title in the plaintiff, but of the fact of actual possession prior to defendants\u2019 entry, and of the fact that defendants acquired possession under them.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">The verdict and evidence are conclusive that the judgment recovered by Hoe against defendants was collusive, and was suffered with intent to defraud plaintiff. It was, therefore, void as to them. (See section 20 of the Statutes of Frauds, Wood\u2019s Digest, 107.)</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">There being no error in the record, judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
