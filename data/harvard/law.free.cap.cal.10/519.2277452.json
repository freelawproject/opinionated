The defendant, Eugene Chevrier, subsequently petitioned the Court to revoke the letters granted to plaintiff, and order the property of the deceased to be delivered to him as the surviving husband of the deceased, there being no debts against the estate, except the funeral expenses. Chevrier did not allege, in his petition, nor was it shown to the Court, on the hearing thereof, that there were no descendants of the deceased. The Court revoked the letters of plaintiff, and ordered that the property be delivered to the defendant as the surviving husband of the deceased. Plaintiff appealed to this Court, and assigned as error : <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number><em>\u201c </em>That the petition for the revocation of said letters was defective, in not showing affirmatively that there were no descendants of the deceased who would be entitled to a moiety of the estate.\"</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b530-4\"><em>George W.
