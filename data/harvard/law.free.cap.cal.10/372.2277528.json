In the first place, there seems to be no statement. In the second, the allegations of the complaint are not specifically denied; and, in the third place, we think that the only point seriously urged by the appellants\u2014the want of consideration in the paper sued upon\u2014is unfounded, because whatever the rule may be at common law, the statute (Wood\u2019s Digest, 75, 81) makes such an instrument as that sued on, <em>prima facie </em>evidence of indebtedness, though no consideration be expressed therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
