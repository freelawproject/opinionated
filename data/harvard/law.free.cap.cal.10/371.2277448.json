After this, Gardner went across the street to wait on a lady.\u201d Record then proceeds : \u201c Witness was then about to tell what Bradley hallooed to Gardner immediately after he went across the street, to which plaintiff objected, and defendant insisted on witness making the statement, on the ground that it was a part of the same conversation. The Court sustained the objection, on the ground that it was statements of the plaintiff made after the slanderous words were spoken by the defendant.\u201d To which ruling of the Court, defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b381-12\">The cause was tried before a jury, who returned a verdict for plaintiff, and assessed the damages at $500.

J., and Field, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">Without considering the other assignments of error, it is apparent that the judgment must be reversed, on the ground that the Court below, on the trial, refused to admit the proof of the entire conversation between plaintiff and defendant at the time of the uttering of the alleged slanderous words. The question asked was as to the reply made by the plaintiff when the defendant uttered the words for speaking which suit was brought. That reply might have qualified or explained the words, or shown in what sense they were uttered, or even admitted their truth. At all events, they were a part of the transaction out of which the suit <em>arose; </em>and the plaintiff was entitled to have them if he thought them material. For this error, the judgment must be reversed, and the cause remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
