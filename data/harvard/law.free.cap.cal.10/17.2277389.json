Kendall, and, under color of said execution, wrongfully and illegally entered upon and sold certain property, the homestead of plaintiffs, and averring damages in the sum of two thousand dollars, the value of the property is insufficient, as the same does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b27-10\">No damage has or can result from such a sale. If the property sold was a homestead, the sheriff's deed conveyed nothing.
