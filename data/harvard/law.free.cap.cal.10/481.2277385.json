The undertaking was filed the 28th of April, 1858, whilst the notice of appeal was not filed until May 31st, 1858, more than a month afterwards.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b491-12\"><em>R.

If an appeal could be rendered effectual by an undertaking filed one month pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>viously, it might be by an undertaking filed at any time previously within a year. And the undertaking, if of sufficient amount, must operate, if at all, to stay proceedings, and it would thus often happen that a stay would be obtained for the entire period during which an appeal is allowed, and no appeal in fact be ever taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">The filing of the notice of appeal must precede the filing of the undertaking.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
