It is there said: <em>\u201c We </em>are satisfied, from a full examination of the instrument, that it was designed as an executory agreement for the sale of the property therein described, or a conveyance on condition precedent, dependent for its validity on the performance of an act <em>in pais.\u201d </em>That was an ejectment in which it was only necessary to decide whether it could be operative as a conveyance\u2014whether it was operative as an executory agreement was not determined. It may have been intended as an executory agreement, or as a conveyance on condition precedent, and yet inoperative as either, for want of conformity with the requirements of law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>It is difficult to imagine why greater certainty should be required in the one character of instrument than in either of the others. The contract, whether executed or executory, is wholly in writing, and its effect is a question of law, whether it was intended as a conveyance, either <em>in presenti </em>or upon conditions precedent, or as an agreement to convey, must be ascertained from its own terms. Young <em>v. </em>Jeffries &amp; Harris, 3 Dev. &amp; Bat. N. C., 216.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">In a written contract as to lands, the terms are fixed, and their meaning is a question of law; it must be certain, or refer to another which makes it certain, and parol evidence is not admissible to supply a substantial defect. Massey <em>v. </em>Belisle, 2 Iredell, 170; Taney <em>v. </em>Batchell, 9 Grill\u2019s R., 206; Church of the Advent, <em>v. </em>Farrow, 7 Rid. Eq., 378<em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-6\">Is greater certainty of description required in a conveyance <em>in present\u00ed, </em>than in conveyance on condition precedent ? A labored and patient research among the authorities has failed to produce a single case favoring the affirmative, while the general principles of the cases, as well as right reason, are with the negative. The latter is, of necessity, already in one view uncertain, for it depends for its effect upon the performance of an act <em>in pais, </em>which may never be performed, and, therefore, ought not certainly in other respects to be more rigidly exacted. Aside from the power to sell, and the covenants on the part of the grantor, which can not enlarge or otherwise affect the estate, the terms of the deed are, with one exception, <em>in present\u00ed, </em>and completed; and if they operate at all it must be instantly or against their own ordinary import. These terms are, \u201c hath granted, bargained, and sold, and by these presents doth grant, bargain, and sell \u201d 2200 lots in Sacramento city, with a vast quantity of other property specifically described; and afterwards, it is provided that if the $125,000 should be paid, in certain instalments, \u201c then this instrument is to take effect as a full and complete conveyance, in fee, of all and singular the lands, tenements, hereditaments, appurtenances, and real estate in the State of California, belonging, etc., to the party of the first part.\u201d In all this, there is not the semblance of any agreement, on the part of the grant- or, for further assurance, or of any other act to be done by him, but upon the happening of the event specified, that instrument was to take effect as a conveyance; and even if such event did happen, the instrument might be inoperative, by reason of the interposition of certain inexorable rules of law herein considered. The whole writing shows that Sutter, Jr., performed all his obligations when its execution was consummated. His vendees took it as then completed, and for what it was worth; and if worthless, and they were not the victims of his fraud, which is not pretended, they can not now complain. To hold otherwise, would be to add to the writing, even to make for the parties a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>new contract presenting little or no analogy to that which they made for themselves. Courts can construe contracts, but here their power ends; they can not make or alter contracts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-5\">But the clause from which it is argued to be a conveyance, on condition precedent, or an executory agreement, does not apply to the 2200 lots, nor to any of the property particularly described, but was intended to affect other property which the grantor was presumed to own in the State. The rule is, to construe the instrument so as to give effect to the whole if practicable; and to carry out the rule, it is necessary to give a specific effect to particular provisions as against those which are general. <em>JSxpressum facit cessare taciturn. </em>The 2200 lots, if they passed at all, were conveyed by the particular words \u201c grant, bargain, etc.,\u201d in the former part of the deed, and the conditional or ex-ecutory clause relates wholly to other lands. \u201c Subsequent words shall not defeat precedent ones, if by construction they may stand together. But where there are two clauses in a deed, of which the latter is contradictory to the former, then the former shall stand \u201d \u201cIf there is repugnancy in a deed, the first clause shall stand.\u201d \u201cWhatever is expressly granted, etc., can not be restrained or diminished by subsequent restrictions, etc., but general or doubtful clauses precedent may be distributed or explained by subsequent words and clauses, not repugnant or contradictory to the express grant, covenant, etc.\u201d \u00d1or can subsequent words or clauses repugnant to the express grant, demise, covenant, etc., enlarge such grant, etc.\u201d Green leaf\u2019s Cruise, 300, 301, and notes; Cutter <em>v. </em>Tufts, 3 Pick. R., 272.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">The doctrine here affirmed is not in conflict with that very respectable class of cases in which instruments for the sale of lands have even been construed as mere agreements, though they contained the usual expressions of a conveyance as grant, bargain, and sell, in the present tense. In those cases, it appeared from the whole instruments to have been the intention that the grantor was to make further assurance; but without- words evidencing such intention, such further assurance ought not to be decreed; nor will the usual operative words of a conveyance be wrested from their common significance, unless there are other words in the writing with which they are in conflict. Such were the cases of Stouffer <em>v. </em>Coleman, 1 Yates R., 393, and Dawson <em>v. </em>Megill, 4 Whart., 220.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">In these cases, the words grant, bargain, and sell, had been employed, but in neither was there any want of certainty, nor of mutuality, and in both there were express covenants, among other things, for further assurance. To give effect, therefore, to the whole instrument, it was necessary to restrict the ordinary import of the words employed; but here there is no such necessity. In this case the expression is not that upon the happening of the event <em>in pais </em>the vendor shall execute a conveyance; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>instrument itself was to take effect as a conveyance. But the question recurs, to take effect as a conveyance of what real estate ? Could it be of that which was already specifically conveyed, or was it, as we contend, of all real estate of the grantor in California not therein previously conveyed ? Proper technical words of conveyance <em>in present\u00ed </em>had already been employed as to the 2200 lots, and other property of the vendor; and can their import and effect be wholly changed by a subsequent clause between which and the former there is, in no view, any necessary conflict ? The affirmative would assert, for a mere subsequent conditional or executory clause, the potency of defeating or entirely changing the character of the very estate already created by the direct and positive terms of the deed; a proposition in conflict with all sense and authority.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-5\">It makes no difference that these direct and positive terms are inoperative for the want of mutuality and certainty, their effect can not be enlarged or impaired by other subsequent words relating to other real estate, and not to the lots in question. And although it may result that the deed as to the lots is void, yet its defects can not be aided by other provisions intended to affect other property; each distinct substantive provision must rest upon its own merits.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-6\">That these positions are correct will clearly appear from the face of the whole deed; for immediately after the supposed conveyance of the 2200 lots, and other property specifically described, there follows a distinct general warranty of title as to such. Then follows a distinct covenant to make (and, in the same sentence, an appointment of,) the parties of the second part the attorneys in fact of the vendor, to enter upon and take possession of, and to sell any of his lands and real estate in California. Then follows a covenant of the vendor not to sell any of his lands and real estate in the State, or to receive from any person or persons, any sum or sums of money which are due and owing to the said party of the first part, for the sale of any real estate, etc. How, why make the respondent and others attorneys to take possession of and to sell, and why covenant himself not to sell that which had been already sold with warranty of title ? And why the other covenants ? They could not give any additional force to the conveyance <em>in present\u00ed, </em>with warranty already made\u2014and thus to give reasonable effect to all the different parts of the deed, we are forced to the conclusion that all its provisions, after that of general warranty, were intended to affect other real estate supposed to have been owned by the vendor.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b113-7\">It is conceded that if the instrument had referred to another, as constituting a part of the same agreement, then parol evidence would have been admissible to ascertain that to which such reference was made; but here there is no reference, and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>therefore, no pretext for the application of the exceptional rule. Clinraun <em>v. </em>Cooke, 1 Schooles &amp; LeFroys, 32-3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-5\">Where an agreement is reduced to writing, aside from the peculiar provisions of the statute as to such as affect lands, it is presumed to express the whole contract, to bind all the parties so far as they intended to be bound; and, in view of this rule, any other intention of the respondent and his co-purchasers, is wholly excluded. 2 Starkie\u2019s Ev., 548-9; 2 Cow. and Hill\u2019s notes to Phil, on Ev., 593, 595, 598; King, adm\u2019r, <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 Mo. R., 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-6\">The test of the admissibility of parol evidence in general cases, is, whether it will vary the written instrument. If so, it is inadmissible, and here such evidence would supply a consideration where there is none, and bind those who are not bound by the terms of their own agreement. <em>A fortiori </em>do these considerations control in written contracts as to lands. Massey <em>v. </em>Belisle, 2 Iredell, 170; Taney <em>v. </em>Batchell, 9 Gill\u2019s R., 206; Church of Advent <em>v. </em>Farrow, 1 Rid. Eq., 378.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-7\">That it is not a valid conveyance <em>in present\u00ed </em>is already adjudged; and it is, then, to be regarded either as a conveyance on condition precedent or an executory agreement. In either case, to subject the appellant to this action it ought to be shown that he had legal notice of the instrument, and of the payment therein specified. In their argument below, it seems to have escaped the attention of the counsel for the respondent that it might be effectual as between the parties, and yet its recordation, even if allowed by law, be insufficient to bind or affect third persons! In one of the principal cases cited by themselves, it is held that a conveyance of all the estate, both real and personal, to which the grantor is entitled, in law or equity, is valid to pass his whole estate; but the registry of a deed, conveying land by such general description, is not notice in law to subsequent purchasers from the grantor of the existence of such deed. And even actual notice of such deed, and of its contents, would not affect such purchaser unless he had notice that the land purchased by him was included in the deed; and the proof of such notice must be such as to affect the conscience of the purchaser\u2014and is not sufficient if it merely puts him on inquiry. It should be so clear and strong as to fix upon him the imputation of <em>mala fides. </em>Munday <em>v. </em>Vawter and others, 3 Grat. R, 518.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b114-8\">Those decisions which apply to a definite ascertained portion of property will not extend to a vague and indefinite contract of this kind: it being a leading principle that to affect a subsequent purchaser on the ground of implied notice of a former title, there must be something to lead such purchaser distinctly to a knowledge of such title, with reference to the identical specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>property in question. Lewis <em>v. </em>Madison, 1 Munf. R., 303; French <em>v. </em>Loyal Co., 5 Leigh, 627.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-5\">Admit that the appellant had notice of these contents, still it was only of these contents\u2014he \u201ccould only be chargeable with constructive notice from the record where the record itself would give actual notice;\u201d but here the writing itself did not give the requisite notice. Jennings <em>v. </em>Wood, 20 Ohio R., 261.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-6\">To fix fraud, the proof of notice must be clear; if it is doubtful, a presumption of fraud will not take place. Curtis <em>v. </em>Lume, 6 Munf., 42.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b115-7\"><em>Jo. G. Baldwin, </em>for Appellant, made an argument in support of the ground taken by Mr. Edwards.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b115-8\"><em>H. O. Beatty </em>for Respondent.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b115-9\">Terry, C. J., after stating the facts, delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">Burnett, J., and Field, J., concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-10\">The case, as presented by the record, involves three questions :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-11\"><em>First, </em>as to the character of the conveyance from Sutter to Brannan and others.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-12\"><em>Second, </em>the effect of the registration; and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b115-13\"><em>Third, </em>whether the conditions were performed by the vendees.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b115-14\">The objection on the ground that one of the grantees was the trustee or agent of Sutter, and that the purchase was a fraud on his <em>cestui que trust, </em>is not supported by the record. The only evidence on this point is that of Wetzlar, who says that he was requested by Sutter to find purchasers for the land; that he found parties who were willing to purchase three-fourths, and that Sutter himself requested Wetzlar to become the purchaser of the remaining one-fourth upon the terms already agreed on between Sutter and Brannan.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-15\">There is no evidence that Wetzlar sustained any fiduciary relation with Sutter, or had any peculiar knowledge of his affairs, before the execution of the deed; his agency, according to the evidence, began after that period.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-16\">The first step in the construction of a deed is to ascertain the understanding and intention of the parties at the time of contracting.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-17\">\u201cWhen it is necessary to give an opinion upon the doubtful words of the deed, the first thing we ought to inquire into is, what was the intention of the parties ? If the intention of the parties be as doubtful as the words, it will be of no assistance at all; but if the intent of the parties be plain and clear, we ought, if possible, to put such a construction on the doubtful words of a deed as will best answer the intent of the parties, and reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>that construction which manifestly tends to overturn and destroy it.\u201d (Parkhurst <em>v. </em>Smith, Willes, 322.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">To arrive at this intention, the situation of the parties, and the subject-matter at the time of contracting, should be considered; the whole deed should be taken together, and, if possible, effect should be given to all of its parts. \u201c It is a true and important rule of construction, that the sense and meaning of the parties to any particular instrument, should be collected <em>ex antecedentibus et consequentibus; </em>that is to say, every part of it should be brought into action, in order to collect from the whole, one uniform and consistent sense, if that may be done; or, in other words, the construction must be made upon the entire instrument, and not merely upon disjointed parts of it; the whole context must be considered in endeavoring to collect the intention of the parties, although the immediate object of inquiry be the meaning of an isolated clause. In short, the law will judge of a deed or other instrument, consisting of divers parts or clauses, by looking at the whole; and will give to each part its proper office, so as to ascertain and carry out the intention of the parties.\u201d (Broom\u2019s Legal Maxims, 442.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The reason of this rule is, that the \u201c same parties make all the contract, and may be supposed to have the same purpose and object in view in all of it; and if this purpose is more clear and certain in some parts than in others, those which are obscure may be illustrated by the light of others.\" (2 Parsons, 14.) If several instruments are made at the same time, by the same par-tics, and in relation to the same subject, the intention of the parties is to be gathered from all the instruments, taken together, and the recitals in each may be explained or corrected by reference to any other. (Ib., 15.) Oral evidence is sometimes admissible to explain, but not to contradict or vary the terms of a written contract; thus, if the words of a contract be ambiguous, its meaning may be gathered from contemporaneous facts which intrinsic testimony establishes. If, when the intention is thus ascertained, it is found that the words will fairly bear a construction which makes them express this intention, then the words will be so construed, and the contract in this sense, or with this interpretation, will be enforced as the contract which the parties had made. The distinctions between patent and latent ambiguities, are now regarded as intended to enable the Court to distinguish between cases curable and those of incurable uncertainty; to carry the aid of evidence as far as it can go, without making for the parties what they did not make for themselves. (2 Parsons, 75.)</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Taking the deed from Sutter to Brannan and others as a whole, and testing it by the above rules, it is clear that Sutter intended to convey all his real estate in California; but, in view of the state of affairs then existing, he was unwilling to part with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>legal title until bis vendees had fully complied with the conditions of the sale. <em>At </em>the time of making the contract, California had just completed the organization of a State government; the operation of the judiciary system adopted had not been tested; the population was unsettled; sudden changes in the fortunes of individuals were constantly occurring, and personal security was of little value. It was, therefore, natural that a party disposing of valuable real estate should retain the legal title in himself as the best possible security for the payment of the purchase-money.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We are satisfied that the deed in question was intended as a conveyance upon condition precedent, and that the grantees could acquire no title under it until the condition had been performed. If it had been intended as a conveyance <em>in present\u00ed, </em>there could have been no necessity for inserting the power of attorney to enable the grantees to dispose of their own property, nor for providing that the instrument should take effect as a conveyance upon the happening of an event <em>in futuro. </em>That this was the construction given to the instrument by the grantees, is shown by the fact that they assumed to act in the disposition of the property as the agents of Sutter, under the power of attorney contained in the instrument, and not in their own right. It is perfectly consistent with the words of the whole instrument, taken together, and is the only one which will give effect to all its clauses.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">The instrument in question was before the Court in the case of Mesick <em>v. </em>Sunderland, (6 Cal., 308,) and was held to be not a conveyance <em>in present\u00ed, </em>nor a conveyance in fee, with lien reserved, but \u201c an executory agreement for the sale of property therein described; or a conveyance on condition precedent, depending for its validity on the performance of an act <em>in pais\u201d </em>and that its registration imparted no notice of its contents.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">The case involved many interesting and novel points, which were argued, at great length, by able counsel. The attention of the Court was not directed\u2014either in the oral argument or briefs on file\u2014to the marked distinction which is recognized in the books between conveyances upon condition precedent and ex-ecutory contracts which are mere agreements to convey. It is, therefore, not surprising that the Court should have overlooked the distinction which had escaped notice of the learned and ingenious counsel who argued the case, however important such a distinction may have been, in view of the peculiar phraseology of the Registration Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">The Act concerning Conveyances, passed 1850, provides that every conveyance whereby any real estate is conveyed, or may be effected, which shall be acknowledged and recorded pursuant to the act, shall, from the date of filing with the recorder, impart <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>notice to all persons of its contents, and all subsequent purchasers and mortgagees shall be deemed to purchase with notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">The term conveyance, as defined by the thirty-sixth section of the act, embraces <em>\u201c </em>every instrument in writing, by which any real estate, or any interest in real estate is created, aliened, mortgaged, or assigned, except wills, leases for a term not exceeding one year, executory contracts for the sale or purchase of lands, and powers of attorney.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">A deed on condition precedent vests the title in the grantee, on the performance of the condition, without any further act on the part of the grantor, and being <em>\u201c </em>an instrument in writing affecting real estate,\u201d not within the exception mentioned in the thirty-sixth section of the Registration Act, its record imparts notice of its contents to all persons.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">Mesick must be deemed a purchaser with notice. The registration of the deed was sufficient to put him upon inquiry as to the performance of the condition, and he stands in the same relation to the plaintiff as his immediate grantor. As the validity of plaintiff\u2019s title depends upon conrpliance on his part with the conditions of the deed, and. the evidence of this fact rests in parol the deed from Sutter to Mesick, which in effect denies the compliance, it is a cloud upon his title which a Court of Equity, under proper circumstances, will remove. But in order to entitle himself to equitable relief, it is necessary to show a performance in good faith of every duty imposed upon him by the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-8\"><em>\u201c </em>Conditions precedent are such as must happen, or be performed, before the estate can vest or be enlarged; they admit of no latitude; they must be strictly, literally, and punctually performed. It is a known maxim, that where the estate is to arise upon a condition precedent, it can not vest till that condition is performed, and this has been so strongly adhered to, that even where the condition has become impossible, no estate or interest grew thereupon. Where a condition copulative precedes an estate, the whole must be performed before the estate can arise; or where an act is previous to any estate, and that act consists of several particulars, every particular must be performed before the estate can vest or take effect.\u201d (2 Dallas, 317.)</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">Payment of the purchase-money being a condition precedent to the vesting of title in the plaintiff, it follows that unless such payment was made, the legal title remained in Sutter, and passed to Mesick under the deed of July, 1855.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">On the question of payment, the evidence is by no means satisfactory. The receipts amount only to <em>prima facie </em>evidence, which may be rebutted by oral testimony. The fact that they were acknowledged before a notary, imparts to them no additional weight. A receipt is not regarded as a contract, and hardly as an instrument at all, and has but little more force than the oral admission of the party receiving. (2 Parsons, 68.) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>Whether the fact of acknowledging the receipt of the consideration, and neglecting for a long period of time to assert title to the property conveyed, would estop Sutter or his grantee from denying the performance of the condition upon which the legal title was to pass, as against innocent purchasers from Brannan and his associates, is a question which does not arise in this ease; he is certainly not concluded by these acts in a controversy with the original parties to the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">It is shown by the plaintiff\u2019s witness that the money was not, in fact, paid; that Sutter was induced to make a deduction of over forty thousand dollars, upon a representation that a portion of the property conveyed had been previously deeded away by Sutter, which representation, it appears, was not true. It also appears that an amount of money due Sutter on a former sale of lands, and secured by mortgage, was collected by Wetzlar under his power of attorney, and appropriated to the use of Brannan &amp; Co., under the claim that the conveyance of June, 1850, had operated as an assignment of the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">The testimony of Wetzlar, one of the original parties to the deed, taken in connection with his manifest prevarication on many points, and the fact that his memory was totally at fault as to transactions concerning the same property in which he was personally engaged subsequent to the execution of the deed, while it was perfect as to the occurrences at the time of. its execution, raise a strong presumption of fraud as to the settlement.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">We think the evidence of payment was not sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to relief in a Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">Judgment reversed, and bill dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
