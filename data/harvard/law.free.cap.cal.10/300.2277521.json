The draft prepared by the appellant, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>amendments proposed by the respondent, and allowed by the Judge who tried the cause, are not incorporated into one document, and in their separate form do not constitute such a statement as we will notice on appeal. This was expressly decided in the case cited, and in People <em>v. </em>Edwards, (9 Cal., 291.) The judgment-roll is, therefore, the only record properly before us, and this does not disclose any error in the action of the Court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
