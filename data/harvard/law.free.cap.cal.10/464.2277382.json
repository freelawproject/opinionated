After the close of the plaintiff's evidence, his counsel, then, for the first time, brought the mistake to the notice of the Court, by moving for judgment by default, which motion the Court sustained, and refused to allow defendant to then verify his answer: <em>Held, </em>that the Court erred, and should have allowed the defendant to have verified his answer.</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b474-11\">Appeal from the District Court of the Ninth Judicial District, County of Siskiyou.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b474-12\">The facts sufficiently appear in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Afx\"><em>Crosbey and Steel </em>for Appellant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b474-13\"><em>Winans </em>for Respondents.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b474-14\">Baldwin, J., delivered the opinion of the Court</author>\n<p id=\"AB-\">Terry, C.
