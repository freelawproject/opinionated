A. Swallum, referred to herein as the defendant, alleged to be a physician duly registered under the act of Congress known as the Harrison AntiNarcotie Law (26 USCA \u00a7 211, 691-707), is charged with having unlawfully sold morphine sulphate by prescription on four different occasions to Richie Feinberg; each occasion being covered by a separate count of the indictment. He was tried and convicted. He complains here of having been entrapped by government agents, and assigns as error the refusal of the trial court to sustain his motion at the close of the evidence for a directed verdict in his favor on that ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-21\">The evidence of Richie Feinherg, corroborated in many essential parts by H. T. Gillispie, a pharmacist at Ft. Dodge, Iowa, by W. I. Heiberg, a narcotic inspector for the government, and by R. J. Preuss, a federal narcotic agent, was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-22\">\u201cI have been working as an investigator for the government in the narcotic department about seven years. In December, 1926, and January, 1927, I was working in that capacity in and around Storm Lake and at Ft. Dodge, Iowa. I met the defendant the first time on the 22d day of December, 1926, when I went down to his offiee to secure some morphine. I told the doctor my name was Howard and that I would be around that part of the country during the holidays. I told the doctor I was working around there and wanted to see if I could get some morphine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-23\">\u201cThe doctor said he had no straight morphine, but that he had some tablets with other ingredients in. I told him I could not use them. There was a general conversation and I had the doctor write me a prescription. He asked me what amount I was using and I told him about 25 grains a day at that time, and that I wanted 50 grains. So the prescription was written and handed to me for 50 grains.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-24\">\u201cI know that the tablets that he offered me when I first talked to him\u2019 contained morphine. The prescription is offered in evidence. I paid the doctor $4 after I obtained the prescription, and I told him I would be back later. I turned the prescription over to Narcotic Agent Preuss, and went back to Ft. Dodge. The prescription was not filled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-25\">\u201cOn January 6, Mr. Preuss and myself went back to Storm Lake. I went to the doctor\u2019s office again. I told him I wanted another prescription but the druggist wanted it mailed, that he had no powder and he would rather have it mailed in. So the doctor wrote the prescription for 200 tableta <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>and wrote that letter and put it in an envelope and I mailed it myself to the druggist at Et. Dodge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-4\">\u201cAt that time the doctor said that \u2018we better not use the same name as Howard so I will give you another name. It won\u2019t look so bad on this prescription with the same name.\u2019 The doctor said \u2018we better not use the same name as Howard. We didn\u2019t want all these prescriptions with the same name\u2014 found in the same name.\u2019 So he stepped over to the telephone directory and took the name out of the directory and put it on the prescription., I believe the name was Loman, or Looman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-5\">\u201cExhibit B is the prescription that he gave me at that time. He also gave me a similar prescription for 5 grains, 25 tablets, and I believe it was dated an earlier date, dated the 5th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-6\">\u201cI mailed the prescription myself, and there was a note therein telling the druggist that this party would call for same. Exhibit C is the note. I also received at that time Exhibit D. When I got Exhibits C and D, I told the doctor I probably would not remember that name, so he made that little notation with the name on. After putting the prescription and note to the druggist in the envelope, I mailed, it at the post \u00f3ffiee at Storm Lake.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-7\">\u201cExhibit E is the other prescription that I have referred to. I turned Exhibit E over to Mr. Preuss at Storm Lake. Exhibit E was turned over to Mr. Preuss on January 6, when I returned to Storm Lake. The doctor said he didn\u2019t want to use the name R. Howard on the prescription and went to the telephone book and picked out another name. After mailing the prescription Mr. Heiberg gave me $10 to go up to the. drug store and . call for the package which was there. The druggist charged me $6 for it, and I delivered, it to Mr. Heiberg.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-8\">\u201cOn the 17th of January, I called on the defendant again in his office. At the time I called upon him on December 23,1 did not call upon him for treatment as a physician. He did not make any examination of me. I told him I was using morphine. I was a drug addict. I told him I was a drug addict.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-9\">\u201c.On January 6, he made no examination of me, nor was he treating me for any purpose, and I was not his patient at that time. I saw the doctor write these prescriptions and the note that I enclosed in the envelope, and saw him address the envelope which I put in the post office, and which I stamped.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">On cross-examination he said: \u201cI have been a dope addict for ten years, but I am not under the influence this morning. The last I used was last night at eight o\u2019clock.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-12\">\u201cQ. You went up to Dr. Swallum\u2019s hospital on January 6, 1927, to' have Dr. Swallum violate the law, didn\u2019t you? I didn\u2019t have him do anything only what he wanted to do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-13\">\u201cQ. What object or purpose did you have in going up there? A. Go up there and get some morphine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-14\">\u201cQ. And have the Doctor thereby violate the law, you thought, did you? A. Why, that was up to him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-15\">\u201cQ. You went to Dr; Swallum\u2019s hospital on January 6, 1927, knowing that you had . no right to obtain morphine from Dr. Swallum on that date? A. Yes sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-16\">\u201cQ. A legal right, didn\u2019t you? A. In the line of work I was -following, yes sir, working under the narcotic agents to secure morphine and evidence. That was the object and purpose I had in going to Dr. Swallum\u2019s hospital on January 6, 1927. I did not use or consume any morphine that I obtained under any prescription that Dr. Swallum gave me. I had no purpose or intention to use or consume any morphine that I might-obtain under any prescription that I might have obtained from Dr. Swallum.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b416-17\">The witness R. J. Preuss, in addition to the corroboration referred to, further testified: \u201cI met the defendant in June, 1926. I had a conversation with him and examined his records. I asked the Doctor what became of the morphine that he purchased on his order forms, and Dr. Swallum informed me that drug addicts had got the most of it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b416-18\">The defendant did not testify or offer any evidence. The government\u2019s evidence, therefore, stood undisputed and undenied.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-19\">The rules of law regarding entrapment are clearly and concisely set out by Judge Walter H. Sanborn in the leading case of Butts v. United States (C. C. A.) 273 <em>F. </em>35, 37, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-20\">\u201cIt is not denied that, in eases where the criminal intent originates in the mind of the defendant, the fact that the officers of tjie government used decoys or trutkful statements to furnish opportunity for or to aid the accused in the commission of a crime, in order successfully to prosecute him therefor, constitutes no .defense to such a prosecution. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b416-21\">\u201cBut when the accused has never committed such an offense as that charged against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>him prior to the time when he is charged with the offense prosecuted, * * * or any such offense, and had not the means to do so, the fact that the officers of the government incited and by persuasion and representation lured him to commit the offense charged, in order to entrap, arrest, and prosecute him therefor, is and ought to be fatal to the prosecution, and to entitle the accused to a verdict of not guilty.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">Instead of there being any evidence to directly, or by inference, sustain the elements of entrapment as set forth in the latter rule, it discloses to the contrary that the doctor had been selling to addicts; that, when opportunity offered, he was ready, willing, and able to commit the offense charged, and that he was not incited or persuaded to commit the offense, but aided and abetted the agent in surreptitiously obtaining the drug.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">Defendant relies upon a statement set out in the case of Spring Drug Co. v. United States (C. C. A.) 12 F.(2d) 852, 856, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">\u201cIt is well settled by the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States, we think now universally followed in the several circuits, that, where the government, through its agents, has reasonable cause to believe that the law is being violated by the defendant, they may legally entrap the defendant by decoy letters or by pretended purchases. Price v. United States, 165 U. S. 311, 17 S. Ct. 366, 41 L. Ed. 727; Grimm v. United States, 156 U. S. 604, 15 S. Ct. 470, 39 L. Ed. 550; Goode v. United States, 159 U. S. 663, 16 S. Ct. 136, 40 L. Ed. 297; Andrews v. United States, 162 U. S. 420, 16 S. Ct. 798, 40 L. Ed. 1023; Fiunkin v. United States (C. C. A.) 265 F. 1.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">It is the claim of the defendant that the agent who procured the prescriptions for morphine from him did not have reasonable cause to believe that the law was being violated by him, and that he (the defendant) had not violated the law pri- or to that time. Prom this is advanced the argument that under this situation a finding of entrapment is conclusively shown by the evidence, and that the defendant was entitled to a directed verdict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">We do not find any authority holding that lack of probable cause to believe defendant was unlawfully selling morphine, or lack of suspicion in the mind of an agent who makes a pretended purchase, alone, constitutes entrapment. See United States v. Siegel (D. C.) 16 F.(2d) 134, where the above authorities are digested.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-12\">That an agent manufactures an offense against the law and then incites a person against his will to commit that offense for the purpose of prosecution is the gist of a defense of entrapment.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-13\">When any evidence of this situation appears,\" the question whether such a person was approached as an innocent man, or one suspicioned of violating the law, becomes important. United States v. Siegel, supra. There is no evidence here, however, that the agent either manufactured the crime or induced its commission. The lack of evidence then that the agent did not have a belief or suspicion of a prior violation of the law becomes immaterial.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-14\">The testimony of the witness Preuss, however, supplies satisfactory evidence that the government agents had reasonable cause to believe that the doctor was, prior to December, 1926, violating the law in selling morphine to drug addicts. His evidence also, as well as the evidence of Richie Eeinberg, being undisputed and undenied, strongly indicates that defendant was an old offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-15\">The situation as disclosed by the evidence does not show entrapment, or evidence that would warrant the court in submitting the question to the jury had it been requested. The case is not unlike Fiunkin v. United States (C. C. <em>A.) </em>265 F. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-16\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
