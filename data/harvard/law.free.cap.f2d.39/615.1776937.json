Willard, 220 U. S. 413, 31 S. Ct. 460, 55 L. Ed. 521.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-26\">The only question presented by this record is whether the petition alleges a principal debt of more than $3,000. The allegations are that on December 1, 1926, the defendant was indebted to the plaintiffs in the principal sum of $5,000, for goods sold and delivered. The petition alleges various payments thereon, at various times, totaling $2,099.72. The appellant contends these payments should have been applied to the principal, although it concedes that, in the absence of direction by the debtor, the creditor may make application. Nat. Bank, etc., v. Mechanics\u2019 Nat. Bank, 94 U. S. 437, 24 L. Ed. 176; Alexandria v. Patten, 4 Cranch, 317, 2 L. Ed. 633; Field v. Holland, 6 Cranch, 8, 3 L. Ed. 136; 21 R. C. L. 95; 30 Cyc. 1235. It further contends that in the absence of an agreement to pay interest, interest is recoverable only as damages. The OHahoma statute provides that for breach of an obligation to pay money only, there shall be recovered \u201cthe amount due by the terms of the obligation, with interest thereon.\u201d Section 5977, C. O. S. 1921. Moreover, the petition alleges that, \u201cin accordance with said contract, sale and delivery the defendants paid to the plaintiffs the sum of $500, leaving a balance of $4,800.\u201d This is a direct allegation that the plaintiffs, in accordance with the contract, applied $300 to interest and $200 to principal. After alleging other payments, and similar applications to interest accrued, with the balance on principal, the petition alleges a balance due on November 29, 1927, of $3,314.92, for which sum, with interest, recovery is sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-27\">It clearly appears that plaintiffs claimed the defendant was indebted to them, on the date of the filing of the suit, in a principal amount in excess of $3,000. The judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
