We think it unnecessary to enter into any discussion of either the facts or the'law relative to this ease, since the statute vests the Secretary with power to determine the heirs, and provides that \u201chis decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.\u201d The nature of the exercise of such power by an officer of the government was defined in the early case of Bartlett v. Kane, 16 How. 263, 272, 14 L. Ed. 931, as follows: \u201cIt is a general principle, that when power or jurisdiction is delegated to any public officer or tribunal over a subject-matter, and its exercise is confided to his or their discretion, the acts so done are binding and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>valid as to the subject-matter. The only question which can arise between an individual claiming a right under the-acts done, and the public, or any person denying their validity, are power in the officer and fraud in the party; all other questions are settled by the decision made, or the act done by the tribunal or officer, whether executive, legislative, judicial, or special, unless an appeal is provided for, or other revision by some appellate or supervisory tribunal is prescribed by law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b318-4\">No averment of fraud is made in the present case, nor is the jurisdiction of the Secretary questioned. Neither is there any provision for appeal from the decision of the Secretary giving the' court revisory power. In these circumstances it is too elementary to require citation of authority that this revisory power cannot be invoked through extraordinary process. Whether appellants may ultimately have a remedy enforceable in the jurisdiction where the lands are located, it is unnecessary for us to determine.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">The decree, dismissing the bill, is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
