Appellant in this court complains of the fact that the Commissioner has gratuitously passed upon a question not presented in so far as it has not asked for registration under the ten-year clause. An examination of the record discloses that the applicant made no proper application for registration under the ten-year clause of the Trade-Mark Aet of February 20, 1905, and it nowhere appears that he sought consideration of the question as to whether or not he was entitled to register under said clause. The statement of the Commissioner to the effect that certain considerations \u201cwould indicate the applicant is not entitled to the benefit of the ten year clause of the Trade Mark Act of February 20, 1905,\u201d regardless of its correctness or incorrectness as a conclusion of law, can have no legal effect upon applicant\u2019s rights or upon the issues of this case. This action on the part of the Commissioner has been assigned as error in this court. While the Commissioner erroneously referred to this matter, it is not such an error as affects the issue before us and does not justify a reversal of his decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-25\">The Commissioner and the examiner both mention the fact that the word sought to be registered constitutes a substantial or principal portion of the names of various companies or corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-26\"> Applicant contends that for this line of goods the word \u201cAutographic\" was first originated and used by Major James C. Shoup, the originator of the autographic register business in 1883. The Autographic Register Company, appellant herein, is the manufacturer of the autographic registering machine for which Shoup was granted patent No. 286,560 on'October 9,1883.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-27\">This ease was considered several times by the Patent Office tribunals, resulting in unanimity'of opinion that the word \u201cAuto-graphic\u201d is descriptive of the goods sold. The word \u201cAutographic\u201d is defined as self-writing . or self-recording (Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary; Ex parte Eastman Kodak Co., 124 M. D. 18, reported in 7 T. M. Rep. 599), and we think aptly describes the character of the goods upon which, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>seeks to use the proposed trade-mark, and therefore is not registerable. A long line of decisions by the courts and the Patent. Office ape to the same effect, some of which follow:</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\u201cAsbestos,\u201d for asbestos engine and machinery packing, H. W. Johns-Manville Co. v. American Steam Packing Co., 33 App. D. C. 224, 145 O. G. 257, 1909 C. D. 425.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">\u201cRuberoid,\u201d for flexible roofing material, Standard Paint Co. v. Trinidad Asphalt Mfg. Co., 220 U. S. 446, 31 S. Ct. 456, 55 L. Ed. 536, 165 O. G. 971, 1911 C. D. 530.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">\u201cElectro,\u201d for steel, Electro Steel Co., Successor of Hammacher Delius &amp; Co. v. Lindenberg Steel Co., 43 App. D. C. 270, 215 O. G. 977, 1915 C. D. 144.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">\u201cInfallible,\u201d for smokeless powder, Hercules Powder Co. v. Newton, Commissioner of Patents (C. C. A.) 266 F. 169, 274 O. G. 204, 1920 C. D. 340.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\u201cEasyset,\u201d for metal window sash, In re Kawneer Mfg. Co., 48 App. D. C. 587, 262 O. G. 167, 1919 C. D. 200.</p>\n<p id=\"ANZ\">\u201cSelf-Loading,\u201d for cartridges, Winchester Repeating Arms Co. v. Peters Cartridge Co., 30 App. D. C. 505, 134 O. G. 2030, 1908 C. D. 401.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">\u201cMagazine,\u201d for pencils, ex parte Eberhard Faber, 115 M. D. 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">\u201cModulation,\u201d for steam heating and ventilating apparatus, Ex parte Warren Webster &amp; Co., 174 O. G. 287, 1912 C. D. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-13\">\u201cB-Liminator,\u201d for battery 'eliminators, Andrews Radio Co. v. Timmons Radio Products Corp., 345 O. G. 798, 1926 C. D. 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-14\">As further indication that the wor4 \u201cAutographic\u201d is descriptive of the machine under consideration here, the examiner has pointed out that it was used by at least a dozen inventors to describe similar articles which have been patented.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-15\">The solicitor for the Patent Office, in urging the nonregistrability of the word, also invokes the rule laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Singer Mfg. Co. v. June Mfg. Co., 163 U. S. 169, 16 S. Ct. 1002, 41 L. Ed. 118, 1896 C. D. 687. In the Singer Case, supra, it was held that since the word \u201cSinger\u201d was adopted by Singer &amp; Co. as designative of the distinctive style of machine rather than as solely indicating the origin of manufacture; that upon the expiration of the patent on the Singer sewing machine, use of the generic name \u201cSinger\u201d passed to the public with the dedication resulting from the expiration of the patent. The solicitor here contends that since patent No. 286,560 to James C. Shoup for an \u201cauto-graphic registering apparatus\u201d uses the term as designating the distinctive style of the machine, and since that patent has expired, the publie is entitled to the use .of. the word \u201cAutographic,\u201d and that to grant registration to appellant would be to give it an exclusive property in the word and thus extend its patent monopoly. This is a well-settled principle in patent and trade-mark law, and we agree with this contention on the part of the solicitor.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-17\">Appellant has urged with great earnestness, in a very well-prepared brief, that it should be granted registration under the' authority of Ex parte Eastman Kodak Co., supra, wherein registration was granted to the Eastman Kodak Company, for the word \u201cAutographic\u201d as applied to cameras, camera backs, and films. It is pointed out that in this decision by the Commissioner it was said: \u201cOf course, the question is not what the term \u2018Autographic\u2019 means at this time, but whether it had any meaning in March, 1914, when the applicant began to use its marks.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b743-18\">Without expressing any approval or disapproval of the Eastman Kodak Co. Case, supra, it -is sufficient to note that the word \u201cAutographic\u201d there was written in a particular or distinctive manner. Furthermore, the examiner in the ease at bar points out, and it is not disputed anywhere in this record, that the word \u201cAutographic\u201d was a word in common use in the English language, used for describing devices similar to the auto-graphic registering apparatus under consideration here, prior to the us\u00e9 of the same by applicant, and cites the Encyclopaedic Dictionary, published by Cassell, Petter, Galpin &amp; Co., London, Paris, and New York, 1879, in which the word \u201cautographic\u201d is applied to \u201cautographic ink,\u201d \u201cautographic paper,\u201d \u201cautographic press,\u201d and \u201cautographic telegraph\u201d ; also the Imperial Dictionary of the English Language, published by Blackie &amp; Son, London, 1882, and the Century Company, New York, wherein is found the word \u201cautographic\u201d defined as: \u201c3. Self-recording; as, an autographic telegraph.\u201d Evidently the Eastman Kodak Case, supra, was decided upon a record quite \u2019 different from the one at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-19\">For the foregoing reasons we think the decision of the Commissioner of Patents was correct, and it is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
