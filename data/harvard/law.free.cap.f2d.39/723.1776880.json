It reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-25\">\u201cA dental preparation, comprising an alkaline reacting substance and an indicator, said preparation being adapted to form a clear solution for use as a mouth wash, whereby acidity of the mouth may be determined by the change in colors of the indicator and the amount of mucin on the teeth may be determined by the precipitate formed in the solution after rinsing the mouth.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b747-26\">The reference is: Westenfelter, 1,112,180, September 29,1914.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-27\">In the decision of the Board of Appeals, attention is directed to the fact that the patent to Westenfelter\u2019 discloses a solution adapted to be used in the same manner and for substantially the same purposes as that of appellant. It is an alkaline solution containing the same indicator \u2014 phenolphthalein\u2014as is used in appellant\u2019s preparation. ])n addition, however, it contains precipitated chalk for cleaning and polishing the teeth. Appellant\u2019s claim is predicated on the absence of chalk from his preparation. It is also contended by counsel for appellant that the reference discloses a \u201cdentifrice,\u201d not a mouth wash.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-28\">The word \u201cdentifrice\u201d is understood to mean \u201cAny preparation used for cleansing the teeth.\u201d Funk <em>&amp; </em>Wagnalls\u2019 New Standard Dictionary.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-29\">Appellant claims that his preparation cleans the teeth; therefore, according to the quoted definition, it is a dentifrice.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-30\">It is further contended that Westenfelter did not contemplate or suggest the omission of the chalk from his'dentifrice, and that, as appellant has omitted chalk from his preparation, he has obtained a clear solution. The importance of obtaining a clear solution, according to appellant\u2019s contention, is that \u201cthe 'amount of mucin on the teeth may be determined by the precipitate formed in the solution after rinsing the mouth\u201d; and that, therefore, as a new result is obtained, the omission of the chalk amounts to more than the.omission of its function.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-31\">In its decision the Board of Appeals, in part, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-32\">\u201c * <em>* </em>* Appellant urges that sinceWestenfelter uses precipitated chalk he does not have a clear solution and therefore he cannot determine the amount of mucin on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"724\">*724</page-number>teeth <em>by </em>observing the precipitate formed in the solution after rinsing the mouth. Westenfelter\u2019s chalk serves its own independent purpose and it is not seen that its omission from the Westenfelter preparation amounts to invention. With the omission of the chalk his preparation clearly responds to the claim on appeal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">It would seem to be obvious that the omission of the chalk from Westenfelter\u2019s prepay ration would leave a clear solution with such advantages as might result.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">We are in entire harmony with the conclusion reached by the tribunals of the Patent Office, and the decision of the Board of Appeals is accordingly affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
