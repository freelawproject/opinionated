In other respects, so far as we can see, the glove is of conventional design.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-20\">The references are: Lemercier, Fr., 567,-345, Dec. 5, 1923; Gaisman, Design, 29,037, July 12, 1898; Rice, Design, 61,380, Sept. 12, 1922; Item 18-H-6955, page 147, Sears Roebuck &amp; Co., 1917; Item 35-B-3100, page 321, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 1915; Item 35-E-7289, page 321, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., 1919.</p>\n<p id=\"AXa\">It clearly appears from the references, and it is not denied by counsel for appellant, that an adjustable fastener around the wrist of a glove is old in the art.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-22\">It is contended by appellant, however, that the particular adjustable fastener disclosed in the application, together with the other features of appellant\u2019s glove, produce a novel and distinctive design not suggested in the prior art. It is contended that \u201ceven .though the applicant had substituted a different form of strap in gloves otherwise tantamount, the patent should issue <em>inasmuch as the finished design is attractive and has the approval of eommer&amp;ial acceptance.\u201d </em>(Italics ours.)</p>\n<p id=\"b308-23\">In its decision, the Board of Appeals, among other things, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-24\">\u201cGloves having bands or straps surrounding the wrist or body portion thereof are not new. The Rice design patent shows such a glove, also Item E-7289; page 321 of Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. Catalogue for 1919. The claimed design generally being old as disclosed by the cited references, the examiner has taken the position that it is a mere .matter of selection not involving invention to apply to or substitute for the strap or band of the reference gloves a band or strap like that shown by the French patent to Lemereier, No. 567,345, Dec.' 5,1923. * * \u2022*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b308-25\">\u201cWe agree with the examiner that it would not involve invention to substitute for the strap or band of the glove in the basic references a strap or band of such as is disclosed in the French patent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b308-26\">The French patent to Lemereier discloses an adjustable fastener, consisting of a band or strap and two metal rings, for use on articles of clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-27\">It would seem to be obvious that appellant has added the adjustable fastener disclosed by Lemereier to a glove of conventional design.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-28\">It is argued that 'the design thus' produced is patentable. Although it is true that a patentable design may be created by a combination of old elements, it does not necessarily follow that every such combination involves invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-29\">Obviously, if adding the adjustable fastener of Lemereier to a glove of conventional design, in view of the prior art, produces a patentable design, then any change or alteration in a glove design by a skilled workman would involve invention.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-30\">We are of opinion that the tribunals of the Patent Office were right in denying appellant\u2019s application.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-31\">The decision of the Board of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-32\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
