It was alleged in the motion, among other things, that under the contract set out in the notice of opposition appellee was estopped from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>opposing the registration by appellant of its alleged trade-mark; that it did not appear from the notice of opposition that opposer would be damaged by the registration of applicant\u2019s trade-mark; and that, by virtue of the contract referred to in the notice of opposition, the registration of the mark \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d would not interfere with the rights of the opposer.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">The Examiner of Interferences sustained the motion to dismiss the opposition, on the theory that the opposer was estopped by the terms of its contract to deny that the applicant was entitled to the \u201cexclusive use on shoes of the notation \u2018American Lady,\u2019 \u201d and therefore held that the applicant was entitled to have the mark registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">On appeal to the Commissioner of Patents, the decision of the Examiner of Interferences was reversed. In his decision, the Commissioner called attention to the fact that the involved parties had extensive litigation prior to the date of the contract alleged in the opposition; that, in the case of Hamilton-Brown Shoe Company v. Wolf Brothers &amp; Co., 240 U. S. 251, 36 S. Ct. 269, 60 L. Ed. 629, the Supreme Court held that the involved trade-marks, applied as they were to shoes, were confusingly and deceptively similar; and that, as opposer was the owner of the trade-mark \u201cThe American Girl,\u201d applicant had no right to use the words \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d as a trade-mark on its products. The Commissioner further pointed out in his decision that the involved contract granted to applicant the right to the use of the words \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d as a trade-mark for shoes for women, provided those words were \u201caccompanied on the shoes themselves, with the n|ame \u2018Hamilton, Brown Shoe Company,\u2019 and the word \u2018Makers/ \u201d so that the public might not be confused as to the origin of the shoes of, the respective parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">In concluding his decision, the assistant commissioner said: \u201c* * * It being apparent the two marks are deceptively similar, the application for registration of the mark \u2018American Lady\u2019 should be denied. In re S. C. Herbst Importing Company, 134 O. G. 1565, 30 App. D. C. 297; In re Herbst, 141 O. G. 286, 32 App. D. C. 365.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">Counsel for appellant contends that, as appellee entered into the contract set out in the notice of opposition, it is estopped to deny appellant\u2019s right to registration; that, as appellant transacts business in foreign countries, it is necessary that it register its trade-mark under the Trade-Mark Act of 1905 (15 USCA \u00a7\u00a7 81-109), before it will be permitted to register the mark in foreign countries; and that, as the law prohibits the registration of the words \u201cHamilton, Brown Shoe Company\u201d and the word \u201cMakers\u201d required by the terms of the contract to accompany the words \u201cAmerican Lady,\u201d it is entitled to register its trade-mark without any accompanying or qualifying language.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">The following eases were cited by counsel for appellant whieh, it is argued, support his contention: Waukesha Hygeia Mineral Springs Co. v. Hygeia Sparkling Distilled Water Co. (C. C. A.) 63 P. 438; President Suspender Co. v. Macwilliam (C. C. A.) 238 F. 159; Mac William v. President Suspender Co., 242 O. G. 255, 46 App. D. C. 45; Arkell Safety Bag Co. v. Safepack Mills, 53 App. D. C. 218, 289 F. 616.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">Most of the cases cited by counsel are not in point. Some of them hold, as was said in the headnotes in MaeWilliam v. President Suspender Company, supra:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-12\">\u201cThe transfer of a business with its good will, either by sale or license, carries with it a trade-mark used in connection therewith, whether expressly mentioned in the instrument of transfer or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201cWhere the owner of a trademark grants the right to another, either by sale or license, to use the mark on the goods with whieh its use is connected and abandons its use himself, he cannot afterwards either deprive his assignee of the right to its use or set up an. adverse use. By use in connection with the business the assignee acquires the title abandoned by the assignor, and the title is of tiiat exclusive character whieh is entitled to protection even against the assignor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">In the case of Waukesha Hygeia Mineral Springs Co. v. Hygeia Sparkling Distilled Water Co. (C. C. A.) 63 F. 438, relied upon by counsel for appellants, the court held that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-15\">\u201cWhere two parties have been using similar trade-marks, a contract between them whereby one party is to use one form of the trade-mark in connection with certain words, and the other is to use another form of it in connection with other words, followed by the use of such trade-marks for several years in accordance with the terms of the contract, establishes the rights of the parties, and is binding upon their assigns and successors in business.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-16\">\u201cSuch contract is not recordable in the patent office, since it is not a transfer of a right to use a trade-mark.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number> The decision in that ease is directly opposed to 'the contentions of counsel for appellant, and, when applied to the contract between the parties to this appeal, holds squarely that appellant is not entitled to the use of the words \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d as a trademark for its products, unless accompanied by appellant\u2019s name and the word \u201cMakers.\u201d This is our view of the rights of the parties. Obviously, if appellant has no right to the use of the words \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d as a trademark, unless accompanied by unregisterable language, it is not entitled to registration. Furthermore, the goods of the parties possess the same descriptive properties, and, as the mark \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d is confusingly and deceptively similar to appellee\u2019s mark, \u201cThe American Girl,\u201d appellant is not entitled to have the words \u201cAmerican Lady\u201d registered as its trade-mark.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">We are in entire accord with the views expressed by the Commissioner of Patents, and his decision is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
