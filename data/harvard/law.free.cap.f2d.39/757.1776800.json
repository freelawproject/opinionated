United States, supra, and, for the reasons stated in that ease, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. The petition must therefore be dismissed, and it is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-14\">BOOTH, Chief Justice, and WILLIAMS,, and GREEN, Judges, concur.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-15\">GRAHAM, Judge, concurs in view of the previous decisions of the court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
