That <em>John H. McElfresh, </em>named in said will, took upon himself the burden of executing all the trusts imposed upon and confided to him by said will; both as the sole executor of said will, as also the trustee for the several parties, devisees, and legatees, named in said will. That in and by said will and testament, the said testator did, among other things, devise and bequeath to the said John, &amp;c., (for a statement of which devises and bequests, see the will <em>post.) </em>That the said <em>J. H. McE., </em>after the death of said testator, gave to your oratrix, <em>Christina Barr, </em>wife of <em>David Barr, </em>full and immediate possession of said farm, so devised to her as aforesaid, in compliance with the direction of said testator; and she has, ever since, received and enjoyed the rents and profits thereof. He also received and paid over to her, the dividends received by him on said bank stock; also, the rents on the dwelling house of said testator, and the several lots of ground in <em>Frederick </em>town; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>as devised as aforesaid, for the use of your oratrix. But the said McElfresh; in his life time, did not pay over to your oratrix any part of the interest due her on the said sum of $32,000 ; contending, that he was not bound to pay the same until two years after the death of said testator; that he was entitled to hold the said sum, free of interest, for one year after the death of said testator; so that your oratrix would be entitled to receive interest on said sum, from the 29th day of October 1840, and not before; to which your oratrix objected, and the said <em>McElfresh, </em>therefore, withheld from her the said interest on said $32,000; that the said <em>J. H. McE. </em>died some time in the month of July 1841, intestate, and that letters of administration on his goods and chattels, rights and credits, have been granted by the Orphans court of <em>Frederick </em>county, to his widow, <em>Theresa McElfresh </em>and <em>William M. Beall, </em>who are acting as such administrators ; your orator and oratrix further charge, that the said <em>J. H. McE., </em>in his life time, received and held in his hands, for the use of your oratrix, the interest on said $32,000 ; and that he also received from the assets of said testator the said principal sum of $32,000, and had the same so invested or loaned, as to produce and yield annually, the legal interest of the same; which ought to have been, but which was not, paid over to your oratrix, during the life time of the said ./. JET. <em>McE.; </em>that some time after the death of said <em>J. H. McE., </em>your oratrix applied to his said administrators to pay her over the dividends on said bank stock, that had accrued in part, and had not been paid over to her in the life time of said intestate, and which had in part accrued since his death ; as also to pay over to her certain rents that had become due on the real property lying in <em>Frederick </em>town ; and also the interest, due to her under the will of her said brother, on the said sum of $32,000 ; but they refused payment of any part to her; saying, that any payment to be made by them, must be made to whoever might be appointed the trustee for your oratrix, in the place and stead of the said <em>J. H. McE., </em>deceased. That your oratrix being much in want of the money, which her brother\u2019s bounty had so kindly provided for her, immediately filed her pe= <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>tition, together with her husband, in this honorable court; and obtained an order appointing <em>George Schley </em>her trustee, to act in the place and stead of the said <em>J. H. McE., </em>in regard to said (rusts; that said <em>George Schley </em>has accepted said trust; that the said <em>G. S. </em>as trustee, as aforesaid, in the place and stead of <em>J. H. McE., </em>and by virtue of said order, called on said administrators of said <em>McElfresh, </em>to pay into his hands, for the use of your oratrix, according to the provisions and directions of said last will of said <em>Caspar Mantz, </em>the $32,000, in cash, with all the interest due thereon ; as also the rents of the real estate, and the dividends on the said bank stock, that had been received by the said /. <em>H. McE. </em>in his life time; but had not been paid over to your oratrix, the said <em>Christina, </em>by him. That the said administrators did pay over to said <em>George Schley, </em>as trustee for your oratrix, the rents and dividends on the bank stock received by said <em>J. H. McE., </em>as also the sum of $28,000, in part of the said principal sum of $32,000; and the sum of $2426.66, as interest on said $32,000, from the 29lh day of October 1840, being one year after the death of said testator, up to the 3rd day of February 1842 : that being the day on which the payment was made to your orator, the said <em>George Schley. </em>But the said administrators refused to pay the remaining $4000, of the said principal sum, to the said <em>G. S.$ </em>and now hold the same in their hands, and refuse to pay it over for the benefit of your oratrix, until, as they say, your oratrix and her said husband will unite in a deed of conveyance; by which, they will convey and release to the said <em>T. McE., </em>as the residuary devisee in said will, all their estate, right, title, and interest both at law, and in equity, in and to a certain farm or tract of land, known as the <em>\u201cKenega farm </em>and which said land was purchased, by and conveyed to, the said <em>Caspar Mantz, </em>some considerable time after he had made and executed his said last will and testament. This conveyance your oratrix is unwilling to make, believing, as she is indeed advised, that the said testator died intestate, as to the said land so purchased by him, after he had made his said will, and that the same will descend to his heirs at law, of whom your oratrix is one; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>that your oratrix is under no obligation, legal or equitable, to forego her rights as one of the heirs at law, of her said brother, to said farm, to enable her to receive and enjoy the whole bounty intended for her, and given to her by his said last will and testament.

The doctrine of election is founded on clear, and unquestioned law. To devises on express condition, it will of course apply. So of implied conditions : benefits to A and B; the grant to B, being of A\u2019s property ; an implied condition not to take both. So where one has power over two estates, grants one to A, and makes an ineffectual attempt as to B. There A must elect upon principles of equity. It would be against conscience not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>to carry out devise to both. Such is the case of <em>Tkelusson vs. Woodford. </em>But this case is clear of all previously decided causes. <em>Mrs. Barr </em>has nothing but the rents and profits; no part of the <em>corpus </em>of her estate ; after her death the estate goes to her children.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-5\"><em>P.

If he claim the other estate, he could not claim under the will. Here the trustee of the fund claims : it is not <em>Mrs. </em>Barr; she does not take under the will. We do not set up legal rights in opposition to equity : <em>Mrs. B. </em>has no power to burthen the estate, sell, or dispose of it; the trust fund cannot be a question in any way ; the right of election must arrest the determination of her estate ; the thing devised, must be capable of alienation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b202-6\">Revebjdy Johnson in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b202-7\"><em>Mrs. Barr </em>must be entitled to one third of the estate, at common law. There is one question, peculiar to the case itself, <em>i. e., </em>what is the true interpretation of the will, which shuts out the heir at law? Looking to the whole character of this devise, at the time the will was executed, it is clear, the testator did <em>not </em>design to die intestate, of either his real or personal estate. If intestate, as to the farm in controversy, it must be attributable to ignorance, in fact, of the effect of the devise. As far as relates to <em>Mrs. Barr </em>and <em>Mrs. </em>Harding, the testator did not intend to vest in them, absolutely, any interest in his estate, so as to subject it to their husbands power. We are not left to speculate about this. The testator knew how to devise absolute, and qualified estates, so as to keep them clear of their husbands. The whole will designed <em>testacy, </em>and, to avoid <em>intestacy. </em>That is manifest in fact; or, why did he put the words in the last clause ? <em>All he then had, </em>must pass. These words were put to enlarge antecedent phrases ; to include, what they might not embrace. They are not surplussage; they have an independent meaning: and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>they meant, that all the estate he possessed, at the time of his death, should go to the residuary legatee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-5\">As to personal and mixed estate, the will operates upon all; and the words used, put the real estate on same footing ; show the <em>same </em>state of mind as to <em>both. </em>The meaning is, all I have aow, or may have, at my death. He meant, that <em>Mrs. McElfresh </em>should take under the will, and not as heir. All who take under the will, must admit this. As respects the devisees, the intent was, that <em>all of them </em>should take under the will. <em>Dillon vs. Parker, </em>1 <em>Swanst. </em>397, note, 2 <em>Story Eq. </em>339.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-6\">The doctrine of election, is more ancient than the case in <em>Vernon. </em>It may be traced back to <em>Elizabeth. </em>It arises, most frequently, under wills ; yet is applicable to deeds. Its justice is recognized everywhere. A devisee is estopped to deny the testator\u2019s power to devise. He, who claims any part, must admit the residue. The right, under grants, rests on the same footing. It is litre lessor and lessee; the latter cannot deny title to make the lease.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-7\">As to the two devises, to <em>Mrs. Barr </em>and <em>Mrs. Harding, </em>being in trust for life, remainder to she children ? <em>Mrs. Barr </em>has made her acceptance of the life interest, and she now disputes as to the <em>Kenega farm. </em>The children have nothing to do with this controversy. The limited character of the interest cannot change the principio. As she takes the trust estate, she is estopped from relying on her rights as heir at law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b203-8\">A will, not executed in conformity with the statute of frauds, is still good as to personalty.

The inapplicability of the doctrine of equitable election, to this case, has been urged upon several grounds :</p>\n<p id=\"b206-11\">1st. On the intention of the testator, as deduced from the residuary clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-12\">2nd. Its inapplicability to an heir at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>3rd. Its supposed inapplicability to a clause in a will, which, although it may manifest the intention of the testator, is in itself inoperative to pass any estate by the rules of law. And,</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">4th. On the ground that the case before us, if the intention were even clear, and if applicable to an heir at law, is not of such a character as comes within the most approved definition of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">1. No person will be compelled to make an election, unless the intention of the testator be sufficiently made out. There never can be a case of implied election, but upon a presumed intention of the testator. 3 <em>Bro. Ch. </em>191, 1 <em>Ves. jr. </em>257, 557. The degree of intention necessary to raising a case of election, must plainly appear upon the face of the will. On the other hand, it is said, the court is not to refuse attention, to what amounts to a moral certainty of the testator\u2019s intention; where that is to be gathered, either from the state of the property, or the purview of the will. 4 <em>Bro. Ch. </em>24.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">What was then the intention of the testator in the residuary clause ? It is supposed that the residuary clause maybe construed, so as only to shew an intent to pass, that which should constitute a residue of his then existing property, at the time of his death; and not properly, which, after the execution of his will, he might acquire. Such a construction would make the testator guilty of the folly of supposing, that without such clause, either the residue at his death would not pass, by the term, \u201cof which I am now possessed,\u201d or, that any portion of his property, constituting a part of the residuary, if disposed of by him in his life time, would pass under the will: a supposition we should not be justified in making, when the words, themselves, have so plain an import. His design is declared in express terms, to make her his residuary devisee ; and of what, he explicitly announces, by devising the remainder of the property, of which he was then possessed, or of which he might be possessed at the time of his death; the term <em>\u201cwhich,\u201d </em>referring in the mind of the testator to the word <em>\u201cproperty\u201d </em>and not to the word \u201cremainder.\u201d It then stands as a devise of all the estate of which he died possessed, or of which he might be possessed at the time of his death,</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>We agree with the Vice Chancellor, in 4 <em>Sim., </em>520, that such words show in a most marked manner, that he intended to pass, not only the estates he had at the date of the will, but all that he should be in possession of, at the time of his decease. It cannot be denied, that the words would pass all the personal estate, that the testator was possessed of at his death; and if it is clear as to future personal estate, bow can it be said he had not the same intention as to real estate, when they are both disposed of in the same sentence ? Can any one say, that he had one intention as to personal estate, and a different intention as to the real estate, when he uses \u201cthe same words as to both.\u201d And he overrules a contrary construction put upon words of the like import,, in <em>Back </em>if <em>Kett, Jacobs Rep., </em>540.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">2. That this doctrine is applicable to an heir at law, is clear from the authorities. 2 <em>Vern. </em>586. 2 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>696. 2 <em>Scho. </em>&amp; <em>Lef. </em>449. 2 <em>Story Eq. note, </em>338. 2 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>544, 559. 2 <em>Ves. &amp; Bea. </em>187, are all cases where the heir at law was put to his. election; and in 10 <em>Ves, </em>593., the point was admitted, that the doctrine reached the heir. The same doctrine was applied in 2 <em>Eq. Ca. 2, </em>referred to in 2 <em>Rop. Leg. </em>405; and in the case of 2 <em>Ves. </em>&amp; <em>Bea. </em>187, it was applied in a case, in which the devise to the heir was inoperative.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">In the case of an <em>express condition, </em>there never could have been a doubt, because the testator may annex what condition he pleases to his estate. Why should not election occur in the case of an implied condition, if the intention be plain and clear, as against the heir ? It is said, that the devise to the heir is read as if it were to him absolutely, if he confirm the will; if not, then in trust for the disappointed devisees as to so much of the estate given to him, as shall be equal in value to the estates intended for them. It is only carrying out a plain intent of the testator, and giving to the residuary devisee, that which the testator intended, and forbidding the heir from taking property not designed for him. From the earliest case on the subject, the rule is, that a man shall not take a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>benefit under a will, and at the same time defeat the provisions of the instrument. If he claims an interest under an instrument, he must give full effect to it, as far as he is able \u00edo do so. lie cannot take what is devised to him, and, at the same time, what is devised to another; although, but for the will, it would be his : hence he is driven to his election to say, which he will take.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">3. But we have seen that the will is inoperative to pass the lands acquired after its execution. Will this fact prevent the application of the doctrine of election ? The <em>English </em>cases since the revolution, are, we think, decisive of this subject. 13 <em>Ves. </em>219. 4 <em>Simons, </em>520. 4 <em>Con. Ch. Rep. </em>412. The first of these cases was affirmed in the <em>House of Lords, </em>and is considered, notwithstanding the opinion of <em>Sir T. Plumer, in Back </em>&amp; <em>Kett, Jacobs </em>534, as a case of great authority ; and is now the settled law of <em>England. </em>We could add nothing to the convincing reasons by which these cases are supported, by the judges who decided them. There are cases of void wills, such as the will by a <em>feme covert, </em>or an infant, which certainly, by established cases, will not demand an election ; but these have been rightly placed on a ground, which does not affect the present question. So too, a will not executed and attested according to the statute, creates no case of election from implication. They are considered as no wills ; they cannot he read as evidence ; and there is nothing, therefore, to indicate intention. But in the case before us, the will is properly in evidence; and the intention is clearly indicated. The cases above referred to may be the first in which the law of election was applied to a will, ineffective to pass after acquired lands; but no case from the <em>English </em>books has been cited against such application, and we consider them as the strongest evidence of the pre-existing law ? We have examined an opposing case, cited from 1 <em>Whar. Pen. Rip. </em>509, but cannot agree with it, in confining the rule of election to the operative parts of the will, from the fear of being led into error, by endeavoring to give effect to an intention imputed to the donor. It would he only in such cases where the inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>tion was plain, that the rule would or ought to be extended, and when this is clearly ascertained, it would be unbecoming a court of conscience to allow the heir to take the devise to himself, and also as heir, what was manifestly intended for another.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">4. The modern <em>English </em>cases do not, we apprehend, extend or enlarge the principle of election. That principle, as applicable to this case, we take to be this ; that no one shall be permitted to take under an instrument, and defeat its provisions ; or, in the language of <em>Lord </em>ErsJcine, a person shall not claim an interest under an instrument, without giving full effect to that instrument as far as he can. This is not a new doctrine; it will be found to have been announced as long since as the case of <em>Noys </em>&amp; Mordaunt, 2 <em>Ves. </em>581. <em>Lord Redesdale, </em>in 2 <em>Scho. Lef. </em>449, 451, says the general rule is, that a person cannot accept and reject the same instrument; and he declares it to be the foundation of the law of election, upon which courts of equity, particularly, have grounded a variety of decisions in cases, both of deeds and wills.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-6\">The complainants allege in their bill, that after the death of the testator, <em>Mrs. Barr </em>was put in possession of the lands devised ; that she had ever since been in the enjoyment of the rents and profits; and had received the interest on the bank stock devised to her; and that her trustee had received in pursuance of the will, the sum of $32,000 for her use, and had invested the same; that she had made efforts to procure the payment of the interest from the said trustee, on the money bequeathed to her. S</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">It thus appears, that her trustee and herself, are in possession of all the estate devised to her; and she is claiming, as heir at law, the proceeds of the <em>Kenega </em>farm, purchased by the testator after the date of the will. By the agreement of the parties, it is conceded, that the court may make a decree in accordance with the doctrine of election, and to have the same effect as if a cross bill had been filed, to compel <em>Mrs. Barr </em>and her trustee to make their election; provided, the court should be of opinion, that <em>Mrs. Barr </em>could not claim the devises- and be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>quests made in her behalf; and also claim, as heir at law, her proportion of the lands purchased after the execution of the will; and that this is a case in which <em>Mrs. Barr </em>should be compelled to make her election.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">We have seen, that the case before us is a proper case for election ; and we perceive nothing in the character of the trusts, which should forbid its application ; or how any injustice could be done to the children <em>o\u00ed Mrs. Barr, </em>who take, after her death, by the terms of the trust. If <em>Mrs. Barr </em>elected to take the property devised, then all her right and title in the property purchased after the date of the wrill, would be directed to be conveyed to the residuary devisee. If, on the other hand, she elected to take as heir the after purchased land, her life estate in the lands devised and in the property bequeathed, would be gone, and would pass to the residuary devisee; such an election, however, would not affect the persons in remainder, who would take their estates in the property devised ; just as they would have taken them, if there had been no case of election under the will.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">We shall, therefore, sign a decree, that <em>Mrs. Barr </em>and her trustee shall, within sixty days after service of a copy of the decree, make her election; either to take under the will, or to take her proportion of the <em>Kenega </em>farm, purchased by the testator after the date of the will; and if she should fail to make her election within that time, that then she shall convey her part of the said <em>Kenega </em>farm, which descended to her on the death of the testator, to <em>Theresa McElfresh, </em>in fee simple ; and the decree shall provide, in case <em>Mrs. Barr </em>should elect to take the land descended to her, instead of the devises and bequests to her by the will, that then she shall account for the sums by her received under the will; and that, thereafter, the said trustee shall hold the property devised and bequeathed in trust for <em>Mrs. Barr, </em>in trust during the life of <em>Mrs. Barr </em>for <em>Mrs. Theresa McElfresh. </em>And that the principles of this decree may be carried into effect, the decree of <em>Frederick </em>county court will be reversed, and the cause will be remanded to <em>Frederick </em>county court.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">DECREE REVERSED AND CAUSE REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
