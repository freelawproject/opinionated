That the same was levied and assessed on the rails, bed of the rail road, and other property of said defendants, connected with its rail road, and absolutely necessary for the use and enjoyment of its rail road. That the plaintiff was regularly authorised, to collect all taxes, legally assessable, on the property of defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-7\">That the several acts of Assembly, which relate to the incorporation and charter, are to be regarded as part of this statement, and to save the trouble of transcribing them, either party may read them from the printed statutes, to have the same effect as if they were transcribed info this statement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b364-8\">It is further agreed, that if the court shall be of opinion on the aforegoing statement, that the said property of the said defendant, is liable to be assessed for ordinary county charges, then judgment to be rendered for plaintiff, for $118 and costs.

'''That they are so, in common with all other property in the county, is conceded, unless exempted therefrom, by some legislative enactment upon the subject; and such enactment it is insisted, is to be found in the latter part of the 19th section of the act of the General Assembly of <em>Maryland, </em>passed at December session 1831, chap, 296, entitled, \u201can act to incorporate the <em>Delaware </em>and <em>Maryland Rail Road Com</em>pany,\u201d which declares, \u201cthat the said road or roads, with all their works, improvements and profits, and all the machinery of transportation used on said road, are hereby vested in said <em>Company, </em>incorporated by this act, and their successors forever; and the shares of the capital stock of said Company, shall be deemed and considered personal estate, and shall he exempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>from the imposition of any tax or burthen, by the States assenting to this law, except upon that portion of the permanent and fixed works of said <em>Company, </em>which may be within the State of <em>Maryland; </em>and that any tax, which shall hereafter be levied upon said section, shall not exceed the rate of any general tax, which may, at the same time, be imposed upon similar, real or personal property of this State, for State purposes.\u201d According to the true construction of this provision of the act of Assembly, we think, that by the first part of it, the shares of the capita] stock of the Company, thereby created, its works, improvements, profits, and machinery of transportation, except its permanent and fixed works, which lay within the State of <em>Maryland, </em>were exempted from all taxation or levies, whether for county or State purposes. And that, as far as regards the said first part of said recited provision, such permanent and fixed works which lay within the State of <em>Maryland, </em>remained subjects of taxation or assessment, either for county or-State purposes, or for both, in the same manner as if no such exemption had been inserted in the aet of Assembly. That as to the succeeding part of the said provision, it has no reference to taxes or assessments on levies, for county purposes; and, therefore, in no wise, impairs the rights asserted by the appellee in the present action. That it relates exclusively to taxes laid for State purposes; and is to be construed in the same manner, as if the words \u201cfor State purposes,\u201d which now stand at the end of the section, had been inserted after the words \u201cany tax,\u201d when it would read, and that any tax, for State purposes, which shall hereafter be levied upon said section, shall not exceed the rate of any general tax, which may, at the same time, be imposed upon similar, real or personal property of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">But, suppose we are wrong in the construction we have given to the portion of the act of Assembly referred to, what has that to do with the question now before us. That act of Assembly, related to the <em>Delaware </em>and <em>Maryland Rail Road Company; </em>the southern terminus of which road, was at the river <em>Susquehanna. </em>The powers and exemptions given <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>by its charter to that <em>Company, </em>as regards matters of the character of those now in controversy, apply to <em>Cecil, </em>not <em>Harford </em>county. To determine the question now before us, we must look to the act of 1831, ch. 288, entitled, \u201can act to incorporate the <em>Baltimore </em>and <em>Port Deposite Rail Road Company </em>not to the act of Assembly, for the incorporation of the <em>Delaware </em>and <em>Maryland Rail Road Company. </em>Under the first of these laws, you will look in vain for any such exemption, as that now claimed by the <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Rail Road Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The acts of Assembly of 1835, ch. 93, and 1837, ch. 30, by which the <em>Wilmington and Susquehanna Rail Road Company, </em>and the <em>Delaware and Maryland Rail Road Company, </em>and the <em>Baltimore and Port Deposite Rail Road. Company, </em>were united into one <em>Company, </em>by the name of the <em>Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Rail Road Company, </em>confer no such exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
