Because the action (as appears from the plaintiffs\u2019 declaration,) is brought to recover damages for changing the location of the railroad, which, heretofore, was constructed through the land of the plaintiffs, and if they are entitled to recover any thing, the measure of damages is the injury inflicted by such change, and not what may have been suffered from the first location of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">2nd. Because, if proof is admissible of the damage sustained by the original location and construction of the railroad of the defendant upon the lands of the plaintiffs, then that the inquisition of damages upon said land, in the lifetime of their ancestor <em>T. C., </em>taken and returned to <em>Baltimore </em>county court, and by it confirmed, and which has been given in evidence by the plaintiffs, is conclusive as to the amount of such damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-9\">3rd. Because, if proof of such damage, other than, or in addition to, said inquisition, is admissible, the evidence, so1 offered is not the best which the nature of the case admits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-10\">The court (R. B. Magkudek, A. J.,) refused to sustain said objections, and the evidence was admitted accordingly, and went to the jury. The defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-11\">2nd Exception. The defendants then, to support the issue on their part, offered in evidence, that on the 1st January 1838, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>under the supplement to their charter as proved, they had reconstructed off the lands of the plaintiffs, and at the distance of about two hundred yards from its old location thereon, all that portion of their rail road which had been originally located on the lands of the plaintiffs, and had completed and were using and travelling the same, and that said rail road, as so re-constructed, was of equal benefit and convenience to the said plaintiffs, as it had been where originally constructed ; and further proved that the parcel of land described in the proceedings of condemnation, given in evidence by the plaintiffs, had been in the possession of the plaintiffs from the time of theie construction of said rail road, and was claimed and admitted to belong to them ; and further gave in evidence, that the same, at an expense of not more than five hundred dollars, might be rendered as valuable for cultivation, as it had been before the original construction of the rail road thereon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-5\">The defendants then prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-6\">1st. That the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action, because the altered location of the rail road through the land of the plaintiffs, though it has removed the same from said land, has been by authority of, and pursuant to, and within the provisions of the act of Assembly of 1835, ch. 371, entitled a further supplement to the act entitled, an act to incorporate the <em>B. </em>\u00a7\u2022 <em>S. R. R. Co.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b41-7\">2nd.

That if the plaintiff's are entitled to recover in this action, the measure of the damages to be awarded them, is the damage sustained by them, in having the rail road of the defendants in its present position, instead of having it upon its original location on their land, and that if the jurors find the plaintiffs to have sustained no injury from such change, then that they arc not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>The plaintiffs likewise prayed the court for other instructions, as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-5\">The plaintiffs ask the court\u2019s instruction to the jury, that they are entitled to recover the damage done to the land and other property of the plaintiffs, by the original location of the defendants road over the same, and the abandonment of such location at the time of such abandonment, provided, the jury shall find such damage, location and abandonment, and also, that the present location of said road is on the eastern side of Jones\u2019 Falls, entirely off of the plaintiffs\u2019 land, without any deduction whatever for the benefit or advantage which the jury may find from the evidence, the plaintiffs derive from the present location of defendants road. The plaintiffs in this case claim, as a measure of damages, to recover what from the evidence in the cause the jury may find to have been the value of the land originally taken under the condemnation offered in evidence by the plaintiffs, and such other of the land as was directly injured by the making of said road, at the time the defendants totally abandoned the said location, and made and used the one on the western side of the Falls off the plaintiffs land, if the said land had never been taken by the defendants, less what the jury may find to be the value to the plaintiffs of said lands at the time of such final abandonment; and for the purpose of proving said facts, they offered in evidence to the jury, that twenty acres of the said land, worth $200 an acre, were by said first location, and the making of said road, rendered totally valueless, except for the purpose of said road, and as evidence thereof, offered to prove by a competent witness, <em>Capt. De La Roche, </em>as civil engineer, who had carefully examined said part of said road, that to restore the said land to its said original value of $200 an acre, would cost at least $5,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-6\">The court (R. B. Maghudek, A. J.) refused to instruct the jury as prayed, and gave the following direction :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b42-7\">If the jury shall find that the defendants originally located their rail road through the lands of the plaintiffs, and made the embankments and excavations, and completed and used the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>said road in the manner set forth in the evidence, and that defendants then abandoned the said road, and shall also find that the present location of the road is on the eastern side of Jones\u2019 Falls, entirely off' the plaintiffs land, then the plaintiff are entitled to recover the damage done to the land and other properly of the plaintiffs, by the original location of the defendants\u2019 road through and over the same, without any deduction whatever for any benefit or advantage which the jury may find from the evidence, the plaintiff derived from the present location of the road.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-5\">And the court further instruct the jury, that the price paid <em>by </em>the plaintiffs for the benefit of the road, as originally located, or the amount which was charged to, or assessed upon, the plaintiffs, at the time of the taking of the inquisition given in evidence in this cause, as benefit resulting to the plaintiffs from the location of the road through his land, and which was deducted by the jury who made the inquisition from the whole amount of damage done to the land and other property of the plaintiffs by said original location, if the jury shall find from the evidence such price or assessment and deduction, together with legal interest thereon, from the time of the abandonment of the road by the defendants, is the proper rule to regulate the jury in estimating the damages sustained by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-6\">To which direction, as given by the court, and the refusal of the prayers offered on their part, the defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b43-7\">3rd Exception. After the parties to this cause had gone \u2022before the jury under the direction of the court, as stated in \u25a0the second bill of exceptions, the defendants, by their counsel, insisted that the jury were entitled to take into their estimate of damages, the sum for which the lands of the plaintiffs, occupied by the road, as originally constructed, might be rendered as valuable for cultivation as they had been prior to such original construction, and wrere not bound to consider said land as totally destroyed, to which the plaintiffs objected as contrary to the true construction of the direction aforesaid, and thereupon the court decided, that by the true construction of said direction, the jury were bound to consider said land as wholly destroyed. The defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>The judgment being against the <em>Baltimore and Sus.

All questions in relation to such damage were terminated and concluded by the inquisition previously found by the jury. They formed no part of the issue then on trial. The question to be tried by the jury empannelled in the county court, was the extent of the injury which resulted to the plaintiffs by the abandonment and discontinuance of the railway on their lands, and its location and construction on the lands of another person. The county court therefore erred in admitting the testimony thus objected to by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">A majority of this court are of opinion that the county court were right in rejecting the defendant\u2019s first prayer, in his second bill of exceptions; that the plaintiffs could not recover, inasmuch as the removal- of the railway complained of was made under the authority and pursuant to the provisions of the act of Assembly of 1835, ch. 371. From this opinion I have \u25a0dissented ; but, as no reasons have been assigned in support of it, I do not deem it necessary to state the grounds of my dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-11\">The defendant\u2019s second prayer in the same exception, to wit: \u201cthat the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action, for the removal from their land, of the rail road of the defendant, unless they find some actual damage to the plaintiffs growing out of such removaland his third prayer, to wit: \u201cthat if the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the measure of the damage to be awarded them, is the damage sustained by them in having the rail road of the defendant <em>m </em>its present position, instead of having it upon its original location on their land ; and that if the jurors find the plaintiffs to have sustained no injury from such change, then that they are not entitled to recoverwe think both ought to have been granted : and that in failing to do so, the county court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">In the third bill of exceptions, the county court was right in its construction of the instruction it had given to the jury as stated in the second bill of exceptions. The error of that court consisted in its giving the instruction, not in its interpretation of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">This court concur with the county court in its construction of its instruction as stated in the third bill of exceptions. And a majority of this court approve of the refusal of the county court to grant the defendant\u2019s first prayer in his second bill of exceptions. But this court, dissenting from the county court\u2019s decision in the first bid of exceptions, and in its refusal to grant the defendants\u2019 second and third prayers in his second bill of exceptions, and from its instruction given in that exception to the jury, reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">LET A PROCEDENDO ISSUE.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
