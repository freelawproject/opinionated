That the defendants never had any possession of said vessel, to the knowledge of this witness, until after she returned from the coast of <em>Africa, </em>in August or September 1842; that after her return, and after the termination of said voyage, the defendants took possession, and they received the freight due upon said charter party; that when, or about the time when the said vessel was chartered to him the said <em>James Hall, </em>he told said <em>Boyle, </em>that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>said master, <em>William </em>Champion, might act as his, <em>Boyle\u2019s </em>agent, in superintending the repairs which he, <em>Boyle, </em>was bound by the charter party, to put upon said vessel, to fit her for the intended voyage; and that the said master did superintend those repairs, and from time to time, called upon, and received from said <em>Boyle, </em>instructions or orders, where and of whom to procure materials for the making of such repairs, and purchased them accordingly; and that the materials for which this suit is brought, were necessary for said brig upon said voyage.

That if the jury find from the evidence, that the bill of sale of 6th October 1841, from <em>Boyle </em>to the defendants (or three of them,) was made by way of mortgage, or collateral security, to secure the payment of the note of <em>Boyle </em>for $2,628.17, dated 7th October 1841, at four months; and that the assignment of the charter party, <em>by Boyle, </em>to the defendants, on the 21st January 1842, was made as a further security for the payment of said note; and if the jury further find, that the defendants never gave any order or authority to the plaintiffs, or to any other person, for the furnishing of the materials charged in the account of the plaintiffs, the price or value of which, they seek to recover in this action; and if they further find, that the-defendants never took, or had, or exercised any possession or control of the said brig, until she returned to the port of <em>Baltimore, </em>upon the termination of her voyage Under the charter party, made between <em>Hugh Boyle </em>and <em>James Hall, </em>then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action ; notwithstanding that the bill of sale is absolute on its face, and notwithstanding the oath and registry made and procured at the custom house by the defendants, or some of them, notwithstanding the insurance procured by the defendants upon their order on the vessel and freight, and notwithstanding the defendants, after the return of said vessel as aforesaid, in August or September, 1842, did take possession of and sell her for the purpose of paying the defendants the amount of the said note, the premium of insurance on the said vessel and freight, and other expenses incidental to the entryof the vessel at the port of <em>Baltimore.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Aoe\">2nd.

Because they were not the owners of the vessel:</p>\n<p id=\"b416-13\">2nd. Because the credit was given to another, to wit, to <em>Hugh Boyle.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b416-14\">There was certainly evidence offered to the jury, that the appellees were the owners of the vessel at the time that she was furnished with the supplies. But the account against the vessel and its owner, was sent to <em>Boyle, </em>and this it is supposed, was giving credit to him. It appears however, that <em>Boyle </em>was at one time the owner of the vessel, and it would seem that the account was sent to him, under an impression that he was still the owner. This proof of the account being sent to <em>Boyle, </em>cannot discharge the owner, if, but for this proof, he would have been answerable. Unless the seller knows at the time who the principal is, and notwithstanding that knowledge, makes the agent his debtor, the principal is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>not discharged. <em>(See Roscoe on Evidence </em>216, and the authorities there collected.) Notwithstanding all the testimony, then, on the part of the appellees, designed to show that the credit was given to <em>Boyle, </em>the former may be answerable, and it is a materia] question in the case, whether <em>Boyle, </em>in purchasing these supplies, is not to be regarded as the agent of the appellees? There was testimony offered to the jury, \u201ctending to prove\u201d the agency. Of the weight to which that testimony was entitled, the jury are the exclusive judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The court below, therefore, erred in granting the second prayer of the defendants below, as it withdrew the question of agency from the consideration of the jury, and also in giving the instruction which was given, in lieu of the instruction asked for by the appellees in their third prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">No error is discovered in the rejection of the appellants\u2019 first or third prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">The appellants, who were defendants in the court below, took exception to the opinion of the court, that parol evidence was inadmissible to show, that the bill of sale was intended to be a mortgage. It is the opinion of this court, that the decision was correct. Parol evidence is inadmissible to change or contradict the terms of a written instrument. Strangers to the instrument, when authorized to impeach or contradict it, may offer parol testimony for that purpose; and so a grantor may, in a controversy with the grantee, if he charges the same to have been obtained by fraud or mistake. But the parties to a written instrument are not permitted, in controversies with strangers, to insist, that it does not express what it was intended to express. The appellants, after obtaining an absolute deed, and authorizing the community to regard them as the owners of the vessel, cannot now, for their own benefit, be permitted to allege that their bill of sale is a mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">The party here, who is a stranger to the deed, insists, that it is what it purports to be, and the appellants who accepted it, are precluded from offering the evidence on which they rely, in order to defeat the action against them.</p>\n<p id=\"A8C\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Judgment must therefore be <em>reversed </em>upon the appeal of the structions given by the court to the jury.
