Policy 50 18.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-7\">It was accompanied with a statement of particular average, showing damage to $994.27, and the usual affidavits against the defendants, a company not incorporated by the State of <em>Maryland.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-8\">The defendants appeared by consent, and pleaded <em>non assumpsit. </em>The jury found a verdict for the plaintiffs. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment generally.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-9\">At the trial of this cause, the plaintiffs, to maintain the issue on their part, offered in evidence to the jury, that being the owners of three hundred boxes of tin, at <em>New York, </em>they shipped the same on board the schooner <em>Edward Vincent, </em>for <em>Baltimore, </em>and proved their bill of lading for the same.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b374-10\">That the defendants being an insurance company, chartered by the <em>State of Georgia, </em>and not chartered by the laws of this State, but transacting business, and holding and exercising franchises in this State, by its agents <em>John G. Proud </em>and <em>Francis II. Smith, </em>who are and were citizens of the State of <em>Maryland, </em>resident in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>and acting as such agents under the firm of <em>John G. Proud and Company, </em>insured the said tin upon the said voyage, by the aforesaid policy. That on the said voyage, the said schooner encountered gales and storms, which caused her to leak badly; and on the arrival of the said schooner at <em>Baltimore, </em>the said tin <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>was found to be damaged by salt water, in consequence of the said storms and gales, to the amount claimed by the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-5\">The defendants, to maintain the issue on their part, offered in evidence to the jury, that the said tin was stowed upon sand ballast, and badly and insufficiently dunnaged, and that the risk upon said tin thus stowed, was greater than if the stowage and dunnage of the same had been usual, sufficient, and proper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-6\">The plaintiffs, in order further to maintain the issue on their part, offered in evidence to the jury, that the stowage upon sand ballast, was usual and customary; and that the stowage and dunnage of the tin in this case was good and sufficient. Whereupon the defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-8\">1st. If the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the damage done to the tin insured, was owing to the neglect of the master in improperly stowing and dunnaging the same, then they must find for the defendants; although they may also believe that the injury done to the tin was occasioned by contact with salt water, introduced by leakage of the vessel, which leakage was occasioned by storms and gales.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-9\">2nd. If the jury shall believe from the evidence, that the stowage arid dunnage of the tin insured, was such as to expose it to more than ordinary risk, then they must find for the defendant, unless they shall also- believe that such risk was in the contemplation of the parties at the time of effecting the insurance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b375-10\">3rd. If the jury believe from the evidence, that owing to the negligent and improper manner in which the tin in controversy in this case was stowed and dunnaged, the schooner <em>Edward Vincent </em>was not sea-worthy for the safe transportation of the tin against leakage, and the ordinary perils of the sea, upon the voyage from <em>JVew York </em>to the port of <em>Baltimore, </em>then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this case, notwithstanding the jury may believe that the said schooner was sea-worthy in other respects.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>Which instruction, as asked in <em>the first </em>and <em>third </em>prayers, the court, (Magruder and Purviance, A.

These facts too, the points which were raised, in the court below, require us to assume.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">A verdict having been obtained by the defendants in error, a motion in arrest of judgment was made, and this because, as was contended, the remedy which is given against foreign corporations by the act of 1832, ch. 280, is taken away by a subsequent law, passed in 1834, ch. 89. This motion was properly over-ruled. The latter gives, and was designed to give, to the creditors of such corporations, an additional remedy, and cannot be interpreted to deprive the defendant in error, of the remedy which the previous law afforded to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">The questions which remain to be decided, are presented by the bills of exceptions, taken in the progress of the trial, by the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">On the part of the defendant, it is contended, that the damage done to the tin, was occasioned by the perils of the sea, and that the gales and tempests, which the vessel encountered, being the proximate cause of the loss, they are entitled to recover, even although his adversary has found in wrong stowage and dunnage, what is called a remote cause of such damage.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">Much of controversy has arisen upon the question, which is here presented, and by many it has been insisted, that;' although the loss be occasioned by any of the perils mentioned in the policy, yet the insurer is not liable, if there can be found another and remote cause of the loss, and it can be ascribed to misconduct, or negligence of the captain and crew, the same not amounting to barratry. Chancellor <em>Kent, </em>in the chapter of his <em>Commentaries, </em>which treats of the law of insurance, (in the edition of 1828,) refers to decisions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>for and against the insurer, and adds: \u201cIt may be expedient to suspend our own judgment, under such a sad uncertainty of the law, and leave the question for further judicial investigation, since an eminent judge of the Supreme Court of the <em>United States, (Justice Story,} </em>has thought proper to take this course.\u201d A number of decisions, both in <em>England </em>and this country have, since then, taken place on this once very vexed question, and in 1837, <em>(see 11th Peters </em>220,) <em>Justice Story </em>said, that in the case, 10 <em>Peters </em>507, \u201cthe court thought, that, in marine policies, whether containing the risk of barratry or' not, a loss whose proximate cause was a peril insured against,: is within the protection of the policy, notwithstanding, it might have been occasioned remotely by the'negligence of the master and mariners. We see no reason to change that opinion; and, on the contrary, upon the present argument, we are confirmed in it.\u201d In these two cases, (10 11 <em>Peters,) </em>are cited most of the <em>English </em>cases, in which the question was decided. The reported decisions-of some of our sister States-, furnish other cases, establishing the same doctrine, and this court can feel no disposition, in deciding this case, to depart from the rule <em>stare decisis. </em>It is to be understood then to be the settled law of <em>Maryland, </em>\u201cthat the underwriters are liable for a loss, the proximate cause of which, is one of the enumerated risks, though the remote cause may be traced to the negligence of the master and mariners.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">It is however contended by the plaintiff in error, that the cases referred to- do not settle the law of this case; that these cases only establish, that a policy, which being once attached, is not discharged by reason of the remote cause of the loss or damage sustained by the assured, but in the case now under consideration, the question is, whether the policy ever attached? The reason of this distinction, however, between this and the other cases is not perceived. The policy is on a cargo, shipped, or to be shipped on board of a vessel, <em>at and from New York to Baltimore. </em>If the policy had said not \u201cat and from,\u201d but \u201cfrom <em>N. York </em>to Baltimore,\u201d the risk would have commenced only when the vessel broke ground; but as the 1 an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>guage here used, is <em>\u201cat and from New York to </em>Baltimore,\u201d it is understood, to \u201cinclude all the time the ship is in port, after the policy is subscribed, and the goods are on board, 4\"c.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A6o\">The owners, &amp;c., of the vessel, it is said, are the agents of the assured, and are answerable to the shippers for any damage, which is the consequence of bad stowage. This may be so, but still we are told, 2 <em>Barn. </em>$\u2022 <em>Aid. </em>82, that \u201ca loss, whose proximate cause, is one of the enumerated risks in the policy, is chargeable to the underwriters; although the remote cause may be traced to the negligence of the master and mariners.\u201d The act of insuring, is the voluntary act of the insurer; he can prescribe the terms on which he will underwrite; may undertake as few or as many risks as he pleases, and in the policy of insurance, may, if he thinks proper, insert such clauses as will secure him against all liability, if the stowage and dunnage be not as they ought to be. If there be no such express warranty on the part of the owner of the cargo, still the underwriter may rely on the implied warranty, and is discharged, if the warranty express or implied, will exonerate him. Now, it is not pretended, that in this case the underwriter can claim to be discharged, by any express warranty. Does the implied warranty furnish him with a defence ? By effecting a policy, whether it be on the ship, freight, or cargo, or the commissions or profits, to accrue upon the cargo, <em>the assured </em>is always understood to warrant, that the ship is sea-worthy, or the materials of which the ship is made, its construction, the qualifications of the captain, the number and description of the crew, the tackles, sails and rigging, stores, equipment and outfit generally, are such as to render the ship, in every respect, fit <em>for the voyage insured. Phillips on Insurance, </em>113. <em>(Am. edit., </em>1823.) The policy implies the seaworthiness of the ship. <em>To render a ship seaworthy, </em>it must be staunch, and of sound materials, or rather, it must be sufficiently staunch and sound, for the employment or situation intended by the insurance. <em>Phillips </em>113. The author then proceeds to explain, that this relates to the beginning of the risk, that the breach of the warranty, discharges the underwriter from all subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>liability; that the vessel must be of proper construction, must have sufficient stores and supplies, must have a skilful master and competent crew, and a competent pilot, where it is customary to take one, but no where tells us, that this warranty <em>ex vi </em>termini, implies any thing, with regard to the stowage or dunnage of the vessel, which it certainly would be unreasonable to expect, that the owners of the articles insured, would attend to.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">But it is said, that the liability of the insurer does not commence, until the articles insured are placed as they ought to be. In <em>3rd Kent, </em>310, <em>(3rd edit.,) </em>the doctrine is not so laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">There would seem to be no good reason for this, as it is generally understood, that afterwards, and even after the vessel has left the port for some time, it is the right, and generally the duty of the master, to arrange the cargo differently, to <em>trim </em>the ship; and it is not contended, that because of a mistake then committed, the underwriter must be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">The owners of the ship, it is said, are answerable to the shipper, for any damage in consequence of bad stowage. It does not thence follow, that the underwriter is discharged. If damages are to be recovered, because of the manner in which goods on board of a vessel are stowed away, it would seem to be but right, that in the action, which is to decide whether the damage was the result of bad stowage, the owner should be the party defendant, and that such a question should not arise in an action, upon the policy of insurance; and who is so fit a person to be the plaintiff in the action, to recover damages for any such negligence or unskilfulness, as the insurer himself, who by relying on such a defence, proves, that he is in possession of the proof, and if there had been no subsequent loss or damage of the articles insured, might have retained the premium, and concealed the damage occasioned by the bad stowage, which perhaps, lessened the value of the article when sold? If the insurer be, <em>as he alleges, </em>in possession of proof, to fix the loss of the cargo upon the owner or captain, he becomes entitled, upon payment of the amount of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>he loss or damage, to stand in the place of the owner, and to be subrogated to all his rights against the person answerable for bad stowage or dunnage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The conclusive answer however, to all that was urged on this subject, is to be found in the decisions alluded to, in <em>England </em>and America, and which have established, that in case of loss, the consequence of the negligence or fault of the assured, their agents or servants, the underwriters will be liable, provided the proximate cause of the loss or damage be one of the enumerated risks in the policy. The good effects which are anticipated by an adherence in such cases to the maxim, <em>\u201ccausa pr\u00f3xima, non remota spedaturf </em>would be entirely lost, if in an action upon the policy, the defendant might insist upon one, yet more remote than the remote cause, which it is settled, can furnish the insurer with no defence. In the case of <em>Waltron vs. Maitland, </em>5 <em>Barnwell &amp; Alde. </em>174, the judge said, \u201cno decision can be cited, wherein such a case, (the loss by a peril of the sea,) the underwriters have been held to be excused, in consequence of the loss having been remotely occasioned by the negligence of the crew. I am afraid of laying down any such rule, It will introduce an infinite number of questions as to the <em>quantum </em>of care, which, if used, <em>might </em>have prevented the loss.\u201d <em>Justice Story, </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, in <em>Waters vs. Louisville Insurance Company, </em>observes, \u201cif negligence of the master or crew were, under such circumstances, a good defence, it would be perfectly competent and proper to examine on the trial, any single transaction of the whole voyage, and every incident of the navigation of the whole voyage, whether there was due diligence, in all respects, in hoisting or taking in sail, in steering the course, in trimming the ship, in selecting the route, in stopping in port, in hastening or retarding the operations of the voyage; for <em>all these </em>might be remotely connected with the loss. If there had been more diligence, or less negligence, the peril might have been avoided, or escaped, or never encountered at all. <em>Under such circumstances, the chance of a recovery upon a policy, for any loss, from the peril insured </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number><em>against, would of itself, be a risk of no inconsiderable hazard </em>and surely, this reasoning, applies to the case now under consideration, and to the defence which is relied on. Policies of insurance would seldom be contracts of indemnity, if, when the actual peril insured against has occurred, the payment of the loss depended upon every act, in regard to the properly insured, which, by possibility, might have increased the risk of loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">The court can discover no error, either in the instruction which was given, at the instance of the counsel, for the plaintiff below, or in the refusal to give the instructions, which were asked by the defendant below.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
