The defendant then, in addition to the facts mentioned in the first and second bill of exceptions, which he prays may be considered as incorporated in this, his third bill of exceptions, offered in evidence to the jury by <em>James P. Mayhue, </em>one of the persons who had rented the farm from the said <em>F. </em>Z., as aforesaid, and also one of the defendants in the said writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>that on or about the 23rd of February 1842, it was agreed between himself and the said <em>F. Z., </em>that the said Z. should offer the grain in the ground, the proceeds of which is the subject matter of this suit, together with the other personal property, in said instrument of writing mentioned for sale, for his own use; and that the proceeds of the said sale should be applied to the payment of the debt due the said <em>Ziegler, </em>and for the security of which the said bill of sale was executed. The debt so due to the said <em>Ziegler, </em>was then about eleven hundred dollars. That at the time of its being so agreed, that the said Z. should sell the grain and personal property, it was also understood, that if the said grain did not bring a fair price, of which said <em>M. </em>and <em>L. </em>were to be the judges and determine, that then the said Z. should proceed to cut the said grain ; and after paying himself out of the said grain for the cutting and securing the same, he should give the said <em>M. </em>and A. credit for the residue on the said debt. That the said <em>M. </em>made the arrangement with the said Z., to save trouble. That considering the said instrument good and valid, as vesting a title in the said Z. to the said grain, he agreed to let him sell the said grain in his own name, as it would be better and save the trouble of selling it themselves, and then assigning the notes to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>said <em>Z. </em>That the said <em>Z., </em>the next day after said agreement, or perhaps the day following that, did advertise the said grain and personal property for sale. That the printed hand bill, here shown by the witness, is one of the advertisements printed, and put up at public places in the neighborhood, in relation to the said sale. The said advertisement here follows, to wit : &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-5\">The said <em>M. </em>further proved, that he wras in possession of said farm on which said grain was then growing, under the said lease from said Z., at the time he made said arrangement for said Z. to sell said grain as aforesaid, and continued in possession of the same up to the 1st of April 1842, when his lease expired. The said Z. was occupying a house on said farm at the time, and which he had occupied from the commencement of said lease. The defendant further proved by the said <em>J. P. M., </em>that before the said <em>F. Z. </em>offered the said grain and personal property for sale, as aforesaid, in a conversation which he had with the said <em>Charles H. S. Besore, </em>one of the plaintiffs, the said <em>Besore </em>mentioned that he had a knowledge of the said bill of sale or instrument of writing, so executed by the said <em>M. </em>and <em>L., </em>to the said <em>F. Z. </em>But that be had no such knowdedge, until after the indebtedness of said <em>Mayhue </em>and <em>Bowman </em>to said <em>Besore </em>had taken place, though before he issued the saidyz./as. That the said <em>Ziegler </em>in pursuance of said notice by hand bill, sold said personal property, except said grain ; that the sale thereof amounted to four hundred dollars and upwmrds.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b165-6\">The defendant thereupon prayed the court to direct the jury, that the said instrument of writing though it may not be valid as a grant, yet that as a covenant between the parlies, it is good and effectual, and will entitle the said <em>Frederick Zeigler </em>to hold the said grain under such contract, if the jury believe from the evidence, that the said <em>Zeigler </em>had paid the consideration mentioned in the said contract, and especially, if the plaintiffs had notice of the existence of such contract, anterior to the issuing of their said writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>&amp;c.; that the said <em>Ziegler </em>had permission, before the issuing of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>writs, from the said <em>Maykue </em>and Lowman, to sell the same for his own use ; which opinion and direction the court refused to give. To which refusal of the court, the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-5\">4th Exception. The defendant, upon the same facts stated in the former bills of exceptions, prayed the court to direct the jury, if they believe from the evidence that the said <em>Frederick Ziegler </em>had permission and authority from the said <em>Mayhue </em>and <em>Lowman, </em>before the delivery of the said' writs of <em>fieri facias </em>to the constable, to proceed and sell said grain in the ground for his own use, and that this permission and authority were given on the premises, and in view of the said grain in the ground; and that said <em>Ziegler </em>did, thereupon, proceed to advertise the said grain for sale, before said writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were so delivered, that the said facts amounted to a delivery of said grain to the said <em>Ziegler, </em>and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover; which opinion and direction the court refused to give. To which refusal of the court the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b166-6\">The verdict and judgment being against the defendant, he prosecuted the present appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b166-7\">The cause was argued before Archer, Dorsey, Chambers, Spence, Stone and Semmes, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-8\">By Weisel and Price for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-9\">By Mason and F. A. Schley for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b166-10\">Dorsey, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aux\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-11\">The County court, we think, committed no error in overruling the appellant\u2019s objections to the admissibility of the writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>and the endorsements thereon. The first of which is, \u201cthat the endorsements on the said writs do not sufficiently shew a levy upon, or seizure of the grain in question.\u201d There is no precise form of return to such executions prescribed bylaw; and that made by the constable on this occasion, as far as this objection is concerned, is in accordance with the returns usually made by such officers; and by common usage and acceptation, the term \u201clevied\u201d when thus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>used by constables, imports a seizure. But suppose the facts were otherwise; seizure is a matter in <em>pais, </em>which may be proved by <em>parol </em>evidence, and was so proved by the constable who made the same, prior to any objection being taken to the testimony. It is not the constable\u2019s return which gives title to a purchaser under a <em>fieri </em>facias; but the seizure and sale under the writ. And the constable\u2019s return is evidence, but not the only admissible evidence of those facts; a statement thereof, in the receipt for the purchase money given to the vendee, would be as effectual to transfer the title to personal property, as the most formal return indorsed on, or attached to the writ; and if there had been no return made, nor receipt given by the constable, and the seizure, sale, and payment of the purchase money were established by oral testimony only, the title of the purchaser would be equally good.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">The remarks made upon the first objection are, for the most part, equally applicable to the second. The parol evidence of the constable obviating the defects, imputed to the returns made to the writs of <em>fieri facias.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">The only question raised on the second bill of exceptions in the court below, and on which the court decided was, whether a bill of sale, under the act of 1729, chap. 8, which enacts, \u201cthat from and after the end of this session of Assembly, no goods or chattels, whereof the vendor, mortgagor or donor shall remain in possession, shall pass, alter or change, or any property thereof be transferred to any purchaser, mortagee, or donee, unless the same be by writing, and acknowledged before one provincial justice, or one justice of the county where such seller, mortgagor, or donor shall reside, and be within twenty days recorded in the records of the same county,\u201d was admissible in evidence, where the magistrate, who took the acknowledgment, omitted to state therein the official character in which he acted ; and where it was admitted by the parties in the cause, that the person before whom the acknowledgment was made, was at the time thereof, a justice of the peace of the Stale of <em>Maryland, </em>in and for <em>Washington </em>county, duly commissioned and qualified as such. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>The only ground assigned for the rejection of the testimony offered, was, that the person who took the acknowledgment did not, upon its face, make any mention of his official character, or state himself to be a justice of the peace. Which objection to the evidence offered, the bill of exceptions states, that \u201cthe court sustained, upon the ground aforesaid, and refused to permit the said instrument of writing to be read to the jury.\u201d The act of 1729, prescribes no form of acknowledgment to be taken by the justice; much less does it require that the authority of the justice to take the acknowledgment, should appear upon its face. With equal, if not greater propriety, might it be insisted, that where the acknowledgment is made before a justice of the county, it should state, that the person was a resident thereof, who made the acknowledgment. Without such residence, the writing acknowledged is as inoperative and void, as if the person taking the acknowledgment were not a justice of the county. And yet, perhaps, not an instrument of the kind can be found, where the acknowledgment contains any such assertion of residence. And should the acknowledgment, contrary to the fact, state the residence of the party to be in a different county from that of the justice, the erroneous statement might be disproved, and the instrument acknowledged, established in its operation under the act of 1729 : although upon the face of the acknowledgment it appeared to be a nullity. See the case of Git- . <em>tings vs. </em>Hall, 1 <em>Harr. Sr John., </em>18; and so, if the acknowledgment had stated the person taking it to be a justice of the county, when, in truth, he was not so, the falsehood might be proved, and the instrument invalidated. And, <em>a fortiori, </em>may the defect be supplied, by testimony <em>aliunde, </em>where the acknowledgment omits to state the official character of him, by whom it was taken. And the proof offered, even if not admitted to be true, as was the case on this occasion, was much stronger and more conclusive evidence of the fact of official authority, than would have been the mere statement thereof, in the body of the acknowledgment. This view of the case we think fully sustained by the opinion of this'court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>in <em>Connelly vs. </em>Bowie, 6 <em>Harr. &amp; John. </em>141, where, in an action of ejectment, a certified copy of a deed was admitted as evidence, by the county court, although the acknowledgment thereto, neither stated the official character of the persons taking it nor the county in which it was taken. This court, in reviewing the judgment of the county court, say: \u201cThe official character of the persons before whom the supposed acknowledgment was taken, does not appear on the face of it, and the paper is equally silent as to the county in which the acknowledgment was taken; <em>nor is there any proof in the record </em>showing, <em>that John Ball and Turner Wootton were justices of the peace ; or that the acknowledgment was made in the </em>county, <em>in which the lands were then situate </em>and for these reasons reverse the judgment of the county court. Is not the inference irresistible, that had there been proof in the record, <em>dehors </em>the certified copy produced, shewing that <em>John Ball </em>and <em>Turner </em>Wootton, (the persons before whom the acknowledgments were taken,) were justices of the peace of, and that the acknowledgment was made in, the county in which the lands were situate, the judgment of the county court would not have been reversed, for the defects appearing on the face of the deed; the copy whereof had been admitted by the county court, in evidence to the jury?</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">But, although the county court, in the case before us erred, in refusing to permit for the reason assigned, the instrument of writing to be read to the jury, as offered by the appellant, yet its refusal was justified upon a ground which does not appear to have been brought to its notice, but which this court are not at liberty to overlook. By the act of 1729, chapter 8, under the provisions of which the bill of sale before us was taken; its being recorded within twenty days \u201cin the records of the same county,\u201d is as necessary to its validity, as is its acknowledgment. The record contains no evidence of such recording: the usual certificate thereof, by the county clerk, not appearing by the record to have been indorsed on the bill of sale. It is true, that preceding the bill of sale there is the following written statement, viz : \u201cAt the request <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>of <em>Frederick Zeigler </em>the following bill of sale was recorded, May 24th, 1841.\u201d But this statement is signed by nobody ; and where or by whom recorded, <em>non apparel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The third bill of exceptions having been abandoned, this court are relieved from its consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">We concur with the county court, in its rejection of the appellant\u2019s prayer, in the fourth bill of exceptions, that if the jury \u201cbelieve from the evidence, that the said <em>Frederick Zeigler </em>had permission and authority from the said <em>Mayhue </em>and <em>Lowman, </em>before the delivery of the said writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>to the constable, to proceed and sell said grain in the ground, for his own use, and that the permission and authority were given on the premises, and in view of the said grain in the ground; and that the said <em>Zeigler, </em>did thereupon, proceed to advertise the said grain for sale, before said writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were so delivered, that the said facts amounted to a delivery of the said grain to the said <em>Zeigler, </em>and the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.\u201d Before the court could grant the prayer thus made to it, it must assume the non-existence of all the other oral testimony given in the cause; because, by the prayer, no part of it is submitted to the finding of the jury. In the absence of all proof, that any consideration was paid for the said permission and authority : or, that it was delegated by <em>Mayhue </em>and <em>Low-man </em>to <em>Zeigler, </em>on account of any debt due from the former to the latter; or for what purpose this delegation of power was made; to call on the court below to deduce the fact of the delivery of the grain to <em>Zeigler, </em>from the facts submitted by the prayer to the finding of the jury, was to ask the court to transcend its jurisdiction, and exert a power exclusively within the cognizance of the jury. The authority delegated, and its incipient exercise by <em>Zeigler, </em>are perfectly consistent, either with the delivery, or non-delivery of the grain. Delivery, in this case, was a fact dependent upon the intention of the parties, to be passed on by the jury, upon evidence being offered, which was legally sufficient for them to assume <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>its existence. And so far from the court granting the appellant\u2019s prayer, upon the finding by the jury of the facts enumerated, with equal if not greater <em>propriety </em>might the appellees have prayed an instruction from the court to the jury, that from their finding, only, the facts submitted to them in the appellant\u2019s prayer, they were not warranted in finding the delivery of the grain to <em>Zeigler.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Concurring in opinion with the county court, in its admission of the testimony stated in the first bill of exceptions ; and in its refusal to grant the appellant\u2019s prayers in the second and fourth bills of exceptions, we affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
