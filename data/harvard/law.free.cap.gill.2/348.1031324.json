Gillispie, </em>they then and there being the administrators of the said <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>deceased, by the <em>Orphans </em>court of <em>Harford </em>county, before that time duly constituted and appointed. The said plaintiff further avers, that after the making of the said two -writings obligatory, to wit, on the day of in the year eighteen hundred and the <em>Orphans </em>court aforesaid, did revoke the letters of administration, so previously granted to the said <em>Jane Dinsmore </em>and <em>Thomas H. Gillispie, </em>on the estate of the said <em>Samuel, </em>deceased. And thereupon, letters of administration upon the estate of the said <em>Samuel, </em>deceased, were, by the <em>Orphans </em>court aforesaid, in due form of law committed to the said plaintiff, who thereupon became entitled to demand and receive from the said defendant the said several sums of money mentioned in the said two writings obligatory. Nevertheless, the said defendant, although often requested, hath not yet paid the said two sums <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>of money, or either of them, or any part of either of them, either to the said former administrators of the said <em>Samuel, </em>deeased, or to the said plaintiff, administrator as aforesaid, nor has he paid the same or any part thereof, to any or either of the heirs or assigns of the said <em>Samuel, </em>deceased, but to pay the same or any part thereof, to either of the said parties above mentioned, the said defendant has hitherto wholly refused and still refuses, to pay the same to the said plaintiff, as administrator as aforesaid. Whereupon, &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-5\">The parties then agreed to submit the cause aforesaid to the court here, upon the following statement of facts, to wit:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-6\">Stated case. It is admitted, that in the year 1826, <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>the elder, died, and that <em>Jane Dinsmore </em>and <em>Thomas U. Gillispie </em>were appointed his administrators. That while they were administrators, the defendant, on the 20th day of July, 1827, executed and delivered to the said <em>Jane </em>and <em>Thomas </em>the two bills obligatory, mentioned in the declaration. That on the 8th day of February 1839, the said <em>Jane </em>and <em>Thomas, </em>as administrators of said <em>Dinsmore, </em>sued out a- writ against said defendant on said bills obligatory, which was not served, but returned <em>\u00edlnon est,\u201d </em>and was renewed to the succeeding term, and again returned <em>non esi. </em>That after the issuing of said writ, to wit, on the day of the letters of administration of the said <em>Jane </em>and <em>Thomas H. </em>were revoked, and administration of the estate of the said <em>Samuel, </em>deceased, granted to the plaintiff, who sued out a writ against defendant on the 16th of January, 1840, to the term immediately succeeding that to which the last mentioned writ had been so returned, which writ was regularly renewed. That the writs referred to are in the case, and make part of this statement. That the said <em>Samuel, </em>deceased, had no children, and was born an alien. That said plaintiff is a naturalized alien.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b360-7\">It is agreed that limitations are considered as if pleaded. And if, upon the aforegoing statement, the court shall be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff; but, if the court should be of opinion that plaintiff is not entitled to recover, then judgment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>to be entered for defendant. Either party to have the right of appeal, and all errors in the pleadings waived.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b361-5\">The county court rendered judgment for the plaintiff, for his debts &amp;c., and the defendant prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b361-6\">The cause was argued before Dorsey, Chambers and Magruber, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-7\">By Reverby Johnson for the appellant, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b361-8\">By Otho Scott for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b361-9\">Magruber, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AZF\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-10\">This cause was submitted to <em>Harford </em>county court, upon a case stated. By this it appears, that <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>the intestate, died in 1826, and that the plaintiff in error, with another, on the 29th July 1827, executed two several instruments of writing, and thereby promised to pay \u201cto the heirs, administrators or assigns,\u201d of the estate of <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>deceased, the sums of money expressed in them. Upon those instruments, suits were brought, first, in the name of <em>Jane Dinsmore </em>and <em>Thomas II. Gillispie, </em>administrators of <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>and upon a revocation of their letters, and the grant of others to the present appellee, before the arrest of the appellant, the last administrator issued a writ in his name, as administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">It is contended, that no judgment could have been rendered in favor of the plaintiff below, although the suits had been continued, as well as brought in the names of the first, who administered upon the estate, because of the uncertainty by whom the money may be demanded. And indeed, it is difficult to determine, who can be said to be the obligee ? One would suppose not the administrators, to the exclusion of the heirs, nor the latter, rather than the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-12\">We are told, in <em>Bacon's </em>Abridgment, (Title, \u201cObligations,\u201d) that an obligation of &lt;\u00a3200, to two, <em>solvendum, </em>the &lt;\u00a3100 to the one, and the other, to the other, is a void <em>solvendum, </em>and this because, although there may be several obligees, yet a person cannot be bound to several persons, severally. But in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>it appears that the obligor is not to be bound to both, but to one or to the other, and to which more' than to the other, the instruments themselves, do not instruct us. How is it to be ascertained, to which of them the obligations are to be delivered? or is a delivery to each necessary, in order to the validity of the instruments?</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">It may be, as was suggested in the argument, that those instruments furnish evidence of an indebtedness either in the life time of the intestate, or for property, a part of his estate sold since his death. If so, the administrators have still their right of action, but that right of action must not be an instrument of writing, which the debtor is at liberty to discharge by paying the money to the heirs, persons who have no right to receive or to release debts due to the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">It must be admitted, that separate suits cannot be brought upon each of these instruments of writing; the one in the name of the heirs, and the other in the name of the administrators, and a judgment be obtained by each, for the same money. Yet, if one be authorized to bring suit, surely an action of debt may be brought by the other, and the pendency of the action by one, could not be pleaded in bar, to the action by the other. There is no \u201ccertainty to a certain intent in general,\u201d in this case, and if \u201cthe creditors of <em>Henry M. </em>Chew\u201d could not maintain an action upon the order of the court, set forth in the case of <em>Boteler &amp; Belt vs. State, use of Chew, &amp;c., </em>in 8 <em>Gill </em>&amp; <em>Johnson </em>360, it would seem to follow, that the objection arising from the uncertainty in this case, to whom the instruments of writing are to be delivered, and in whose name a suit must be brought, must prove equally fatal in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">But if a suit could be instituted in the name of the administrators of the intestate, still the plea of <em>non accrevit infra fyc., </em>of which it is agreed, that the defendant shall have the benefit, would defeat the action. \u201cWhere there are more writs than one, it must appear that they are regular continuances of each other, <em>JYorris\u2019 Peake, </em>425, and the writs issued in the name of <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em>administrator of <em>Samuel Dinsmore, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>are not regular continuances of those sued out in the name &lt;of the original administrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">JUDGMENT REVERSED, WITH COSTS.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
