M., she proved to be the <em>French </em>vessel of war, \u201cthe <em>Perle,\u201d </em>which boarded the brig and took immediate and forcible possession, and hauled.down the <em>American </em>flag, and made prisoner of the deponent, his officers and crew, part of whom were sent on board the <em>Perle; </em>these steps were taken by the <em>French </em>officer and his crew prior to his asking for the vessel\u2019s papers, or any question by which they could have ascertained the national character of the said vessel \u2014 eleven <em>Frenchmen </em>remained in charge of the brig, with their arms about them; at 4 P. M., they descended into the hold, and drew off a portion of wine and rum for their use, being part <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>of the cargo; at 5 P. M., they attempted to get the brig under way, in doing which, they upset the windlass, and carried away the greater part of the pall plates; at 6 A. M., they concluded to remain at anchor during the night, and set a watch, five men in each, all armed \u2014 in hoisting some casks of water on board, they spilled a large quantity on the goods in the hold, which caused considerable damage; on the 17th, strong breezes from the northward and eastward; at 6 A. M., the boats of the <em>Perle </em>boarded us with about twenty men, and immediately got the brig under way, cutting the running rigging and breaking many articles that came in their way; they also broached the brig\u2019s provisions, and used them without ceremony. March 18th, the <em>French </em>crew regularly drew from the cargo three buckets full of wine per day, and used the brig\u2019s provisions extravagantly, and the vessel was managed so badly, that the deponent considered the safety of the vessel, and his life in great danger, there being but two able seamen among the <em>French </em>crew; on the 20th same month, at 8 A. M., made <em>Monte Video </em>; at 1 P. M., came to anchor within half gunshot of the flag ship of the <em>French </em>Admiral, after which an officer from the <em>Perle </em>came on board, and took an inventory of the cargo on board, and the vessel\u2019s roll, clearance and bill of health; on the 21st, the mate of the brig was sent from the <em>Perle </em>on board, and the deponent was permitted to go on shore, the <em>French </em>crew still in the possession of said brig, and the greater part in a state of intoxication, having free access to the wine and spirits, and provisions generally; 25th, at 1 P. M., <em>Commodore </em>JVicholson, in command of the <em>U.

On the 26th same month, at 7 A. M., a boat from the <em>Perle </em>came along side, and placed the original crew of the brig on board, and took the <em>French </em>officer and crew from on board, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>thus delivering the vessel to the deponent, after having forcible possession for ten days, during which time the said brig suffered severely in her sails, rigging, &amp;c., in consequence of negligence and the incapacity of the <em>French </em>crew. And the deponent further declares, that he was not asked for his vessel\u2019s papers until nearly half passage to <em>Monte Video, from Lober\u00eda Chica, </em>and that he then refused them, upon the ground that he had been illegally captured, and that the said papers\u00bb should have been asked for prior to taking and holding possession of the said vessel, and that after the anchorage near the <em>AdmiraVs </em>ship, an officer from the <em>Perle </em>came on board and demanded the papers, which were delivered by the deponent, viz: roll, clearance, and bill of health, which were afterwards returned.

As, however, the charterer does not derive benefit from the part of the voyage performed, to any thing near that proportion, my idea is, that the third party causing the non-fulfilment of charter, should be called on and made accountable for the difference, and suggest the following mode <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>of settlement: that the charterer pay to the vessel $1,200 in full, for the part of the voyage actually performed, receiving the bales from on board in <em>Monte Video; </em>and that his claim on the <em>French Government </em>for the balance, say eight hundred and fifty hard dollars, if recovered, be paid over to <em>Capt.

That the voyage therein stipulated to be performed by the <em>Eliza Davidson, </em>(the brig mentioned in the policy of insurance,) was performed by him to <em>Havana, </em>and the freight of $5,000 earned by her, and paid to the owners; and that said voyage to <em>Havana, </em>was a shorter voyage than would have been that to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number><em>Boston, </em>and on the way home, to the port of <em>Baltimore, </em>of said brig, where she belonged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-5\">The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the deposition of <em>Shadrach Hudgins: </em>that he was mate of the brig <em>E. D. </em>on her voyage from <em>M. V. </em>to <em>C. C., </em>and from thence to <em>Boston, </em>to be performed under a charter party. The voyage commenced in the beginning of the year 1839, and at Jl\u00edT. <em>V. </em>they took in a cargo for <em>Corrientes, </em>and proceeded to <em>Corrientes, </em>where the cargo was landed, and they commenced taking in a cargo for <em>Boston; </em>and when they had taken in a part of the carg\u00f3, about one-fourth, they were seized by a <em>French </em>corvette, and all the crew removed to the corvette, and the brig taken possession of by the <em>French. </em>The <em>French </em>did a great deal of mischief to the said brig; left all her boats ashore; broke the windlass; destroyed the greater part of the running rigging; and the vessel was brought as a prize to <em>M. V. </em>He further states, that the crew and vessel were detained about ten days in <em>M. V., </em>before they were released ; as he understood at the time, <em>C. </em>was declared in a state of blockade, and said brig was prohibited from going there. After their release, they remained in <em>M. V. </em>upwards of forty days, when the said vessel got a freight for <em>Havana. </em>In consequence of this declaration of blockade, the voyage to <em>Boston </em>was broken up. The blockade continued for two years afterwards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b430-6\">Cross examined. Witness understood that the freight for Havana, amounted to $4,000. At <em>M. V-, </em>the windlass was mended; did not get new sails; had a carpenter employed about a week mending the windlass, and doing some caulking; the caulking was not occasioned by the blockade. They did not know that <em>B. </em>was about to be blockaded before they went there, on the contrary, all the consuls there, except the <em>French </em>consul, said that it was not in a state of blockade. The <em>French </em>were, at that time, blockading <em>Buenos Ayres. </em>No application was made by him, or by the captain, to his knowledge, to the <em>French </em>consul, to ascertain the condition of the war, or whether <em>Corrientes </em>was blockaded. He knew that the cargo they had in had come from <em>Buenos Ayres.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Examined in chief. Deponent states that the <em>French </em>were blockading the river <em>Plate; </em>that <em>Corrientes </em>is not in the river <em>Plate, </em>but 60 miles south of <em>Cape Antonio; </em>that in unlading the outward cargo, and taking in a part of the inward cargo, they were occupied nineteen or twenty days, during all which time, they never saw a <em>French </em>vessel of any kind ; that they knew that the <em>French </em>were carrying on a general war with <em>Buenos Ayres.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-5\">Cross examined. Deponent heard from <em>Mr. Corner </em>or <em>Mr. Glenn, </em>that the whole matter had been compromised.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-6\">Examined in chief. Deponent states that one part of the <em>French </em>fleet w?ere above <em>Monte Video, </em>and the other off <em>Monte Video; </em>they saw no vessels below <em>Monte Video.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-7\">Whereupon, the plaintiffs prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-8\">1st. That the true construction of the policy of insurance, given in evidence in this case, is, that the defendants assured the risk of loss arising from restraints and detainments of all kings, princes or people, and were of course liable for the loss arising from the capture and detention of the brig by the <em>French </em>vessel of war, \u201cthe Perle.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-9\">2nd. The true construction of the charter party of <em>Peabody, </em>also offered in evidence, is, that no freight was to be due by the charterer, unless the voyage undertaken was performed, and the goods safely delivered at the termination of the voyage at <em>Boston, </em>and this, notwithstanding it was prevented by the said capture and detention of the <em>Eliza Davidson, </em>by the said <em>French </em>vessel of war.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-10\">3rd. That as the <em>Cape Corrientes </em>was blockaded on and after the <em>Eliza Davidson </em>was released at <em>Monte Video </em>from the capture and detention of said vessel of war, it was impossible for the vessel to earn her freight under said charter party, and that therefore the policy of insurance in question was forfeited, and the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-11\">And the defendants prayed the court to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>1st. The defendants in the above cause, prays the court to instruct the jury, that if they shall find from the evidence, that on the 1st day of January 1839, the defendant executed the policy of insurance offered in evidence in this cause, that on the 1st day of February 1839, the charter party offered in evidence, was entered into by <em>Capt. M., </em>the master of the <em>E. D.; </em>that in pursuance thereof, the said brig proceeded to <em>C. C., </em>and there discharged her outward cargo; that whilst engaged in taking on board the lading stipulated by the charterer to be furnished for transportation to <em>B., </em>said brig was seized by the <em>French </em>brig of war, the <em>Perle, </em>and by her held from the 16th of March 1839, till the 25th day of the same month, when said brig <em>E. B., </em>was surrendered to <em>Capt. M., </em>who, with his crew, took possession of the same; that at the time of her seizure by the <em>French </em>brig, said brig, <em>E. B., </em>had on board of her one-fourth of the cargo stipulated by the charterer, to be furnished for transportation to <em>B.; </em>that being in that condition, the master of said brig demanded of the charterer, (who insisted upon breaking up the contemplated voyage, upon the ground, that the port of <em>C. C. </em>was declared by the <em>French, </em>to be in a state of blockade,) the full amount of the freight stipulated for in the charter party of the 1st of February, 1839; that said charterer refusing to pay the same, the matter was submitted by the said master and the charterer to arbitration ; and that the arbitrators chosen by the parties, awarded $1,200 to be paid by the charterer, as a compensation for what had been done under said charter party, which was accepted by said <em>M.; </em>and that said charter party, by the mutual consent of the said master and the charterer, was thereupon cancelled; that said brig, <em>E. B., </em>afterwards, to wit, on the 2nd May 1838, was chartered for a voyage to <em>Havana, </em>at and for the freight of $5,000, as shown by the charter party offered in evidence, and that said brig performed said voyage, which was a shorter voyage than that from <em>M. V. </em>or <em>C. C. </em>to <em>B., </em>and received the freight stipulated to be paid them ; and shall further find that said master, <em>Mattison, </em>at the time said policy of insurance was effected, and during the whole period covered by the transactions here<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>inbefore recited, was a part owner of said brig, <em>Eliza Davidson, </em>and still is such part owner, that then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover in this action, on the first count in their declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-5\">1st. Because no loss of freight was sustained by the plaintiffs, upon the voyage, covered by the policy of insurance, within the terms of said policy, or the perils thereby insured against.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-6\">2nd. Because upon the true interpretation of the charter party, of the 1st February 1839, the charterer, <em>A. Peabody, </em>was answerable, under the circumstances above stated, for the whole amount of freight stipulated to be paid by <em>A. Peabody, </em>upon the voyage to <em>Boston, </em>and that <em>Captain Mattison, </em>one of the owners of said brig <em>E. D., </em>having consented to the cancellation of said charter parly, and thereby discharged the said <em>Peabody </em>from his obligation to fulfil it, has released the defendant from all responsibility, upon the policy offered in evidence in this cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-7\">3rd. Because the reference and adjustment at <em>M. V. </em>having been made, without the knowledge or consent of the defendant, and having been followed by the cancellation of that charter party, with the consent of one of the assured, <em>M. </em>being a part owner of said brig, discharged the defendant from all liability upon said policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-8\">4th. Because under the circumstance stated, the said owners of said brig <em>E. D., </em>laid a claim for full freight, under said charter party, and that having on board one-fourth of the homeward cargo, they had a lien on it for said freight, and that it was their duty to have prosecuted their voyage to <em>B., </em>after the time limited by said charter party, for the lading of said vessel, and that having relinquished said lien, in the manner shown by the evidence, the defendant was discharged from all liability on said policy.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b433-9\">5th. Because by the second charter party offered in evidence, the said plaintiffs, within the period necessary to perform the voyage under the first, having carried freight to a larger amount <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>than is claimed in the present suit, sustained no damages, which they are entitled to exact in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-5\">6th. The defendant prayed the court, further to instruct the jury, that even if the plaintiffs are entitled to recover in this case, that being the owners of but two-thirds of said vessel, the <em>E. D., </em>they are entitled to recover but two-thirds of the amount due upon the policy of insurance declared upon, after deducting the sum of twelve hundred dollars, received from <em>A. </em>Peabody, notwithstanding that they have sued for the whole amount so due.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-6\">And the court, (Magruder, A. J.,) thereupon gave to the jury, the instructions prayed for by the plaintiffs, and rejected those prayed for by the defendant. The defendant excepted to the said opinion of the court, granting the prayers of the plaintiffs, and to each of them, and to the said opinion rejecting the prayers of the defendant, and to each of them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b434-7\">The <em>Insurance Company </em>prosecuted this appeal.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b434-8\">The cause was argued before Archer, C. J., Dorsey7 Chambers and Magruder, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-9\">By Z. Collins Lee and Nelson for the appellants, and</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-10\">By Reverdy Johnson for the appellees.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b434-11\">Chambers, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">delivered the opinion of this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-12\">The instructions asked by the appellee, who was plaintiff below, were not based on an assumed state of facts, to be submitted to the consideration of the jury. They were moved, it would seem, in the confidence, that as the evidence wras uncontradicted, the jury could not do otherwise than find the facts accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-13\">They are, in effect, an assertion by the court, in the first and second instructions, that the <em>Eliza Davidson </em>was captured and detained by <em>thePerle; </em>and in the third instruction, that <em>Corrientes </em>was blockaded on and after the ship\u2019s release at <em>Monte Video. </em>Doubtless the jury would have found these facts according to the testimony, but the sufficiency of evidence to satisfy a jury, or the circumstance, that it is all on one side. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>does not authorise the court to direct the jury, that it proves the fact. They have the power to refuse their credit, and no action of the court should control the exercise of their admitted right, to weigh the credibility of evidence. In thus incautiously expressing their opinion, the court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">The appellants deny the right of the appellee, to recover on the state of facts set out in the defendant\u2019s first prayer, on various grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">The first four reasons assigned in the record, are based upon the assumption, that the ship was entitled to full freight, and might have earned it by proceeding on the voyage, with the part of her cargo received, when she was seized and driven off.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">If the construction given to the charter party by the appellants, could be adopted, this objection must be sustained. That construction is, that Peabody, the charterer, under the circumstances which occurred, was answerable for the whole amount of freight, which would have been earned by the successful prosecution and termination of the contemplated voyage. Was such the meaning of the charter? It is to be construed as other contracts, so as to effect the design of the parties, apparent by its terms. The evidence is, that about one fourth of the cargo was taken in at Comentes; and there is no allegation of unwillingness, or wmnt of readiness or preparation, on the part of the charterer, to furnish the residue of the lading. It would, therefore, seem to require very explicit language to justify the inference, that in such a state of things, the charterer intended to pay full freight. If it can be demanded in a case where an enemy\u2019s force, by seizing and driving away the ship, after receiving one fourth part only of the cargo, why may it not be in a case, where one hundreth part only is taken in ? If full freight is due, where, by a hostile force, the ship is prevented from loading more than a very minute portion of the cargo, why not, if, after receiving a full cargo, a hostile force were to seize and carry off a very large proportion of the cargo, before the ship had left her port of lading ? In these cases, full freight certainly could not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>charged. We think the apparent intent of this charter party, was, that \u201ca full and complete cargo\u201d should be received on board at <em>Corrientes, </em>and delivered at <em>Boston, </em>to entitle the owner to full freight; and that in the event, which actually happened, it was at least doubtful, whether the charterer could have been compelled to pay any freight on the small portion of the cargo received, and which was violently seised, and taken to <em>Monte Video. </em>We think the appellants have no cause, therefore, to complain of the adjustment between <em>Peabody </em>and <em>Mattison.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The next reason assigned, is, that the freight which was actually earned and received, on the voyage from <em>Monte Video </em>to <em>Havana, </em>or so much of it as would repay the loss claimed by the appellees, ought to be applied as <em>salvage, </em>to the relief of the underwriters, in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">It is rightly argued, that the contract of insurance is one of indemnity, and the doctrine of <em>salvage </em>for freight, has been introduced as a fair item in the adjustment of actual loss. If therefore, the particular freight, that is to say, the freight on the particular cargo contemplated in the policy, be not earned, but other freight be earned in the same voyage, the insurer will only be liable for the difference, because, that is the extent of actual loss by that voyage. No case, however, has extended the doctrine so far as is now claimed. This is not the case of a suspended voyage, afterwards pursued, nor is it the case of a prosecution of the same voyage, with a different cargo. The first voyage was completely and finally broken up and ended, in consequence of the ship\u2019s being driven off from the port of lading, and without a prospect of permission to return. Time had elapsed sufficient for the completion of the original voyage, when, at a different port from that of her intended lading, she received a different cargo, for a different destination, on which she earned freight.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">There must be some limitation, in regard to time, as well as distinction, in the application of this doctrine. It cannot be required, that a ship shall remain, year after year, awaiting the restoration of peace, or removal of an embargo, so as to allow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>her to return to her original port of lading; or to remain, for any indefinite period, waiting for a cargo to her port of destination. The inconvenience, not to say ruinous consequences of such a doctrine, are too manifest to require detail. In like manner, it would be quite impossible to maintain, on principles of policy, or by authority, that the first subsequent voyage, whatsoever might be the port of lading or of destination, must be made subject to this claim for salvage, on the freight of the interrupted voyage.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Great difficulty may be found in ascertaining the precise limits, within which the doctrine should be applied; but we do not think, that any adjudged case will authorise us to include this within its letter or spirit.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">The fifth reason is subject to the additional exception, noticed in considering the prayers of the appellees. The time in which either of the voyages alluded to, should be performed, is a question of fact, and not to be assumed and asserted by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">The last objection stated in the record, respects the right of the plaintiffs below, to recover more than the proportion, in which they were owners. This, we think, was rightly abandoned, as altogether untenable. See <em>Phil, on Ins. </em>593, and the numerous cases there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">The result is, we concur with the court below, in their several opinions on the instructions asked for by the appellants below, but differ from that court, in respect to the opinions expressed on the prayers of the appellees, the plaintiffs below.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO ORDERED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
