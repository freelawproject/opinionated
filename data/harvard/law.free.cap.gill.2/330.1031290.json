Witness replied, that he did not know, and asked <em>Gist, </em>what the <em>Company </em>wanted with cotton? to which he answered, for packing their machinery. He (witness,) further proved, that <em>Gist </em>(the defendant,) stated, in the same conversation, that <em>David Keener </em>and himself, had been appointed a committee, to raise money for the use of the <em>Eutaw </em>Company, and in consideration, that he would endorse said bills, with others, as the means of raising money for it, the <em>Company </em>agreed, to give him a credit upon the claims of the <em>Company </em>against him, he, the said <em>Gist, </em>being at the time, the debtor of the <em>Company, </em>to a considerable amount; that he did endorse said bills and others, for said purpose, under said agreement, and upon which money had been raised. The witness farther proved, that in a second interview, between said <em>Gist </em>and himself, he, the witness, stated to said <em>Gist, </em>that he had examined the books of said <em>Company, </em>and found, that his indebtedness thereto, would cover all his liabilities incurred, to which <em>Gist </em>replied, that he thought he had gone further; that he intended to pay the bills in the hands of witness, but wished him to go against the <em>Company </em>and <em>Keener </em>first; and promised, that he would give witness a judgment, with a stay of execution, for the amount of the bills; that at a third interview, witness told <em>Gist, </em>(the defendant,) that <em>Keener </em>had consented to confess a judgment; <em>Gist </em>said he did not think he owed as much as he had become responsible for, on account of said <em>Company, </em>but that he would confess a judgment upon the bills; that <em>Gist </em>nevertheless, seemed to hesitate to make such confession, when witness left the nar. and order, for the judgment to be confessed, with <em>T.

That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, under the <em>first </em>count in the nar. because the bills offered in evidence, are not promissory notes.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-8\">2. That the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, under the counts for work and labor, &amp;c., or for materials furnished, &amp;c., because there is no evidence, that the plaintiff performed any work and labor for the defendant, or furnished any material, as charged in said counts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-9\">3. That the plaintiff cannot recover under the count for goods sold and delivered, because there is no evidence in support of said count.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-10\">4.

That if the jury believe from the evidence, that the defendant, when he wrote his name upon the back of the bills offered in evidence, intended to assume the responsibility of an endorser, of a commercial negociable instrument, in the order in which said bill was endorsed, and that the plaintiff so understood the said intended contract when he received said bills, then the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-12\">6. Because there is no evidence of any agreement or authority from the defendant, with the plaintiff, under or by which, the plaintiff can write the guarantee, proposed to be written by him, over the name of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-13\">7. Because there is no evidence of any contract, between the plaintiff and defendant in this cause, and the promise and undertaking of the defendant, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, was a <em>nude </em>pact, and void for want of present consideration when it was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b345-14\">8. Because the promise of the defendant, to pay the said writing obligatory, if the jury shall find such promise, was a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>promise and undertaking, to pay and answer for the debt of another person, and there is no evidence, that the agreement and consideration for such promise, was made in writing, and signed by the said defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-5\">9.

Because there is no evidence, that the plaintiff used due diligence, to collect the debt mentioned in said writing obligatory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-7\">11. Because the only evidence offered by the plaintiff, to charge the defendant, is evidence of a joint contract and responsibility, by <em>Keener </em>and <em>Gist, </em>and it being in evidence, that the plaintiff has recovered judgment against <em>Keener, </em>the obligation of the said <em>Gist, </em>if it ever existed, has been discharged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-8\">12.

If the jury believe from the evidence, that the writing obligatory, offered in evidence by the plaintiff, was made and put in circulation, for the purpose of raising money for the use of the <em>Eutaw Company, </em>then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, because the <em>Eutaw Company </em>had no power or authority under its charter, to make, issue, or put in circulation, the said writing obligatory, and the pretended contract, was merely void, and the promise of the defendant, if the jury should find such promise, is void for want of consideration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-10\">14. If the jury believe from the evidence, that the bills offered in evidence, were made by the <em>Eutaw Company, </em>and passed to the plaintiff, for the purchase of cotton, by the <em>Eutaw Company, </em>and for its use, from the plaintiff, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover in this action, because the said <em>Eutaw Company, </em>had no authority to make such a contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b346-11\">The court, (Purviance, A.

Of this instruction the appellants complain.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">Upon what grounds is it asked of us to say, that the court below erred in giving this instruction?</p>\n<p id=\"Akj\">It was frequently assumed, in the course of the argument, that sealed instruments are the causes of action in this case, and authorities were cited to prove, that instruments of that description, if left blank, could not be filled up by the owner of them. But, this action is grounded not upon the promises of the <em>Eutaw Company, </em>which are to be found only in sealed instruments, but upon alleged written promises of the defendant, in the court below, to which there were no seals. Many of the cases therefore, with a reference to which, we have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>furnished, afford us no information, with regard to the law of this case. Those alleged promises, although on the same piece of paper, may be collateral to, or distinct from, and no part of the obligations of the <em>Eutaw Company.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Much stress was, in the course of the argument, laid upon the circumstance, that the obligations of the <em>Eutaw </em>Company, were not promissory notes, or negotiable paper; and it seemed to be conceded, that if they had been instruments of that description, the defendant in error, would have been entitled to recover; the authorities, however, would not appear to lead us to this conclusion. Chancellor <em>Kent </em>says, (3 <em>Com.,p. </em>59, 1$\u00a3 <em>edit.,) </em>no other use can be made of a blank endorsement, on a note or bill of exchange, in filling it up, than to point out the person to whom the bill or note is to be paid. In the case of <em>Moies vs. Bird, </em>11 <em>Mass. Reports, </em>436, <em>Justice Parker, </em>pronouncing the opinion of the court, said : \u201cHad the notes been made payable to him, and negotiable in its form, the plaintiff would have been restricted to such an engagement, written over the signature, as would conform to the nature of the instrument. In such case, the defendant would have been held as endorser, and in no other form, for such must be presumed to have been the intent of the parties to the instrument.\u201d But this note was not made payable to the defendant, and was therefore, not negotiable by his endorsement. What then was the effect of his signature? It was to make him absolutely liable to pay the contents of the note. He puts his name upon a note, payable to another, in consequence of a purchase made by his brother, in a day or two after the bargain was made, knowing that he could not be considered in the light of a common endorser, and that he wras entitled to none of the privileges of that character. He leaves it to the holder of the note, to write any thing over his name, wdiich might be considered not to be inconsistent with the nature of the transaction. In <em>Seabury vs. Hungerford, 2nd Hill\u2019s N. Y. Rep. </em>80, the court say, \u201cwhen a contract cannot be enforced, in the particular mode contemplated by the parties, the court, rather than to suffer the agreement to fail altogether, will, if possible, give effect to it in some other way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>This is an attempt to charge the defendant with the amount due on two obligations; because of an endorsement thereon of his name in blank, and of course, the obligation is not, speaking technically, a negotiable instrument. <em>Justice </em>Story, in his able work on the law of promissory notes, page 587, speaking of notes, with the name endorsed in blank thereon, says, \u201cthese cases have been either, <em>first, </em>where the <em>note </em>was not negotiable, or <em>second, </em>where it was negotiable,\u201d and then adds: \u201cIn the former class of cases, it has been held, that if the blank endorsement was made, at the same time as the note itself, the endorser ought to be held liable, as an original promisor or maker of the note, and that the payee is at liberty to write over the signature, <em>\u2018for </em>value <em>received, I </em>undertake to pay the money within mentioned to B, \u2019 the payee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">It is not the duty of this court to say, upon how much less proof, than was offered by him, the plaintiff, in' the court below, might have recovered the amount of his plaim. He might perhaps, have regarded this as a contract, like that spoken of by the <em>Supreme Court of the United States, </em>in the case of <em>De Wolf against Rabaud and others, </em>1st <em>Peters, </em>476, \u201ca trilateral contract, each as an original promise, though the one may be deemed subsidiary, or secondary to the other, a credit not given solely to either, but to both; not as joint contractors, on the same contract, but as separate contractors, upon co-existing contracts, forming parts of the same general transaction.\u201d It may be, that the plaintiff below, haight have filled up the blank somewhat differently, and thereby, have dispensed with the necessity of offering some of the proof which he adduced, but it is not perceived, that the blanks are filled up, otherwise than as the holder of the notes, was at liberty to fill them\u2019up, or that the.defendants have any cause to complain of the insertion of any word, which, consistently with the nature of the transaction, might have been omitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">Indeed, in order to sustain this decision of the court below, it is not necessary to rely on very modem decisions. The principles settled by the case of <em>Russell vs. Langstaff, Doug. </em>514, and the various cases in the books, (see <em>2nd H. Blac. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>298, <em>note,) </em>brought upon bills, payable to a fictitious payee, <em>or order, </em>would seem to be sufficient for our purpose. If in cases like those now spoken of, such objections to a recovery were over-ruled, it is difficult to come to a conclusion, that they can be fatal objections to a recovery in this suit. In the first case, (that in <em>Douglass,) </em>the defendant endorsed several notes, all of them at the time blank; that is, without any sum, date, or time of payment, mentioned in the notes. The defendant\u2019s counsel, in the case, might well say, that by the signature, the defendant <em>contracted for no given sum; </em>that notes, without sum or date, were waste paper, and might insist, that the declaration, which alleged a pre-existing note, made previous to the endorsement, was at war with the facts of the case. <em>Lord Mansfield </em>however held, that it was a clear case, in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">In the suits upon notes, or bills, payable to a fictitious payee, or order, it was strenuously argued, that the <em>Law Merchant, </em>forbade notes payable <em>to order, </em>to be treated as notes payable <em>to hearer. </em>The court however, decided, that if the rules of law prevented the instrument from operating, according to the words used therein, it may be slated in such a manner, that the law will give effect to them. The intention of the parlies is to be considered, and effect is to be given to that intention, if no rule of law is thereby violated. In this case, we must not doubt, for the defendant below admitted to the witness, and the jury have, by their verdict found, that the defendant in the court below agreed for a valuable consideration, to become, and by endorsing them, designed to become security for the money expressed in each instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">It appears by the bill of exceptions, that the jury were put in possession of acknowledgments by <em>Gist, </em>(the defendant below,) that he and <em>Keener, </em>were to raise money for the <em>Eutaw Company; </em>and of his further acknowledgments, that in consideration of his, <em>(Gist,) </em>endorsing the bills, the <em>Company </em>agreed to give him credit upon the claims, which it had against him, (he being at the time, the debtor of the <em>Company;) </em>that he endorsed the bills in fulfilment of said agreement, and upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>the bills so endorsed, money was raised. By the terms of'the contract, then, between the <em>Company </em>and <em>Gist, </em>(for which the latter received a valuable and ample consideration,) he wa3 bound to become security for the payment of those bills of the <em>Eutavj Company, </em>and this, before any person was the owner of them; and moreover, that he was to become such security, by the endorsement of, (or writing his name on) them. Surely upon such testimony, (which the jury were to believe,) the appellee was entitled <em>ex cequo et bono, </em>to demand of the defendant below, the amount of notes, the payment of which, to the holders of them, was to be secured by his endorsement, and the amount of which, was to remain in his own hands, in order to save him from any possible loss. The man who becomes a party to such a contract, for such a purpose, and for such a consideration, is forbidden, by every thing like reason and justice, to deny, that the appellee became the owner of the bills at his special instance, and because of his undertaking to pay the holder of them their amount, if default was made by the makers of them. Surely, of such a transaction it may be said, as was said by <em>Baron Hotham, </em>in <em>1st H. Blac. Reports, </em>584, \u201cunless some <em>stubborn </em>rule of law stand in the way of the present judgment, it ought to be supported.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Immediately following the prayer of the appellee, we read in the bill of exceptions, that \u201cthe defendant offered to the court the following prayers.\u201d These prayers, (fourteen in number,) are nearly all of them points, which might be legitimately insisted upon by the counsel, whose duty it was in the court below, or in this court, to argue, that the court ought not to give the instruction, of which we have already spoken. Upon a few of them, some remarks will be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">The fifth was properly rejected. It required the court to assume, that the parties <em>might not </em>have <em>known, </em>that single bills were not such commercial, negotiable instruments as promissory notes, or might not know, what was the liability which the defendant below assumed, when he endorsed them. The law requires us to assume, that the parties did understand the contract into which they entered, and the liability which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the defendant below assumed. It would have been improper to authorise the jury, to infer from the evidence the existence of such ignorance among the parties, and if so, to instruct them that if it existed, the verdict must be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">With respect to the thirteenth, and the next point, (which may be considered in connection with it,) they seem to assume, that if the <em>Eutaw Company </em>had no authority (to be found in its charter,) to make those writings obligatory, then the defendant could not oblige himself, to pay to the holders of them, the sums of money expressed in either of them. It is thought, that it did not lie in the mouth of the defendant below, to make such an objection. He was capable of binding himself to pay the debts, if when they became due, they remained unpaid.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">In regard to the supposed speculation in cotton, the testimony (derived from the defendant below,) was, that the cotton purchased, was \u201cfor packing their machinery.\u201d By this, it can only be understood, that it was purchased to pack, in order to send away, the articles in which the <em>Company </em>was authorized by its charter to deal. For such a purpose, the <em>Company </em>was surely authorized to buy cotton upon credit as well as for cash, and might give its bonds as well as the verbal promise of any of its members, or its officers, for payment of the purchase money.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">For reasons, which have already been suggested, we think there is no error in the refusal by the court to give the other instructions, which were not given.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">There is another exception taken by the plaintiff in error, of which we will now dispose.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">A rule of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, then existing, commenced in these words. \u201cThe court will require in all cases, that the whole testimony intended to be produced by both plaintiff and defendant, shall be offered before any question of law is raised, except objections to the competency of testimony.\u201d In this case, after all the points submitted by the defendant, as well as plaintiff, had been decided by the court, the defendant offered to introduce other testimony. The plaintiff objected to its introduction, \u201cat this stage of the cause,\u201d relying on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>the rule of court above mentioned, and the court \u201crefused t\u00a9 permit the testimony, under the circumstances stated, to <em>go </em>to the jury.\u201d Was there error in this refusal, for which an appellate court ought to reverse the judgment of the court below?</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">This court has heretofore <em>(Wall vs. Wall, </em>2 <em>H. &amp; G. </em>82,) said, \u201cthere exists no discretion in an inferior court, to dispense, at pleasure, with their own rules, or to innovate upon established practice; and a party injured by such a course; has an undoubted right to seek redress in this court. Every suitor is interested in the interpretation of the rules of court,, applicable to his case; and an erroneous judgment of the county court in relation to them, may in many cases be as vitally injurious to him, as a wrongful judgment upon the law, which may govern his case.\u201d Again, in the case of <em>Dunbar vs. Conway, 11th G. J. </em>97, \u201cthis court has always regarded a legitimate rule of a court, as prescribing a law to the court. The proper office of such a rule, is to establish fixed and settled practice, to which the court is required to conform, and any error of opinion, in respect <em>to its legal effect, or to its application to a particular case, </em>will entitle the party injured to redress by appeal.35 It is believed, that the power of this court, in acting upon appeals of this description, as well as the duties of the court below, in regard to the observance of its own rules, are accurately defined in the above extracts, from its former decisions; and that a plaintiff in error, who brings such a complaint as this before us, must show that he is authorized by these former opinions of the court, to prefer such a complaint against the court below. Rules of court, adopted for the dispatch of business, and the impartial administration of justice, must be written, so that all may understand them, and when adopted, must be a law to the court, as well as to others. But it can never be a question in this court, whether a rule adopted by any inferior court, is just such a rule, as in the opinion of this court, or a majority of its members, ought to be adopted in preference to any other rule, calculated and designed to accomplish the same object.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>It cannot be alleged, that in this case, the court dispensed with its rule, or changed its practice. The question then must be, had the court power to make such a rule, and because of its existence, deprive the defendant of an opportunity of introducing testimony, at a time, when according to the rule, it was inadmissible?</p>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">It appears by the record, that the defendant below had not previously offered any testimony. This however, is unimportant, as it must be taken for granted, that he had declined to offer any, at the time when the rule of court required or permitted it to be offered. The testimony offered, if it had proved the fact for which it was offered, might have rendered wholly unnecessary a discussion of the very many points of law, upon which the defendant below, seemed to the court, to be disposed to rest his case. Why this testimony was not offered at an earlier stage of the trial, is not shown. We cannot, therefore, assume, that at the time when he ought to have submitted it, according to the rule of court, it was out of his reach, or was afterwards discovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">A court constituted as this is, would necessarily feel reluctant to entertain the question, what rules would be the best for, and therefore ought to be adopted by, the courts of any one of our judicial districts.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-7\">How long the parties shall be at liberty to introduce fresh testimony, or at what stage of the trial this privilege shall cease, it is proper that a rule of court should determine; and yet, it is not to be believed, that any rule for that purpose, which can be devised, would be equally proper for every district.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">There may be reasons, oftentimes, why either party, and especially the defendant, should be permitted to settle the law of the case, before he consumes the time of the court, in examining witnesses, whose testimony may afterwards be found to be wholly unnecessary. But, who is to be the judge of this, in any particular case? Certainly not the party himself. He may suggest this course, with his reasons for preferring it, and if the court and his adversary approve of it, none would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>say, that the observance of the rule might not be dispensed with. But ought such a course to be pursued, if the court, when the reasons for preferring it are made known, thinks, that the rule ought to be adhered to?</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">It is very much in favor of the rule under consideration, that it was adopted as a rule for city business, at least fifteen years ago, and yet, that it is now for the first time, it is believed, a subject of complaint in this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">JUDGMENT AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
