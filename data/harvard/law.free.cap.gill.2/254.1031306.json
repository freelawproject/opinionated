It is alleged, that the proceedings of the meeting held in July 1843, were void, because of the irregular proceedings of the meeting in July 1842, which it is said, disorganized the district, and suspended the powers of the taxables.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-5\">The specific irregularities alleged, are, that the trustees and clerk were elected <em>viva voce, </em>and not by ballot; and that the clerk did not give bond, as required by law. I have already, in the former case, discussed the effect of the irregularity in the manner of conducting the elections of 1842, and shown, as I trust, that it is cured by the act of 1828, chap. 169, sec. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-6\">The only effect of the irregularity, if not cured, would be to avoid all the acts of the meeting of 1842. It cannot disorganize the district, or dissolve the corporation. In 9 <em>Wendell, </em>35, <em>Reynolds vs. Moore, </em>and in 7 <em>Wendell, </em>341, <em>Ring vs. Grant, </em>it has been decided, that in an action like the present, the plaintiff cannot show an irregularity or defect in the original organization of the district. If a defect in the original organization, which shows that the district was never duly organised, cannot be relied on, for the purpose of avoiding subsequent proceedings of the district, you cannot, on any principle, admit that proceedings, in themselves regular, of a district regularly organized, shall be avoided by proof of an intermediate irregularity. The act of 1825, chap. 162, sec. 9, expressly provides, that the clerk, trustees, and collector, once duly appointed, shall continue in office until their successors shall have been elected. An irregularity or defect in the mode of conducting an election, may vitiate the whole proceeding. It cannot disorganize the district, since provision is made to supply the defect created by a failure to elect, by an election, which, by reason of its irregularity, is to be treated as no election.</p>\n<p data-order=\"94\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b277-7\">The taxables of the district, having the power of assessing taxes, and electing officers to manage their local affairs, constitute for those purposes a corporation: a corporation, not private but public, and clothed with political powers of great moment. Now, it is not true, that a political corporation, entrusted with important political functions, can be dissolved by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>an irregularity in its proceedings, or in the succession of its officers or members. As a general rule, the acts of a person claiming to be invested with a particular office, and exercising publicly, and with general assent or acquiescence, the powers annexed to that office, must be respected. The remedy against usurpation, is to be found in the exercise of the power of <em>amotion. </em>You cannot avoid the act of the intruder; much less can you affirm, that <em>an </em>acquiescence by a corporation, in an intrusion, shall work a dissolution of the body. The commissioners of <em>Anne Arundel </em>county constitute a corporation. The law provides for a continued succession of its members, and I grant, for the purpose of the argument, that an election irregularly conducted, would not clothe the persons elected with the legal character of corporators. Yet, if the persons claiming to be the commissioners under such irregular election, were permitted to assume the office of commissioners; to possess themselves of the records of the corporation; to adjust the county expenses and impose a tax, and to appoint a collector and other local officers, could it be safely affirmed, that those proceedings were simply void, that the collector could not enforce the collection of the tax? that the killing of a constable thus appointed, whilst in discharge of the duty incident to his office, would not be murder? Will it be argued, that an irregularity in conducting the elections of commissioners in the year 1842, dissolved the corporation, and that the persons now acting as commissioners, in virtue of an election in 1843, are exercising the functions of an office which has no existence? If none of those positions can be maintained, it will be still more difficult to prove that a corporation, aggregate of an indefinite number, exercising in general meetings its most important functions, can be dissolved by a failure to elect, or mere irregularity in electing an executive officer. The consequence of maintaining the judgment of the county court, in this case, will he, that every one who is not inclined to pay his State or county taxes, will attain his object, by examining into the proceedings of the commissioners for some five years past. None of them, it is apprehended, will endure a severe scrutiny. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>is impossible to adopt any legal principle in support of the proceedings of the county commissioners, which will not apply with equal force, when invoked to the aid of the proceedings of the taxables and their trustees. And, indeed, their case is placed beyond the reach of cavil by the act of 1828, chap. 169, sec. 5, which expressly commends the primary school system to the protection of our courts of judicature, and declares, that no proceedings of the taxables or of the trustees, shall be set aside, or adjudged to be void for defect of form, or any irregularity therein, so as the requisitions of the acts are substantially complied with. The informal or irregular proceeding is to be sustained; and yet it is to be argued, that such informality or irregularity shall work a dissolution!</p>\n<p data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-5\">This act avoids all consequences of an irregular or informal proceeding, and therefore would repeal any inconsistent provision, which existed in the previous act of 1825, chap. 162. But in fact no inconsistency is to be discovered. Section eight of this last act, provides for the original organization of the district, and for the failure to organize after meeting, by an adjournment without day, or from any other cause. It cannot apply as a perpetual provision. After the first, or other meeting, has appointed a day for holding future annual meetings, there can be no adjournment without day, in the sense of the section. After one election, duly conducted, the offices will remain filled; and provision is made for other meetings, at which the omissions of the annual meetings may be supplied. If in all these important particulars, the law has so anxiously guarded against the consequences of irregularity, it is reasonable to infer, that informalities of less importance were not designed to accomplish a disorganization.</p>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b279-6\">Nor is it unworthy of notice, that the effect of the irregularity is expressly submitted by the law to the judgment of the commissioners, and they are the exclusive judges of every question arising under the provisions of that section. If in their opinion, the district has from any cause been dissolved, they arc to convene another. Can any court of justice or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>jurisdiction, in opposition to their judgment, determine tbafl the first meeting was not dissolved, and sustain the proceedings of, and officers appointed by the first meeting, against the proceedings of, and officers appointed by the second meeting? If the commissioners should determine that the meeting was not dissolved, and refuse to convene another, could a court of justice reverse that judgment, and annul the proceedings of the first meeting? And what would be the consequences of such judgment of reversal? The district would be deprived of its school, and of its capacity to organize another, since the initiatory proceeding must be taken by the commissioners. We are brought, then, to this alternative; the section commented on must refer to an original meeting exclusively; or the question of dissolution, by the irregularity <em>of </em>a subsequent meeting, must be referred to the jurisdiction of the commissioners ? Either alternative may be adopted by our adversaries, since it is to be inferred from the record, that the commissioners treat this as a regularly organised district.</p>\n<p data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b280-5\">The failure of the clerk, appointed in 1842, to give bond, could not work a dissolution, The giving of bond is essential to his due qualification. But a vacancy in the office of clerk, does not disorganize a district. Neither is such effect produced by a failure, on the part of the taxables, to elect a clerk by ballot. Provision is made by the law for the continuance in office, of the officer once inducted, until the regular appointment of his successor. We have shown the case of a clerk, duly elected and inducted, and entitled, because of the irregularity in a recent election, to hold over, and yet yielding his office to another, who claims under such recent election, which by reason of such irregularity \u25a0 may be avoided. All the cases shew, that the acts of such usurping clerk, exercising the functions of clerk with the assent of the person lawfully invested with that office, and with public approbation, must be respected as if he had been legally inducted into office. 9 <em>Wendell, </em>17, <em>McCoy vs. Cartier. </em>7 <em>Wendell, </em>341, <em>Ring vs. Grant. </em>5 <em>Wendell, </em>231, <em>Wilcox vs. Smith.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"98\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>The record admits, that the persons giving notice of the meeting of 1843, was elected (though the argument concedes irregularly,) clerk by the meeting of 1842; that he acted as clerk, from his election up to the time of meeting in 1843, without objection to his authority as such. Upon those cases and those admissions, I insist, that the notice in pursuance of which the meeting of 1843 was convened, is to be treated as given by the duly qualified clerk. I deny next the necessity for any notice of an annual meeting. The time of holding the annual meeting is fixed by the taxables, and all persons are bound to take notice of that day. The law requiring the clerk to give notice of such meeting, is directory merely. I think this may safely be inferred from section 10, and proviso to section 8 of the act of 1825, chap. 162. But this point was discussed in the former case, and is therefore to be rested on that discussion.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b281-5\">3. Assuming then that the district remained organized, and that the clerk elected in 1842, notwithstanding the irregularities existing in his election and qualification, was right in giving notice of the meeting of 1843, it is next to be shewn, that the form of the notice was sufficient for its purpose. One would suppose, that if defect in form could be tolerated in any proceeding whatever, it ought to be in the form of notice. No form is prescribed by the law. The act of 1825, chap. 162, see. 10, simply requires that notice shall be given of the time and place of meeting. A designation of time and place is essential to the notice. Every thing else is surplussage. Does a notice then, that the meeting will be held for the purpose of voting a tax \u201cfor the support of the school for the ensuing year,\u201d or for any other specific purpose, restrain the meeting from transacting any business, which might have been transacted at a meeting convened after a more general notice? By no means. It might possibly be argued, that where a special meeting is called by the trustees, for a particular purpose, it should transact no other business than such as occasioned its call. But an annual meeting does not derive its authority &gt;o convene, from the order of the trustees or notice of the clerk. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>Provision is made for the annual meetings by the law, which also enumerates the powers which such meetings may exercise. It may safely be affirmed, that the authority of an annual meeting to entertain and vote on any particular subject, is not to be restrained by the notice of the clerk. Else may the clerk defeat any purpose of the law. Pie might omit to state in his notice that officers were to be elected; and then it might be argued, that the corporation would be dissolved. He might omit all notice of the tax proposed to be assessed, and then no tax could be laid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b282-5\">4. The tax, it is said, is retrospective in its objects, and not prospective; is not with the provision of the acts, but for purposes not prescribed by them. The specific objection, as is more specially stated in the third point, is, that the tax was imposed \u201cto defray the necessary expenses of the district during the past and for the present year.\u201d What items are included under the head of \u201cnecessary expenses,\u201d do not appear, and consequently it cannot appear that the taxables have provided for any expenditure which it is not right to provide for. We are to assume then, that they are proper in their character, and the only question can be, whether the taxables can raise by taxation, a fund for payment of liabilities which they have previously incurred ? In discussing this question it is tobe assumed, that the law designed to confer on the taxables the authority to raise the sums, necessary to defray the expenses which they might incur in the exercise of their powers. And that they may, occasionally experience the very casualties which sometimes intervene to embarrass other public bodies and individuals. They may vote a tax of $500 to build a school house, which may in fact cost them $1,000. Would you debar them of the power of providing for payment of the additional' expense? Their proceedings in assessing a tax may be void, and may not be so adjudged until after the expenses which it was designed to meet have been incurred. Would you say that those expenses should remain a charge and incumbrance on the district, until a special act of the legislature should enable them to provide for its discharge? A school <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>house may be erected at a necessary cost of $2,000, which the convenience of the district would require to have discharged by instalments. Would you subject the lavables to the charge for the entire amount in one year? Why would you deprive the taxables of this power of providing for payment of past expenses ? No reason can be given for subjecting the taxables to this restraint, other than that as the assessable property in the district is continually changing hands, a tax to be imposed at this present time, would reach persons who were not subject to taxation during the past year, and would not reach many who will be subject to taxation during the succeeding year. This was the argument used in the court below. It assumes, that the persons owning property at the time a debt is incurred, must defray their aliquot proportion of that debt. Bui the act of 1825, chap. 162, sec. 12, requires the tax to be imposed on all the assessable property in the district, agreeably to the assessment of the last preceding tax. Upon the hypothesis suggested, the county tax may have been laid in January, the district tax may be voted in December, to defray the expenses of the succeeding year. All this the argument assumes to be admissible. Is there any greater injustice to result from permitting the meeting in December, to assess a tax for the then preceding year? There is nothing in the act, (vide section 8,) or in the act of 1828, chap. 169, sec. 3, which requires the taxation to be prospective. The language of those acts is just as broad as is to be found in the act of 1794, chap. 5, sec. 1, which requires the justices of the levy courts to meet annually, \u201cto adjust the ordinary and necessary expenses of their several counties.\u201d Under this law, some of the levy courts adjust their expenses already incurred. Others provide only for future expenses, whilst others again provide for expenditures of particular classes already incurred, and as to others by wTay of anticipation. Will you deny to a levy court the power of providing a fund, to defray an expense which is about to be incurred ? or to provide for payment of a debt already contracted ? May not a recovery be had against a levy court, for a debt contracted by its authority? And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>would not a court compel the levy court to make a levy, for the purpose of discharging the judgment? The like law holds with regard to debts contracted by school trustees, and recoveries had against them. To say that the property in the district may have changed hands since the debt was incurred, begs the question. The alienation was made <em>cum onere. </em>The practical inconvenience of assessing, or attempting to assess a debt in due proportions on the persons taxable, at the moment the debt was contracted, would be extreme. The debts increase day by day. The alienations are daily made. But the spirit of our institutions require that the tax-gatherer should be seen once only in the year. The 13th section of the Declaration of Rights expressly declares, that every \u201cperson in the State ought to contribute his proportion of public taxes for the support of government, according to his actual worth.\u201d Here the charge is literally on the persons. But no one has yet ventured to deny the right of the legislature, to provide for future exigencies, or to supply the deficiencies created by the omissions of past legislatures. Can we charge the next generation with the debt we have created for works of internal improvements ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-5\">5. That the tax was not laid at an annual meeting. The answers to this objection are: 1. There is nothing in the law which requires the tax to be imposed at an annual meeting. 2. The notice states that an \u201cannual meeting\u201d will be held, and it is agreed, that the meeting purported and claimed to be an annual meeting. From these and the other facts admitted, it is fairly to be inferred, that the meeting was an annual meeting.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b284-8\">6. That two taxes have been laid in the same year for the same purpose. This is not true in point of fact. One tax was laid at the 12th annual meeting, held on the 30th July, (being the last Saturday,) 1842, the other at the 13th annual meeting, held on the 29th July, (being the last Saturday,) 1843. The first tax was voted to defray the liabilities then incurred and contemplated. The decision of the <em>Howard District </em>court was adverse to the right of the trustees to collect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>that tax. in deference to the judgment of the court, the laxables suspended the collection of the tax, and assessed another lax, out of which they proposed to discharge the liabilities which were intended to he met by the first tax. There are not two taxes imposed for the same purpose. The last vote annuls the former vote, and all that can be collected is the last tax assessed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-5\">7. That the tax last voted, was not raised in due proportion on all the taxable property in the district. The tax list made out is regular on its face, and there is nothing to show that it is not correct in every particular. The only pretext for this objection is, that by the third resolution, \u201cevery taxable who shall have paid the sum assessed to him by the resolution, passed on the 30th July .1842, shall be entitled to retain the sum, so paid by him out of the tax, which he may be liable to pay under the preceding resolutions.\u201d So far from inducing inequality, its adoption was essential to produce equality in contribution by the taxables. if partial collections of the tax of 1842 had been made, it would have been unjust to exact from those who made the payments, the entire amount of the taxes assessed by the resolutions of 1843. The further collections of the tax of 1842 being suspended, and the tax of 1843 being thereby necessarily increased, nothing was more just or equal than that the monies paid on account of the tax of 1842, should be refunded, or the taxable permitted to retain the amount out of the taxes chargeable to him in 1843.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-6\">8. That the property of the appellee has been taken in execution, for a part of the sum now demanded. This is untrue in point of fact. The property was taken by the collector of 1842; but was replevied by the appellee, and the judgment in that action was in his favor. The appeal now pending, does not affect in any manner that judgment or its consequences. If it should be affirmed, then there would be no ground for the objection; if it should be reversed, the appellee would be entitled to discount the amount assessed to him in 1842, from the sum claimed from him under the proceedings of 1843.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b285-7\">9. That the collector has not duly qualified according to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>law. This objection does not deny the due election of the collector; and indeed, this fact could not be denied, since his election is expressly affirmed in the record of the proceedings of the meeting. His qualification is alone at issue. His bond (the giving of which constitutes his qualification,) is set out in the record, and it is admitted, that it was accepted and approved by the trustees. It is impossible for me to discover any ground for this objection.</p>\n<p data-order=\"106\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-5\">In the argument of the former case, I insisted, that the proceeding adopted in the case assumed, that the defendant was legally appointed and qualified as collector. I rely on that argument in opposition to this objection now taken.</p>\n<p data-order=\"107\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-6\">10.' That the person assuming to act as clerk was ineligible, having been previously elected trustee, and acted as such. That he could not act in both capacities, and the proceedings shew, that he acted as trustee and not'as clerk. This objection is but a variation of the third objection: \u201cThe clerk of</p>\n<p data-order=\"108\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-7\">1842 was also elected a trustee. He could not act in both capacities. He acted as trustee, and therefore was not clerk.\u201d That he did act as clerk, is clear from the notice under which the meeting of 1843 was held. And it is distinctly admitted, that he continued to act as clerk down to the meeting of 1843. He acted likewise as trustee; but this did not vitiate his acts as clerk. There is no incompatibility between the offices of clerk and trustee. 16 <em>Johns. </em>135; and if there was, he was clerk <em>defacto, </em>and I have already shown, that as clerk <em>defacto, </em>his notice was to be respected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"109\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b286-8\">Having thus answered all the objections taken on the record, to the authority of the appellant, to enforce payment of the tax laid in 1843, I presume to ask a reversal of the judgment of the court below.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"110\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b286-9\">By R.

The resolutions attached to the tax list in paper A, show, that the retrospective tax was designed to operate only on the appellee, and those who like him, had refused to pay the tax imposed in 1842, the regularity and constitutionality of which, as regards the appellee, was then \u201csub <em>judice\u201d </em>in this court. This was directly opposed to the 12th section ol the act of 1825, chap. 162, which provides, (hat if the sum payable by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>any person named in such tax list, shall not be paid or collected within the time limited, \u201cit shall be lawful to renew such warrant,\u201d not to double the tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"127\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-5\">The legality of the tax in 1842, being then pending, by appeal, in this court, if the same should be pronounced legal, the appellee must be twice mulcted for one year\u2019s tax; or if the same should be declared illegal, the appellee must pay the same, notwithstanding the court\u2019s decision against it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"128\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-6\">It is further insisted by the appellee, that the election of officers, held in 1842, being made <em>viva voce, </em>and not by ballot, as required by the act of 1825, chap. 162, the primary school district, No. 30, was disorganised, and those officers illegally elected, could do no act for the continuation of the corporation, but the duty of re-organization devolved upon the commissioners of primary schools, as prescribed by said act in such cases, who did not, as is admitted by the appellant, form or organize any district meeting of the taxables of said district subsequently.</p>\n<p data-order=\"129\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-7\">2nd. The appellee should recover, because the acts of 1825, chap. 162, and its supplements, are unconstitutional and void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"130\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-8\">The original act, sec. 29, 30, provides, that if the majority of the voters of any county should be in favor of the establishment of primary schools, as therein provided for, then and in that case, the said act should be valid for such county or counties, otherwise of no effect whatever; and if a majority of the voters of any county in this State should be against the establishment of primary schools, then and in that case the said act should be void.</p>\n<p data-order=\"131\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-9\">This reference to the people of the counties, for the obligation or sanction of a law, is no where warranted by the constitution. It sprung either from a desire to avoid the responsibility of legislation, or a mistaken application of that clause of the constitution, which requires an amendment of the constitution to be passed by two successive legislatures.

Because of this, it is contended that the said district is disorganised, and the power of the taxables suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-11\">It appears by the case stated, that a notice of the meeting, which was to take place July 15th, 1843, \u201cfor the purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>electing officers and voting a tax on the assessable property of the district, for the support of the school for the ensuing year,\u201d was signed <em>\u201cGeorge L. Stockett, clerk.'\u201d </em>The meeting took place, and to the proceedings of that meeting, in the election of officers for the ensuing year, no objection is taken ; but the incurable error consisted, in the election of those, of the previous year.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">The minutes of the proceedings of that meeting which constitute a part of the case stated, tell us, that <em>George L. Stockett, </em>was nominated, and elected <em>unanimously: </em>and surely, from this entry we are not bound to infer, that he was elected illegally? This entry, at all events, must be one of \u201cthe matters of form,\u201d which the <em>Act of </em>1828, <em>ch. </em>69, requires us to disregard.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">According to the reasoning of the counsel for the defendant in error, the election must be pronounced to be void, unless the minutes state every thing to have been done, which the law requires to be done. The law says, that the election must be by ballot; and therefore, and in order to be valid, it is not only necessary that the election should be by ballot, but the omission to state on the minutes that it was by ballot, vitiates an election, to which no other exception can be taken. It will not be denied, that in some of the old cases, to which we are referred by the counsel, expressions may be found attributed to the court, which would seem to justify this reasoning. Those expressions are generally to be found in cases, where, by their own showing, the acts done were contrary to law, and seem to have been used without reflecting, that as they might be understood, they would take from us much valuable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">The election does not appear to have been by ballot; and moreover, it does not appear that the clerk gave bond, as the act of 1825 requires. Now these objections, which are designed to take from the clerk his office, are urged in a suit to which the clerk is no party. See 7 <em>Sargeant </em>&amp; <em>Rawle., </em>392. Besides, the act of 1825, ch. 162, sect. 9, provides, that the clerks, &amp;c., of each district, shall hold their office until the next annual meeting, and a new election shall be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>Now, we find, that <em>George L. Stockett </em>was in the office, acting as clerk, in July 1842; and are we, in this suit, to which he was no party, and grounding our opinion upon this statement, to determine, that he was not legally in the office, the duties of which he was discharging ?</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">In the case of corporations it is considered, that the recording of an official bond is not essential to its validity, unless it be so expressly declared. A vote or resolution appointing an agent, need not be entered on the minutes, but may be inferred from the permission, or acceptance of his services. See <em>Angel Ames on Corporations, </em>157, and the case there referred to, of <em>Dunn, vs. Saint Andrews Church, </em>14 <em>Johnson\u2019s Reports, </em>118. The authority continues, \u201cwe need hardly add, that if m such case the agent is held to be duly appointed, as between the corporation and himself, <em>a fortiori, </em>he would be, as between the corporation and third persons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">\u201cPersons acting publicly, as officers of a corporation, are presumed to be rightfully in office; acts done by a corporation, which presuppose the existence of other acts, to make them legally operative, are presumptive proofs of the latter; and although the charter or act of incorporation prescribes the mode in which its officers shall be elected, and an election contrary to it, would unquestionably be <em>voidable, </em>yet if the officer has come in under <em>color </em>of right, and <em>not in open contempt of all rights </em>whatever, he is an officer <em>de facto, fyc.\u201d </em>See <em>Angel and Ames, </em>158, 159.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">An act of Assembly, confers upon the mayor and aldermen of the city of Annapolis, authority to take the acknowledgment of deeds, which are designed to transfer the title to land from the grantor to the grantee. Surely a party who claims under a deed so acknowledged, is not, in order to make the deed evidence, to prove that the mayor was what he professed to be, that is, was duly elected to the office.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">It seems however to be thought, that these trustees, clerks, &amp;c., are to be regarded as special agents, deriving from the law special authority, and their acts, in order to be valid, must be proved to be, in every respect, according to the strict iettei <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>of the law; and that the law, with respect to the acts, and the inferences from the acts of corporations, are not applicable to them and their actings. The correctness of all such notions may be questioned. In the case of the&gt; inhabitants of the fourth school district, in <em>Rumford, vs. Wood, </em>13 <em>Mass. Reports, </em>193, chief justice <em>Parker </em>in delivering the opinion of the court, admits, that they, (the school districts,) are not bodies politic or corporate, <em>with the general powers of corporations; </em>and he tells us this may be said of towns and other municipal societies. He then proceeds: \u201cthey may be considered under our institutions as <em>quasi </em>corporations, with limited powers; co-extensive with the duties imposed upon them by statute or usage,\u201d and he is brought to the conclusion, that in construing their acts, a liberal view should be had to the end intended to be effected. See, also, <em>Angel and Ames on Corporations, p. </em>18.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">These authorities, in connection with the act of 1828, ch. 169, will, it is believed, justify the court in over-ruling this and other points, which were raised by the defendants counsel, in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">It is also objected, that the notice given by the clerk, declared the object of the meeting to be, \u201cfor the purpose of electing officers and voting a tax, &amp;c., for the support of the school <em>for the ensuing year.\u201d </em>To this notice the objection does not apply; but it is said, that the tax voted, was to \u201cdefray the expenses of the district; during the past and for the current year, such being the language used in voting the tax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">What are the powers of these people, when assembled in district meeting, in regard to voting taxes ? \u201cTo vote a tax on the resident inhabitants of each district, as they or a majority of such of them as may be present, as aforesaid, shall deem sufficient to purchase a suitable scite for the school house, and to build, keep in repair, and furnish such school house with necessary fuel, books, stationary, and appendages ; and to repeal, alter, regulate and modify all such proceedings, or any part thereof, from time to time, as occasion may require.\u201d And surely, in the discharge of these duties, it may be neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>sary to raise funds, in order to defray expenses already incurred, and (as required by another clause,) to \u201cpay the salaries of such teachers.\u201d The officer must give notice, and did give notice, of the time and place of meeting. What follows, cannot make the notice illegal, although it had not stated that all the business which was actually done, (such as acting upon claims, directing the payment of them, &amp;e.,) would be done. It may also be observed, that between the notice and the vote, there is not that difference which is suggested. The tax to be voted, is to pay what is then due, and what it is known will be due in the course of the year: and provision for the payment of what is already due, and what in the course of the year is to become due, is made by voting a tax for the support of the school; that is, to pay debts which, no matter when contracted, are payable in the course of the coming year.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Perhaps it would be desirable to ascertain, at the begininng of the year, the amount of expense to be incurred in the course of that year, and provide for the prompt payment of it; but then, this is impossible, as it cannot be known what will be the amount of expenditures for repairs, books, fuel, &amp;c. They must sometimes purchase upon credit, and in order to pay for what is thus purchased, it is necessary to vote a tax, which is to defray expenses during the past, as wrell as the ensuing year; and this may, with strict propriety, be said to provide for the school for the ensuing year. This too, is an answer to the fourth objection, that the tax is retrospective, and not prospective.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">We perceive nothing which warrants the objection, that the tax was not voted at the annual meeting of the taxables; nor that two taxes have been laid in the same year for the same purpose; nor does there seem to be any foundation for the objection, that the sum voted as the tax, was not raised in due proportion on all the taxable property.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">As to the eighth objection, it appears that the seizure there spoken of, (if in this case it can be noticed at all,) was illegal, and for that tax he is not responsible. It can furnish no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>objection to the vote, that a tax of sixteen cents, be laid in the year 1843.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">The ninth objection assumes, that the collector is to be presumed not to be qualified, unless there be express proof of his qualification. He is an officer <em>de facto; </em>but if not <em>de jure </em>also, he is not in office. The defendant, himself, has sworn, (see affidavit <em>ante,) </em>that the very property for which this suit was brought, was seized by the collector, <em>Thomas Burgess, </em>for the school taxes, for the primary school district No. 30, of said district.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Of the last of the objections, which appear to have been relied on in the court below, notice has already been taken, and according to our view of such objections, this cannot be sustained. Besides this, it seems to have no foundation in law. The charter does not forbid the appointment of one of the trustees to be the clerk. It is true, that at the meeting in August 1840, it was voted, that in the opinion of the then meeting, it was incompatible in the trustees to hold another office, and perhaps, at some meeting an opinion was expressed, that the offices of trustee and clerk are incompatible; but these votes and expressions of opinion, do not <em>disqualify </em>any man.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">The objections, all of them, assume, either that the legislature had no right <em>to </em>delegate to those appointed to exercise them, the powers given to them by the act of 1825, or, that the individuals to whom those powers have been delegated, must not only conform strictly to the provisions of the law under which they act, but that the minutes of their proceedings must show all the facts which are necessary to give them jurisdiction. \u201cIt is believed, that this would not be correct, even although the law of 1828 never had been enacted. But surely the legislature had the power to pass that law, and one object of it seems to have been, to require courts, in judging of their actings and doings, to judge them by other rules than those which are sometimes adopted, in determining upon the validity of the acts of special agents, who, by the nature and terms of their authority, can do nothing which they are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>not expressly authorized to do. Much is left to the discretion and judgment of the individuals, who are to execute the law of 1825. In their judgment the law reposes, and from the nature of the trust, must repose great confidence; and it will presume every thing which it requires to be done by them, to be rightly done, until the person, who would impeach their conduct, can furnish legal and satisfactory evidence, that they have done acts not necessary to be done, in exercising the powers and discharging the duties which the law requires of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">But if for any or all of the reasons, which have been noticed, the proceedings of the clerk and other officers were to be considered illegal and void, still, it would be necessary to reverse the judgment, and order a writ of <em>procedendo; </em>because, the case stated, (whatever might have been intended by the parties,) does not authorise the court to give judgment, either for plaintiff or defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Of course, this court can give no judgment upon the statement, but reverse the judgment, with costs, and order a <em>procedendo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO AWARDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
