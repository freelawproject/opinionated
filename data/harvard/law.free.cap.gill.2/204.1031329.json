Sworn this 3rd day of February, in the year 1824, &amp;c. And on the same day, 12lh February 1824, the plaintiff sued out a writ of <em>hah. fac. pos., </em>under which, possession was given, on the 24th February 1824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-7\">And also proved the writ of possession; and further offered evidence, that the said <em>Sarah, </em>mentioned in said recovery in ejectment, intermarried before the institution of this suit, with the defendant <em>Ashton Alexander, </em>and that said <em>Sarah </em>and <em>Ash-ton, </em>have been in possession of the premises declared for in this case, ever since possession was delivered under the writ of possession, issued on said judgment in ejectment, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>September term 1823, continued t.o the fourth Monday of March 1824.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-5\">The plaintiff, further offered in evidence, that the court was not in session on the day when the affidavit, stated in the record, was filed, and when the execution issued.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-6\">The defendant offered evidence, that the terms of <em>Baltimore </em>county court have always been adjourned over from the end of one term to the beginning of another. And the defendant offered evidence to the court, by various attorneys at law, of the practice of <em>Baltimore </em>county court, as to the time of filing the affidavit, under the statute 4, <em>Geo. </em>2. The practice was stated to be, to file the affidavit at any time before suing out the w7rit of possession. The defendant, also, filed copies of the docket entries in various actions of ejectment, where judgments, nisi, had been entered.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-7\">Whereupon the plaintiffs made the following prayers to the court:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-8\">The plaintiffs pray the court to instruct the jury:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-9\">1st. That the proceedings in ejectment, given in evidence in this cause of <em>Merry-man's lessee vs. Smith, </em>do not vest any title in said <em>Merryman, </em>and are no bar to plaintiffs\u2019 right of recovery in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b218-10\">2nd. That as the defendants have produced the record of the ejectment suit between <em>Merryman's lessee </em>and <em>Walter, </em>for the lot in question in this case, and as a part of that record, the affidavit of the plaintiff\u2019s lessee in that case, dated the 3rd February 1824, and filed in court in said case on the 12th day of the same month, that then, in point of law, said affidavit was too late to make the judgment in said case conclusive against the lessee; and the lessors of the plaintiff, in the present suit, claiming the said lot under the lease from <em>Bowley </em>to <em>Ettings, </em>as a judgment in ejectment, under the statute 4, <em>George 2nd, </em>and that such affidavit having been produced by defendants, the jury are not bound to presume, that any other affidavit to obtain or justify said judgment, under said statute, was filed or made before the court rendering the said judgment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>3rd. That the judgment, <em>nisi, </em>against the casual ejector, in the ejectment referred to in the preceding prayer, became a final judgment, after the first day of the term of the court, in which the same was rendered, next succeeding the term at which said judgment was rendered, and that consequently, the said judgment became an absolute judgment, after the first day of the term of said court, which commenced in September 1823; and that the affidavit made by the lessor of the plaintiff in that suit, on the 3rd February 1824, and filed, in said suit, on the 12th of that month, was not in time to authorise such judgment, under the statute of <em>4th George 2nd, </em>so as to make the same, and the proceedings in the said case, final and conclusive upon the lessee of the lessor of the plaintiff in that case, and those claiming under the lease.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-5\">4th. And the plaintiff further prays the opinion of the court to the jury, that if they find from the evidence, that the affidavit filed in the ejectment suit aforesaid, of <em>Merry-man\u2019s lessee, </em>was not, in fact, submitted to the court by which said judgment was rendered or approved of, or seen by said court, or held by it to be sufficient under the said statute of <em>George the 2nd; </em>and if they also find, that no other affidavit in said case was made, that then said proceedings in ejectment are not conclusive upon the rights of the lessor under said statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-6\">The defendants then prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they should find, that the defendant, <em>Sarah, </em>became entitled to the reversion of the ground declared for, as stated in the testimony, and recovered possession, and took, and has ever since held possession thereof, in the year 1824, as shewn by the record of recovery, given in evidence, and that this action was instituted on the 19th day of April 1841, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-7\">The court (Magkudek and Pukviance, A.

The points, on which the decision of that court were demanded, were, that the proceedings in the ejectment referred to did not vest any title in <em>Merryman, </em>and formed no bar to the plaintiff\u2019s right to recover. Every ground, therefore, which established either of those points, we must assume to have been considered and determined by the county court. It was very properly conceded in the argument, that if these proceedings in ejectment, offered in evidence to shew title in the defendants, were not had under the statute of 4 <em>Geo. </em>2, c. 28, that the judgments therein rendered, vested no title in the defendant\u2019s wife, and formed no bar to the plaintiffs right to recover. This statute requires, that to render a judgment by default conclusive upon the rights of the tenant, and bar his future recovery of the demised premises, it shall be made appear to the court, where the said suit is depending, by affidavit, that half a years rent was due before the declaration was served, and that no sufficient distress was to be found upon the said demised premises, countervailing the arrears then due, and that the lessor or lessors in ejectment, had power to re-enter; in every such case, the lessor or lessors, in ejectment, shall recover judgment and execution, in the same manner as if the rent in arrear had been legally demanded, and a re-entry made. To give to this judgment the efficacy ascribed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>it, it must appear to this court to be a judgment rendered under the statute of 4 <em>Geo. 2; </em>or, in other words, the record must disclose such facts and circumstances, as would justify us in believing or assuming, that in rendering its judgment, the court below designed to exercise the authority conferred on it by the statute. The record, before us, discloses nothing which could warrant us in any such assumption or belief. All the proceedings in ejectment, until long after the judgment, shew it to have been an ordinary case of ejectment, (having no connexion with the statute,) the judgment in which, is conclusive upon no body. Upon what principle, then, can this court be called on, where an affidavit was filed in the case, in vacation, at a different term from that of the judgment; and more than ten months after it was rendered, and which according to the proof was never shown to the county court, to believe or assume, that its judgment was given on the affidavit thus introduced into the cause ? According to the obvious import and design of the statute of 4 <em>Geo. </em>2, c. 28, we think the affidavit should be filed before the judgment by default is entered, or some time during the term at which it was rendered; so that, before it became absolute, the court may have had an opportunity of inspecting and adopting the affidavit, as the basis of its judgment. That such is the construction of this statute in England, see <em>Adam's on Ejectment </em>159, <em>and Doe. on Dem. of Hitchings and </em>Another, <em>vs. Lewis </em>1 <em>Burr. </em>614.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">It has been contended in this case, that after the lapse o\u00ed seventeen years, during which the defendants have been in the undisturbed possession of the demised premises, this court ought to presume the filing of an affidavit pursuant to the statute. The proof in this case having so clearly disproved such filing of the affidavit, the court has no ground left for such a presumption to rest on. This case differs essentially from the case above mentioned, of 1 <em>Burr, </em>614, referred to as warranting the presumption which this court has been called on to make. There, the question arose upon a case stated, in which the proceedings and judgment in ejectment, were stated to have been \u201cunder and by virtue of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>of 4 <em>Geo. 2, c. </em>28;\u201d and that fact was strongly relied on by the court, which, after an acquiescence in the landlord\u2019s possession, under the judgment of almost twenty years, determined that it was not necessary that the landlord should have produced the affidavit on the trial, in which the proceedings in ejectment were offered as evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">We must not be understood as deciding, that to give effect and validity to the judgment of the court, in a proceeding in ejectment, under the 4 of <em>Geo. </em>2, when judgment is incidentally brought before the court, (as in this case,) as evidence of title, that it must appear upon the face of the proceedings, that all the requisitions of the statute have been complied with; that there is no error in the judgment of the county court, which upon appeal or writ of error would cause its reversal. All that we mean to decide is, that to give to a judgment by default in ejectment, under the statute of 4 <em>Geo. </em>2, the conclusiveness designed to be imputed to it by the statute, it is necessary that the affidavit should be filed or presented to the court before the judgment is rendered, or some time during the term at which it was given; so that before it became absolute, the court may have had an opportunity of inspecting and adopting the affidavit as the basis of its judgment, and that such judgment, when offered in evidence, as in this case, was sustained by such an affidavit, as satisfied the court before which it was offered in evidence, that the court by which it was rendered, intended it as a judgment under, and in virtue of the statute 4 of <em>Geo., 2, c. </em>28.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">Nor do we mean to say, that it is requisite that the affidavit should appear to have been presented to the court. If filed at the proper time, the court will be presumed to have discharged their duty in relation to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">The testimony offered on the part of the defendants, of the loose practice sometimes prevailing in the city of <em>Baltimore, </em>of filing the affidavit long after the rendering of the judgment, or as the witnesses state, at any time before the issuing of the writ of <em>habere facias possessionem, </em>can have no influence on the determination of the case before us. The construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>the statute must be the same in every part of the State; and were it otherwise, the practice referred to, is so entirely inconsistent with both the letter and spirit of the statute, that to sanction such a practice would be, <em>pro tanto, </em>to repeal the statute. We think the county court erred in refusing to grant the appellant\u2019s two next prayers; for the reasons we have stated, in the consideration of its refusal to grant his first prayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The court below, also erred, in their refusal of the appellant\u2019s fourth prayer; because, from the uncontradicted record evidence in the cause, it could not have worked injustice to the appellees, but might have operated most prejudicially to the rights of appellant. Under the opinion of this court, the proceedings and judgment in ejectment, relied on by the appellees, formed no bar to the plaintifPs recovery, and the jury were not al liberty to find the filing of any other affidavit. And yet, if that prayer had been granted, the jury would have been authorized in finding, that these proceedings in ejectment were a conclusive bar to the rights of the appellant; if they found that the affidavit, no matter at what time, had been submitted to the court, or approved of, or seen by it, or been held by it sufficient, under the said statute of <em>George </em>2nd; or if the jury found that any other affidavit had been made in the case, no matter when made, or what it might be.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">The prayers of the appellant having been rejected by the county court, the appellees prayed the court to direct the jury, that if they should find that the defendant, <em>Sarah, </em>became entitled to the reversion of the ground declared for, as slated in the testimony, and recovered possession, and took, and has ever since held possession thereof, in the year 1824, as shown by the record of recovery given in evidence, and that this action was instituted on the 19th day of April 1841, then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover: which prayer was granted, and in doing so, the county court erred, for the reasons stated by us in our examination of the courts refusal of the appellant\u2019s first prayer. It also erred for another reason. It called on the court, to submit to the finding of the jury, a faet of which there was no testimony; but which was conclusively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>disproved by the testimony of both parties. It required the court to direct the jury, that if they should find that the defendant, <em>Sarah, </em>became entitled to the reversion of the ground, declared for, &amp;c., then the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. Both the lease from <em>Daniel Bowley </em>to <em>Solomon Efting, </em>and the deed for the ground rent, and reversion from <em>Daniel Bowley </em>to <em>John Merryman, </em>under whom the defendant <em>Sarah </em>claims title, shew, that she was not entitled to the reversion of the lot of ground for which the ejectment was brought; but for a lot of different and smaller dimensions. And it is somewhat remarkable, that the alleged recovery of the lot of ground, by <em>Sarah, </em>the defendant in the action of ejectment under the statute of 4 <em>Geo. 2, c. 28, </em>was not of the lot leased, as aforesaid, by <em>Daniel Bowley, </em>and to the ground rent and reversion of which she was entitled; but of a lot of larger dimensions.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">Dissenting from the county court, in its refusals to grant all the prayers of the plaintiff, and in its granting of the defendants prayer, we reverse its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">JUDGMENT REVERSED AND PROCEDENDO ISSUED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
