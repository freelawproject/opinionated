C., and the Andrews Institute for Girls, a corporation of the State of Ohio, concerning a will made by Wallace C. Andrews, a resident of. the city, county and State of New York, who died in that city on April 7,1899. Both Mr. Andrews and his wife perished on that day in a fire in their dwelling house'in New York city. Whether husband or wife died first, is not known. She was twelve years younger than he. They had no children. The will was executed on November 12, 1891. After some special gifts, which need not be noticed, the will provides:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-7\">\u201cFourth: Upon the death of my said wife, I devise and bequeath to the corporation hereinafter directed to be formed, all the excess and residue of my estate over the sum of five hundred thousand dollars specified in the third paragraph hereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b50-8\">\u201c Fifth: I direct my executor and executrix as soon as practicable after my decease and' during the lives of my said wife and her said brother or the life of the longest liver of them, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>procur\u00e9 under the laws of the State of Ohio, an incorporation to be formed with proper powers, for the purpose of establishing an institution on the farm known as the Williams Farm,formerly owned by me and now owned by my wife, fronting on Erie street, in the town of Willoughby, Lake county; Ohio, or if said farm be for any cause not available, then on other suitable premises in the said town of Willoughby, for the free education of girls and for their support in proper cases during education, with a special viefa toward rendering them self-supporting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b51-4\">\u201cSaid institution shall contain, among others,- a-Sewing Department, \u2022 Cooking Department, Designing' Department and Departments of Phonography and Typewriting and other useful work that would afford the pupils employment in life, including such new discoveries and inventions as may be made from time to time tending to enlarge the opportunities for' useful and honorable employment for women, and-such as will aid them in obtaining honorable and independent positions in life.

Thereafter he commenced this suit in the Supreme Court of New York County, seeking a con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>struction of the will and a determination of the rights of' the Andrews Institute for Girls, the Smithsonian Institution and the heirs at law and next of kin of the deceased. The Andrews Institute for Girls, the Smithsonian Institution, Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller as Chancellor thereof, the Attorney-General of the State of New York, and the heirs and next of kin of the deceased, were made parties defendant. At a hearing in a special term of the' Supreme Court of the county of New York it was held that \u201cthe defendant, the Andrews Institute for Girls, .is entitled to the residuary estate.of the said Wallace C. Andrews, deceased, together with the income thereof which has accrued since the death of said deceased, after paying the expenses of administration,\u201d and also that the defendant, the Smithsonian Institution, has no interest in the estate of the said Wallace C. Andrews, deceased. -This decision was sustained by the Appellate Division of the First Department, and thereafter with a slight modification by the Court of Appeals of the State, which remitted the. record of the Supreme Court of New York city, where the final judgment was entered. Thereupon that judgment was brought here on a writ of error by the Smithsonian Institution and its Chancellor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b53-4\">\u25a0 The defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which was postponed until the final hearing and, the case is now before us on such final hearing and motion to dismiss.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b53-5\"><em>Mr. Frank W. Hackett </em>and <em>Mr. Edmund Wetmore </em>for plaintiffs in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-6\">The Federal question herein was properly and seasonably raised.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b53-7\">That a state court holds-that the Federal question was not raised is not conclusive. This court will look into the record and judge for itself what was the fact. ,It may find that the state court has ignored a claim of constitutional right. Such action is the 'equivalent of denying the Federal right. <em>Des Moines Nav. Co. </em>v. <em>Homestead Co., </em>123 U. S. 552; <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>Goodnow, </em>123 U. S. 540; <em>Rogers </em>v. <em>Alabama, </em>192 U. S. 230.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Our affidavit forming a part of the papers upon which the Co\u00fcrt-'of Appeals deliberated sets forth in detail the circumstances of o\u00far claiming the right in our brief as well as upon the oral argument. There can be no question that the character of the constitutional right asserted was.brought to the knowledge of the court and it is obvious that the court denied it. Although the court says that no Federal question was .raised, it .is apparent that this can be nothing more than the expression of a view entertained by the court of the facts as they had occurred. It is enough to say that even had the court failed to perceive the true character of our claim at the hearing, it was later fully explained in our affidavit, so that there would appear to be no justification for the conclusion announced by the court as to the fact of our raising a Federal question.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-4\">This eourt must judge for itself of the true nature and effect of the order relied upon. <em>Great West. Tel. Co. </em>v. <em>Purdy, </em>162 U. S. 335.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-5\">\u2022 A right may be specially set up and claimed, though not in terms stated to be a right claimed under the Constitution. <em>Tilt </em>v. <em>Kelsey, </em>207 U. S. 51.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-6\">Where the Federal question, is raised for the first time in the Supreme Co\u00fart of a State and that court takes no notice of it, in its opinion, if this court sees that the question was- in fact raised, it will take jurisdiction. <em>Arrowsmith </em>v. <em>Harmoning, </em>118 U. S. 194.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-7\">. The settled practice of this court is to look into the record in order to ascertain whether in fact there was presented to the State court a claim of a constitutional right. <em>McCullough </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>172 U. S. 117.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-8\">.' The benefit of claiming the protection of the Constitution is not dependent upon an adherence to technical form. It is sufficient if it appear from the record that the right was especially set up or claimed in such a manner as to bring it to the attention of the court. <em>Chicago &amp; Burlington R. R. </em>v. <em>Chicago, </em>166 U. S. 231; <em>Mo., Kan. &amp;c. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>184 U. S. 534.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b54-9\">The New York Court of Appeals denied a right claimed by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>the Smithsonian Institution under the Constitution of the United States. It gave no faith and credit to the prohibition in the Ohio constitution against passing special act\u00e1 conferring corporate powers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-4\">Had the Court of Appeals heeded that prohibition it must necessarily have found that the gift to the Andrews Institute had failed for illegality and by the operation of the alternative bequest, went to the Smithsonian Institution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-5\">That court sustained the constitutionality of the act of 1902 against the objection of plaintiffs in .error that it fixed an arbitrary standard in order to suit this Andrews will. The Federal question was raised upon a further and different poini; as follows :</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-6\">' The testator required certain restrictions to go into the charter. Plaintiffs in error contended that the Andrews Institute as now incorporated is not the incorporation the testator intended, because these restrictions are not in the charter. Anticipating a holding that the effect of copying the will into the articles was to give efficacy to such restrictions, plaintiffs in error contended that if the court should so hold it would convert the act into a special act conferring corporate powers. The court did so hold without paying attention to the Ohio constitution and thus denied full faith and credit to that constitution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-7\"><em>Mr. James W. Hawes, Mr. Virgil P. Kline </em>and <em>Mr. Harold Nathan </em>for defendants in error. <em>Mr. Hawes </em>for defendant in error St. John:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b55-8\">Where the record discloses that if a question has been raised and decided adversely\u2019to a party claiming the benefit of a provision of the Constitution or laws of the United States&gt; another question, not Federal, has also been raised and decided against such party, and the decision of the latter question is sufficient, notwithstanding the Federal question, to sustain judgment, this Court will not review the judgment. <em>Jenkins </em>v. <em>Loewenthal, </em>110 U. S. 222; <em>Crescent City Co. </em>v. <em>Butcher\u2019s Union, </em>120 U. S. 141, 156, 157; <em>Eustis </em>v. <em>Bolles, </em>150 U.

S. 226, 233.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-4\">Assuming that a Federal question was involved in this case, no Federal question was raised b.y plaintiffs in error prior to theirmotion for a reargumeiit; and as the Federal question was not considered and acted upon by the Court of Appeals upon that motion, the raising of the Federal question came too late. <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Ferrum Mining Co., </em>197 U. S. 343; <em>Disconto Gesellschaft </em>v. <em>Umbreit, </em>208 U. S. 570; <em>Paraiso </em>v. <em>United States, </em>207 U. S. 368; <em>Harding </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>196 U. S. 78, 84.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-5\">No Federal question is involved in this case.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-6\">The courts of New York nowhere denied or questioned the validity of the constitutional provision of Ohio, but recognized its existence and force in their opinions, admitted it in evidence and expressly found it as a matter of fact.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-7\">. It is only when the power to enact a statute, as it is by its terms or is made to read by construction, is fairly open to denial and denied, that the validity of such statute is drawn in question. <em>Balt. &amp; Pot. R. R. Co. </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em>130 U. S. 210, 224; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Lynch, </em>137 U. S., 280, 285.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b56-8\">, When in the courts of a State the validity of a statute of another State is not drawn in question, but only its construction, no Fed\u00e9ral question arises. <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Alleghany Co., </em>196 U. S. 458; <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Garth, </em>147 U. S. 360. See also: <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>New York Life Ins. Co., </em>187 U. S. 491; <em>Hamblin </em>v. <em>Western Land Co., </em>147 U.

Andrews <em>et al.; </em>by <em>Mr. Henry M. Earle </em>in behalf of defendant in \u00e9rror Edith A. Logan; by <em>Mr. Virgil P. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number><em>Kline, Mr. Henry Wollman </em>and <em>Mr. Sheldon H.

O\u2019Malley, </em>who succeeded <em>Mr. Jackson'&amp;s </em>Attoney-General of the State of New York, also filed a brief herein.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b50-9\"> In this case the New York cohrt held: Whether- an act general in form:is a mere device to evade a wholesome constitutional provision [against special acts conferring corporate powers], is largely dependent upon the special circumstances. If the act relates to persons and things as a class, and is neither local nor temporary, the mere fact that its practical effect is special and private does not necessarily prove that it violates constitutional provisions against special legislation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"Ax\">Mr. Justice Brewer,</author>\n<p id=\"ARn\">after making the . foregoing statement; delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"AxY\">. It is difficult to spell- out from the record in. this case .the .decision of any, question, arising under the Constitution and laws Of the United States. Neither in the pleadings nor in. the opinions is there, a direct reference to any special provision of the Federal Constitution. It is true that, after the decision by the Court of Appeals an affidavit was filed by one of the \u25a0counsel for plaintiffs 'in error in support of a.petition for a rehearing, stating that in the brief, as well as upon the oral argument in that court, a Federal question (describing it) had been presented and discussed; which petition was denied' , by the Court of Appeals in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">\u201cOrdered, that the said-motion be and the same hereby is denied, with ten dollars costs, no Federal question having been raised in this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AH\">It is unnecessary to determine, whether this of itself is suf- \u2022 ficient to give jurisdiction to this court. The language of the Court of Appeals may be construed as denying that any siich matter was brought to its attention as stated in the affidavit, oras holding that it presented no Federal-question. <em>Mallett </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>181 U. S. 589; <em>M., K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. </em>v. <em>Elliott, </em>184 U. S. 530; <em>Leigh </em>v. <em>Green, </em>193 U. S. 79; <em>McKay </em>v. <em>KalytOn, </em>204 U. S. 458.</p>\n<p id=\"A-\">- Cqunsel further contend that there was necessarily involved in' the decision of the- case the determination of a question arising under the Constitution and laws of the United States, and that hence this court has jurisdiction- of this writ of error, even if the question was not formally referred to by counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>or the state courts. Chapman v. <em>Goodnow, </em>123 U. S. 540-548; <em>Navigation Company </em>v. <em>Homestead Company, </em>123 U. S. 552; <em>McCullough </em>v. <em>Virginia, </em>172 U.

S. 226, 230, in which last case it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-4\">\u2022 <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201c It is a necessary and well-settled rule that the exercise of jurisdiction' by this court to protect constitutional rights cannot be declined when it is plain that the fair result of a decision is to deny the rights. . . . There can be no doubt-that if full faith and credit were denied to a judgment rendered in another State upon a suggestion of want of jurisdiction, without evidence' to warrant the finding, this court would enforce. the constitutional requirement. See <em>German Savings Society </em>v. <em>Dormitzer, ante, </em>p. 125.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The question upon which counsel rely arises upon Article IV, \u00a7 1, of-the Federal Constitution, which reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">\u201cFull faith and credit: shall be given in each State to the. public acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State. And the Congress may by general laws prescribe the manner in which such acts, records and proceedings shall be proved, and the effect thereof.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">It is not pretended that any judgment of the State of Ohio was disregarded by the courts of New York, but it is contended that full force and effect was not given to the constitution of the State- of Ohio. This duty is as obligatory as the similar duty in respect to the judicial proceedings .of that State. <em>Town of South Ottawa </em>v. <em>Perkins, </em>94 U. S. 260, 268; <em>Chicago &amp; Alton Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Wiggins Ferry Company, </em>119 U. S. 615, 622, in which Mr. Chief Justice Waite said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">\u201cWithout doubt the constitutional requirement, art. IV, sec. 1, that \u2018 full faith and. credit shall be given in each State to the publics acts, records, and judicial proceedings of every other State/ implies, .that the public-acts of every State \u00e1hall be given the same effect by the courts of another Statq that they have by law and usage at home. This is clearly Ijhe logical result of the'principles announced'as early as 1813 in <em>Mills </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>v. <em>Duryee, 7 </em>Cranch, 481, and steadily adhered to Aver since.\u201d <em>Hancock National Bank </em>v. <em>Farnum, </em>176 U. S. 640, 642.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">On the other hand, it is settled that th\u2019e'mere construction by &gt;a state court of the statute of another State,. without questioning its validity, does not deny to it the full faith and credit demanded by the constitutional provision. <em>Glenn </em>v. <em>Garth, </em>147 U. S. 360; <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Matthews, </em>155 U. S. 222; <em>Banholzer </em>v. <em>New York Life Insurance Company, </em>178 U. S. 402; <em>Johnson v. New York Life Insurance Company, </em>187 U.

Sections 1 and 2 of article .13 of the Ohio constitution read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">\u201cSec. 1.

After the death of the testator, and.on March 19, 1902, the \u25a0general assembly of the State of Ohio passed .an act (Laws 1902,\u2019 p.-61), the first section of which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AhCa\">\u201cSec. 1: Whenever, by the last will and testament of any person which has heretofore been-, or shall hereafter be, duly \u25a0 admitted\u2019to probate in this State or elsewher\u00e9, any decedent has devised or bequeathed, or may devise\u2019 or bequeath, his or her property,\u2019 or any portion thereof, for charitable uses within this State, or for the establishment and maintenance of any industrial or-educational sc\u2019hooLor institution\u2019to be located at any place within this State; and whenever, in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>such will and testament it has been, or may be, provided that the executor or executors thereof shall organize a corporation under th\u00e9 laws of this State for the purpose of receiving the property so devised or bequeathed, and carrying out the charitable purposes in such will expressed,' or establishing and maintaining the institution or school therein provided for, and such will further provides for the management of such corporation by a board of trustees or directors, consisting, in part, of officials of this State, of the county in which such charities are to be administered or such institution or school located, the officials of. any municipal incorporation in said county, and the member of Congress for the district of which said county forms a part, or any \u00f3f such officials, and names any other person or persons to be associated with said officials or any of them, and provides for the appointment of a successor or successors to the person or persons so appointed to act with such officials in any manner specified in said will, such executor or executors, or his or their successors in office, and the persons hereinafter named, may constitute themselves a body corporate, with' the general powers of benevolent incorporations.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">The second section requires that a copy of the will or testament, for the carrying out of the provisions of which the porpor\u00e1tion is organized, shall be set forth in the articles of incorporation: Thereafter the Andrews Institute for Girls was incorporated, containing, as required by, \u00a7 2, the will-of the testator. N.ow it is contended by counsel for the plaintiffs in error that this act was a special act conferring corporate powers, and that therefore it and the incorporation made under it was in. conflict with the constitution of Ohio. It is not suggested that there has been any deeisi\u00f3n of the courts of Ohio in reference to the validity of the act or subsequent incorporation of the .Andrews Institute, but it is insisted that it is so obvious that the act is a special act conferring corporate powers, inasmuch as the terms of the will of-an individual are th\u00e9\u2018 basis of the act and the incorporation that the courts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>New York could not have given force and effect to the pro-* hibitions of the constitution of Ohio. Nevertheless, whether rightly or wrongly, the New York courts held that there was no violation'of the constitution of Ohio, the Court of Appeals saying in its opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-5\">\u25a0 \u201cAt the death of the testator the general statutes of Ohio-provided that corporations might be formed for any purpose for which individuals might lawfully associate themselves, except for carrying on professional busiriess. 2 Bates\u2019s Ann.

It is not an uncommon thing in any State for ques-' tions to arise making it desirable or perhaps necessary for further general legislation to enable persons interested to carry out desired and desirable measures. The fact that such further general statute is passed to aid a particular person for the time being does, not make the act a special, - as distinguished from a general One.. Whether an act, general in form, is a mere device to evade a wholesome constitutional provisi\u00f3n is largely dependent upon the special circumstances of each case.' If the afct relates to persons, places and things as a class, and is neither local nor temporary, the mere fact that its practical effect is special' and private does not necessarily prove that it violates constitutional provisions against speciaLlegislation. <em>Matter of N.
