Notwithstanding the fact that the deferred purchase money notes are barred by the statute, the vendor may still retake the land if the notes are unpaid; but this right is one personal to himself, and does not pass to an assignee or endorsee of the notes. <em>Elliott </em>v. <em>Blanc, </em>54 Texas, 216, 218; <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>60 Texas, 217; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Matthews\u2019 Heirs, </em>69 Texas, 341-344.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b192-6\">The identical proposition relied upon by the petitioners in this case is recognized in <em>Ewell </em>v. <em>Daggs, </em>108 U.

A court of equity can decree that a' lien which otherwise would be merged or extinguished, shall not be, or that what would ordinarily amount to payment shall not have this effect. The provision for the sale of the notes and interest coupons by the receiver shows beyond controversy that the court was of opinion there was something to sell.

It is not merely security for notes that may be given'for the consideration, but is for the debt of which the notes were evidence. The lien is not affected by taking a new note, for that is but a change of the evidence, and not a payment of the debt. See <em>De Cordova </em>v. <em>Hood, </em>17 Wall. 1, holding that, in Texas, an assignment of the notes given for purchase money carries with it the vendor\u2019s lien to the assignee. See also <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>23 Wall. 119.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b193-11\">Federal courts adopt state statutes of limitation, as such, only so far as they regulate remedies on the common-law side of the court. They do not-follow a state statute of limitations when thereby manifest wrong and injustice would be wrought. 1 Foster\u2019s Fed. Practice (3d ed.), 15, 16, citing <em>Fogg </em>v. <em>St. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number><em>Louis, H. &amp; K. R. Co., </em>17 Fed.

S. 130, citing <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Hook, </em>7 Wall. 430, holding that if legal remedies are sometimes modified to suit the changes in the laws of the States, and the practice of their courts, it is not so with equitable. In his note on this case, Rose, in demonstrating that \u201cFederal courts\u2019 equity jurisdiction is not subject to limitation by States,\u201d cites <em>Burdon Central Co. </em>v. <em>Ferris Mfg. Co., </em>78 Fed. Rep. 422, where, under facts, equitable lien was allowed, although laws of State in which court was sitting would give no lien; <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Sanford, </em>65 Fed. Rep. 157; <em>S. </em>C. 28 U. S. App. 313, and <em>Brown </em>v. <em>French, </em>80 Fed. Rep. 169, reaffirming the rule. See also <em>Slide &amp; Spur Gold Mines </em>v. <em>Seymour, </em>153 U. S. 517, holding that such a lien is one which appeals strongly to the favorable consideration of a court of equity, and <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Shropshire, </em>147 U. S. 133. To the enforcement of this purely equitable right, over which a court of law cannot have concurrent jurisdiction, the'statute qf limitations can never be. applied. The only question involved is one of laches.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b194-4\">Me. Justice Holmes</author>\n<p id=\"ATn\">delivered the opinion of the \"court.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">This is a bill brought by the petitioner to quiet title to a lot of land nr Waco, Texas: A cross-bill was filed bj^ the <em>respondent </em>to establish and foreclose a vendor\u2019s lien and mortgage upon the same land. The facts, so far as necessary to a decision, are thes\u00e9. One Bailey convey\u00e9d one undivided half of the land in question to William E. Dupree, partly in consideration of five notes, for nine- hundred dollars each, maturing in one, two, three, four and five years respectively, from December 31,1894, the date of the conveyance. By the words of the deed, \u201cthe vendor\u2019s lien is hereby reserved on the said property to secure the above described notes.\u201d On the same date Dupree made a mortgage in the form of a trust deed of one undivided half of the premises to secure the same notes. These deeds were recorded th\u00e9 next year and later Dupree conv\u00e9yed the land to his wife, whose title is not assailed ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>cept as subject to the lien for the notes. Then Dupree conveyed other property in trust for creditors in three classes, in the first of which was included one' Slayden in respect of the above-mentioned notes, of four of which he had become the holder. Forthwith certain creditors brought a bill to get the benefit of other securities held by one of the preferred creditors and for a receiver. Neither the petitioner nor Slay-den were made parties, nor was this property mentioned in the bill. On the same day another similar bill was brought by W. B.. Belknap &amp; Company, unsecured creditors, in which Slayden was one of the defendants. The petitioner also was joined in respect of a vendor\u2019s lien on other land, which she was alleged fraudulently to assert. It was ordered that on the trial the two suits should be consolidated, the same person having been appointed receiver in each. Then Slayden answered and intervened for three of the notes, one having been paid. ' By the final, decree made on June 30, 1897, it was decided that the pl\u00e1intiffs in the Belknap bill, to which the petitioner was a party', take nothing by their bill; but, among many, other things, the claim of Slayden on his intervention was allowed, it was adjudged that he recover the amount of Dupree and be paid out of the funds in the hands of the court, and it was ordered that thereupon he should endorse the notes, described as secured by vendor\u2019s lien on the land in question, to the receiver, without recourse, and that the receiver should sell them and pay the net proceeds into court to be applied with the other funds. The decree was carried out and the notes were sold to one Duke for 8300. He afterwards sold them to Mansur, the respondent, who attempted by proceedings unnecessary to state to have the land sold. Then this bill was filed. The Circuit Court granted an injunction. This decree was reversed, and a decree of foreclosure in favor of the respondent ordered by the Circuit Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">. The Circuit Court of Appeals proceeded upon'the ground that the decree was conclusive upon the petitioner, though for what purposes or with what results is not entirely clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>and is-not necessary to inquire. We shall assume that the purchaser took the notes as unpaid, with the vendor\u2019s lien attached to the same extent as if Slayclen had sold them without coming into court. That certainly is the most that can be attributed to the decree. But since the date of that decree, and before the date of the bill, the notes have been barred by the Texas statute of' limitations. It is established law in Texas that when a debt is barred an action to foreclose a lien or imortgage .given as security for it is barred also. <em>Hale </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>60 Texas, 217; <em>Goldfrank </em>v. <em>Young, 64 </em>Texas, 432, 434; <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>69 Texas, 341, 344; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Andrews, </em>88 Texas, 524; <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Cates, </em>99 Texas, 133. The former decree afforded no possible ground for not applying the Texas law in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">The respondent argues that the vendor\u2019s lien is equitable; that the statute of limitations does not govern, equitable proceedings, and that a court of equity will not be governed by the analogy of the statute unless.it seems equitable to follow it; that the equity jurisdiction of the United States is not to be affected by state laws; that therefore the United States courts are unincumbered by the Texas decisions, and that they ought to say that it is inequitable to deny a remedy on the security when a suit is barred upon the debt. We will not consider in how many points we disagree with this argument, but will confine ourselves to what we deem a sufficient answer..</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">\u2022 A vendor seems to have greater rights than are enjoyed by a purchaser of notes for the price of land, to which a vendor\u2019s lien is attached. If not- inequitable, the vendor may resolve the sale for non-payment, whereas a later holder of the notes only can have the lands sold and the proceeds applied in satisfaction, and this right is lost'when the notes are barred. <em>Stephens </em>v. <em>Mathews, </em>69 Texas, 341, 344. (These notes, it will be remembered, had been sold by the vendor long before the sale under the decree.) In one case a lien expressly reserved seems to be regarded as equivalent to a mortgage. <em>Wilcox </em>v. <em>National Bank, </em>93 Texas, 322, 331. Whether this be true or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>not, we hardly see how a court of law could disregard an express reservation of security, or how a lien s\u00f3,reserved can be called a purely equitable right. But equitable or not it is a creation not of the United States, but of the local law of Texas. If that law should declare the words in Bailey\u2019s deed purporting to reserve a lien unavailing, it wo\u00fald not be for the courts of the United States to say otherwise when sitting in equity any more than when sitting at law.' It appears to us equally their duty, when the local law decides that the words create a right, to take the measure of that right from the same source. The notes are barredlas well in equity as at law. By the law of Texas the security is incident to the note and does not warrant a foreclosure when the -note does -not warrant a judgment. This is not a mattertof procedure or jurisdiction, but of substantive rights concerning land. It seems to us that it should be governed by the decisions of the State where the land lies. See <em>Slide &amp; Spur Gold Mines </em>v. Seymour, 153 U. S. 509, 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u25a0 We should add as an independent consideration that it cannot be admitted for a moment that for, a debtor to rely upon the statute of- limitation is inequitable/of itself without some special circumstance wanting here. That would' be for courts, and in this case courts of a different power, to undertake to declare wrong or discreditable what the proper authority, the legislature of the State, had declared right. There are other questions in the case, but we deem the foregoing reasons sufficient t\u00f3 show that the decree must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\n<em>Decree reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">June 1, 1909, Mr. Justice Holmes. To prevent misapprehension there should be added to the opinion at the end the following words:</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">We have considered only the question of the foreclosure on the cross-bill. The case will be remanded to the Circuit Court for further proceedings in accordance with the opini\u00f3n/ with-, out prejudice to the question whether the bill can. be maintained.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
