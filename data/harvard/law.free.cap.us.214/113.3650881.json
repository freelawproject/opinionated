Upon the trial of the indictment for which plaintiff in error was extradited he was himself sworn, and testified as a witness, and on the twenty-ninth of December, 1905, after he had given- such evidence, he was indicted again by-the grand jury of San Francisco county, the indictment charging him with perjury committed on December 12,1905, while testifying on his own behalf -on the trial, as already stated.

Collins, </em>plaintiff in error and appellant, <em>pro se, </em>submitted:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b146-7\">The accused has the legal right, by virtue of .the treaty, to a. trial to a final conclusion of the extradition case.' This right is supreme, paramount and exclusive. It imposes an obligation which the State must first ob,ey and perform, and to which all its laws, and process and judicial power are necessarily in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>ferior and subordinate. It is incompatible .with-this right and obligation, and in violation of the treaty, to arrest the accused; put him to trial and prosecute him on a charge of committing another offense subsequently to the extradition surrender, and do this while the extradition c\u00e1se' is pending and awaiting trial to a final conclusion. Nothing in article 3 of the convention of 1889, authorizes any such nullification of. the supremacy of the extr\u00e1dition process and of the supremacy of the extradition jurisdiction in its exclusive authority and control over the p\u00e9rson of the accused.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-6\">The extradition jurisdiction over the person of the accused, is special and limited, and extends no farther than the charge on which he has been extradited. It is a jurisdiction derived entirely from the treaty; and consequently is supreme and exclusive until it has wrought its function by securing to the accused a trial to a final conclusion of the specific charge on which his extradition was granted, and he has been afforded reasonable time and opportunity after his final release on that charge, to return to the country of asylum.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b147-7\">To conserve' and enforce the fundamental and paramount right to a trial to a final conclusion of the extradition case, the law of the treaty prohibits the arrest or trial of the accused upon any other charge, until he is first given a reasonable time and opportunity after his final release from custody or imprisonment in the case where his' extradition was grant\u00e9d, to return to the country of asylum. This principle also maintains in exclusive and supreme control of the person of the accused, the extradition jurisdiction, until the extradition case is ended. The well-settled law on this point deems the accused to be present and actually 'resident within the territory of the nation granting the asylum; thus necessitating a new extradition to authorize the subsequent trial \u00e1nd'prosecution on the subsequent extraditable offense. There is absolutely nothing in article 3 of'the convention of 1889, that can by any possibility be construed to the contrary. It simply fails to prohibit, and it would be very ridiculous if it did prohibit, the prosecu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>tion for the subsequent offense. It certainly does not authorize \u00e1 prosecution for a subsequent extraditable offense^ without the necessity of a new extradition. It does nqt and could not deal with the subject of subsequent offenses; ifls entirely foreign in its scope and purpose to all such matters. \u2022 Above all else it does not permit a trial and prosecution for the subsequent offense, while the extradition case is pending, and while the extradition jurisdiction extends its supreme and' exclusive authority over the person of the accused; the treaty would clearly be self-stultifying and self-contradictory if it did.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-5\">By \u00a7 5275, Rev. Stat., the extradited prisoner is invested with the legal right to a trial to a final conclusion of the' charge specified in the warrant of extradition. The statute no more than the treaty, nor than the well-settled principle of' international law, makes any distinction' whatever,' between such prosecutions for subsequent offenses and such prosecutions for prior offenses; nor is it possible for any such distinction to' find support in reason or authority. It can make no difference at all and is entirely irrelevant .to the point, that th\u00e9re exists an absolute immunity as to prosecutions for prior offenses, and none as to prosecutions for subsequent offenses.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-6\">By the treaty, the statute, and the principle of international law, the extradited person is entitled as a matter of right to have his trial to a final conclusion, in the .extradition, .case, within a. reasonable time. What is a reasonable time will .usually be determined by analogy to the <em>lex fon. </em>In California the period' is sixty days and is held by the Supreme Court of the State to apply as much.to a case where .there has been a mistrial as it does to a case where no trial has taken place at all. <em>Ex parte Begerow, </em>133 California, 349.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b148-7\">Holding the accused in custody,for years on the extradition charge,-against his constant protest, without a trial to-a final conclusion of the charge on which he was extradited, is extremely and oppressively unreasonable; and, in l\u00e1w, operates to terminate the jurisdiction over his persoil, and he is entitled to his discharge on <em>habeas corpus.

In other words, .the plaintiff in error claims immunity, under the treaties, from arrest or detention for any crime com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>mitted by him'after he has been brought back upon the extradition warrant until he has. been allowed a re\u00e1sonable time to return to the place from which he was taken. He contends that the duty originally resting upon the demanding c'ountry to try him only for the offense for which; he was- extradited and to then afford him reasonable opportunity to -return,, is unaffected by the fact that he committed another crime after \u25a0his extradition.</p>\n<p id=\"AbZ\">The treaty of 1842, August. 9 (8 Stat. 576, \u00a7 10), is the one in regard to which discussions as to its meaning haye arisen. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Rauscher, </em>119 U. S. 407. Subsequently to treaty, Great. Britain passed the extradition act of 1870 (32 and 33 Victoria, chapter 52) and also in 1873 an act to amend the extradition act of 1870 (36 and 37 Victoria, chapter 60). Both these acts are cited as the extradition acts of 1870 and 1873. See I Moore on Extradition (1891), pages 741, 755. In subdivision 2 of \u00a7 3 of the act .of 1870 it is provided: \u201c (2) A fugitive criminal shall not be surrendered to a foreign State unless provision is made by the law of that State, or by arrangement that the fugitive criminal shall not, until he has been restored or had an opportunity of returning to Her Majesty\u2019s dominions, be detained \u00f3r tried in that foreign State for any offense committed prior to his surrender, other than the extradition crime proved by the facts on which the surrender' is grounded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Article 3 of the treaty or convention of 1889, July 12, between Great Britain and the United States is to be found in 26 Stat. 1508-9, and is also, among others, set out in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Browne, </em>205 U. S. 309, 319, as follows: \u201cArticle III. No person surrendered by or to either of the high contracting parties shall be triable or be tried for any crime or offense, committed prior to his extradition, other than the offense for which he was surrendered, until he shall' have had an opportunity of returning to the country from 'which he was surrendered.\u201d The treatment of the criminal for all acts committed or said to have been committed by him prior to extradition is thus fully provided for.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqu\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>The- contention of the plaintiff in error that the duty to afford opportunity to return after a trial or other termination of the case upon which he was extradited is unaffected by any subsequent crime he may .have committed, is not even plaus-. ible. Nothing in the <em>Rauscher case (supra) </em>is authority for any such contention: The duty to afford opportunity to return after trial, as stated, is limited to matters' which happened before extradition, and in the nature of things such duty cannot be' extended by implication so as -to '.cover a totally different state' of facis.- Because, in some cases, in construing the treaty, it' has been stated that a person extradited can be tried only for the offense for which he was surrendered for trial until he has had an opportunity of returning, it is assumed by the plaintiff in error that such language prohibits the trial of \u00e1 person so extradited for any crime committed by him subsequently as well as prior to the surrender, without an opportunity for his' return to the other country. The whole question is simply one as to\" the meaning of the treaty, and we cannot doubt for a single moment what that meaning is.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">Much is<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> said by,the plaintiff, in error as to his right to an asylum as. if it- inhered in himself. The right is, however, simply provided for by treaty, and must-be found therein, so far alone as the criminal is concerned.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">. The question then is,' .does either the treaty or convention, by express provision or by inference, provide for a return of the criminal to the surrendering country after his surrender and after a subsequent commission of a crime in the country to which he was surrendered? To ask the question is to answer it. The plaintiff in error contends for the treaty right to leave the country, notwithstanding his commissiqn of the subsequent crime. This we cannot assent to. It is impossible to conceive of.-representatives of two civilized countries, solemnly entering into a treaty of extradition, and therein providing that a'criminal surrendered according to demand, for a crime that hechas committed, if subsequently to'his surrender he is guilty of murder or treason or other crime is, nevertheless, to' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>have the right guaranteed to him to return unmolested to the country which surrendered him. We can imagine no country, by treaty, as desirous of exacting such a' condition of surrender or any country as willing to accept it. When a treaty or statute contains a provision that the party surrendered shall be tried for no', other offense until he has had an opportunity to leave the country, the meaning of such a provision is perfectly plain, and must receive a reasonable and sensible cohstruction. The 'party, proceeded against must.not be tried for any other offense existing at the time when he was extradited (whether at the time of guch extradition it had or had not been discovered), until he shall have had a reasonable time to return to the country- from, which he was taken, after his trial or other'termination of the proceeding. That such privilege should be accorded to one who commits a crime after his sur-, render to a. demanding government lacks all'semblance of-reason or sense.</p>\n<p id=\"AFV\">Spear in the second edition of his work on the Law Of Extradition says, at . page 84, that the party extradited is. not \u201cprotected against trial for any offenses which he may commit against the receiving government subsequently to his extradition, and while in its custody,, or after his discharge' therefrom . . \u25a0Such a criminal hag no asylum, because he never had an asylum within the jurisdiction of th\u00e9 government delivering him, with regard to the crime which lie committed since'such delivery.</p>\n<p id=\"ACJ\">The contention is also without merit that he has) at aiiy rate, the right to a trial to a conclusion of the case for which he was extradited, before he can be tried for a crime subsequently committed... The matter lies, within the'jurisdiction'of the. State whose laws he has violated since, his extradition, and we cannot see that it is a matter of any interest to the'surrender,ing government.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak6\">There is nothing in section 5275, Rev. Stat., <em>supra, </em>which gives the least countenance to the claims of the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>The other objections made b.y him in'-regard to the person\u2019 who now has him in custody under the various warrants and processes, copies of which are returned in the/record, we regard- as unimportant.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">As soon as the judgments herein \u00e1re affirmed the plaintiff in error will, of course, pursuant to the judgment entered upon the verdict of conviction against him, be taken to the state prison in California, provided for in the sentence; and there confined according to law.'
