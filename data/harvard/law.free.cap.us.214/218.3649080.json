The facts were agreed upon. It was a company engaged in the express business. W. G. Tharp was a resident of Hart County, Kentucky, who bought and paid for liquor in Nashville, Tennessee,.and New Albany, Indiana. The'sellers wer\u00e9 licensed dealers in those places, and shipped the liquors to him, by the defendant, prepaying the express charges. ' Tharp was in the habit of becoming intoxicated, and the defendant\u2019s .agent in-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>Hart County knew of this fact when he delivered the liquors. On the trial the court ruled \u201cthat the said transportation and delivery of said liquor to said Tharp by defendant did not constitute interstate commerce within the meaning of the clause of the Federal Constitution, which gives to the Congress of the United States power to regulate commerce between the States, and that the defendant is guilty of knowingly furnishing liquor to an inebriate, as charged in the information herein.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A4K\">The defendant prayed an appeal to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, which was denied, and thereupon the case was brought here directly from the Circuit Court of Hart County, the highest'court of the State in which a decision could be had. Ky. Stat. 1903, \u00a7 1307, p. 579; Id. \u00a7'950, p. 482- \u00a7 347 Crim. Code, p. 567.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b250-8\"><em>Mr. Lawrence Maxwell, </em>with'whom <em>Mr. Joseph S. Graydon </em>was on the brief, for plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-9\">This court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-10\">The Federal question was duly raised and overruled in the trial court.' The case is brought here direct because the Circuit Court of Hart County is the highest court of the \u2019State in which a decision can be had. The information was based on \u00a7 1307, Ky. Stat. 1903, which fixes the only penalty at a fine of fifty dollars. Under \u00a7 347, Criminal Code, and Ky. Stat. 1903, \u00a7 950, the trial court properly refused an appeal to the Court of Appeals of Kentucky, and allowed the writ from this court with supers\u00e9deas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b250-11\">This proposition that the transaction was interstate commerce is well settled.- Tharp lawfully bought and paid for the liquor in another State from dealers duly licensed there to sell it. The only connection of the defendant with the transaction was to carry the liquor to Kentucky and there deliver it to the consignee- \"This it did in discharge of its duty as a common carrier engaged in interstate transportation, under the laws of the United States, and in pursuance of a lawful contract entered into iri another State with the 'shipper, who there paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>defendant its carrying charges. It is not competent for the State of Kentucky to declare such a contract unlawful, or to punish defendant for performing it, or to regulate its performance by forbidding delivery to the consignee on the claim that he is a person who is in the habit of becoming intoxicated. If such regulation of interstate commerce is deemed advisable it must proceed from Congress. The \u2022 States cannot interfere until the interstate transportation has- been completed by delivery to the consignee. The court has so construed the Wilson Act repeatedly. <em>American Exp. Co. </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>196 U. S. 133; <em>Bowman </em>v. <em>Chicago &amp; Northwestern Ry. Co., </em>125 U. S. 465; <em>Leisy </em>v. <em>Hardin, </em>135 U.

S. 412, 426.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b251-5\">The Kentucky statute is an illegal regulation of interstate commerce. \u2022 A state statute which- compels a carrier to know the contents of his packages, and to ascertain at his peril whether the consignees of all interstate shipments of intoxicating liquor ar\u00e9 in the habit of becoming intoxicated, and which denies- the right to deliver to such persons an article of commerce in course of transportation from another State, is a plain regulation of int\u00e9rstate commerce. <em>Wabash, St. L. &amp; P.

Defendant contended That the Kentucky statute as applied to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>the transportation.of liquor from State to State was in conflict with the section of the Federal Constitution vesting jurisdiction' in Congress over interstate commerce. This contention was denied by the state court, and thus a question arose under the Federal Constitution decided adversely to the plaintiff in error. <em>Western Turf Association </em>v. <em>Greenberg, </em>204 U.

S. 438, 444, Mr. Justice White, delivering the opinion of the court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-7\">\u201cEqually we|l established is the proposition that the right to send liquors from one State into another, and the act of sending the same, 'is interstate commerce, the regulation whereof has been committed by the Constitution of the United States to Congress, and, hence, that a state law which denies such a right, or substantially.interferes with or hampers the same, is in conflict with the Constitution.of the United States.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">That the transportation is not complete until delivery 'to the consignee is also settled. , _ .</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">In <em>Rhodes </em>v. <em>Iowa, </em>170 U. S. 412, 426, it was held that the Wilson Act \u201cwas not intended to and did not cause the power \u2022of the State to attach to -.an interstate commerce shipment, whilst the merchandise was ;in transit under'such 'shipment,, .and until its arrival at the'point of destination and delivery there to the consignee.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">This legislation is in the exercise of the police :power, \u00e1 pow\u00e9r which, generally speaking, belongs to the State, and is-an attempt in virtue of that power to directly regulate commerce, but in case of conflict between the powers claimed by the'State and those which belong exclusively to.Congress, the former must, yield, for the Constitution of the United States and the laws made in pursuance thereof are \u201cthe supreme law. of the land.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>Section 5258 of .the Revised Statutes of the United States provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">\u201cEvery railroad company in the United States . .' . is hereby, authorized to carry upon and over its road . . ,. all passengers '. . . freight, and property on their way from any State to' another State, and to receive compensation therefor.\u201d <em>New Orleans Gas Company </em>v. <em>Louisiana Light Company, </em>115 U.

S. 557.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In <em>Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company </em>v. <em>Wharton, </em>207 U. S. 328, 334, it was declared \u201cthat any exercise of state authority, in whatever form manifested, which directly regulates interstate commerce, is repugnant to the commerce clause of the Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-9\">In <em>Adams Express Company </em>v. <em>Kentucky, </em>206 U. S. 129, 135, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-10\">\u201c The testimony showed that the package, containing a gallon of whiskey, was shipped from Cincinnati, Ohio, to George Meece, at East Bernstadt, Kentucky. The transaction was therefore one of interstate commerce, and within the exclusive jurisdiction of Congress. The Kentucky statute is obviously an attempt to regulate such interstate commerce. This is hardly questioned by the Court of Appeals, and is beyond dispute under the decisions of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-11\">Clearly within the cases above cited the statute before us as applied to transportation from State to State cannot be sustained.'</p>\n<p id=\"b253-12\">\n<em>The judgment of the Circuit Court of Hart County, Kentucky, is reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with the views expressed in this opinion.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b253-13\">Me.
