The libel alleged is found in an advertisement printed in the defendant\u2019s newspaper, The Chicago Sunday Tribune, and so far as is material is as follows: \u201cNurse and Patients Praise Duffy's \u2014 Mrs A. Schuman,'One of Chicago\u2019s Most Capable and Experienced Nurses, Pays-an Eloquent Tribute to the Great Invigorating; Life-Giving and . Curative Properties of Duffy\u2019s Pure Malt Whiskey. . . .\u201d Then followed a portrait of the plaintiff, with the words \u201cMrs. A. Schuman\u201d under it. Then, in quotation marks, \u201cAfter years of constant use of your Pure Malt Whiskey, both by myself and as given to patients in my capacity as nurse, I have no hesitation in recommending it as the very best tonic and stimulant for all weak and rundown conditions,\u201d &amp;c., &amp;c., with the words \u201cMrs. A. Schuman, 1576 Mozart st., Chicago, 111.,\u201d at the end, not in quotation marks, but conveying the notion of a signature, or at least that the words were hers. The declaration alleged that the plaintiff was not Mrs. Schuman, was not a n\u00farse, and was a total abstainer from whiskey and all spirituous liquors. \u2022 There was also a count for publishing the plaintiff\u2019s likeness without leave; The defendant pleaded not guilty. At the trial, subject to exceptions, the judge excluded the plaintiff\u2019s testimony in support of her allegations just stated, and directed a verdict for the defendant. His action was sustained by the Circuit Court of Appeals. 154 Fed. Rep. 330; &lt;S. <em>C, </em>83 C. C. A. 202. ...</p>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Of course the insertion of the plaintiff\u2019s picture in the place and with the concomitants that, we have described imported that she was- the-, nurse and made the statements set. forth, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>rightly was decided in <em>Wandt </em>v. <em>Hearst\u2019s Chicago American, </em>129 Wisconsin, 419, 421. <em>Morrison </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>177 N. Y. 366. Therefore the publication was of and concerning the plaintiff, notwithstanding the presence of another fact, the name of the real- signer of the certificate, if that was Mrs. Schuman, that was inconsistent, when all the facts were known, with the-plaintiff\u2019s having signed or adopted it. Many might recognize the plaintiff\u2019s face without knowing her name, and those who did know it might be led to infer that she had sanctioned the publication -under an alias! There was some suggestion that the defendant published the portrait by mistake, and without knowledge that it was the plaintiff\u2019s portrait or was not what it purported to be. But the fact, if it was one, was no excuse. If the publication'was libellous the defendant took the risk. As was said of such matters by Lord Mansfield, \u201cWhatever a man publishes he publishes at his peril.\u201d <em>The King </em>v. <em>Woodfall, </em>Lofft, 776, 781. See further <em>Hearne </em>v. <em>Stowell, </em>12 A. &amp; E. 719, 726; <em>Shepheard </em>v. <em>Whitaker, </em>L. R. 10 C. P. 502; <em>Clark </em>v. <em>North American Co., </em>203 Pa. St. 346, 351, 352. The reason is plain. A libel is harmful on its face. If a man sees fit to publish manifestly hurtful statements concerning kh individual, without other justification than exists for an advertisement or a piece of news, the usual principles of \u2022tort will make him hable, if the statements are false or are true only of some one else. See <em>Morasse </em>v. <em>Brochu, </em>151 Massachusetts, 567, <em>575.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">The question, then, is whether the publication was a libel. It was held by tbfe Circuit Court of Appeals not to be, or at most to entitle the plaintiff only to nominal damages, no special damage being alleged. It was pointed out that there was no general consensus of opinion that to drink whiskey is wrong or that to be a nurse is discreditable. It might have been \u00e1aded that very possibly giving a certificate and-the use of one\u2019s portrait-in aid of an advertisement would be regarded with .irony,, or a stronger feeling, only by a few. But it appears to us that such inquiries are beside the point.- It may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>be that the action for libel is of little use, but while it is maintained it should be governed by the general principles of tort. If the advertisement obviously would hurt the plaintiff in the estimation of an important and respectable part of the community, liability is not a question of a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">We know of no decision in which this matter is discussed \u2022uppn principle. But obviously an unprivileged falsehood need not entail universal hatred to constitute a cause of action. No falsehood is thought about or even known by all the world. No conduct is hated by all. That it will be known by a large number and will lead an appreciable fraction of that number to regard 'the plaintiff with contempt is enough to do her practical harm. Thus if a doctor were represented as advertising, the fact that it would affect his .standing with others of his profession might make the representation actionable, although advertising is not reputed dishonest and even seems to be regarded by many with pride. See <em>Martin </em>v. <em>The Picayune, </em>115 Louisiana, 979. It seems to us impossible to say that the obvious tendency of what is imputed to the plaintiff by this advertisement is not seriously to hurt her standing with a considerable and respectable class in the community. Therefore it was the plaintiff\u2019s right to prove-her case and go to' the jury, and the defendant would have got all that it could ask if had been permitted to persuade them, if it could, to take a.contrary view. <em>Culmer </em>v. <em>Canby, </em>101 Fed. Rep. 195, 197; <em>Twombly </em>v. <em>Monroe, </em>136 Massachusetts, 464, 469. See <em>Gates </em>v. <em>New York Recorder Co., </em>155 N. Y. 228.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">It is unnecessary to consider the question whether the publication of the plaintiff\u2019s likeness was a tort <em>per se. </em>It is enough .for the present case that the law should at least be prompt to. recognize the injuries that may arise from an unauthorized use in connection with other facts, even if more subtilty is needed to state the wrong than is needed here. In fkis instance we feel no doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
