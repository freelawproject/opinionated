By such order (although vague initsterms)the only construction to be reasonably madethereof is that with respect to civil cases the jurisdiction of the Provisional'Court was limited to such jurisdiction as Circuit and District Courts of the United States at the time possessed under the Constitution and laws of the United- States then in force.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AuBO\">The Prtivisional Court did not have jurisdiction of the cases complained of, because they were not such as a Circuit Court or District Court of the United States should have had jurisdiction over.

If this is not true, then where did the authority. lie for governing the Island during that\u2019 period of time? The treaty of peace concluded between' the United States and Spain in December, 1898, and ratified and promulgated in April, 1899, made no provision for the temporary government of. the Island pending the action of Congress in the premises, the only reference to judicial proceedings being contained in art. 18, the second paragraph of which provided that civil suits pending and undetermined at the date of the .treaty shall be prosecuted to judgment before the court in which they may be pending or in the co\u00fcrt that may be substituted therefor. \u2022 This paragraph of the treaty demonstrates that it was even then contemplated that new courts might be substituted by the- United Stat\u00e9s for the determination \u00f3f actions'which had already been brought and were then pending in the courts of Porto-Rico.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b293-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>No power or authority existed for the Government of Porto Rico after the American occupation, and prior to the passage of the organic act, except the military power, which had supreme authority in accordance with the authority which We have quoted, and that the direct recognition of the Provisional Court by the organic act, and the mandatory provision for the continuance of pending. proceedings in the Provisional Court to be carried out by th\u00e9 United States District Court for Porto Rico, which was established by said' organic act, must definitely determine the-legal existence and validity of the acts of the Provisional Court within the scope,of its jurisdiction as provided in the general order creating it.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b293-5\">Me.

The defendants, by mesne conveyances, hold the title conveyed by the execution sale. The plaintiffs' attack that title solely upon the grounds, that the United States. Provisional Court had no lawful existence, and if lawfully constituted was entirely without jurisdiction to render'the judgment which it did, and that for the one reason or the other the judgment is \u00e1 nulhty everywhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">The ratifications qf the treaty of peace by which Porto Rico was ceded to the United States were exchanged..April 1.1,1899. 30 St\u00e1t. 1754. ' The act of Congress establishing a civil government in Porto Rico, passed April 12, 1900,31 Stat. 77, c. 191, took effect on May Tof that year. Between these two dates, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>on June 27,1899, the United States Provisional Court,, here in question, was established by military authority, with the approval of the President, by General Order, No. 88, series of 1899. The parts of the order material here follow:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-6\">' \u201cI. In view of the existing and steadily increasing legal business requiring judicial determination, which does not fall within the jurisdiction of the local insular courts, such as smuggling goods in evasion of revenue laws, larceny of United States property, controversies between citizens of different States and of foreign States,' violation of the United States postal law, etc., etc., and pursuant t\u00f3 authority from the President of the United States, conv\u00e9yed by endorsem\u00e9nt of April \u00cd4, 1899, from the Acting Secretary of War, and after full conference with the Supreme Court and members of the-Bar of the Island, a United States Provisional Court is hereby established for the Department of Porto Rico. ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-7\">\u201cII. The judicial power of the Provisional Court hereby established shall extend to all cases which would be properly cognizable by the Circuit or District Courts of the United States under the Constitution, and to all common law offenses withm the restrictions hereinafter specified.\u201d -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-8\"><em>\u201cX. </em>In civil actions when the amount in controversy is fifty dollars ($50.00) or over, and in which any of the classes of persons above enumerated in paragraph VIII are parties, or in which the parties, litigant by stipulation invoke its jurisdiction; shall be brought in the Provisional'Court: Provided, That in the determination-of all suits to which Porto Ricans are parties, or of suits arising from contracts which have been or shall be made under the provisions of Spanish or Porto Rican laws, the court shall, as far as practicable, conform to the precedents and decisions of the United States courts in similar cases which have been tried and determined in territory formerly acquired by the United States from Spain or'Mexico. In. all other civil actions the case shall lie within the jurisdiction of the proper insular court as now provided by local law.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b294-9\">By paragraph XI, the -losing party is afforded an opportunity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>to apply to this court for a \u201cwrit of certiorari or other suitable process to review such judgment or decree.\u201d At the time this order was issued peace prevailed in Porto Rico and the courts established under Spanish sovereignty were open.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The. plaintiffs contend that the military power, acting by the authority of the President as Commander-in-Chief, does not warrant the creation of the United States Provisional Court.</p>\n<p id=\"ARl\">By the ratifications of the treaty of peace, Porto Rico ceased to be subject to the crown of Spain and became subject to the legislative power .of Congress. But the civil government of the United States cannot extend immediately and of its own force over conquered and ceded territory. Theoretically, Congress might prepare and enact a scheme of civil government to take effect immediately upon the cession, but, practically, there always have been delays and always will be.. Time is required for a study of the situation and for the maturing and enacting of an adequate scheme of civil government. In the meantime, pending the action of Congress, there is no civil power under our system of government, not even that of the President as civil executive, which can take the place of the government which has ceased to exist by the cession. Is it possible that, under such circumstances, there must be an interregnum? We think clearly not. The authority to govern such ceded territory is found in the laws applicable to conquest and cession. That authority is the military power, under the control of the President as Commander-in-Chief. In the case of <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Harrison, </em>16 How. 164, a situation of this kind was referred to in the opinion of the court, where it said: \u201cIt (the military authority) was the government when the territory was ceded as a conquest, and it did not cease, as a'matter of course, or as a necessary consequence of the restoration of peace. The President might have dissolved' it by withdrawing the army and navy officers who administered it, but he did not do so. Co\u00f1gress could have put an end to it, but that was not done. The right inference from the inaction of bbth is, that it was meant to be continued until it had been legislatively changed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>No presumption of a contrary intention can be made. Whatever .may have been the causes of delay, it must be presumed that the delay was consistent with the true policy of the Government,\u201d pp. 193, 194. And see <em>Leitensdorfer </em>v. <em>Webb, </em>20 How. 176, and opinion of Mr. Justice Gray in <em>Downes </em>v. <em>Bidwell, 182 </em>U. S. 244, 345.</p>\n<p id=\"Anl\">.; The authority, of a military government during the period between the cession and the action of Congress, like the authority.of the same government before.the cession, is of large, though it may not be of unlimited, extent. In fact, certain limits, not material here, were put upon it in <em>Dooley </em>v. <em>United </em>States, 182 U. S. 222, and <em>Lincoln </em>v. <em>United States, </em>197 U. S. 419, though it was said in the <em>Dooley case, </em>p. 234: \u201cWe have no doubt, however, that, from the necessities of the case, the right to administer the government of Porto Rico continued in the military commander after the ratification of the treaty, and until further action by Congress,\u201d citing <em>Cross </em>v. <em>Harrison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">But whatever may be the limits of the military power, it certainly must .include the authority to establish courts of justice, which are so essential a part of any government.. So, it seems to have been thought in <em>Leitensdorfer </em>v. <em>Webb, supra. </em>With this thought in mind, the military power not only established this particular court in Porto Rico, but as well a system of courts, which took the place of the courts under Spanish sovereignty, and were continued by the organic act. The same course was pursued in the Philippine Islands.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">By. \u00a7 34 of the organic act (31 Stat. 77), a District Court of the United States for Porto Rico was created, and it was provided that the same \u201cshall be the successor to the United States provisional court established by General Orders-numbered Eighty-eight, promulgated by Brigadier General Davis,. United States Volunteers, and shall, take possession 'of- all records of-that Court/and take jurisdiction o.f all cases and proceedings pending therein, and said United States provisional \u2022court is hereby discontinued.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"A2q\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>The record shows that in conformity with this provision the-newly-created District Court of the United States for Porto Rico issued an execution upon this judgment of the United States Provisional Court, and the property was sold upon that execution. .</p>\n<p id=\"AIB\">A further cont\u00e9ntion of the plaintiffs is, that the United \u25a0States Provisional Court was without jurisdiction, because the diversity of citizenship made requisite by the order did not exist. Assuming, without deciding, that this question is open at this.time, we are of the opinion that the citizenship of the parties to' the action in the United States Provisional Court was such as to give that court jurisdiction. The plaintiff there was a Spanish subject and the'defendant a citizen and a resident of Porto Rico. Taking the second and the tenth paragraphs into consideration and the classes of persons enumerated in paragraph 8, which included \u201cforeigners,\u201d there can be no doubt that the case was within the jurisdiction which the order sought, to confer. In view of the whole order, we think that a contrbversy between a Porto Rican and a Spaniard furnished the diversity of citizenship which the order made jurisdictional. Undoubtedly, one of the main .purposes of the establishment of this court was to afford a court where Spanish subjects could obtain justice against Porto Ricans at a time when it might be feared that the' embers of the old disputes between Spaniards and Porto Ricans were still aflame.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">The plaintiffs, one of whom was the defendant in the action before the United States Provisional Court, further suggest that defendant was not served with process and never appeared, and that the judgment rendered against him by default was a nullity, This point does not appear to be pressed and there is nothing in it. The service was in strict accordance with the procedure established by the court and by delivering a summons at the usual place of abode of the defendant intq the-hands of his wife..</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">The- plaintiffs further contend that if the.. United-States Provisional Court had jurisdiction qf the Gase and the\u2019parties, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>in some way it had lost it, because in the course of its proceedings it disregarded certain provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure which were binding upon it. But clearly no such question is open on a collateral attack, such at this is, and we need delay no further upon that point.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">There were other questions in the case, which the view we have taken of it render it unnecessary to consider.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">We are of the opinion that the judgment of the United States Provisional Court was not a nullity and that the sale on execution, under which the defendants claim, conveyed to them a good title. As the court below took the same view, its judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"Ah8q\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">By agreement No. 128, Santiago <em>v. </em>Gonzalez y Rodriguez; No. 129, Santiago <em>v. </em>Moscoso; No. 130, Santiago <em>v. </em>Ana Semidey, widow of Antonio Costa, abide the result of this case, and corresponding judgments will be entered in them.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
