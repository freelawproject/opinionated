On July 20,1904, Ernest M. Newton and John F. Newton, partners as E. M. Newton &amp; Co., merchants at wholesale and retail in Arkansas, and Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co., a corporation, of Kansas City, Missouri, engaged in the wholesale dry goods business, entered into a written contract as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b310-8\">\u201c 'Know all men by these'presents: That Mr. E.

The contract was not filed or recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-10\">\u201c3. Pursuant to the contract and prior to June 30,1905, the Dry Goods Company delivered to/the Newtons goods of the value of $15,369.57. The latter paid on account thereof the sum of $2,059.01. On June 30,1905, the unpaid balance was $13,310.56.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b312-11\">\u201c 4. The goods delivered under the contract were placed by the Newtons in their stock with other goods obtained from other parties, but they were of such character and contained such marks as rendered them capable of being identified and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>separated. It was contemplated by the parties that the Newtons might sell the goods so delivered in the usual course of their business. The Newtons did not keep separate accounts of their resales of the goods nor did the Dry Goods Company require them to make reports thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-5\">\u201c 5. On June 30,1905, when the Newtons were insolvent and the Dry Goods Company knew it, they surrendered to the Dry Goods Company as belonging to it under-the provisions of the contract, goods of the value of $5,337.21; notes to the amount of $1,684.32, and customers\u2019 accounts to the amount of $8,277.04. The goods were so surrendered by the Newtons as being the unsold part of those delivered under the contract, and the notes and accounts as representing proceeds of their sales of like goods. Actual possession was taken by the Dry Goods Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-6\">'\u201c6. In fact the goods surrendered to the Dry Goods Company were, with slight exception, goods that had been delivered under the contract, but only about one-half in amount of the notes and accounts surrendered represented proceeds of other goods delivered under the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-7\">\u201c7. On July 3,1905, three days after the surrender of the property as above mentioned, the Newtons filed their voluntary petition in-bankruptcy, were adjudged bankrupts, and' Thad. -A. Bryant was appointed receiver. In one of the schedules \"attached to the verified petition in bankruptcy the Dry Goods Company was listed as a secured creditor, with a statement of the facts upon which its rights were based, and recitals of the surrender to it of the goods, notes and accounts, that the notes and accounts were proceeds of the goods furnished by the Dry Goods Company under the contract and resold by the Newtons to their customers, and that the goods, notes and accounts were then in the possession of that company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-8\">\u2022 -\u201c 8. After the appointment of the receiver in the bankruptcy proceeding he demanded from the Dry Goods Company ypibssfession of the goods, notes and accounts mentioned. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>demand was refused, but afterwards the Dry Goods Company surrendered them to the receiver under a written stipulation that they might be disposed of by him in connection with the sale of the other property in his hands, but that the Dry Goods Company should not be prejudiced thereby, and that the proceeds should be held in lieu of the property so surrendered to abide the final determination of a court of competent jurisdiction as to the ownership thereof, and if the Dry Goods Company prevailed it should have the proceeds free of fees, charges and expenses. As one of the conditions upon which it was made it was expressly admitted in this stipulation that the goods, notes and accounts in controversy were then in the actual, exclusive and adverse possession of the Dry Goods Company, that the goods were part of those delivered to the Newtons. under the contract of July 20, 1904, and that the notes and aqcounts were proceeds of other goods delivered under that contract. This stipulation was made subject to the approval of the referee in bankruptcy. It was executed by the Dry Goods Company and the receiver, and the referee duly endorsed his approval thereon. Upon the faith thereof the goods, notes and accounts were then surrendered to the receiver. No fraud or deception was practiced by the Dry Good's Company upon the referee or the receiver in connection with the making of this stipulation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-5\">\u2022 <em>\u201c </em>9. Thad. A. Bryant who had been appointed receiver was duly selected as trustee. He sold the goods in controversy for $3,135.00. The notes and accounts were not sold but at the time of the hearing of this matter before the referee he had collected $2,250.00 on account thereof and still retained in his hands those that were uncollected. He has kept a separate account of these funds and\u2019held sufficient funds to answer the result of the litigation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b314-6\">\u201c 10. The Dry Goods Company thereupon presented its intervening petition seeking the payment to it of the sums realized as mentioned in the preceding finding and the restitution to it of the uncollected note's and accounts. The controversy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>in the cause was presented by the intervening petition, the trustee's answer thereto and the reply of the Dry Goods Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-5\">\n<em>\u201c Conclusions of Law.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqL\">\u201c1. The contract of July 20, 1904, is a contract of conditional sale and not of mortgage, and as such was not required by the laws of-Arkansas to' be filed or recorded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AmPv\">- \u201c'2. Under the laws of Arkansas the contract was valid as between the parties thereto, notwithstanding the fact that it authorized''the vendees to resell the goods delivered thereunder.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AJO\">\", \u201c 3. It was also valid a,s between the parties thereto not only in respect of such of the goods delivered thereunder as remained unsold when the vendor demanded and secured possession from the vendees, but also in respect of the notes and accounts which represented proceeds of like goods resold by the vendee to' their customers and which could be so identified and segregated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-9\">\u201c 4. The contract being valid.under the local law as between the parties thereto the trustee'in bankruptcy of the vendee cannot avoid or defeat the title of the vendor who took possession prior to the institution of the proceedings in which the vendees were adjudged to be bankrupts. The trustee has no greater right or title than the bankrupts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-10\">\u2022 <em>\u201c 5. </em>Inasmuch as the bankruptcy court obtained from the vendor possession of the notes and accounts in controversy upon the faith of a stimulation made with its approval and without practice of fraud .or deceit that such notes and accounts were the .proceeds of goods covered by the contract of conditional sale, and still holds to. such possession, the trustee is estopped from disputing the fact stipulated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b315-11\">\u201c 6. Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Company, the vendor, is entitled to a decree that the trustee in bankruptcy pay to it the sum of $3,135.00; the proceeds of the goods in controversy, and the further sum of $2,250.00, the collections of notes and accounts in controversy made by the trustee prior to the hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>before the referee, and also for such collections as may have been made since that tim\u00e9 and for the surrender of such of said notes and accounts as may remain uncollected and for costs. The sums mentioned should be paid in full.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b316-4\"><em>Mr. William H. Arnold, </em>with whom <em>Mr. Jaimes K. Jones </em>was on the brief, for appellant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-5\">The receiver did not have authority to make the admission, so that it might not be questiqned by the trustee, contained in the agreement of July 4,1905, that the notes and accounts turned over to the intervenor were proceeds of sales of goods purchased from Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-6\">While the receiver undoubtedly had the right and it was his duty to take charge of the bankrupt estate, he did not have authority, under the statute creating his office, to enter into any \"kind of an agreement which would in any manner affect, or give over to, a claimant the property of the bankrupt estate. The trustee is primarily the representative of the creditors and not the receiver. The receiver is non-partisan and he acts as an agent for the court in protecting the property against loss. <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>17 How. 322.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-7\">By \u00a7 70 of the Bankrupt Act the title of the bankrupt\u2019s. property is vested in the trustee. If the title of Newton &amp; Company to these notes, accounts and goods, to which the im tervenor could not make claim, vested in the trustee, then it would seem that the receiver would be without power to make any contract.whereby that title could be divested. In this case the stipulation, however, has been sustained by the Honorable Circuit Court of Appeals, and the direct effect of it was to divest the title of property from the trustee which it was intended by the Bankrupt Act should pass to him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b316-8\">But the trustee has not in himself the right of unlimited disposition of the property of the bankrupt. He cannot compromise or arbitrate, a controversy, except in a certain way prescribed by the statute and by the general orders in bankruptcy. Certainly the receiver, who'has not as much power <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>as the trustee, should not, therefore, be allowed to make contracts or deals without any restriction whatever, whereby the property which belongs to the creditors would be wasted or given away. <em>Wallace </em>v. <em>Loomis, </em>97 U.

The very nature of the goods themselves, added to the power of disposition as in the case at bar, without being required to keep them separate from other goods or the proceeds separate from the general stock, ought to bar a recovery in this case. \u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>This difference is recognized by the Supreme Court of Arkansas. <em>Lund </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>39 Arkansas, 334.

The acceptance and retention of benefits thereunder by the trustee operates as a ratification of same on his part, and as a waiver of any lack of authority or irregularities in its execution. <em>Bryan </em>v. <em>Bernheimer, </em>181 U.

It is valid between the parties, and valid, also, against the trustee in bankruptcy, who stands merely in the shoes of the bankrupts, and is in no sense a creditor armed with process, a subsequent mortgagee or a purchaser in good faith. <em>Triplett </em>v. <em>Mansur &amp; Tebbetts Impt. Co., </em>68 Arkansas, 230 (57 S. W. Rep. 261), and cases cited.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b319-5\">Mb. Justice Moody,</author>\n<p id=\"A8g\">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The \u2022 merchandise which was delivered by Swofford Bros. Dry Goods Co. to E. M. Newton &amp; Co. was delivered under the terms of a written contract. That contract provided that the title to the goods until their sale; and to the proceeds derived from their sale, whether in the form of cash, notes or book accounts, should be and remain in the Dry Goods Company. The contract gave the Newtons the right to sell the goods in the ordinary course of business, but, as has been said, provided that the proceeds of the sale, in .whatever form they existed, should be the property of the Dry Goods Company. When the Newtons became insolvent and ceased- business they, in recognition of the obligations due from them under this contract, returned to the Dry Goods Company, that part of their goods which remained unsold. The character and marks of the goods rendered) them capable of being identified and separated. They turned over at the same time, as and for the notes and accounts representing the proceeds of sales of the company\u2019s goods, certain notes and customers\u2019 accounts. It was found as a fact that one-half in amount of these notes and accounts represented the proceeds of sales of other goods than those dehvered under the contract. It, therefore, now appears, if it is competent to show it, that this one-half of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>notes and accounts did not belong to the Dry Goods Company, and ought not to have been turned over to it, and that, on the contrary, they should have gone into the estate of the Newtons, who subsequently became bankrupt. Three days after the surrender of this property the Newtons, on their voluntary petition, were adjudged bankrupts and the appellant was appointed receiver. . He demanded of the Dry Goods Company the possession of the goods, notes and accounts mentioned, but the demand was refused. Subsequently a written contract was entered into between the Dry Goods Company and the receiver, with the approval of the referee. No' fraud, or deceit induced the making of this contract.. By its terms the Dry Goods Company, on its part, surrendered the goods, notes and accounts to the receiver, and agreed that he might dispose of them in connection with the assets of. the estate, and that the proceeds of the property thus disposed of should be held in lieu of it to abide the determination of a court of-competent jurisdiction. The receiver, \u00f3n the other hand, agreed that the goods, notes and accounts were in the actual and adverse possession of the Dry Goods Company, and that the goods were part of those delivered to the Newtons under the contract between them and the Dry Goods Company before referred to, and that the notes and. accounts were the proceeds of other goods delivered under that contract. Subsequently, the receiver was appointed- trustee and sold the goods and collected a part of the notes and accounts. The proceeds of the goods, and of the collections are held to await the .result- of this litigation, which is in.the form of an intervening petition of the Dry Goods Company.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We think it clear that the contract under which the goods were delivered to the Newtons was one of conditional sale. <em>Harkness </em>v. <em>Russell, </em>118 U. S. 663; <em>Wm. W. Bierce, Ltd., </em>v. <em>Hutchins, </em>205 U. S. 340. There is nothing in the nature of this contract which would forbid the parties from entering into it, if it is valid by the laws of, the State where, made, but in bankruptcy the construction and validity of such a contract must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>determined by the'local laws of the State. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>Fairbanks, </em>196 U.

The trustee has no higher' rights in this regard than the bankrupt. <em>York Manufacturing Co. v. Cassell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">It follows that, so far as the identified goods and notes and accounts are concerned, the intervenor, the Dry Goods Company, must prevail.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">' It has turned out, according to the finding of facts, that some small fraction of the goods and about one-half of the notes and accounts which were delivered by the Newtons to the Dry Goods Company, as and for the goods, notes and accounts which were the property of that company, were not in fact such, and the question therefore arises whether, under the circumstances disclosed in the findings, the trustee is entitled to avail himself of these facts. We think it was rightly held by the court below that he was not. There seems to be no reason for a nice consideration of the powers of receivers and trustees. When the receiver was appointed he found all the property in dispute in the hands of the Dry Goods Company, to which it had been delivered by the Newtons, as and for the property of the company, and by which it had been received as its own property. When the receiver made his demand for it the return was at first refused. The parties in the controversy, then being at arm\u2019s length, agreed that if the Dry Goods Company would give tip the advantages of possession and instead of converting the goods, notes and accounts into cash in its own way and on its own account, permit the receiver to dp so, then those goods should be deemed part of those delivered-under the contract and the notes and accounts the proceeds of other goods delivered under the contract. This arrangement was approved by the referee. The trustee has taken the property under it and has never offered to return the property,\" or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>any part of it. The property has in large part been sold or otherwise disposed of in the course of the bankruptcy administration. Under these circumstances we are of opinion that the trustee, the appellant in this case, was bound by the agreement of the receiver, that all the property in dispute should be conclusively deemed that which passed under the original conditional contract or. the proceeds thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
