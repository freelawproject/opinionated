Congress must be presumed, therefore, to have known the reason and theory which had led to the enactment of the five per cent exemption- of banking. circulation from taxation, the. specific conditions which it was designed to meet; and the kind of circulation to which it originally referred, and; further, to have known that mainly, if not entirely, as a result of the previous legislation in question, national bank circulation had superseded state bank circulation and had become the recognized 'form of currency of the country. With full knowledge of. these facts Congress deliberately enacted, under \u00a7 3411, the provisions of the previous law, and exempted the outstandr ing circulation of any bank from taxation when the same was reduced to an amount not exceeding five per cent of its capital, as the percentage of bank notes likely to be lost or destroyed in circulation is at least as great in the case of national banks as of state banks, and theoretically the principle of the exemption is equally as appropriate to the one kind of circulation as to the other.'</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-5\">The construction placed by the court below upon \u00a7 3411, is not tenable, for the* reason that it would render \u00a7 3416 nugatory. The result of such a construction would be an unjust discrimination against the circulation of national banks. \u25a0</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b65-6\">Upon any principle of construction the &lt; Court of Claims erred in restricting the general language of \u00a7 3411 to th\u00e9 particular case of national banks succeeding state banks by conversion, and rightly construed, \u00a7 3411, as it stood in the orig<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>inal law,' extended to any and all state banks an exemption from taxation upon their circulation when the same ..was reduced to an amount not exceeding five per cent of the capital, and the exemption aforesaid proceeded upon the assumption that five per cent of outstanding circulation was lost or destroyed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av9\">When, therefore, Congress carried this general principle of tax exemption info the Revised Statutes, and in express terms provided that the benefits of the principle should be extended to-national banks, it thereby intended to apply t\u00f3 the circulation of national banks the same' principle which it had theretofore applied to ..the circulation of -state banks.

Stat., so far as they relate to the sub-' ject under discussion, to exempt from taxation on circulation only the five per cent of' state bank notes which might be outstanding.

For nearly, thirty years after its organization as a national bank, that is, up to July 1,1904, the bank was assessed for and paid 'the duty of one-half of one per cent upon the average-amount of its notes in circulation, in conformity with \u00a7 5214, Rev. Stat. Availing itself of the right conferred by \u00a7 5218, Rev! Stat., copied in the'margin,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the bank made application to be refunded the sum of $4,713.01, on the ground that in making certain of the half-yearly payments under \u00a7 5214 there had been a, miscalculation, and besides, because of \u00e1n error of law, some of the half-yearly payments had been exacted when the bank was exempt. We put aside so much of the claim as was'based upon mere errors of calculation, as ri\u00f3 contention on that subject is here presented. , \u2018</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">\u2022 The alleged error of law or asserted right to exemption rests upon the .assumption that by the operation of \u00a7 3411, Rev. , Stat., the bank -was not. liable to pay the half-yearly duty on.' its outstanding circulation wheneverthe amount of its circulation fell below five per cent of its capital, a contingency, which \u2022it-was insisted, had arisen during certain of the half-yearly-periods b\u00e9tweeri January, 1888, and July, 1904. The request to be refunded having been rejected by the.Treasur\u00e9r of the . United States, this suit was coinmenced and this appeal was taken from\" a judgment in favor of the United States. 42 Ct. Cls. 6. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">' In the argument for the bank it is stated that all-the errors relied-.upon are embraced'in the following propositions: -.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>\u201c1. The said court erred in holding and deciding that the claimant, being a national bank, was not exempt from taxation on its notes in circulation during the half-yearly periods when the average amount of its said notes was less than five per centum of-its chartered capital.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b69-3\">\u25a0 \u201c 2. The said court erred in holding and deciding that \u00a7 3411,. Revised Statutes, relates solely to the taxation of the outstanding circulating notes of state banks which had ceased to exist or had been converted i\u00f1to national banks, and did not limit the claimant\u2019s liability to 'taxation on its own outstanding circulation.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">Without presently determining whether the right to be refunded, even if otherwise well founded, was without merit because of the voluntary nature of the payments or the effect of the statute of limitations, we come to consider the merits of the contention. It depends upon whether \u00a7 5214, Rev. Stat., is limited and controlled by the provisions of \u00a7 3411, Rev. Stat. The two sections are as follows\":</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adtt\">\u201cSec. 5214. In lieu of all existing taxes, every association shall pay to the Treasurer' of the United States, in the months of January and July, a duty of one-half of one per centum each half-year upon- the average amount of its notes in circulation, and a duty of one-quarter of one per centum each- half-year/ upon the average amount of its deposits; and a duty of one-quarter ,of one per centum each half-year on the .average amount of 'its capital stock;' beyond the amount invested in United States bonds.!\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A_H\">\u201cSec. 3411. Whenever the outst\u00e1nding circulation of afiy/ bank, association, corporation,\" company, or person is reduced to \u00bfn amount not exceeding five p\u00e9r centum of the Chartered' or declared capital existing at the time the same was issued,said circul\u00e1tion shall be free from taxation; and whenever any bank which has' ceased to-issue notes for circulation deposits in the Treasury of the United States, in lawful money, the amount of its outstanding circulation, to be rede\u00e9med at par, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>prescribe, it shall be: exempt from any tax upon such circulation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">It is insisted that the sections, considered as' applicable to the same subject, are harmonious, and that giving effect to both, while leaving a national banking association liable to the duty imposed by \u00a7 5214, will yet entitle it to the exemption provided in \u00a73411 when the contingency stated'in-that section has come, ;to p\u00e1ss. And as this result, it is' argued, is' clear and free from, all doubt, considering the -text of the two sections, recourse may not be had to legislation:, prior to the Revised Statutes, from which the provisions of the sections were drawn, in Order to arrive at their correct meaning. , Reference to such prior legislation, it is insisted, cannot be resorted to- for the' purpose of creating a doubt, but only to .solve one otherwise arising from the text, citing <em>Hamilton v. Rathbone, </em>175 U. S. <em>418; Bate Refrigerating Co, </em>v. <em>Sulzberger, </em>157 U. S. 1, 36, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">Accurately considering the text of. the two sections and the context of the respective titles of the Revised Statutes in which they are found, we think .the contention that the sections ar\u00e9 free1'from ambiguity and may be harmoniously applied .without the necessity of construction, is without imerit. It is conceded, that forthe more than thirty-five years since the enactment .of the Revised- Statutes, in the administration of-the .national-bank. act, national banking. associations have been required to and have .without question paid the half-yearly duty on circulation, wholly irrespective of the ex\u00e9mption provided.in \u00a7 3411, a condition which'clearly suffices, to say the .least, to -engender doubt -as to the. correctness of the belated contention mow. urged. Besides, the sections \u00e1re in different titles of the Revised Statutes,- the one \u2022(\u25a0\u00a7 3411) Internal Revenue, the other (\u00a7 5214) National Banks. While \u00a7 5214 and the other sections contained in' the title in which it is found leave no- doubt that \u00a7 5214 was .intended to deal with'the outstanding circulation .of national banks, not only the text of \u00a7 3411, but the' other-sections of .the chapter under the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>title Internal Revenue in which it is found, cause it to be questionable whether that section is at all. concerned with the subject of the circulating notes of a national banking association. As suggesting doubt and ambiguity concerning the contention that national banking associations are embraced within the enumeration of banks and bankers made in \u00a7 3411, whose outstanding circulation would become \u201cfree from-taxation\u201d in the specified contingency, it is to be observed that the enumeration conforms generally to that made in other sections of the chapter, which other enumerations clearly relate only to state banks and private bankers. \u2022 Indeed, this is strengthened by the fact that in the Revised Statutes associations organized under the national-bank act are distinctively characterized as. national banking associations, and that their designation by that call is explicitly made use of in various sections of. the chapter in which \u00a7 3411 appears. In view (a) of the distinct provisions as to the circulating notes of national banks, found in the appropriate title of the Revised Statutes, <em>(b) </em>of the general'subjeet to which the chapter in which \u00a7 3411 is contained relates, and (c) that in that chapter, when it was deemed essential to legislate concerning national banking associations, they were specially designated by that appellation,- it would seem to result that it cannot possibly be said that \u00a7 3411 clearly has relation to the outstanding circulation of national banking associations. Moreover, the assumption that, considering the text of the two sections and treating them as relating to the same subject, they are each susceptible \u00f3f being fully enforced,. is a mistaken one. The duty upon the outstanding circulation imposed by \u00a7 5214 is assessed half-yearly, not upon.the amount outstanding at any particular time, but upon the average for the six- months. Section 3411, however, provides that the outstanding ^circulation to which it refers \u201cshall be .free from tax\u00e1tion whenever such outstanding circulation is reduced to an amount not exceeding five per centum of the chartered or declared capital existing at the time the same was issued,\u201d a provision-which clearly contemplates a positive and perma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>nent exemption to arise from the reduction to the limit specified and wholly incompatible with the system of average provided in \u00a7 5214. This results because by that system' of average, even although the sum of the outstanding circulation of' a national banking association might, on a particular day or days of a half-yearly period, \u2018fall below five per centum of its capital, yet the duty.to be paid would attach wholly without reference to that, condition, and be determined by the average for the si\u00e1\u00ed months. Besides, when there is taken into account the plain, meaning of the concluding portion of \u00a7 3411, concerning a deposit with the Treasurer of the United States of money to meet outstanding circulation of the banks embraced within that section, it becomes manifest that the circulation referred to in \u00a7 3411 cannot be the circulation of a national banking association referred to in \u00a7 5214, since the method of deposit of money to secure the payment of outstanding circulation provided by \u00a7 3411 is absolutely in conflict with the methods provided for securing and redeeming outstanding circulation of national' banking associations, as expressly provided in the sections of the Revised Statutes concerning national banking associations, which sections are cognate to and insepafably connected with the provisions of \u00a7 5214: And, beyond all this, it is apparent that to treat the outstanding circulation referred to in \u00a73411 as embracing the outstanding circulation of national banking associations, contemplated by \u00a7 5214, would require it to be held that the very purpose intended to be accomplished by the national-bank act was frustrated by the exemption accorded by \u00a7 3411. It has long b\u00e9en settled that one of the public policies embodied in the national-bank act was to'secure the public credit and encourage the issue of notes to circulate as currency, founded upon the security of the bonds of the United States, a purpose which would be directly discouraged by exempting a national banking association which reduced its circulation below'five per centum of it.k capital from the payment of .a duty thereon, and yet enforcing the payment of such duty against a national bank which had not reduced its out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>standing circulation to. the limit stated.. In addition, as the half-yearly- duty provided by \u00a7 5214 was intended, among other things at least, to create a general fund for paying the cost of engraving and printing the circulating notes of national' banking associations <em>(Twin City Bank </em>v. <em>Nebeker, </em>167 U. S. 196), \u00a7 3411 could not be construed as now claim\u00e9d without giving rise to the assumption that it was without reason intended to exempt-national, banking associations which might choose to allow their circulation to fall below five per centum from a burden which, in the nature of-things, was common to all each banks.</p>\n<p id=\"AUa\">But, in effect, it is argued, conceding that all the ambiguities just stated .arise from treating-the two sections as relating to the same subject, and from seeking to harmoniously enforce them on that hypothesis, yet there is no warrant for considering the genesis of the provisions in order to dispel the apparent conflict between them, because of the express terms of \u00a7 3417, Rev. Stat., found in the same chapter which embraces \u00a7 3411. The- section relied upon is in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It will be observed that it is expressly declared therein that the provisions of the chapter in which the section is contained shall \u201cnot .apply to associations which are taxed under and by virtue of title National Banks.\u201d This declaration, however, is limited by the words \u201cexcept as contained in sections,\u201d, which are enumerated, one of- them being \u00a7 3411. . From this it is argued that,whatever may otherwise be the conflict between \u00a7 5214 and \u00a73411, construed together, as \u00a7 3417 causes \u00a73411 to be broadly applicable to national banking associations, that section must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>be treated as limiting and controlling the provisions of \u00a7 5214. \u2022But \u00a7 3417, unless it be treated as surplusage, implies that \u00a7 3411 might not in and of itself be broadly applicable to national banking associations. While there is no doubt that the result of \u00a7 3417 is to cause \u00a7 3411 to be applicable to national banks, the doubt and ambiguity which must arise from the attempt to make that provision broadly applicable so as to cause it to be controlling upon \u00a7 5214 is in nowise removed by \u00a7 3417. In other words, giving full effect to \u00a7 3417 requires us yet to'determine the nature and extent of the application of the provisions of \u00a7 3411' to national banking associations, a determination, as we have seen, essential in order to reconcile the confusion and contradiction which \u2022 otherwise would prevail from the co-association of the provisions without limitation or interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">A consideration of the origin of the provisions at once demonstrates the unsoundness. of the contention relied upon, establishes the correctness of the administrative construction which has prevailed from the beginning, and dispels the confusion and contradiction which necessarily results from the interpretation contended for. We need not specifically .trace and develop the origin of the provisions, since it is expressly conceded in the argument for the appellant that \u201cthe provisions of the acts of Congress . . . which are carried into the Revised Statutes as \u00a7\u00a73407-3417 did, not, <em>when and as originally passed, </em>relate to national banks or to the circulation of national banks, but related to state and private banks. . . .\u201d So, also, it is conceded that, wholly irrespective of the provisions of the national-bank act of 1864, there was imposed by acts of Congress relating to internal revenue burdens of taxation so heavy upon the circulation of state banks and private bankers, as,-by their necessary operation, caused the retirement of such circulation as far as possible. Nor need we refer specially to the origin-of \u00a7 3411, since it is conceded that the provision was enacted originally in order not to compel the payment by state banks, of a tax on circulation when such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>circulation no longer existed, upon the assumption that if ninety-five per .cent had been 'retired the remainder was no longer in existence, or, at all events, was not within the power of the b\u00e1nk to retire. It is also unquestioned that where a state bank had become converted into a national bank, or . where a national bank had assumed the liabilities of a state bank, the national bank was liable, in addition to the duty on its own circulation, to the payment of the internal revenue tax upon the outstanding circulation of the state bank absorbed by it or the liabilities of which had been assumed, and that as to such circulation national banks were given the b\u00e9nefit of the presumption. of loss or destruction or possible retirement when' all but five per cent of the circulation of the state bank had been actually retired. The concrete result of the provisions just stated and of the antecedent legislation are aptly portrayed in the reenactment in \u00a7 14 ,of the act of July 13, 1866 (14 Stat. 98, 1461-147, c. 184), of previous provisions on the subject, said \u00a7 14 reading as follows :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">\u201cThat the capital of any state bank or banking association which has- ceased or. shall cease to exist, or which has been or shall be converted into a national bank, shall be assumed to be the capital as it existed immediately before such bank ceased to exist or was converted as aforesaid; and whenever the outstanding circulation of any bank, association, corporation, company, or person shall be reduced to an amount not exceeding five per centum of the chartered or declared capital existing at the time the same was issued, said circulation shall be free from taxation; and whenever any banlc which has ceased to issue notes for circulation shall deposit in the Treasury of the United States, in lawful money, the amount of its outstanding circ\u00falation, to be redeemed at par, under such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury shall prescribe, it shall be exempt from any tax upon such circulation; and whenever any state bank or banking association has been converted into a national banking association, and such national banking association has assumed the liabilities of such state bank or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>banking association, including the redemption of its bills, by any agreement or understanding whatever with the representatives of such state bank or' banking association, such national banking association shall be held to make the required return and payment on the circulation outstanding, so long as such circulation shall exceed five per centum of the capital before such conversion of such state bank or banking association.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">It is apparent that these provisions were in substance adopted in the Revised Statutes and now constitute \u00a7 \u00a7 3410, 3411 and 3416, and that as ihumined.by the history which we have given it clearly results that the provision of \u00a7 3417, expressly making \u00a7 3411 applicable to national banking associations, caused that section to apply not in the broad sense now claimed, but that it was expressly made applicable in order, beyond peradventure, to give to national banks, as representing state banks, the benefit of the presumption of loss or inability to retire the circulation of the state bank when such circulation had been reduced by ninety-five per centum of the volume thereof.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">It is strenuously argued that to thus construe the provisions in question will destroy the effect of the revision by causing one or more of the sections contained in the revision to become redundant or superfluous. To test this contention we must recur to the provision of the act of 1866, which has been previously quoted. By that provision, a, What should constitute the sum of the capital of a state bank .for the purpose of taxation was declared; <em>b, </em>The right to an exemption of circulation, when such circulation was less than five per cent, was also declared, and the power to deposit money with the Treasurer of the United States to the extent of the outstanding circulation and thus avoid .the continuance of a tax thereon was also given; c, The liability of a national.banking .association for the tax upon the circulation \u00f3f a state bank which had been assumed as well as the right of the national banking association to. the benefits of the exemption when ninety-five per cent of the circulation of the state bank had been retired was also expressed. The argument is that to give <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>to \u00a73411 the restrictive significance we have adopted is to render \u00a7 3416 superfluous. It is inde\u00e9d true that the effect of the construction in an extremely narrow and technical sense might be considered as operating \u00e1 redundancy. But the asserted redundancy is more seeming than real, as \u00a7 '3416 was plainly not enacted in order to reiterate what was expressly or impliedly embodied in \u00a7 3411, but was to declare the- obligation of a national bank in a stated contingency to make return and payment on the outstanding circulation of a state bank which was subject to taxation.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-3\">The elaborate argument made at bar, to the effect that Congress at the time \u00f3f the revision must have contemplated' the non-existence of state banks and the extinguishment of their circulation, and, therefore, must be considered as having intended to make \u00a7 3411 applicable to the outstanding circulation of national banks, is, we think, so clearly in conflict with the plain manifestation of the purpose of Congress, as shown by the reenactment in the revision of the provisions as to state banks and their circulation, as to' require no further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b68-10\"> Sec. 5218.
