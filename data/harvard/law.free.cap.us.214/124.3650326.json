W. Parish,'\u25a0 of whose estate, relator, is executrix, entered into a contract with the United States,' as j. W. Parish &amp; Company, to deliver, for the us\u00e9 of the United States medical department at Memphis, St. Louis and Cairo the whole amount of ice required to-be consumed during the remainder of year 1863. The quality of the ic\u00e9 was to be, \u201c A No. 1,\u201d and. the contract stated the prices to be paid at the designated '.points respectively. On March 25, 1863, Joseph B. Brown, by instruction of the Assistant Surgeon -General, issued' an \u25a0order directing Parish to deliver the ice as follows: St. Louis 5.000 tons, Cairo 5,000-tons, Memphis 10,000 tons and Nashville 10,000 tons, \u2018\u2018making a total/\u2019 the. order recited, \u201cof 30.000 tons which you have'contracted to deliver. The ice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>be delivered at Nashville and Memphis is for the use of the sick of the armies in the field, and should be furnished without delay.\u201d Parish .immediately proceeded to execute the order, and was .performing it when, on' March 31, 1863, he received a-letter from the Assistant' SurgeonGeneral, under -instructions of the Surgeon General, suspending the order of March 25 until instructions should be received from the Surgeon General. At the date of this letter 12,768 tons of ice had been delivered and paid for at the contract price. .The order of suspension was never recalled. Under the authority of- an act of Congress, approved May 31, 1872, Parish brought suit against the United States to enforce his demand under the contract. The Court of Claims dismissed the suit. 12 Ct. Cl. 609. This court reversed the judgment and remanded the case, with directions to ascertain the damages sustained by Parish. 100 U. S. 500. The Court of Claims rendered judgment for the claimant for the sum of $10,444.91. 16 Ct. Cl. 642. Parish then petitioned Congress to satisfy as much of- his claim as had not been satisfied by the Court of Claims. Responding to a reference by a committee of the House of Representatives, the War Department, through the Surgeon General, reported that the whole of the undelivered ice, through the order of suspension^ amounted to 17,232 tons, and the same had been lost by the contractor. The report also stated that under the evidence before the Court of Claims, and additional evidence before the department, 'Parish was entitled t\u00f3 be reimbursed) in- addition to the judgment of the Court of Claims, in the sum of $58,341.85, for the loss he had sustained because of the non-delivery of the 17,232 tons. After this report, on February 20, 188.6, Congress passed an act directing payment of said sum of $58,341.85 to Parish, in addition to said sum of $10,444.91, being the balance of money laid out and expended by him in the purchase of 17,232 tons of -ice'for the use and at the request, of the Government of the United States, which were not afterwards called for, but were wholly lost to the said Parish\u2019 24 Stat. 653.

And. that is a business as purely addressed to the judgment and discretion of the Secretary as can be -imagined. ' '</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-7\">. The weighing of evidence and drawing conclusions from it are two of the most important and characteristic functions qf the judiciary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-8\">It is not to be supposed that practical men in Congress intended the .public moneys to-be paid out until there should be <em>a </em>full and complete examination of the claim and a determination, as a result thereof, that a balance was really .and fairly due the claimant.by virtue of a .contract.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-9\">He is to get his facts from-the evidencecoll\u00e9cted.\u201d He is -not told to regard the. findings of the Court of Claims or decisions5 of-ti\u00ede Supreme Court, or the act of'1886. allowing the $58,000' partly on evidence said, to be on file in the War Department, as so many things.adjudicated.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-10\">On -the contrary, he- is to examine the claim, denoro in spite of the most solemn and authoritative adjudications ommatters of fact'and law. -</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-11\">Th\u00e9 theory of standing by adjudications obviously would be fatal to the\" appellant\u2019s c\u00e1se,</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adj\">. \u2022 It. is because\" the Supreme Court Says the Court of Claims had erred .and the committees.Said this court had blundered that the Secretary is .called in to examine the evidence \u2022 collected \u00e1nd maker a full and complete examination in the light Of that and of the'- supposedly nev? and improved rule of-<em>Behan\u2019s case, </em>for the measure-of damages.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b159-13\">From this it follows that he can make up his own mind \u00e1s to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u2022vhow many tons were actually purchased, paid for, and not delivered.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN\">' He might reach a wholly different conclusion from that attributed to the Surgeon General in 1886, especially \u00bfs he has not the same evidence before him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">Appellant did not, as that rule contemplates, lose these profits because the one party prevented .delivery without fault of the other party. The Court of Claims found he was not in a condition to deliver the ice because transportation was impossible, That ,was not the other party\u2019s fault, but his mis-v fortune or miscalculation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-6\">Nor is there any.room in this cas\u00e9, and especially as to that ice, for the principle that failure to tender is no breach, if the other party clearly shows that acceptance would be declined. For the record, indicates, it seems to us, that the Government took about all the ice that was actually offered to it and could be delivered under the contract. Ice in large quantities was. taken at all four places \u2014 St. Louis, Cairo, Memphis, Nashville. \u2022And there is no indication that any ice was declined.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-7\">We understand that the question here, as the case is pre-. sented, is, Shall the Secretary be ordered to accept the finding of the auditor as conclusive?</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-8\">. Obviously the special act does not .require that he should. That is too plain for argument.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-9\">However, supposing a proper case had been presented to raise the'other question,. Was the Secretary given a mere order to do <em>&amp; </em>thing about which people could not differ or was he ordered to use his judgment? ' The answer is equally obvious.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b160-10\">Mr. Justice McKenna,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqr\">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">It will be observed that the controversy in this case started in a contract of no uncertainty of meaning, and an ordinary' action for damages for its breach, but has accumulated- inci-' dents and complexity, ancfhas.finally terminated in a dispute ov\u00e9r an ambiguous statute'..</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>The case was submitted in the Supreme Court of the District upon what may be called a demurrer to the return, which was regarded, and is now regarded, as presenting the question of the power of the Secretary of the Treasury under the act of Congress. This is the ultimate question. If that officer had the power, which he asserts in his return, to review the evidence taken in the Court of Claims, and to \u201cmake such findings\u201d as might \u201cseem right and proper to him,\u201d the judgment of the Court of Appeals must be affirmed. As we may not control the Secretary\u2019s discretion <em>(Riverside Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Hitchcock, </em>190 U. S. 316), we can have no concern with the reasoning advanced by him to support its exercise.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">As' we have seen, in the first suit brought by Parish the Court of Claims decided against him. It based its decision on the ground that the Assistant Surgeon General had no \u201cright to interpret the contract and decide that it called for 30,000 tons of ice, and direct how it should be delivered.\u201d The court, however, found the facts. It found as follows: \u201cIX. The said Parish was <em>prepared' and willing </em>[italics ours] to deliver the said 30,000 tons of ice in conformity with the conditions and obligations of his said contract and the terms of said letter of March 25, 1863, of. which the defendant had notice, but they would not, nor did receive more than the 12,768 tons aforesaid.\u201d This finding is quoted in the reports of the Congressional committees as one of the elements inducing their recommendation of the passage of the bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">This court disagreed with the Court of Claims upon the question of the authority of the Assistant Surgeon General, and reversed that court, but decided that the measure of Parish\u2019s damages was \u201cthe cost of ice purchased at Lake Pepin and lost, the expense bestowed upon its care and the time and expense of making that purchase, and any sum actually lost in regard to the other 17,232 tons of ice purchased to enable them to meet the requirements.\u201d This ruling was based on the assumption that Parish \u201cheither delivered nor offered to deliver the remainder,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The Court of Claims, upon the return of the case to it, found obstruction in its rules to taking additional evidence, but on that before it made an award in favor of Parish in the sum of $10,444.91. \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">He was dissatisfied, and justly dissatisfied. He appealed to Congress, the petition alleges, and respondent does not deny the. allegation, for \u201cthe means of satisfying so much of his claim as the court of last, resort had adjudicated to be his unquestionable right.\u201d The petition further alleges (again with no denial by respondent) that his \u201c claim was referred by the House committee to the War Department for report. The Surgeon General found that the whole amount of undelivered ice, viz., 17,232'tons, was lost to said Parish, and ascertained the cost thereof.\u201d Congress passed an act February 20, 1886, appropriating the sum of $58,341.85 to pay that loss. 24 Stat. 653-654. By the payment of the money appropriated, Parish received the contract price on the ice actually delivered, namely, 12,768 tons, and, in addition, what he had actually spent and' actually lost on account of the balance, namely, 17,232 tons of ice. This is not denied, nor that that which was paid to him was only that which this court had decided should have been paid to him January 1, 1864. \u201cThat is to say,\u201d to quote from the petition, \u201cthe said Parish had not only lost the interest on this large sum of money for more than two decades, but had been forced to meet the expense of litigating the claim, and had been subjected to the labors and anxieties and trials of prosecuting the same.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">The next step was the passage of the act in controversy and we come to its consideration and the determination of how its ambiguity, if indeed it have any, is to be resolved. It had, we may say at the start of our discussion, its impulse in the belief that injury had been done to Parish, and it was intended to provide a means of redress. Keeping in view this purpose, we may get light by which to interpret the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">As we have already said, the ruling of this court in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>United States, </em>100 U. S. 500, was based on the assumption that \u2022 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>Parish had \u201cneither delivered nor offered to deliver\u201d the 17,232 tons of ice, the non-acceptance of which has given rise to this controversy. Commenting on that declaration the committees of Congress called it a \u201cmistaken allegation\u201d and a \u201cfalse assumption,\u201d and said that the decision of the court turned upon it. The committees further said that the court \u201centirely overlooked\u201d finding IX of the Court of Claims, and that the \u201c result of this oversight was to cause the court to lay down a rule of damages inconsistent with the facts and unjust to the parties.1 The committees then reviewed certain cases, among others <em>United States </em>v. <em>Behan, </em>110 U. S. 338, and declared that the latter case established the <em>prima facie </em>measure of damages for a breach of a contract sustained by the injured party to consist of \u201ctwo distinct items or grounds of damage, namely, first, what he has already expended toward performance less the value of material on hand; secondly, the profits that he would realize by performing the whole contract.\u201d The report recognized that profits cannot always be recovered, that they may be remote and speculative, incapable of that clear and direct proof which the law requires. But it is manifest that the committees did not think the case palled for that limitation, for it was said that the reasons for the application of the \u201cequitable rules in the <em>Behan case </em>were-not nearly so clear and strong as in the <em>Parish case,\u201d </em>and declared as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">\u201cIn the latter case the contract expressly provided what should be paid for the ice delivered at the various places najned. -The profits, therefore, were readily and easily ascertainable. In fact, that was the theory of the plaintiff in making his case before the Court of Claims, and the record of that court shows that the proofs on that point were explicit, bringing the case properly within the principles laid down in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Behan.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-6\">\u201cIn a word, it is perfectly clear that the Supreme Court quite overlooked one of the most important findings of fact in the <em>Parish case. </em>At all events, there is no doubt that the law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>is properly stated in the <em>Behan case. </em>And all the present bill contemplates is a final and proper settlement on the rule of law which is older than our .republic, and is everywhere recognized as the only equitable one that can be applied in the premises.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">\u25a0 It is <em>manifest\u00a1 </em>therefore, 'that the act was passed under the conviction that Parish had rights which had not been satisfied, and we are brought to the consideration of the act as the means of satisfying them.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">The act provides'\u201cthat the Secretary of the Treasury is hereby authorized and directed'to make full and complete examination into the claim of Joseph W. Parish against the United States for balances alleged to be due him by virtue of a contract made by Joseph W. Parish <em>&amp; </em>Co., with Henry Jdhnson, medical storekeeper, acting on behalf of- the United States. . . . That the Secretary shall determine and ascertain the <em>full amount which should have been paid said J. W. Parish &amp; Co., if the said contract had been carried out in full without change or default made by either, of the parties thereto, </em>[italics ours] under the ruling of the measure of damages laid down by the Supreme Court of the United State\u2019s in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Behan, </em>110 U. S. 338, and <em>in accordance with the evidence in the case collected by the United States Court of Claims </em>[italics ours], and for determining the full amount thus due, . . . under said- contract and rule of law aforesaid, to deduct therefrom all payments' . . . stating what balance, if any, is due under the ruling and evidence presented herein, and pay the said balance to\u2019 said Joseph W. Parish, the present.owner of said claim; and sufficient money to pay such balances is hereby appropriated out of any\u2019money in the Treasury which has not been otherwise appropriated.\u201d 32 Stat. 1612, c.-559, February 17, 1903.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">The. issue between the parties in their ultimate statement is as follows: Relator contends that the Secretary whs directed to ascertain -what amount Parish should receive under the contract, \u201cwhich he yas ready, able and willing to carry out.\u201d Respondent.contends that the Secretary was to pass on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>evidence taken in the Court of Claims, and make such finding as might seem right and proper to him. In other words, to exereise judgment and discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">To sustain their respective contentions the parties do not urge the same words as the tests of the meaning of the statute. The appellant, to determine the Secretary\u2019s duty, puts emphasis on the provision.that he was to ascertain the \u201cfull amount which should have been paid ... if the contract had been carried out in full, without change or default made by either of the .parties thereto.\u201d Respondent finds difficulty with that provision, and says that \u201cat first glance\u201d it \u201cmay look positive and arbitrary.\u201d But, it is urged that the clause \u201cdoes not say which <em>would </em>have been paid, but which \u2018should\u2019 have been paid, and when we turn to the \u2018contract\u2019 an ambiguity immediately arises, because the contract, \u2018carried out in full,\u2019 did not call for any particular quantity, of ice.\u201d \u25a0 And to remove the effect of the certainty in the quantity of ice required made by the order for 30,000 tons, it is said that the \u201cspecial act nowhere speaks of this order, but Only of the contract.\u201d The final comment is-that \u201cno other clause of the act seems, to be worth quoting as an unambiguous .order to make an arbitrary calculation and allowance,\u201d while the act \u201cin places unequivocally requires something different from an arbitrary, calculation.\u201d To support this it is urged that the act directs a full and complete examination of Parish\u2019s claim for a balance alleged to be due him by virtue of the contract. To do this, it is argued, \u201cwould require as much \u25a0judgment and discretion as the Secretary could muster.\u201d A striking contrast is exhibited to this by declaring that the duty required of t.he Secretary under appellant\u2019s contention was \u201cto do a sum' in arithmetic which any school boy Could do in five minuted; that is,- multiply the prices per ton with the 30,000 tons and deduct the amount already paid, as per receipts on file in the Treasury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">It is elementary that all the words of the statute must be considered in determining its meaning, and we may not, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>therefore, disregard the provision of the statute which directs the Secretary to determine and ascertain the full amount which should have been paid if the said <em>contract had been carried out in full without change or default made by either of the parties. </em>And it seems to us that these words express the subject of inquiry, the exact command to the Secretary to which the other provisions of the statute are subordinate. He was not to determine if Parish was in default. That inquiry was precluded. It had been adjudged otherwise by the Court of Claims and by this court. It had been declared otherwise by the legislature. The act of Congress of February 20, 1886, passed to complete the judgments of the courts, appropriated the sum of $58,341.85, \u201cbeing the balance of money laid out and expended by him (Parish) in the purchase of 17,232 tons of ice, for the use and at the request of the Government of the United States, which were not afterwards called for, but <em>were wholly lost to said Parish\u201d </em>(the italics ours).</p>\n<p id=\"A7H\">The following things therefore, had been determined: The existence of a contract for the delivery \u00f3f ice, quantity not mentioned, at different points and at different prices. The quantity was afterwards fixed at 30,000 tons and the contract made specific in every particular, quantity, quality, places of delivery and prices. Performance was undertaken and 12,768 tons delivered. Then came the order of suspension \u2014 not revo-' cation, it must be kept in mind, and Parish had to keep prepared.' He was not permitted to fulfill his contract,'he dared not be unprepared to do so upon any notice. This court in <em>Parish </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>has portrayed the situation. The demand upon him was \u201can unequivocal demand,\u201d the court said, for 30,000 tons, and \u201cto enable' him to fulfill this demand . . . required promptitude and diligence in se-' curing the ice.\u201d The court states why. A moment\u2019s reflection on the situation shows us why. The ice was needed for the us.e of the armies in the field. It might be demanded at anytime. The necessity for it might be imperative. If Parish could not have supplied it, this court said, the officers of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>Government would have procured it at any price in the market, a price which would have been enormously enhanced by that very demand, and Parish would have been liable for the difference between such price and the contract price. He was, therefore, this court said, \u201cunder an imperative necessity to prepare to fulfill this requirement.\u201d He realized his situation, and that he prepared against its contingencies was the finding of the Court of Claims, it was the declaration of Congress in the act of February 20, 1886, and it was the repeated declaration of the committees of Congress in their recommendation of the passage of the act in controversy. We see now the reason for regarding the opening clause of the act as its principal and dominating clause. We see now why his readiness to perform, the possession of the means of performance and the offer of performance were to be assumed by the-Secretary and the loss of profits only was to be determined. And the profits, the committees said, \u201cwere readily and easily ascertainable.\u201d Indeed, because they were, their calculation was referred to an executive officer. If to ascertain them involved an intricate judicial problem the reference would have been to the judicial tribunals, for we cannot agree with the intimation of the Government that Congress would imagine that the Court of Claims, and this court were unable \u201cto master the difficulties\u201d of that problem. The better supposition is that Congress regarded the controversy as over and that the time for reparation had arrived, and, that it might be quick and complete, referred the matter to that officer who could best state the balance due and pay it.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">It does not militate with this conclusion that the duty enjoined was simple. The committees of Congress believed it to be so, believed that the extent of relief to which Parish was entitled and the items of it had been established. The act in controversy was the expression of that belief. Its purpose was relief shown to be due from a problem already solved, not to start another problem. The duty enjoined required a reference in a sense to evidence, it may be, but it was to evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>whose probative force had been estimated and declared. It conduced to but one-conclusion. That conclusion was stated by the Auditor of the War Department, following the direction of the statute, to be a balance in Parish\u2019s favor of $181,358.95. This amount represented the amount that Parish should have received over and above what he was paid by direct payment, judgment or appropriation by Congress and the balance due him under the. rule in the <em>Behan case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">\n<em>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and that court isr directed to reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court and direct the latter court to sustain the demurrer of relator to the return of respondent and enter judgment as prayed for in petition of relator.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b168-7\">Mr. Justice Moody took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
