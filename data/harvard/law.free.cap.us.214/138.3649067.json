(2) It is made the duty of the Commissioners of the District to notify the owner or owners of every lot required by the act to be connected with a public sewer or water main, as the case may be, to so connect such lot, the work to be done in accordance with the regulations governing plumbing and house drainage in the District.

We do not give them, because two only are relied on, to wit, that the record .does not show that notice was mailed to her as provided by \u00a7 4, and that the record fails to disclose that any nuisance existed on her property or that the means of drainage already there were unsanitary or insufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b171-5\">A rule to show cause was issued, to which the District made return.

It says:</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b172-13\">\u201c If h\u00e9 lives in the District or can be found here, his premises may not be molested but he may be fined.

R.

Gertman </em>was on the brief, for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-5\">The act of Congress here in question is unconstitutional and void. This contention is based upon certain salient vices in the act which are apparent on its face, of which the principal are:</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-6\">(a) The attempt to give controlling evidential effect to: the mere existence of an improvement in case of improved property, and to the <em>ex parte </em>certificate of the health officer in the case of unimproved property, thus violating the <em>\u201c </em>due process\u201d clause of the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-7\">(ib) Because the act lacks the requisite uniformity inasmuch as it undertakes to provide one law for property of resident and another for property of non-resident owners in said District.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-8\">(c) Because the act is. not capable of universal enforcement, and creates unequal burdens.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-9\"><em>(d) </em>Because the act is incapable of uniform enforcement as against all property in the District of Columbia;</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-10\">Perusal of the act will clearly disclose the absolute lack of uniformity which is essential to the validity of such an act even though it be considered that it embodies a lawful exercise of the so-called police power, under the guise of which so many attacks have been made upon the due process and uniformity clauses in the Constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b175-11\">The invalidity of such an act has been shown in the opinion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>in <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>24 App. D. C. 22. That case involved the validity of the snow and ice law which the court declared to be most beneficial in its purpose and which the court expressed its desire to sustain, yet it found itself unable to do so, and by unanswerable reasoning determined upon the grounds stated in the opinion that the act was unconstitutional. See, also, <em>Heylman </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>27 App. D. C. 563.</p>\n<p data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-6\">The act involved in this case is far more vicious in form.</p>\n<p data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-7\">If the purpose of the law is to be effective as against all the property coming within this act, then the means to make it so must, of course, be found in the act itself, and yet in certain situations neither the Commissioners nor anybody else would have any power to enforce such connection as against the resident owner who elects to pay the fine rather than comply with the notice. It is apparent that to make the legislation, valid, power should be given to the Commissioners to make the connection in all cases, and to pay the cost out of the emergency fund' so that the act .shall apply equally to all classes of property, and. in the absence of such authority this act furnishes no uniform and effective means for its enforcement, and therefore it fails to subserve the purpose of its enactment. To put it differently, in the act under consideration there is apparently one law, namely, a civil one, for .owners not found in the District, and another law, namely, a criminal one, for those who are found in the District. As to one class the Commissioners are given the power to make good the requirements of the law by making the connection, while as to the other class such power is withheld from the Commissioners.</p>\n<p data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b176-8\">If the language of the law is to be interpreted as though it read, that in case the owner or owners of a lot cannot be found in the District, leaving out the words \u201cbe anon-resident or non-residents of the District,\u201d which is the most favorable construction that can be given to the act, we have two separate and distinct ^classes of persons to which the law has an unequal- application so far as their liability is concerned \u2014 to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>class found in the District, a criminal liability \u2014 to the class not so found, a civil liability; and moreover, as already stated, the law is capable of-exact enforcement for the purpose for which it was enacted as to the class of owners not found in the District, while the contrary is true as to those found therein.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b177-5\">Me. Justice McKenna,</author>\n<p id=\"Aoa\">after making the foregoing statement, delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Defendant in error, to sustain her contention that the. record does not show notice to her of the proposed work, says that it shows only that a \u201cparcel\u201d was mailed to her, not a letter, and that the contents of the parcel are not disclosed. To the extreme technicality of this contention the Court of Appeals answered that no objection was made to the return, and that it averred that the officers and agents of the District made diligent search for defendant in error in the District, and that she could not be found there, and that plaintiff in error believed that she was a citizen and resident of the State of Maryland. The court also pointed out that the return alleged that notice was given to her by publication, as required by the act of Congress, and by registered letter, postage prepaid, which was received by her. A registry return receipt, with her signature attached thereto, was made part of the return. Commenting on this, the court said that if there was a defect in the return it was purely technical, and could have been corrected. \u201cUpon the granting of the writ,\u201d the court observed, \u201chad objection been made to the adoption by the-Commissioners of their preliminary return, the court undoubtedly would have permitted an amendment to the record for the purpose of supplying the defects now complained of by petitioner [defendant in error here.]' Having then made no objection to the form of the return, it is too late to do so now.\u201d If we could concede that the record justifies the distinction made by defendant in error between a parcel and a letter, we should adopt without hesitation the reply made by the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>of Appeals to the contention based on that distinction, or upon any defect in the return, which could have been removed if objection had been seasonably made.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">The second contention of defendant in error is that the record fails to disclose that any nuisance existed on her property, or that the means of drainage already there was unsanitary or insufficient, or that any necessity existed for making the connection. This contention seems to be made in this court for the first time. It certainly received no notice from the Court of Appeals, and the fact that it assumes that there was means of drainage on defendant in error\u2019s lot is not alleged in her petition. But suppose the fact had been alleged, a property owner cannot urge against the drainage system of the District that he had adopted a system of his own and challenge a comparison with that of the District, and obey or disobey the law according to the result of the comparison. The contention virtually denies any power in Congress to create a system of drainage to which a lot owner must conform.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">Finally, defendant in error attacks the validity of the law, and bases the attack, to use her words, \u201cupon certain salient vices in the act which are apparent on its face, of which the principal are \u2014 \u25a0</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-7\">\u201c <em>(a) </em>The attempt to give controlling evidential effect to the mere existence of an improvement in case of improved property, and to the <em>ex parte </em>certificate of the health officer in the case of unimproved property, thus violating the \u2018 due process \u2019 clause of the Constitution.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-8\">\u201c (6) Because the act lacks the requisite uniformity, inasmuch as it undertakes to provide one law for property of resident and another for property of non-resident owners in said District. \u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-9\">\u201c\"(c) Because the act is not capable of universal enforcement, and creates unequal burdens.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b178-10\">\u201c <em>(d) </em>Because the act is incapable of uniform enforcement as against all property in the District of Columbia.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The first objection was not expressed in the petition nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>made in the lower courts, and we might therefore decline to entertain it. At' best, defendant in' error can only be heard against \u201cthe; evidential effect of the' mere existence of an improvement,\u201d because her property does not come within the category of unimproved property. Her improvements are dwelling houses, and their mere existence indicated the necessity for drainage. That they may sometimes be vacant is unimportant. What rights owners of lots differently improved or owners of unimproved property may have is of no concern of-defendant in error. Her contention, therefore, that the act deprives her of due process of law is unsound.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">The other objections expressed the same fundamental idea, to wit, that the act discriminates between resident and nonresident owners of property, and because it does it is void. The Court of Appeals yielded to this contention, following the authority of <em>McGuire </em>v. <em>District of Columbia, </em>24 App. D. C. 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The defendant in error asserts this discrimination and argues its consequences at some length, but does not refer to any provision of the Constitution of the United States which prohibits Congress from enacting laws which discriminate in their operation between persons or things. If there is no express prohibition of such power, may prohibition be implied from our form of government? Upon that proposition we need not express an opinion. If prohibition exists it must rest on all the powers conferred by the Constitution. This court, however, has just held, in the case of <em>United States </em>v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co., </em>213 U. S. 366, that Congress may in the exercise of the powers to regulate commerce among the States, discriminate between commodities and between carriers engaged in such commerce. And it was said that the assertion that \u201cinjustice and. favoritism\u201d might \u201cbe operated thereby,\u201d could \u201chave no weight in passing upon the question of power.\u201d In the case at bar we are dealing with an exercise of the police power, one of the most essential of powers, at times the most insistent, and always one of the least limitable of the powers of government.</p>\n<p id=\"APqx\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>However, the question of the power of Congress, broadly-considered, to discriminate in its legislation is not necessary to decide, for whether such power is expressly or impliedly prohibited, the prohibition cannot be stricter or more extensive than the Fourteenth Amendment is upon the States. That Amendment is unqualified in its declaration that a State shall not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\u201d Passing on that Amendment, we have repeatedly decided \u2014 so often that a citation of the cases is unnecessary \u2014 that it does not take from the States the power of classification. And also that such classification need not be either logically appropriate or scientifically accurate. The problems which are met in the government of human beings are different' from those involved in the examination of the objects of the physical world and assigning them to their proper associates. A wide range of discretion, therefore, is necessary in legislation to malee it practical, and we have often said that the courts cannot be made a refuge from ill-advised, unjust or oppressive laws. <em>Billings </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>188 U. S. 97; <em>Heath &amp; Milligan Manufacturing Co. et al. </em>v. <em>Worst, </em>207 U. S. 338. In the light of these principles the contentions of defendant in error must-be judged. \u2022 The act in controversy makes a distinction in its provision between resident and non-resident lot owners, but this is a proper basis-for classification. 'Regarded abstractly as human beings, regarded abstractly as lot owners, no' legal difference may be observed- between residents and non-residents, but regarded in their relation to their respective- lots under regulating laws, the limitations upon juris- . diction,'and the power to reach one and not the other, important, differences immediately appear. We said in <em>St. John </em>v. <em>New York, </em>201 U. S. at pages 633, 637, not only the purpose of a law must be considered, but the means of its administration \u2014 the ways it may be defeated. Legislation, to be practical and efficient, must regard this special purpose as well as the ultimate purpose. This was in effect repeated in <em>Field </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Co., </em>194 U. S. 618, where a privilege to protest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>against a street improvement given by the statute assailed to resident property owners and denied to non-resident property owners, was sustained, and the statute held not to violate the equality clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See <em>Travellers Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Connecticut, </em>185 U. S. 364.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">It is not contended, that the act of Congress is not impartial within the classes. The act treats all resident lot owners alike and all non-residents alike. It is contended .that there is a difference in the procedure prescribed in case of default, and nonresident lot owners are thereby discriminated against, though they stand in the same relation to the purpose of the law as resident lot owners. In other words, non-resident lot owners are not treated the same as resident owners in like situation, because against resident owners the coercion of the law is by criminal punishment, while against non-resident owners the remedy is by civil proceedings, the District does the work that the non-resident owners neglect' and charges the expense thereof on their property. This is a distinction, a discrimination it may be called, but it has even more justification than that sustained in <em>Field </em>v. <em>Barber Asphalt Co., supra. </em>The statute under consideration in the case at bar enjoins a duty on both resident and non-resident lot owners, a duty necessary to be followed to preserve the health of the city. There is a difference onty in the manner of enforcing it, a difference arising from the different situation of the lot owners, and therefore competent for Congress to regard in its legislation. In other words, under the circumstances presented by this record the distinction between residents and non-residents is a proper basis for'classification. It might not be under other circumstances. <em>Blake </em>v. McClung, 172 U. S. 239; <em>S. C., </em>176 U. S. 59; <em>Sully </em>v. <em>American National Bank, </em>178 U. S. 289.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">That the remedy in the statute under consideration against non-resid\u00e9\u00f1t owners may be.more efficient \u2014 more completely fulfill the purpose, of the law \u2014 than that against resident owners, is beside'-the question. Indeed, the fact may be disputed. Usually the most emphatic and efficient enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>of a law is through criminal prosecution. At any rate, it is hard to believe that there will be many resident- lot owners whose delinquency under the statute will be so resolute that it will stand against repeated charges of crime and the consequent penalties. But, be that as it may, it was for Congress to decide whether such possibility should be risked rather than incur the greater possibility of more delinquents in so numerous a class as resident lot owners if the District was to first bear the expense of the drainage and collect it afterward by civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">Other criticisms are made of the law to display what is alleged to be its lack of uniformity. For instance, a supposition is made of tenants in common, some of whom are residents and the others non-residents, and the possible difficulties that may arise from such ownership under the act, and it is asked if the property belongs to resident minors or insane persons, or persons under legal disabilities, can the act be enforced against them or against their property? To these suppositions and questions we answer that it will be time enough to reply when a case arises in which they are presented, and to determine then the operation of the act upon the persons enumerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\"><em>Judgment reversed with directions to reverse the judgment of </em>, <em>the Supreme Court, quashing the tax, and to dismiss the petition.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b182-9\">Mr. Justice White did not hear the argument and took no part in the decision.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
