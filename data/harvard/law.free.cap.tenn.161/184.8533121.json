The Chancellor construed the term to mean next of kin, according to the statutes of distribution. In this he was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\"While we have no reported case in this State in point, this has been the practically unanimous holding in other jurisdictions, supported generally by textbook authority. The opinion is frequently expressed that a contrary view would render the devise void for indefiniteness.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u201cThe word \u2018relations\u2019 or \u2018relatives\u2019 has of itself no precise reference to legal succession, nor indeed any precise sense at all, since kindred to the remotest degree might thus be spoken of. But for convenience, and in order to prevent a gift from being void for uncertainty, it is commonly confined to those who would take under the statutes of distribution (or if a devise, under the statutes of descent), unless the will discloses a plain purpose to the contrary.\u201d Schouler on Wills, Ex. <em>&amp; </em>Admrs.
