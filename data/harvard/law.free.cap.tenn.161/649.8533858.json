Co. </em>v. <em>Rapid Transit Co., </em>133 Tenn., 117; <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Hoffman </em>(Chy. App.), 58 S. W., 929: <em>Raht </em>v. <em>Southern Ry. Co. </em>(Chy. App.), 50 S. W., 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b682-9\">Neither is the complaining party required first to apply to the municipal authorities for relief before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>bringing' suit. 13 Exiling Caso Law, 241; <em>Raht </em>v. <em>Southern Ry. Co., supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b683-3\">In the Corpus Juris text, referred to above, it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-4\">\u201cWhere a road is shown to be an existing public highway, a private individual is entitled to an injunction against encroachments or obstructions thereon when, and only when, he has sustained special damage, different not merely in degree but in kind from that suffered by the public at large.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-5\">And the text in Euling Case Law, referred to above, is' in this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-6\">\u201cA private citizen who sustains a special injury there by may maintain a suit in equity to enjoin the erection or maintenance of an obstruction in a street or highway, though it constitutes a private nuisance. This right, of course, is subject to the general rule that equity will not intervene except to prevent irreparable injury.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b683-7\">In discussing the right to injunctive relief against the vacation of a highway where the complaining party has an easement, the author, in 13 Euling Case Law, 76, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b683-8\">\u201cSome courts hold that since his easement is limited to the portion of the street on which he abuts, or a street which affords him the only means of access to his property, he must show that his property fronts or abuts upon that portion of the street sought to be vacated, or that the part sought to be vacated furnishes the only means of access to his property. If he is not an abutter upon the obstructed or vacated portion of a street or way, and has ample means of access to his property by other streets and public ways, he is simply one of the general public, suffering an inconvenience common to all; and though he may, by reason of proximity, suffer a greater <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>inconvenience tlian others, lie is in no way distinguished from them except in degree.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">Applying\u2019 these principles to the facts as alleged in the bill, we are of the opinion that the chancellor was in error in holding that such a suit cannot be maintained by a corporation or an individual. On the other hand, we are of the opinion that the bill states no cause of action, and should have been dismissed for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">The bill does not aver that complainant has any easement or other right in said highway; it does not allege that its property abuts on the part of the highway which defendant is obstructing, but alleges that it is near thereto ; it does not allege any facts to show that it will be irreparably injured by such obstruction; it does not show that its access to its plant will be cut off, or that it is \u25a0without other means of1 ingress and egress to and from its property, or that it has sustained any injury that is not shared by the general public in that locality. The mere allegation that it will be \u201cirreparably injured\u201d is a mere conclusion of law, to support which no facts are alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">Since the chancellor reached the right result, but based it upon the wrong ground, his decree will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
