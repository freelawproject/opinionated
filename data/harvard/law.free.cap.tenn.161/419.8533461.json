Justice McKinney</author>\n<p id=\"A17\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">Ryland Hobson, by next friend, instituted this suit to recover damages resulting from a collision between a-motorcycle, which he was riding while- acting as a messenger for the postal company, and an automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">It was charged that Hobson was unlawfully employed by the postal company, and in violation of chapter 57, Acts of 1911, and amendatory acts. Said act makes it unlawful to employ children \u201cbetween the ages of fourteen and sixteen years.\u201d Hobson, at the time of his injury, was sixteen years and eleven months of age. The trial court very correctly sustained a demurrer to the declaration. The words \u201cbetween the ages of fourteen and sixteen years\u201d would not apply to the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">The word \u201cbetween\u201d is thus defined by Webster: \u201cIn the space which separates; betwixt.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">And with respect to its meaning, it is said in 7 Corpus Juris, 1148: \u201cStrictly, when used with reference to a period of time bounded by two other specified periods of time, the periods of time named as boundaries are ex-' eluded. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">The word between, when used in speaking of time \u201cbetween\u201d two certain days, generally excludes the days designated as the commencement and termination of such periods. Words &amp; Phrases (First Series), vol. 1, 766.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-11\"><em>A, </em>statute prohibiting the sale of liquor \u201cbetween the hours of eleven P. M. and five o\u2019clock A. M.\u201d means the period intervening between eleven o \u2019clock night, and five <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>o\u2019clock morning of the succeeding day. <em>Hedderich </em>v. <em>State </em>(Ind.), 51 Am. Rep., 768.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">An act providing for the education of children \u201cbetween and including\u201d the ages of seven and fifteen years does not apply to children who have reached their fifteenth year. <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>145 Mich., 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">The case under consideration is easily distinguishable from <em>Covel </em>v. <em>State, </em>143 Tenn., 571, where the language construed was \u201cbetween the ages of seven and sixteen years, inclusive.\u201d In that case the court said: \u201cBut, if interpretation were necessary, it is found' that the meaning of the word \u2018inclusive\u2019 is defined in Webster\u2019s.International Dictionary to be:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-6\">\u201c \u2018Inclosing, encircling; (2) comprehending the stated limit or extremes; as from Monday to Saturday, inclusive, that is, taking in both Monday and Saturday.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b451-7\">\u201cHence the use of the word in the statute clearly denotes the intent to comprehend the full period of a child\u2019s sixteenth year.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">It is inferable from what was said in that case that hut for the adding of the word \u201cinclusive\u201d the court would have held that the phrase did not include a child sixteen years of age. The legislature evidently intended that the phrase involved should be given its ordinary and natural meaning, for when it subsequently enacted the compulsory school law with the intention that it should apply to children sixteen years of age it added the word \u201cinclusive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b451-9\">There is no error in the judgment of the trial court, and it will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
