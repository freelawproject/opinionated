Likewise if goods so insured be damaged <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>by removal or by water in an effort to save them from fire. <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>115 Tenn., 513; Joyce on Insurance, Secs. 2821, 2824; 26 C. J., 340; et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">And again, under an accident policy, there is liability ordinarily although the more immediate cause of death be an operation necessitated by the accidental injury. Joyce on Insurance, Sec. 2833; 1 C. J., 470; <em>Gardner </em>v. <em>United Surety Co. </em>(Minn.), 20 L. R. A. (N. S.), 1004, and cases collected in Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In marine insurance there are many cases in which losses were held to have been proximately caused by perils of the sea, though such a peril was not in active operation at the consummation of the disaster. As where a vessel had been disabled or' driven ashore by stress of weather and was robbed or immediately destroyed by another agency. Joyce on Insurance, Secs. 2832, 2833; 38 C. J., 1112.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">Many recent cases of such import are collected in 6 Couch on Insurance (1930), section 1462, et seq., in the chapter on proximate cause. The decisions are too numerous to be reviewed.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">Our attention is called to <em>Harley </em>v. <em>Life </em>&amp; <em>Casualty Insurance Company </em>(Ga. App.), not yet reported, and <em>Gant </em>v. <em>Provident Life </em>&amp; <em>Accident Insurance Company, </em>197 N. C., 122, 157 S. E., 740, in which cases policies like the policy before us were considered and views expressed contrary to those herein indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">The language of the Georgia court, upon which counsel rely, does not appear to have been at all necessary to the decision. With entire deference to the North Carolina court, we think the construction we give the policy is more in harmony with the prevailing rules of interpretation respecting insurance contracts generally. We see no reason for exceptional treatment of this undertak<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>ing. \"When the very limited scope of the risk assumed by the policy is considered, the premium charg\u2019ed does not justify a particularly narrow reading\u2019 of that instrument.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-3\">The peril against which the insured here had bought protection was that of a blow from a moving vehicle on a public highway. He could not, of course, have been <em>struck </em>except by a vehicle in motion. No part of the automobile hit his eye. The automobile hit the rock and cast it into his eye. A blow from the automobile was the efficient and proximate cause of his injury. Itj seems immaterial that the moving car struck him with a rock instead of with some part of the machine. He was none the less struck and the agency which inflicted the blow was a moving vehicle upon a public highway against blows from which he had contracted for indemnity.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-4\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
