On appeal, the petitioner claims that the habeas court's judgment should be reversed because that court erred by concluding that the petitioner's trial counsel, Attorneys\n   Henry Becker and Thomas Moore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   did not render ineffective assistance on the basis of their decision not to seek a jury instruction on the lesser included criminal offenses of unlawful restraint in either the first or second degree. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n   The following procedural history and facts are relevant to this appeal. In 2010, following a jury trial, the petitioner was convicted of kidnapping in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-94.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The petitioner was thereafter sentenced to serve sixteen years in prison, followed by four years of special parole.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   This court, in affirming the petitioner's conviction on direct appeal, stated that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts pertaining to the underlying crime. \"On November 10, 2008, the victim was packing groceries into her vehicle, which was parked in the parking lot of a Stamford grocery store. After the victim entered her vehicle, shut the door and started the vehicle, the [petitioner], who had a prior relationship with the victim, opened the vehicle's door and pushed the victim between the passenger's and driver's seats. The victim's keys to the vehicle were knocked out of the ignition during the victim's initial struggle with the [petitioner], but the [petitioner] then started the vehicle with another key. The victim pushed the horn of her car in an attempt to draw attention to the situation. The [petitioner] grabbed the victim's hair and hit her face against the dashboard, which caused the victim to bleed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"He then held the victim's head down as he drove her vehicle on the Merritt Parkway, in the direction of the [petitioner's] residence. The victim, in an attempt to escape the vehicle, persuaded the [petitioner] to pull into a rest stop for gas. The [petitioner] pulled into the New Canaan rest area, which included a gas station,\n   and parked the vehicle, but, after the [petitioner] decided the rest area was 'not the right place to talk,' he began to drive the vehicle in reverse in order to exit the rest area. Trying to prevent the victim from exiting the vehicle, the [petitioner] grabbed the victim's belt and pants, until her pants ripped at the crotch area. The victim successfully escaped the vehicle and ran to the gas station. The victim called 911 on her cell phone and also requested that the gas station attendant call 911.... The [petitioner] ran into the woods, behind the rest area, before state police arrived in response to the 911 calls.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"Officer Glen Coppola of the Stamford police department ... was dispatched to the rest area to meet with the victim. The victim subsequently followed Coppola to the special victims unit of the department. When the victim arrived at the department, she met with Sergeant Christian DiCarlo, who noted facial bruising, scratches around the victim's eyes and the fact that her jeans were torn. DiCarlo\n   took the victim's statement and photographed the extent of her injuries. Later that night, the [petitioner] surrendered to the department and was arrested on the charge of kidnapping in the second degree, of which he ultimately was convicted.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

He thereafter filed an amended petition on April 16, 2014, a second amended petition on May 27, 2014, and a third amended petition on July 30, 2014. In the third amended petition, amongst several other claims, the petitioner claimed that he received ineffective assistance of counsel during his criminal trial because his trial counsel did not request a jury instruction on the lesser included offenses of unlawful restraint in the first degree, unlawful restraint in the second degree, or assault in the third degree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, denied the substance of all of the petitioner's claims in a return filed on August 4, 2014. On November 20, 2014, the court,\n   <em>\n    Sferrazza, J.,\n   </em>\n   held a habeas trial, during which the petitioner presented documentary and testimonial evidence. Relevant to the issue on appeal, the petitioner presented his own testimony, as well as the testimony of Attorney Robert McKay, a Connecticut criminal defense attorney, and Attorney Maureen Ornousky, the prosecutor who handled the petitioner's criminal trial. On December 4, 2014, the court issued a memorandum of decision wherein it denied the petitioner's amended petition. In the court's memorandum of decision, it determined, inter alia, that the petitioner had failed to show ineffective assistance based upon his trial counsel's choice not to seek a lesser included offense instruction on unlawful restraint in either the first or second degree.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The habeas court also found that the petitioner had failed to prove prejudice in accordance with\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Most notably, the court found that the record demonstrated \"ample evidence justifying proof of all the elements of kidnapping [in the] second degree\" and that the jury was presumed to have acted in accordance with the trial court's proper instructions as to the crime charged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The petitioner sought certification to appeal to this court on December 10, 2014, which the habeas court\n   granted on December 11, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.

We agree with the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The following additional facts and analysis set forth by the habeas court are relevant to the petitioner's claim: \"Neither Attorney Becker nor Attorney Moore testified at the habeas trial. The petitioner offered the testimony of Attorney Robert McKay to support [his ineffective assistance argument with respect to his trial counsel's failure to request a lesser included offense instruction]. Attorney McKay opined that the decision whether to seek the possibility of conviction on lesser [included] offenses rests with the client and that\n   <em>\n    he,\n   </em>\n   personally, would have sought instructions on such offenses on behalf of the petitioner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"Attorney McKay reasoned that the incident at the core of the events which gave rise to the charges against the petitioner was essentially an escalation of a domestic dispute between the petitioner and the victim.

We emphasized, however, that our holding [did] not represent a complete refutation of the principles established by our prior kidnapping jurisprudence.

From a more general standpoint, it appears that petitioner's trial counsel, and particularly Attorney Becker, by repeatedly referring to the absence of potentially justifiable, less serious charges against the petitioner, argued that the state had overcharged the petitioner and that the entire incident was a domestic dispute that had been exaggerated as a kidnapping by both the victim and by the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The evidence admitted at the petitioner's criminal trial established, inter alia, that the petitioner grabbed the victim by her hair in her car and hit her face against the dashboard; that he held the victim's head down as he drove her car; and that, after having pulled over the victim's car at a rest area, he grabbed the victim and attempted to restrain her from exiting the car as he subsequently tried to drive away with her before she ultimately escaped his grasp and left the car. In order to prove that the petitioner was guilty of kidnapping in the second degree, the state had the burden of proving, beyond a reasonable doubt, that he \"abducted\" the victim, meaning that he \"restrain[ed] [her] with [the] intent to prevent [her] liberation by either ... secreting or holding [her] in a place where [she was] not likely to be found, or ... using or threatening to use physical\n   force or intimidation.\" General Statutes \u00a7 53a-91 (2) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

Attorney McKay testified that the petitioner's trial counsel should have requested a jury instruction on unlawful restraint in the second degree at his criminal trial primarily because Attorney Becker repeatedly had referred to unlawful restraint in his closing argument, and the maximum penalties for kidnapping are vastly greater than those for unlawful restraint.

Furthermore, as Attorney Ornousky, the prosecutor from the petitioner's criminal trial, indicated in her testimony at the habeas trial, this strategy fit the narrative that the petitioner's trial counsel tried to convey to the jury: \"that this was an overreaching on [the] part of the state, that [it] had overcharged ... that this was something, but not a kidnapping, and that ... the victim had exaggerated what had happened and the state was overzealous....\" Accordingly, we conclude that the petitioner has failed to prove deficient performance because he has failed to prove that his trial counsel, by failing to pursue an instruction on lesser included offenses, performed in a way that \"fell below the required standard of reasonable competence or competence displayed by lawyers with ordinary training and skill in the criminal law....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Walton v.

The timing of the petitioner's actions, as shown by the evidence, strongly indicates that the petitioner used physical force on the victim\n   <em>\n    in order to prevent her liberation,\n   </em>\n   considering that the evidence demonstrated that he hit her head against the dashboard immediately after she tried to summon help and after he had started her car, that he held her head down as he drove her in her car on a busy highway, and that he forcibly grabbed her as she began to escape from the car at the New Canaan rest area.

After he assaulted the victim, the petitioner then further restrained her as he drove her in her car from the Stamford grocery store to the New Canaan rest area.

Furthermore, one reasonably can infer that the petitioner intended to prevent the victim's liberation in order to perpetrate more than a single offense against her, especially in light of the evidence establishing that he drove her away in her car after he had hit her head against the dashboard and after she had attempted to draw attention to the situation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In light of the strength of the state's case, we are not persuaded that if the jury had been charged with respect to the lesser included offense at issue, it is reasonably probable that the jury would have decided the issues differently.

Specifically, he attempts to distinguish his case from\n    <em>\n     Reeves\n    </em>\n    by indicating that his trial counsel did not discuss an \"all-or-nothing\" strategy with him, unlike trial counsel in\n    <em>\n     Reeves.\n    </em>\n    The petitioner attempts to distinguish his case from\n    <em>\n     Fair\n    </em>\n    by noting that his trial counsel did not try to seek the jury's sympathy because Attorney Becker during his closing argument expressly stated that he did not even like the petitioner.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    Our review of the record leads us to infer that it was reasonable for the petitioner's trial counsel not to seek the jury's sympathy for the petitioner in light of the evidence adduced at trial. Evidence of the petitioner's prior uncharged misconduct with respect to the victim was adduced at trial. The victim testified that the petitioner had abused her verbally and physically on numerous occasions in the past and that she had not filed any police reports following these incidents. Attorney Becker, in his closing argument, attempted to discredit the veracity of the victim's testimony about these prior instances of the petitioner's misconduct, as he emphasized that there were no corroborating witnesses for these prior instances. Attorney Becker also attacked the victim's credibility by indicating to the jury that despite all of the alleged prior instances of the petitioner's abusive behavior toward the victim, the victim continued to maintain a relationship with him. Finally, Attorney Becker essentially maintained that the altercation that had occurred between the petitioner and the victim was a domestic dispute that the victim had embellished as a kidnapping. In light of Attorney Becker's argument, and particularly his treatment of the evidence of the petitioner's prior uncharged misconduct with respect to the victim, we infer that the petitioner's trial counsel employed a reasonable trial strategy by not seeking the jury's sympathy for the petitioner, and by attempting to diminish the importance and credibility of the victim's testimony about her relationship with the petitioner.
