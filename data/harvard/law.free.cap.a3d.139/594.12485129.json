The defendant, the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles (commissioner), appeals from the judgment of the trial court reversing in part the decision of the Department of Motor Vehicles (department) that Connecticut's statutes and regulations regarding nonconsensual towing services are not preempted under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C) (2012)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that\n   the plaintiff, Modzelewski's Towing and Recovery, Inc., had overcharged for the nonconsensual towing of a motor vehicle trailer and must pay restitution in the amount of $12,787 to the trailer's insurer. On appeal to this court, the commissioner claims that the trial court incorrectly determined that the fees charged by the plaintiff for the use of a 1075 rotator truck for recovery of the damaged trailer prior to the actual towing, for towing recovery operations, generally, for the use of its major incident response truck during the recovery operation, and for services performed in connection with the storage of a damaged vehicle following a nonconsensual towing are not subject to state regulation. The plaintiff responds that, when a towing is nonconsensual, federal law authorizes the state to regulate only the fee charged for the actual towing and that the state cannot regulate storage rates incident to the towing. The plaintiff also\n   argues that, if this court concludes that the fees charged for recovery services are not subject to state regulation, it cannot review whether the trial court properly reinstated charges for the plaintiff's use of the major incident response truck. We agree with the commissioner and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   FACTS\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The following undisputed facts are set forth in the trial court's memorandum of decision. \"On September 8, 2011, [the] state police called the plaintiff, a towing and recovery services company, to the scene of an accident on Interstate 84 near Newtown. The accident occurred when a passenger vehicle struck the rear of a trailer that was carrying a twenty-eight foot power boat and was hitched to a pick-up truck. As a result of the crash, the boat shifted position, and the trailer became unsafe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"At the accident scene, the plaintiff used a '1075' unit to pick up the front of the boat and restrap it to the trailer. The plaintiff next disconnected the trailer from the truck, removed the trailer and boat from the highway, and used the 1075 machine to place the trailer and boat on a [low bed] tractor trailer. The final phase that day involved the plaintiff's transport of the trailer and boat to its facility in Newtown for storage and further police investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"On September 9, [the] police conducted an inspection of the trailer and boat. The inspection required the plaintiff to lift the trailer with a warehouse forklift in order to place and then remove scales underneath it for the purpose of [weighing the trailer and boat]. The combined weight classification of the trailer and boat unit was between 10,000 and 26,000 pounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The plaintiff charged Eric Unser, the owner of the boat and trailer, $14,732.50 for its services on September 8 and 9. Unser's insurer, Boat U.S. Marine Insurance, paid the bill on behalf of [Unser].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"On October 11, 2011, Unser filed a complaint with the department ... claiming that he was overcharged. The department held a hearing on October 2, 2012. Relying on department regulations governing charges allowed for nonconsensual, 'medium duty' towing, the hearing officer ruled that the plaintiff had overcharged Unser and Boat U.S. Marine [Insurance] in the amount of $12,787....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   \"The restitution order of $12,787 represented the difference between the total\n   charged by the plaintiff ($16,699.50) and the total allowed by the department ($3912.50). The hearing officer rejected the plaintiff's claim that federal statutes preempt the department's regulations. The [hearing] officer held that '[t]ransportation of a motor vehicle as set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C) contemplates a process intended to accomplish an end and cannot be limited by focusing on one aspect, i.e. \"tow truck,\" as suggested by the [plaintiff].'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"Accordingly, the hearing officer ordered the plaintiff to pay Boat U.S. Marine [Insurance] restitution of $12,787 within thirty days of the decision. The [hearing] officer also ruled that, if the plaintiff failed to comply, the department would disqualify the plaintiff's license, seek recovery from the plaintiff's repairer bond, and impose a civil penalty of $1125 prior to any license reinstatement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to the trial court, which sustained the appeal in part. The court first concluded that the damaged trailer qualified as a \"motor vehicle\" and that the low bed tractor trailer used to transport the\n   damaged vehicle qualified as a \"tow truck\" within the meaning of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (16) and 14501(c)(2)(C), respectively, of the federal preemption scheme. The court thus concluded that \"the actual towing component of this case involved a nonconsensual 'for-hire motor vehicle transportation by a tow truck' under [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ](c)(2)(C)\" and that the commissioner had authority to regulate the rate that the plaintiff charged for that service, the cost of which the hearing officer had disallowed entirely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The trial court next concluded, however, that the commissioner did not have authority to regulate the fees charged for the plaintiff's pretowing recovery and posttowing services. The pretowing recovery services included the plaintiff's use of the 1075 rotator truck, the major incident response truck and the heavy duty recovery straps for the purpose of repositioning the vehicle on the trailer to ensure its stability. The posttowing services included storage of the trailer and related warehouse operations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court determined that state regulation governing pretowing and posttowing services is preempted by federal law, and, therefore, the plaintiff was not required to refund payments made by the insurer for these services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thereafter, the commissioner appealed\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the trial court's judgment, claiming that state regulation of pre-towing and posttowing services is not subject to federal preemption. Oral argument was heard on January 20, 2016, in conjunction with\n   <em>\n    Raymond's Auto Repair, LLC v. Commissioner of Motor Vehicles\n   </em>\n   (SC 19454), in which the commissioner raised a similar claim regarding pre-towing recovery services.

Questions of law [invoke] a broader standard of review than is ordinarily involved in deciding whether, in light of the evidence, the agency has acted unreasonably, arbitrarily, illegally or in abuse of its discretion.... Because this case forces us to examine a question of law, namely, [statutory] construction and interpretation [of federal preemption law] ... our review is de novo....

We consider these claims as one, however, because a determination that the charges for recovery operations, generally, are exempt from federal preemption necessarily resolves the question of whether the plaintiff's charge for its use of the\n   1075 rotator truck during the recovery operation is subject to state regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   It is well established that when Connecticut courts interpret federal statutes, \"[t]he decisions of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals carry particularly persuasive weight....\"\n   <em>\n    Webster Bank v.

Recovery services provided in connection with the nonconsensual towing of a damaged vehicle are clearly covered by the term \"transportation,\" as used in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C), because recovery\n   services following an accident involve the use of equipment designed to create the conditions required for the actual towing to proceed. Thus, recovery services are not merely related to but are an integral part of the actual towing. There is no better example of this relationship than in the present case. Without the plaintiff's recovery services, which consisted of repositioning and securing the boat to the trailer and hoisting the damaged trailer onto the low bed tractor trailer for towing, it would have been impossible for the plaintiff to tow the damaged trailer from the accident scene. Accordingly, the definition of \"transportation\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2013102\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 13102\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (23) supports the conclusion that state regulations relating to the price of recovery services provided in connection\n   with a nonconsensual towing fall within the exception to federal preemption set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   This interpretation of the statutory exception is not only reasonable, but does not upset the balance Congress sought to achieve between protecting consumers from exorbitant nonconsensual towing fees and the need for a free market in towing services.

Accordingly, state regulation of such fees \"[is] not the kind of burdensome state economic regulation Congress sought to preempt\"; (internal quotation marks omitted) id.; the need for recovery services being entirely dependent on the need for the towing itself, which clearly falls within the exemption from federal preemption set forth in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, construing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C) to preclude state regulation of fees charged for recovery services would be inconsistent \"with the well established canon of statutory construction that those who promulgate statutes or rules do not intend to promulgate statutes or rules that lead to absurd consequences or bizarre results.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Pictometry International Corp. v.

The [c]ommittee provision struck a balance between the need to protect consumers from exorbitant\n   towing fees and the need for a free market in towing services.

No. 104-311, supra, p. at 120, reprinted in 1995 U.S.C.C.A.N. 832; it was referring to the balance achieved by ceding price regulation of nonconsensual towing services to state and local regulatory\n   authorities while maintaining federal control over the regulation of routes and services, and nothing more. We thus find no merit in the plaintiff's claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The plaintiff also contends that construing\n   <extracted-citation index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c) as permitting federal preemption of state laws regulating fees charged for pretowing recovery services would not subject consumers to potentially exorbitant fees because they may seek judicial resolution of disputes, and, in any event, consumers have insurance to protect themselves from having to pay exorbitant fees. The problem with these arguments is that relying on the courts to settle a dispute requires financial resources unavailable to many consumers, especially those with lower incomes, and insurance companies are likely to pass on any increased costs they may incur to their customers in the form of higher premiums. Moreover, there would be no incentive for towing companies to charge reasonable fees should state regulation of fees charged for nonconsensual recovery services be preempted by federal law. To the extent towing companies believe the rates established under state law are insufficient to cover their costs, state law permits them to petition the commissioner every two years for higher rates, and the commissioner shall reconsider and amend the rates and charges if it is determined that the rates and charges \"are no longer just and reasonable.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 14-66(a)(2). We are therefore unpersuaded by the plaintiff's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   V\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   POSTTOWING STORAGE SERVICES\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The commissioner next claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that federal law preempts state\n   regulation of the fees charged for the storage of damaged vehicles following a nonconsensual towing. The plaintiff responds that the trial court correctly concluded that the state cannot regulate storage rates incident to a nonconsensual towing. In light of the following facts, we decline to review this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The hearing officer found that, \"[i]ncluded in the amount paid to the [plaintiff] was a storage fee in the amount of $1967, which was incurred primarily because [Boat U.S. Marine Insurance] disputed the tow fees prior to paying.\" Thus, because the dispute had extended the time that the damaged trailer and boat remained in storage to thirty-eight days, the hearing officer ordered that the storage fee be divided equally between the plaintiff and the insurer, even though the commissioner had not challenged the storage fee at the administrative hearing. Thereafter, in reviewing the plaintiff's claim that federal law preempts state regulation of storage fees, the trial court concluded that \"[t]here is nothing in the plain language of the phrase 'transportation by a tow truck' [in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014501\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 14501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(2)(C) ] that would include storage or operations at the warehouse the following day. Similarly, the department's regulations defining '[t]ow charge' arguably include some routine posttow services such as cleaning of the equipment used to perform the towing or release of the vehicle to the owner, but they do not specifically encompass storage or warehouse operations.\" The trial court thus concluded that the state lacked authority to regulate the plaintiff's storage fee and ordered Boat U.S. Marine Insurance to pay the plaintiff the entire fee in the amount of $1967.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   On appeal to this court, the commissioner does not challenge the trial court's order to restore the entire storage fee of $1967 but, rather, challenges the trial court's reasoning that state regulation of storage fees related to a nonconsensual towing is preempted under\n   federal law. The commissioner argues that the plaintiff's storage of the damaged trailer for thirty-eight days following the tow was not related to its movement, and the vehicle was not in transit or on its way to a final destination. The plaintiff responds that the storage was temporary and that the trailer was still in transit because it was \"undrivable\" and needed to be towed to its final destination. The plaintiff thus contends that state regulation of storage fees is preempted under federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   We decline to review this claim because the commissioner challenges only the trial court's reasoning and not its order to restore the storage fee. The commissioner is therefore not aggrieved by the trial court's decision, and we do not express an opinion regarding the legal basis for the trial court's conclusion.
