One way underage people can circumvent a minimum drinking age law is to turn to adults over 21.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The General Assembly targeted adults in the fight to protect youths from alcohol when, in 1996, it enacted CR \u00a7 10-117(b). CR \u00a7 10-117(b), which contains exceptions not pertinent to the cases before us,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   states that \"an adult may not knowingly and willfully allow an individual under the age of 21 years actually to possess or consume an alcoholic beverage at a residence, or within the curtilage of a residence that the adult owns or leases and in which the adult resides.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   It is against this backdrop that we confront two cases with the dangerous common denominator of underage people drinking alcohol on an adult's property, and then leaving that property in a motor vehicle. With respect to both cases, the facts are as alleged by the Petitioners in their complaints, or in the Kiriakos case, in the Motion For Summary Judgment, Opposition, or attachments thereto. In both cases, the consumption of alcohol was done with the knowledge and consent of the adult property owner.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Case No. 55: Dankos\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   17-year-old Steven Dankos (\"Steven\") became intoxicated during a party at Linda Stapf's house on the evening of November\n   28, 2009.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   When Steven left early the next morning, still intoxicated, he rode in the bed of David Erdman's pickup truck. Erdman, another intoxicated partygoer who\n   was 22 years old, crashed the truck shortly after leaving, and Steven was killed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   When Stapf first came home during the party, she found a large crowd at her house.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stapf told her son Kevin that some people would have to leave, but she permitted him and some others to continue partying in the garage. Although Stapf knew some (like Kevin) were under 21 and some under 18, she allowed them to keep drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   During the party, Stapf sat in the kitchen near the garage and played solitaire. Alcohol was kept in the garage and made available to all guests. At least four times, she entered the garage to observe the goings-on. Although Stapf asked them to turn down the music, she did not ask or tell them to limit or stop drinking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   When Kelsey Erdman (\"Kelsey\") approached Stapf in the kitchen to express her concerns about her brother driving while intoxicated, Stapf did nothing. Stapf did not tell Kelsey to drive Erdman home, nor call Erdman's parents, nor even check on his condition. Stapf also did not attempt to prevent any intoxicated guests from driving off her premises.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Erdman crashed shortly after leaving the party. Steven, who rode in the truck bed, was ejected and killed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State charged Stapf with violating CR \u00a7 10-117(b), but ultimately stetted this charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In May 2013, Nancy Dankos, Steven's mother, filed an amended complaint (\"Amended Complaint\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging various claims against Stapf that sounded in negligence: common law\n   social host liability; breach of duties arising out of Maryland criminal law statutes;\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   breach of a duty to act;\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   a wrongful death claim; and a survival action. Stapf filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, arguing principally that Dankos had failed to allege the breach of a legally cognizable duty. The Circuit Court for Howard County granted the motion in substantial part.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Following her timely notice of appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   the Court of Special Appeals affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Davis v.

Phillips, age 26, knew that Robinson was 18, that Robinson had driven to Phillips's house and would have to drive to leave, and that Robinson had too much to drink. Because of the quantity Robinson consumed,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phillips told Robinson to \"watch what he's drinking.\" Phillips also offered to let Robinson sleep at his place, but said that Robinson could leave \"whenever he was ready\" if he \"was sure that he was going to be able to drive.\" Robinson decided to wait for the effects of the alcohol to wear off, and left around 4:00 or 5:00 a.m.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Robinson struck Kiriakos about one hour later. The officer who arrived at the scene detected \"a strong odor\" of alcohol on Robinson's breath. This officer also noticed that Robinson's eyes were bloodshot and that vomit was on his sweatshirt. Robinson consented to a preliminary breath test, which measured a BAC of .088. Based on the sobriety test, among\n   other things, the officer placed Robinson under arrest.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the precinct, Robinson consented to take a breath test, which measured a BAC of .08.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Kiriakos filed an amended complaint against multiple defendants,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   including\n   Phillips. The sole count against Phillips sounded in negligence. Kiriakos alleged that Phillips owed a duty \"to the public in general,\" including her, not to provide alcohol and illegal drugs to someone \"under-aged\" when he knew or should have known the under-aged person would drive under the influence of alcohol and drugs. Phillips filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing that \"Maryland does not recognize social host liability for serving alcohol.\" After a hearing, the Circuit Court for Baltimore County granted Phillips's motion, refusing to find that Phillips owed Kiriakos a legal duty, and explaining that \"I'm bound by the law as it exists in the present day and Maryland simply has consistently refused for other reasons to extend liability that far.\" The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion, affirmed the Circuit Court's grant of summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We review for legal correctness a trial court's decision to grant a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.\n   <em>\n    Rounds v.

As we explain,\n   <em>\n    infra,\n   </em>\n   this knowing and willful requirement removes any issue of contributory negligence on the part of the underage drinker vis-\u00e0-vis his claim against the adult, even though the cause of action otherwise sounds in negligence. We address the specific questions presented in each case below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Case No. 55: Dankos\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   We granted Dankos's Petition for Writ of Certiorari to address the following questions:\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   1. Where the Court of Special Appeals found Stapf owed a duty of care to Steven arising from her alleged violation of CR \u00a7 10-117(b), did it err in concluding that Petitioners could\n   not, as a matter of law, establish Stapf was the proximate cause of Steven's injuries?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   2. Where Petitioners alleged that a special relationship existed between the youth on Stapf's property and Stapf, did the Court of Special Appeals err when [it] failed to recognize a cause of action arising from this special relationship based on its conclusion that Petitioners could not, as a matter of law, establish that Stapf was a proximate cause of Steven's death?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Because we answer yes to the first question, we shall reverse without reaching the second question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   All of the counts in Dankos's complaint sounded in negligence. A plaintiff bringing a negligence claim must establish four elements: \"a duty owed to him (or to a class of which he is a part), a breach of that duty, a legally cognizable causal relationship between the breach of duty and the harm suffered, and damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Jacques v.

Dankos contends that CR \u00a7 10-117(b) creates a legal duty for Stapf, a homeowner, to prevent Steven, a minor, from consuming alcohol on her premises.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additionally, Dankos argues that because this duty arises out of a statute and not the common law, the proximate cause analysis is not governed by archaic common law cases such as\n   <em>\n    State for Use of Joyce v.

For support, Stapf draws upon the legislative history that indicates to her the General\n   Assembly's concern with drinking and driving, a broad public problem.

The statute seeks to prevent harm to underage persons as a result of their consumption of alcohol, as is repeatedly expressed in the legislative history for this statute. Those in support of the bill that became CR \u00a7 10-117(b) evinced a deep concern for the protection of underage people from alcohol and the risks alcohol poses to them and the loss of judgment that leads to risky behavior-like getting into a car with a fellow partygoer who is too impaired to drive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   Letter from Melvin Stern, Chair, Legis.

In her complaint, Dankos alleged that Stapf violated CR \u00a7 10-117(b). She alleged that Steven was 17 and consuming alcohol on Stapf's property prior to the accident. She further alleged that Steven's \"degree of intoxication\" inhibited his ability to make a reasonable decision about how to leave the party. Finally, she alleged that Steven's death in the car accident was a direct, proximate result of Stapf's actions. In essence, Dankos alleges that Stapf allowed Steven to get so intoxicated that he might put himself in danger-the very harm that CR \u00a7 10-117(b) seeks to prevent.

Stapf knew that Steven and Erdman, among others, were drinking and became intoxicated at the party.

But as we have discussed, what distinguishes Dankos's claim is the statute the General Assembly passed and in which we identify a civil duty, CR \u00a7 10-117(b). Indeed, it is from this statute that we also identify a legislative recognition that minors such as Steven have a reduced ability to handle alcohol. As such, we refuse to construe a minor's decision to consume alcohol voluntarily as the proximate cause of his injuries.

Focusing on Phillips's active and knowing misconduct, providing alcohol to an underage person, she sees no need to establish a special relationship with Phillips to support her claim of duty.

This history also shows that underage drunk driving poses an equal if not greater public threat.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2062155\" index=\"207\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/306/617/#p627\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (explaining that, among all fatally injured alcohol-impaired drivers, the percentage of such drivers aged 16 to 20 \"has hovered around 25%\" since 1995).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   It is alleged that Phillips served Robinson alcohol, enough so that Phillips had two conversations with him about the extent of his drinking.\n   <footnotemark>\n    56\n   </footnotemark>\n   Phillips knew that Robinson, who had driven to Phillips's house, likely was going to be driving after their get-together, especially when Robinson declined an invitation to stay at Phillips's house. Robinson left about an hour after refusing the invitation, and the accident occurred another hour later. Robinson struck Kiriakos, a pedestrian, while driving under the influence. The officer at the scene smelled \"a strong odor\" of alcohol on Robinson's breath and \"noticed that his eyes were bloodshot.\" Robinson's blood alcohol content measured at .088.\n   <footnotemark>\n    57\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Based on these allegations, and the universally understood risk of harm that underage drunk driving poses to the traveling public, Kiriakos's injuries were foreseeable.

CR \u00a7 10-117. Depending on the circumstances, an adult who violates this statute may owe a civil duty to persons injured as a result of such drinking, including the underage persons consuming the alcohol. Phillips owed Kiriakos such a duty, as Stapf had a duty with respect to Dankos. The Circuit Court erred in granting the defendants' motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Although the reasoning differs in the two cases, the public policy underlying CR \u00a7 10-117(b) applies to both cases. That is, underage persons are not solely responsible for drinking alcohol on an adult's property because they are not competent to handle the effects of this potentially dangerous substance. Because of the public policy evident in CR \u00a7 10-117(b), Stapf and Phillips cannot avail themselves of the adage in\n   <em>\n    Hatfield\n   </em>\n   that a person's decision to drink is the sole cause of injuries arising from his intoxication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hatfield,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2226786\" index=\"258\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/197/249/\">\n    197 Md. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"259\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.2d%20754\">\n    78 A.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS REVERSED.
