King alleged she suffered injuries when her leg fell through a broken and corroded sewer grate, which, she averred, the Authority negligently failed to maintain. King argues the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion for judgment\n   <em>\n    non obstante veredicto\n   </em>\n   (judgment n.o.v.) or a new trial as a sanction for the Authority's spoliation of evidence, where the Authority purposefully destroyed the sewer grate that injured King after it received notice the sewer grate was connected to a \"law claim.\" She further asserts the trial court's failure to issue a sanction against the Authority for its purposeful spoliation of evidence was contrary to public policy. Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In November 2012, King filed suit against the Authority in the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Through her complaint, King alleged that, in August 2012, she attempted to enter a vehicle parked along the curb near the intersection of Greenfield Avenue and Frank Street in the City of Pittsburgh (City). As she opened the front passenger vehicle door and attempted to enter the vehicle, her right foot and leg fell through a hole in a sewer grate located on Frank Street near its intersection with Greenfield Avenue. King alleged that prior to August 2012 the grate was allowed to fall into a state of disrepair in that it was rusty and contained a hole that she fell through. As a result, King alleged, she suffered a large laceration on her right leg.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   King averred the Authority owned, possessed or controlled the premises located at the corner of Greenfield Avenue and Frank Street, including the sewer grate. Thus, she alleged, the Authority was responsible to maintain the premises and the sewer grate. King alleged a dangerous condition existed on the premises in that a hole existed in the sewer grate. She alleged the Authority negligently failed to maintain the sewer grate, thereby allowing a hole to form and creating a dangerous condition. King further averred the Authority had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition and negligently failed to remedy it. She alleged that, had the Authority exercised reasonable care in the maintenance and inspection of the dangerous condition, it could have made the condition safe.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The Authority responded by filing an answer with new matter. In its new matter, the Authority averred it was immune from liability under the Tort Claims Act. Among other things, the Authority alleged it had no actual or constructive notice of the allegedly dangerous condition related to the sewer grate prior to the incident alleged in King's complaint. King filed a reply to the Authority's new matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The case then proceeded to arbitration, after which a board of arbitrators found in favor of the Authority and against King. King appealed to the trial court. She waived her right to a jury trial. The parties conducted discovery. Thereafter, the Authority filed a motion for summary judgment, which the trial court denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In May 2015, the trial court held a non-jury trial. At trial, King testified on her own behalf and submitted documentary evidence, including a photograph of the damaged sewer grate. Additionally, Rick Obermeier, an Authority employee, testified.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After the trial, the trial court entered a non-jury verdict in favor of the Authority and against King. King filed post-trial motions in which she asserted the crux of the case was whether the facts established liability against the Authority under the utility service facilities exception to local agency immunity. King acknowledged that this exception required her to prove the Authority had actual or constructive notice of the dangerous condition of the sewer grate as a prerequisite to establishing liability. King conceded she did not present evidence of actual notice of the broken sewer grate, but rather she presented evidence of constructive notice of the dangerous condition in the form of testimony and documents showing the Authority was in the vicinity of the broken sewer grate six times in the two-and-a-half years preceding her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   King further argued that Obermeier testified the Authority destroyed the sewer grate after it received actual notice that the grate was broken and connected to a \"law claim.\" Reproduced Record (R.R.) at\n   87a. She asserted the trial court questioned Obermeier regarding the Authority's general practice of preserving evidence after receiving notice of a \"law claim,\" and Obermeier confirmed it was not the Authority's practice to \"bag and tag\" or preserve evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   King further averred that, at closing argument, her counsel argued that, within the concept of constructive notice was the notion that after a defective condition exists for a certain period of time, the entity responsible for maintaining the alleged hazard \"could reasonably be charged with notice,\" and that argument strengthens with each day, month or year the condition exists.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   King asserted the Authority's standard practice of spoliation, which occurred here, deprived her of the ability to test the broken grate for a scientific, definitive determination as to how long the grate was broken before her injury. Thus, she argued, the Authority based its entire defense on the concept of notice and engaged in spoliation that prevented her from gathering evidence as to that notice. As such, King asserted the Authority's spoliation of the sewer grate mandated a finding of liability against the Authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   King further asserted that in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder v. Department of Transportation,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"507886\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/551/243/\">\n    551 Pa. 243\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11826955,507886\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/710/23/\">\n    710 A.2d 23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, adopting the Third Circuit's approach in\n   <em>\n    Schmid v. Milwaukee Electric Tool Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834632\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/76/\">\n    13 F.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (3d Cir.1994), held that, in determining the proper penalty for spoliation of evidence, a court should consider: (1) the degree of fault of the party who destroyed the evidence; (2) the degree of prejudice suffered by the opposing party; and, (3) the availability of a lesser sanction that will protect the opposing party's rights and deter future similar conduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Here, King argued, the testimony indicated, not only did the Authority destroy the sewer grate, but it was the Authority's practice to destroy such evidence in every case. King maintained the resulting prejudice to her and all other similarly situated plaintiffs was, and will be, severe because this spoliation prevents plaintiffs from establishing the length of time an alleged defect exists, which directly relates to proving constructive notice. King asserted that, in such circumstances, had the Authority preserved and inspected the evidence, it would have been determined that the defective condition existed for a sufficient amount of time to establish constructive notice against the Authority. Thus, King requested the trial court vacate its verdict in favor of the Authority and enter judgment n.o.v. in her favor. Alternatively, King sought a new trial in which the trial court would foreclose the Authority from asserting a notice defense as a sanction for spoliation of evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The Authority filed a response to King's post-trial motions. The parties also filed briefs. Thereafter, the trial court issued an order denying King's post-trial motions. King appealed, and the trial court directed her to file a concise statement of the errors complained of on appeal pursuant to Pa. R.A.P.1925(b), which she did. The trial court then issued an opinion pursuant to Pa. R.A.P.1925(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In its opinion, the trial court explained this matter arose from a personal injury claim pursued under the utility service facilities exception to local agency immunity. The trial court stated the Authority acknowledged that it \"controls water and catch basin main lines and other related appurtenances\" within the City, and it admitted in its answer and new matter that it maintained the catch basin grate located near the corner of Frank Street and Greenfield Avenue. Tr. Ct., Slip Op., 9/2/15, at 3 (citing the Authority's Answer and New Matter at \u00b6 21).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The Authority does not regularly or routinely inspect catch basin grates within its service area. Rather, it reacts to reports of apparent disrepair or of any hazards presented by catch basin grates when reports are received from the public or Authority personnel who incidentally observe such hazards or disrepair in the course of performing other assignments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The trial court stated, to avail herself of the utility service facilities exception, an injured plaintiff must establish the local agency either had actual notice or could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances of a dangerous condition at a sufficient time prior to the event to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The trial court explained King did not establish the Authority received any complaints, damage reports, repair orders or other records pertinent to the condition of the catch basin grate located near Frank Street and Greenfield Avenue at any time prior to the accident that occurred here. King correctly observed, however, that notice could also be established inferentially. Thus, where the record reveals a hazard existed over a substantial period, a court may reasonably presume the predicate of notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The trial court explained that King asserted the Authority's destruction of the catch basin grate deprived her of the opportunity to prove the grate was likely damaged for some time and that an inference of notice of such damage was appropriate. King \"insist[ed] that an inspection of the catch basin grate may have revealed that the grate was badly corroded and broken for a long time, such that [the Authority] knew or should have known of the hazard[.]\" Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 4 (quoting King's Pa. R.A.P.1925(b) Statement at 2). King further maintained that, because the Authority disposed of the catch basin grate-\"apparently melted it down\"-after receiving notice of King's legal claim, the Authority should reasonably be charged with notice of a dangerous condition under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(5) as an appropriate sanction.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834632\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/76/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That sanction, King argued, should take the form of either judgment in her favor or a new trial in which the Authority was barred from advancing a notice defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court explained that spoliation, by definition, is the non-preservation or significant alteration of evidence that is pertinent to pending or future litigation.\n   <em>\n    PTSI, Inc. v. Haley,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7306790\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/71/304/\">\n    71 A.3d 304\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super.2013). In its most obvious form, spoliation occurs in the context of pending litigation when a party breaches a court's preservation of evidence order. In that context, a court may reasonably presume that if evidence subject to an order is later lost, altered or destroyed, that evidence, had it remained available and fully preserved, would have established facts adverse to the party that had possession or control of the evidence while subject to the order. In such instances, an appropriate spoliation sanction may be one that accepts as true any factual allegation that the evidence would have been offered to prove had it not been destroyed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Nevertheless, the trial court stated, the more common penalty for spoliation is less severe. It does not result in declaring the non-offending party's allegation true, but rather merely permits an inference that the missing evidence would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it.\n   <em>\n    See Schroeder.\n   </em>\n   The trial court stated that has been the view of our courts for some time.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    McHugh v. McHugh,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"989688\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/186/197/\">\n    186 Pa. 197\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20A.%20410\">\n    40 A. 410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1898). Thus, in\n   <em>\n    McHugh,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   The spoliation of papers and the destruction or withholding of evidence\n   which a party ought to produce gives rise to a presumption unfavorable to him, as his conduct may properly be attributed to his supposed knowledge that the truth would operate against him. This principle has been applied in a great variety of cases, and it is now so well established that it is unnecessary to do more than state it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20A.%20410\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20A.%20410\">\n    at 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, the trial court explained, King had no need to rely on a claim of spoliation in order to establish the catch basin grate was broken and resulted in injury to her. The Authority did not vigorously dispute King's account of the event or her injuries. Instead, it argued that, regardless of any injury King suffered from a broken catch basin grate, she could not recover because the record contained no evidence that the Authority had prior actual or constructive notice of any hazardous condition. As such, the Authority asserted, King did not establish the exception to local agency immunity under 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The trial court further stated, although King argued that an inspection of the grate by an expert after the injury might have revealed the grate was badly corroded or broken for a substantial period of time, she offered no competent testimony to that effect. Nor was any testimony or case law provided that corrosion and decay may be presumed to occur over time and that, on that basis, notice may be inferred. The trial court stated the mere passage of time does not give rise to an inference that a structure might be impaired or unsafe, so as to impute notice of a hazard.\n   <em>\n    See generally\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Walden v. City of Hawkinsville, Georgia,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Fed.%20Appx.%20836\">\n    191 Fed.Appx. 836\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (11th Cir.2006) (culvert had been in place for 100 years or more).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   If spoliation occurred, the trial court stated, when considering a proper sanction, a court must weigh three factors: (1) the degree of fault of the party who destroyed the evidence; (2) the degree of prejudice suffered by the opposing party; and, (3) whether there is a lesser sanction that will avoid substantial unfairness to the opposing party and, where the offending party is seriously at fault, will deter similar conduct by others in the future.\n   <em>\n    See PTSI.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, the trial court stated, King did not establish the second factor, prejudice. Because King has not-or cannot-establish that, had the grate been preserved, she could have shown both the approximate date of any damage to the grate and the fact of notice or even constructive notice to the Authority of such damage, King did not establish prejudice. Rather, the trial court stated, King asked, in effect, that some degree of prejudice be presumed because the grate could not be examined. However, the trial court explained, King presented no evidence that any expert examination of the grate would result in a determination that the Authority would have had notice of the broken grate in advance of her injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Issues\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   King argues the trial court erred in failing to grant her motion for\n   judgment n.o.v. or a new trial as a sanction for the Authority's spoliation of evidence, where the Authority purposefully destroyed the sewer grate that injured her after it received notice the sewer grate was connected to a \"law claim.\" King also contends the trial court's failure to issue a sanction against the Authority for its purposeful spoliation of evidence was in error as contrary to public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Judgment n.o.v. or New Trial as Spoliation Sanction\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   King first argues this Court should reverse the trial court's order that denied her motion for judgment n.o.v. or, alternatively, a new trial in which the Authority was precluded from offering a notice defense. She asserts the trial court reached an erroneous finding that the Authority's spoliation of evidence did not warrant a sanction under the three-factor test adopted by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder.\n   </em>\n   Specifically, King contends, the trial court improperly held that King did not establish she was prejudiced by the Authority's spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   King maintains she was prejudiced by the Authority's purposeful destruction of the sewer grate because without an examination of it, King was unable to offer any testimony as to how long the grate may have been in a state of disrepair. King argues that, being unable to present an opinion as to the period of time the grate may have been broken or badly corroded prevented her from rebutting the Authority's notice defense and establishing an inference that the Authority had constructive notice of the grate's condition prior to her injury. Thus, King contends, her inability to examine and present at trial the only piece of physical evidence that could be used to establish constructive notice substantially prejudiced her case-in-chief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   King points out that in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder,\n   </em>\n   our Supreme Court \"recognized that a common penalty for spoliation is a jury instruction allowing an inference that the missing evidence would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=191%20Fed.%20Appx.%20836\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 26-27 (citing\n   <em>\n    Schmid,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1834632\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/13/76/\">\n    13 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   78 ). King argues that the\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   analysis, adopted by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Schroeder,\n   </em>\n   was applied in\n   <em>\n    Pia v. Perrotti,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11684800\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/718/321/\">\n    718 A.2d 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super.1998), where a warehouse owner\n   sued an electrical contracting firm after the destruction of her warehouse by an electrical fire. Upon an investigation of the warehouse after the fire, the owner preserved only the electrical equipment she deemed relevant to the cause of the fire. The common pleas court gave the jury a spoliation instruction. The Superior Court upheld the instruction, finding the warehouse owner was at fault for failing to preserve all of the electrical equipment and the defendant electrical contracting firm was prejudiced in its inability to present alternative causes of the fire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Under the\n   <em>\n    Schmid\n   </em>\n   analysis, King contends, the first prong is established where a party knows litigation is pending or likely, and it is foreseeable that discarding the evidence will prejudice the opposing party.\n   <em>\n    Mt. Olivet Tabernacle Church v. Edwin L. Wiegand Div.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9481274\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/781/1263/\">\n    781 A.2d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Super.2001). Here, King argues, under the first prong, the Authority bears complete fault for destroying the evidence. She asserts the Authority admittedly destroyed the sewer grate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tr. Ct., Non-Jury Trial, Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 5/5/15, at 29; R.R. at 53a. Moreover, the Authority knew litigation was likely because it had actual notice that the grate was connected to a \"law claim,\" and, therefore, it was also aware that destroying the grate would prejudice King to a high degree. Further, the Authority's testimony established it is the Authority's practice to destroy such evidence in every case. N.T. at 41; R.R. at 65a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   King maintains the Authority's conduct is more egregious than that of the offending party in\n   <em>\n    Pia\n   </em>\n   because, unlike in\n   <em>\n    Pia\n   </em>\n   where the evidence thought relevant by the offending party was preserved, here no attempt was made to preserve the sewer grate. Even worse, King argues, while the offending party in\n   <em>\n    Pia\n   </em>\n   ostensibly acted in good faith by preserving the evidence she believed was relevant, the Authority here had notice the grate was likely to be the subject of litigation and nonetheless purposefully destroyed it. Thus, King contends, the Authority bears complete fault for destruction of the sewer grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Under the second prong, King asserts, the court must measure the degree of prejudice suffered by the opposing party. In its opinion, the trial court wrote that King did not satisfy this prong because no evidence was provided that an examination of the grate \"might have revealed that the grate had been badly corroded or broken for a substantial period of time\" nor how such an examination \"would have resulted in a determination that [the Authority] would have had notice of the broken grate....\" Tr. Ct., Slip Op. at 5-6. To support the point, the trial court added, \"[no] testimony or case law was provided to the effect that corrosion and decay may be presumed to occur over time and that, on that basis, notice may be inferred.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9481274\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/781/1263/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   King argues the trial court's reasoning puts the \"cart before the horse.\" Br. of Appellant at 16. To begin, King asserts, the reason she was unable to show an examination of the grate \"might have revealed that the grate had been badly corroded or broken for a substantial period of time\" was because of the Authority's act of spoliation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9481274\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/781/1263/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 5). King maintains this is precisely the reason she was so prejudiced by the spoliation. She contends an examination of the grate itself was the only means through which such a determination could be made-when the Authority destroyed the grate, it also destroyed any chance for King to prove the grate was in a state of disrepair for a substantial amount of time. In short, King argues, the fact that she was unable to show through any alternative means that the grate may have been in a state of disrepair for a substantial\n   period prior to the incident directly reflects the prejudice she suffered as a result of its spoliation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   King further asserts the trial court supplemented its opinion by stating, even if King could show the grate was badly corroded or broken for a substantial period, such evidence would still be insufficient to prove the Authority should be charged with notice. This is because \"[t]he mere passage of time does not give rise to an inference that a structure might be impaired or unsafe, so as to impute notice of a hazard.\" Br. of Appellant at 17 (quoting Tr. Ct., Slip Op. at 6). In support of this statement, the trial court cited\n   <em>\n    Walden,\n   </em>\n   an Eleventh Circuit opinion that is not binding here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Regardless of any Eleventh Circuit precedent, King maintains, Pennsylvania law is clear that the amount of time a defect or dangerous condition exists is an important consideration in charging a party with constructive notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Rogers v. Horn &amp; Hardart Baking Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"735301\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-super/183/83/\">\n    183 Pa.Super. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.2d%20762\">\n    127 A.2d 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764 (1956).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Further, King argues, the trial court's point that \"no testimony or case law [was] provided to the effect that corrosion and decay may be presumed to occur over time and that, on that basis, notice may be inferred,\" Br. of Appellant at 18 (quoting Tr. Ct., Slip Op. at 5-6), should not defeat King's ability to satisfy the second prong. King contends, if the Authority did not destroy the grate, an expert could have examined it and from that examination could have formulated an opinion as to how the corrosion and decay process occurs generally and how it occurred specifically to this grate. However, because of the Authority's spoliation, King was barred from having an expert examine the grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Therefore, King asserts, under the second prong, she was prejudiced by the Authority's intentional action of spoliation. Discarding the sewer grate destroyed the only available physical evidence. Absent an examination of the grate, King contends she had no way to prove the length of time the defect existed, which, under Pennsylvania law, goes directly to constructive notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Lastly, King maintains, under the third prong, the only proper sanction at this point is for this Court to reverse the trial court's denial of King's post-trial motions. King argues the Authority stripped her of her right and ability to prove constructive notice when it intentionally destroyed the sewer grate. As a bench trial, King asserts, she was offered no recourse in the form of a jury instruction, nor was she provided any alternative relief in the form of some other sanction. King contends that, because she established: (1) the Authority destroyed the evidence when it had notice it was connected to a \"law claim\"; (2) it was foreseeable that the destruction would prejudice King in pursuing that claim; and, (3) that the destruction did, in fact, prejudice King's case-in-chief, she should now be granted a sanction against the Authority.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

[King] concedes that proof of actual or constructive notice of a dangerous condition notice is a necessary element of her claim.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   [King] did not establish that any complaints, damage reports, repair orders or other records pertinent to the condition of the catch basin grate at the Frank Street and Greenfield Avenue location had been received by [the Authority] at any time in advance of the accident and injury that resulted in this case. [King] correctly observes, however, that notice may also be established inferentially. Where a record demonstrates that a hazard has existed over a substantial length of time, a court may reasonably presume the predicate of notice.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   In the matter at hand, [King] argues that [the Authority's] destruction of the catch basin grate deprived [King] of the opportunity to demonstrate to the court that the grate had likely been damaged for some time and that an inference of notice of such damage was appropriate. [King] insists that an inspection of the catch basin grate 'may have revealed that the grate was badly corroded and broken for a long time such that [the Authority] knew or should have of the hazard[.]' \" [King's 1925(b) Statement at 2]. Because [the Authority] disposed of the catch basin grate-apparently 'melted it down'-after receiving notice of [King's] legal claim, [King] maintains that [the Authority] should reasonably be charged with notice of a dangerous condition under [42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(5) ] as an appropriate sanction. That sanction, [King] argues, should take the form of either judgment in [King's] favor or a new trial in which [the Authority] is barred from advancing a notice defense....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   In its most obvious form, spoliation occurs in the context of current litigation when a party breaches a preservation of evidence order that has been put in place by the court. In that context, a court may reasonably presume that if evidence that is subject to such an order is subsequently lost, altered or destroyed, that evidence, had it remained available and fully preserved, would have established facts adverse to the party that had possession or control of the evidence while subject to the preservation order. In such instances, an appropriate spoliation sanction may be one that accepts as true any factual allegation that the evidence would have been offered to prove had it not been destroyed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   The more common penalty for spoliation, however, is less severe. It does not result in declaring the non-offending party's allegation true, but merely permits an inference that the missing evidence\n   would have been unfavorable to the party that destroyed it. [\n   <em>\n    See Schroeder\n   </em>\n   ]....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   In the matter at hand, [King] has no need to rely upon a claim of spoliation to establish that the catch basin grate ... was broken and resulted in an injury to [King]. [The Authority] does not vigorously dispute [King's] account of events or her injuries. [The Authority] instead argues that, irrespective of any injury resulting to [King] from a broken catch basin grate, she cannot recover against [the Authority] because the record provides no evidence that [the Authority] had actual or constructive advance notice of any hazardous condition. Therefore, plaintiff failed to establish any exception to governmental immunity under [42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(5) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Although [King] contends that an inspection of the grate by an expert after the fact of the injury might have revealed that the grate had been badly corroded or broken for a substantial period of time,\n   <em>\n    [King] offered no competent testimony to that effect. Nor was any testimony or case law provided to the effect that corrosion and decay may be presumed to occur over time and that, on that basis, notice may be inferred. The mere passage of time does not give rise to an inference that a structure might be impaired or unsafe, so as to impute notice of a hazard. [See generally Walden].\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   If spoliation has occurred, then, when considering an appropriate sanction for such conduct, a trial court must weigh three factors....\n   <em>\n    In this case, the second of those essential factors has not been established by [King]. Because [King] has not-or cannot-establish that, had the grate been preserved, [King] could then have demonstrated both the approximate date of any damage to the grate and the fact of notice or even constructive notice to [the Authority] of such damage, prejudice to [King's] case has not been established.\n   </em>\n   Rather, [King] asks, in effect, that some degree of prejudice be presumed because the grate cannot be examined.\n   <em>\n    No evidence was provided that any expert examination of the grate would have resulted in a determination that [the Authority] would have had notice of the broken grate in advance of [King's] accident and injury.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   Tr. Ct., Slip Op., at 3-6. No abuse of discretion is apparent in the trial court's denial of King's requested spoliation sanction of either judgment n.o.v. or a new trial based on the Authority's spoliation of the sewer grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   To that end, our review of the record supports the trial court's determination that King did not offer any evidence that an inspection of the grate by an expert may have revealed the grate was badly corroded or broken for a substantial period, or that the effect of any such corrosion or decay could be presumed to occur over time and, on that basis, notice could be inferred. Indeed, King did not identify a materials expert as a possible witness or assert that she ever contacted one. Additionally, King offers no explanation as to why she could not have provided such opinion evidence based on the large, color photograph of the damaged sewer grate she presented at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Certified Record, Non-Jury Trial, 5/5/15, Plaintiff's Ex. 5; Br. of Appellant, Ex. B. at 5. Thus, because King did not present any competent proof that, had the grate been preserved, she could show both the approximate date of any damage and the fact of constructive notice to the Authority, she did not establish prejudice, the second prong of the\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   analysis. Rather, as the trial court indicated, King asked, in\n   effect, that the trial court presume prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   In addition, while the trial court did not expressly address the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   analysis, the degree of fault of the party who destroyed the evidence, we note, evaluation of that prong requires consideration of two components: the extent of the offending party's duty to preserve the evidence, and the presence or absence of bad faith.\n   <em>\n    Creazzo.\n   </em>\n   The duty prong, in turn, is established where: the offending party knows litigation against it is pending or likely; and, it is foreseeable that discarding the evidence would be prejudicial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11821085\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/825/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Here, Authority employee Obermeier acknowledged that, when the Authority inspected the sewer grate in October 2012, it knew the grate was connected to a \"law claim.\" N.T. at 29; R.R. at 53a. Nevertheless, the sewer grate was \"scrapped\" and replaced by the Authority.\n   <em>\n    Id.;\n   </em>\n   N.T. at 39; R.R. at 63a. Further, Obermeier confirmed it was not the Authority's practice to \"bag and tag\" or preserve evidence. N.T. at 41; R.R. at 65a. However, despite the Authority's knowledge that the grate was connected to a \"law claim,\" the record does not clearly show the Authority was aware that discarding and replacing the damaged sewer grate would be prejudicial. And, as set forth above, the trial court's supported determination reveals that King did not\n   <em>\n    prove\n   </em>\n   prejudice to her case as a result of the destruction of the grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   In addition, as to the second component of fault,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   bad faith, neither at trial nor in her post-trial motions did King assert the Authority acted in bad faith in destroying the sewer grate. Thus, consideration of the first prong of the\n   <em>\n    Schroeder\n   </em>\n   analysis, fault, particularly when coupled with the trial court's supported finding of lack of prejudice, does not warrant the severe spoliation sanction King seeks.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Nevertheless, King cites\n   <em>\n    Pia,\n   </em>\n   in which the Superior Court upheld a trial court's decision to charge a jury that it could draw a spoliation inference against a plaintiff where the plaintiff did not preserve all electrical equipment related to a fire in a warehouse she owned. King argues the Authority's conduct here is more egregious than the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Pia,\n   </em>\n   warranting a more severe sanction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   However, in neither\n   <em>\n    Pia\n   </em>\n   nor any other case King cites did a court determine that a grant of judgment n.o.v. or a new trial in a party's favor was an appropriate spoliation sanction. Indeed, as the Superior Court in\n   <em>\n    Mount Olivet Tabernacle Church,\n   </em>\n   pointed out, even in a case where the offending party was highly culpable and prejudice to the non-offending party was severe, a federal trial court declined to dismiss the offending party's case because it considered such a sanction too punitive.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11821085\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/708/825/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 1273 n. 9 (citing\n   <em>\n    Henkel Corp. v.

Further, although King requested such relief in her post-trial motions, in her closing argument to the trial court she merely asserted she was entitled to a spoliation inference as a sanction for destruction of the sewer grate. N.T. at 55-56; R.R. at 79a-80a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   As a final point, King cites the Superior Court's 1956 decision in\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   for the proposition that: \"What constitutes constructive notice must depend on the circumstances of each case, but one of the most important factors to be taken into consideration is the time elapsing between the origin of the defect or hazardous condition and the accident.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 764. However,\n   <em>\n    Rogers\n   </em>\n   does not support King's position. In that case, which did not involve an immunity statute, the Superior Court\n   <em>\n    reversed\n   </em>\n   a common pleas court's grant of judgment n.o.v. in favor of a plaintiff who suffered a slip and fall at a restaurant allegedly caused by the existence of liquid on the floor. Among other things, the Court determined the plaintiff presented no evidence from which the fact-finder could infer that the owner had actual or constructive notice of the existence of the alleged hazardous condition that it negligently failed to correct as \"there [was] no testimony as to how or when this slippery substance came to be on the floor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 764. Thus, there was nothing to show that the liquid was there for a sufficient period of time to place the restaurant on notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Similar to the plaintiff in\n   <em>\n    Rogers,\n   </em>\n   King presented no evidence here from which the trial court could infer that the Authority had constructive notice of the alleged defect in the sewer grate. King offered no evidence, expert or otherwise, as to the age of the grate or the length of time the defective condition existed, and, while she attributed this failure to the Authority's destruction of the grate, she did not establish that, had the grate been preserved, she could have demonstrated both the approximate date of any damage to the grate and the fact of constructive notice of such damage to the Authority. Thus, King presented no evidence that any expert examination of the grate would have resulted in a determination that the Authority had notice of the broken grate at a sufficient time in advance of the incident to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. Rather, King relied on the argument of her attorney that she suffered prejudice as a result of the Authority's destruction of the sewer grate.

To that end, King asserts: (1) the Authority is a public agency and its property exists for the public to walk and drive on; (2) nevertheless, the Authority admits it does not inspect its property; (3) the Authority only inspects and performs maintenance after someone complains or is hurt, N.T. at 22; R.R. at 46a; (4) the Authority then disclaims any notice of a dangerous condition of its property; and, (5) the Authority destroys evidence that could be used to establish constructive notice, N.T. at 41; R.R. at 65a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   King contends these practices are contrary to the \"utility service facilities\" exception to local agency immunity as well as public policy more broadly. She acknowledges that it is clear from the language of the exception that proof of notice is required for a plaintiff to recover.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 8542(b)(5). However, she argues the statute is equally clear that actual notice is not required; rather, a plaintiff may recover if she can establish the agency \"could reasonably be charged with notice under the circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810764\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/128/6810764/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   In other words, if all other elements of liability are proven, a plaintiff will recover if she shows the agency had constructive notice of the dangerous condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   King contends that, by including the constructive notice provision in this exception, it is evident the General Assembly sought to impose a duty on local agencies that own sewer facilities to take reasonable measures to inspect and maintain those facilities, even when not given actual notice that a defect or dangerous condition exists.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921. King argues this makes sense because (1) the facilities are put in place for the protection and benefit of the public; and, (2) as a public utility, the Authority is charged under Pennsylvania law with a duty to inspect its property to ensure it is in a safe condition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Section 1501 of the Public Utility Code, 66 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1501 (\"Every public utility shall furnish and maintain adequate, efficient, safe, and reasonable service and facilities, and shall make all such repairs, changes, alterations, substitutions, extensions, and improvements in or to such service and facilities as shall be necessary or proper for the accommodation, convenience, and safety of its patrons, employees, and the public....\"). King argues the Authority's conduct here is in derogation of its duties as a property owner and a public utility agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   King asserts that, unless the Authority receives actual notice of a dangerous condition and fails to remedy the condition within a reasonable time after which an injury results, the Authority could never be held liable under the utility service facilities exception. In other words, King contends, the Authority's policy of non-inspection renders the constructive notice provision of the exception meaningless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   King further maintains that, even assuming the Authority's policy of non-inspection does not render the constructive notice provision superfluous in and of itself, the Authority's policy of spoliation most certainly does. This is because even if the Authority could be charged with constructive notice through proof that a particular condition existed for a long period, a plaintiff could never make such a showing based on the Authority's policy of spoliation. King argues this is particularly relevant in the context of injuries arising from sewer grates because through no other means, besides actually examining the grate, can an inference of constructive notice be shown.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Lastly, King urges this Court to consider the broader impacts an affirmation of the trial court's ruling may have on the public. To that end, she argues, although her injuries were by no means minor,\n   there is no doubt they could have been far worse. King asserts the next victim may be elderly or adolescent and may suffer injuries far more severe than those King sustained. Under such circumstances, she argues, it would offend our society's common sense notion of justice to deny relief to the victim merely because the Authority owns a lot of sewer grates, has no policy for regular inspection, and destroys any and all evidence that could otherwise be used to establish liability. King contends the sanction she now advocates for is necessary to deter the intentional practice of spoliation currently used by the Authority. If left unsanctioned, King argues, the Authority will continue to employ its practice of spoliation, thereby prejudicing all future similarly situated plaintiffs by preventing them from establishing the length of time an alleged defect exists, which goes directly to proving constructive notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   Initially, we reject the Authority's argument that King waived the issue regarding the Authority's constructive notice of the damaged sewer grate. As the Authority acknowledges, King filed her Pa. R.A.P.1925(b) Statement\n   <em>\n    prior\n   </em>\n   to the trial court's issuance of its opinion here. Thus, at the outset of her 1925(b) Statement, King stated: \"The trial court has not written an opinion. Therefore, [King] cannot readily discern the basis for the trial court's decision. Accordingly, [King] will identify the errors complained of in general terms pursuant to Pa. R.A.P.1925(b)(4)(vi).\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. for Appellee, App. C. In turn, Pa. R.A.P.1925(b)(4)(vi) provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   If the appellant in a civil case cannot readily discern the basis for the judge's decision, the appellant shall preface the Statement with an explanation as to why the Statement has identified the errors in only general terms. In such a case, the generality of the Statement will not be grounds for finding waiver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810764\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/134/128/6810764/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, under the circumstances presented here, King was permitted to express her claims of error in general terms. Further, although the Authority argues that, in a case such as this, where the Authority's principal defense at trial was the lack of prior constructive notice, it is not mere \"generality\" to omit reference to the Authority's lack of prior constructive notice, our review of King's 1925(b) Statement reveals King did, in fact, briefly address the issue of constructive notice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Br. for Appellee, App. C at 2. As such, King did not waive the issue of whether the Authority had constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition of the sewer grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   Notably, however, aside from King's argument that the Authority's destruction of the sewer grate prevented her from proving notice, in both her 1925(b) Statement and her brief to this Court, King does not clearly present a stand-alone argument that the City had constructive notice of the alleged dangerous condition of the sewer grate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In any event, regardless of the Authority's claims of waiver, as explained above, the trial court correctly explained that King did not establish the Authority had actual or constructive notice of the allegedly dangerous condition of the sewer grate at issue at a sufficient time prior to the incident to have taken measures to protect against the dangerous condition. To that end, although at trial King presented six notification forms that documented complaints the Authority received concerning its water or sewer facilities at various locations within blocks of the sewer grate at issue,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   N.T. at 25-27; R.R. at 49a-51a, King presented no evidence that the Authority received any complaints regarding either the sewer grate at issue\n   or any other sewer grates at the intersection of Frank Street and Greenfield Avenue prior to the incident. N.T. at 28-29; R.R. at 52a-53a; N.T. at 32-34; R.R. at 56a-58a; N.T. at 35-36; R.R. at 59a-60a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Further, the following exchange occurred during King's counsel's cross-examination of Obermeier, the Authority's witness:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   Q. And to your knowledge, there wasn't any investigation as to what caused the [sewer grate at issue] to break, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   A. No, there would be no way how we could-a car could have drove over it and broke it, whatever, you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   Q. And there would have been no investigation by the [Authority] as to how long that grate may have been broken before you received the complaint about [King's] injury, correct?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A. We would have no way of knowing that.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   N.T. at 29; R.R. at 53a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   In short, because notice was an essential element to King's suit, without proof of notice King could not recover under the utility service facilities exception to local agency immunity.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gramlich v.
