Mr. Hall was found early in the morning on July 30, 2008, lying dead from gunshot wounds in the parking lot of KIPP Harmony Academy, a public charter elementary school located in Baltimore City.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Appellant was tried before a jury in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City after his codefendant Toomer had been convicted of murder. The State attempted to present Toomer as a witness against Appellant, but when called before the jury to testify, Toomer refused to answer questions and invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. Acting swiftly, the circuit court halted questioning and excused the jury before examining the merits of Toomer's assertion of privilege. The circuit court did not compel Toomer's testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   After the jury convicted Appellant of Mr. Hall's murder, Appellant filed a motion for a new trial arguing,\n   <em>\n    inter alia,\n   </em>\n   that the State called Toomer for the impermissible purpose of using Toomer's reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege before the jury to imply Appellant's guilt. Toomer maintained that the State had been made aware that he would not testify. The court, however, rejected Appellant's contentions of error and denied his motion for a new trial. Appellant asks this Court to examine:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   I. Whether Appellant was denied his right to a fair trial, in violation of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, when the prosecution called his separately tried and convicted codefendant as a witness in its case in chief with full knowledge that the witness would invoke a valid Fifth Amendment privilege and refuse to testify?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   II. Whether the trial court erred in denying appellant's motion for new trial when the prosecution,\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   a. Improperly called appellant's separately tried and convicted codefendant as a witness with full knowledge that the witness would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuse to testify;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   b. Committed a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation by failing to disclose impeachment information relating to a critical prosecution witness;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   c. Improperly displayed a firearm to the jury, which was not admitted into evidence or forensically linked to\n   crime, in support of its closing argument asserting that the firearm was, in fact, the murder weapon used by appellant?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Applying the factors enumerated in\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1932054\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/237/305/#p309\">\n    237 Md. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 309-10,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    206 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1965), we conclude Appellant was not prejudiced by codefendant Toomer's brief appearance before the jury because (1) the prosecutor did not call Toomer solely to gain the benefit of \"the effect of the claim of privilege on the jury\"; (2) the circuit court minimized any negative effects of Toomer's refusal to testify when it halted questioning expeditiously and excused the jury; and (3) during the course of the trial Appellant never requested any curative instruction nor did he move for a mistrial. Regarding the other issues Appellant presented in his motion for a new trial, we perceive no error or abuse of discretion on the part of the circuit court and conclude that Appellant was not denied his right to a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 15, 2011, a grand jury indicted Appellant for Mr. Hall's murder on the charges of: murder in the first degree; use of a handgun in the commission of a crime of violence; wearing, carrying, and transporting a handgun upon his person; and possession of a handgun after being convicted of a disqualifying crime. The grand jury also indicted Appellant of conspiring with codefendant Derrick Toomer to commit Mr. Hall's murder. Appellant's case was severed from Derrick Toomer's on March 11, 2013, and Appellant's first trial commenced on March 22, 2013, in the Baltimore City Circuit Court. Appellant moved for a mistrial in that proceeding, and the court granted the motion on April 1, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Appellant's second trial began on March 18, 2014. The following events transpired as the story unfolded over the six-day trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    A. The Testimony of Hall's Fianc\u00e9\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The State presented as its first witness, Ms. Faaizah Seals, who was Mr. Hall's fianc\u00e9 at the time of his death. She\n   testified that she and Mr. Hall were co-owners of Muscles Bail Bonds. Ms. Seals related that Muscles Bail Bonds was seeking a new insurer following the 2008 departure of another employee who had acted as the company surety insurer under his license as an insurance producer in Maryland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Hall was looking for another person who was licensed through which Muscles Bail Bonds could be insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the early evening hours of July 29, 2008, while Ms. Seals was cooking dinner, Mr. Hall was taking a nap. Mr. Hall's phone rang at approximately 7:00 p.m., so Ms. Seals woke him up to tell him about the call. He listened to the voicemail left by the caller and prepared to leave their home. According to Ms. Seals, \"[Mr. Hall] said he was going to meet up with someone named G concerning insurance....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   That evening Mr. Hall drove away in a Ford Expedition XL2-a vehicle they both shared and used in their business. After Mr. Hall did not return, Ms. Seals tried to reach him unsuccessfully on his cell phone multiple times throughout the night and, after getting no answer, she also tried a couple of hospitals to no avail. In the morning when she awoke, she found a card under the front door from homicide detective Michael Moran asking her to give him a call.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Detective Moran\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Detective Michael Moran of the Baltimore City Police Department, Homicide Unit, was called to testify regarding his role as the primary investigating officer in this case. He testified that at 6:01 a.m. on July 30, 2008, he responded to a call notifying him that there was a deceased person in the\n   parking lot of KIPP Academy at 4701 Greenspring Avenue. When Det. Moran arrived at the scene he observed \"the deceased, Mr. Ralph Hall, face down wearing blue jeans[ and] a red polo,\" and he noted that a medical technician had already pronounced Mr. Hall dead. Det. Moran also testified that, when he arrived, \"[Mr. Hall] had on a pair of white tennis shoes that said Muscles on them [, and] [h]e was stiff.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Det. Moran oversaw the collection of crime scene evidence, including photographs, measurements, and other physical evidence. Under his supervision, Baltimore City Crime Lab technicians processed the scene; however, no weapon or bullet casings were recovered. Det. Moran testified that he was also present at the autopsy of Mr. Hall, and that the Assistant Medical Examiner who conducted the autopsy recovered two projectiles from Mr. Hall's body and submitted them for ballistic analysis. Baltimore City Firearms Examiner Christopher Faber later determined that the projectiles were lead bullets of the .38/.357 caliber class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   During his evaluation of the scene, Det. Moran noticed a security camera on a nearby building \"up high and ... facing towards the parking lot where the victim was found.\" He directed officers to recover the whole security system from KIPP Academy so that the footage from multiple cameras could be downloaded and viewed as part of the investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Det. Moran confirmed that the next day, July 31, Mr. Hall's Ford Expedition was recovered on the 2800 block of Roslyn Avenue, and towed to the crime lab where it was processed as part of the crime scene. Crime lab technicians then collected DNA samples from the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    C. The Conspiracy\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Detailing his investigation into the homicide, Det. Moran recounted that \"[b]ecause Mr. Hall had a badge and the cuffs and he had Muscles written on his shoes, we knew there was Muscles [Bail Bonds] on Bel Air Road.\" This led the detective to contact Ms. Seals who, according to Det. Moran, was hysterical when he interviewed her. She told him that Mr.\n   Hall received a voicemail and that an individual known as \"Credit Card Mike, set this insurance up for his business because Ralph Hall needed his own insurance to start his business with the bail bonds. And that he wanted to meet this guy at 7:30.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In his second interview with Ms. Seals, Det. Moran was informed that Credit Card Mike-now identified as Michael Hayes-believed that Mr. Hall set him up to be robbed earlier in 2008. Det. Moran then interviewed Michael Hayes, who had recently been arrested on a handgun violation. Det. Moran testified that Hayes told him that Derrick Toomer was involved in the murder. Hayes also identified one of the vehicles connected to the murder; and provided police with an address, \"806 Tipton,\" and a hand drawn map to where they\n   could find the vehicle. Upon investigating the address, Det. Moran located and photographed a vehicle matching the vehicle in the security footage recovered from KIPP Academy, and that vehicle was found to be registered under the name \"Darrell Toomer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Det. Moran also testified that, on November 12, 2008, he interviewed James Nelson, who helped him narrow the suspects to Appellant and Derrick Toomer. Nelson identified both Appellant and Derrick Toomer in photographic arrays shown to him by Det. Moran.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On March 21 and 24, the State's principal witness, James Nelson, appeared before the jury in a prison uniform. Nelson testified that he had been incarcerated twice between the time Mr. Hall was killed and Appellant's trial and that he was currently serving a thirteen-year sentence. Nelson testified that Derrick Toomer and Appellant typically drove a burgundy red Crown Victoria. Nelson also testified that he had a conversation with both Derrick Toomer and Appellant in which Appellant admitted to killing Mr. Hall. The following exchange took place:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [THE STATE]: What did [Appellant] tell you about [Mr. Hall]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [NELSON]: That he got robbed and that Mike paid [Derrick Toomer] for him to be killed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [THE STATE]: So [Appellant] told you that Mike paid [Derrick Toomer] to have [Mr. Hall] killed?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   [NELSON]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [THE STATE]: What else did he tell you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [NELSON]: That he killed him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [THE STATE]: Who killed [Mr. Hall]?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [NELSON]: [Appellant].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [THE STATE]: Did he tell you how?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   [NELSON]: He shot him in the truck.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [THE STATE]: And did he tell you with what weapon?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   [NELSON]: A .38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [THE STATE]: Are you familiar with any .38's?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   [NELSON]: Yeah.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   [THE STATE]: He tell you about that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   [NELSON]: We all used to use it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [THE STATE]: Can you describe the .38 you used?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   [NELSON]: Revolver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   [THE STATE]: What color was it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [NELSON]: Black.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   [THE STATE]: And any other color on that gun?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   [NELSON]: The handle's brown.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Nelson testified that he and Appellant discussed Mr. Hall's murder \"probably eight, nine times[,]\" and that Appellant told him that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   Derrick rode him up there to meet [Mr. Hall] and [Appellant] got out the car and walked over to [Mr. Hall's] car-truck and, you know.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   ... [Appellant] said when he got up there he got out the car, talked to Derrick for a minute. Walked over to [Mr. Hall's] car and talked to him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [Appellant] said he pulled out the gun and shot him.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-64\">\n   [Appellant] said he pulled [Mr. Hall] out the car and drove off in the car.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally, the State introduced a photographic array in which Nelson had identified Derrick Toomer. Nelson read his handwritten statement, made at the time of the photographic array, in open court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   The person in the picture is Derrick Toomer. Face, [Appellant], told me that it was easy to kill [Mr. Hall]. When [Appellant] got out the driver's seat of the car Derrick Toomer asked [Appellant] was he sure he could handle the\n   shooting. [Appellant] replied, it's nothing. [Appellant] met [Mr. Hall] and talked to him for a minute and pulled out a .38 and shot him and took his money and necklace and left.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   They went back to Nicole's house, [Derrick Toomer's] girlfriend, and split the money up. That's when [Derrick Toomer] called me and we met up, he told me the whole story and that he was waiting for Mike to come over to give him the money for killing [Mr. Hall].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   The next day [Derrick Toomer] told me that he went back over to Greenspring [ ] to see if [Mr. Hall's] body was still there and it was. [Appellant] then bragged that he should have shot [Mr. Hall] in the head for being cruddy for setting Mike to get robbed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Nelson also testified that he met with officers investigating Mr. Hall's murder prior to entering a plea agreement in his own case. Nelson denied that he was either threatened or promised anything in exchange for his testimony. The State did not disclose that Nelson was also a witness in an unrelated murder trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Admission of the .38 Caliber Handgun\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   On March 21, 2014, the State called Kelly Toomer-codefendant Derrick Toomer's son. Kelly Toomer identified Appellant\n   in the courtroom and testified that he, Appellant, Derrick Toomer, and James Nelson spent time together in 2008.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   On direct examination, Kelly Toomer testified that, in 2008, he had a \"[f]ew different guns,\" but he could not recall the calibers of the weapons. However, he also testified to the events surrounding his arrest on August 31, 2008. Kelly Toomer was arrested while seated in the front passenger seat of a Crown Victoria, from which two handguns were recovered by the police. When the State presented him with a revolver, marked as State's Exhibit 20, the following exchange occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   [THE STATE]: Mr. Toomer, can you tell the members of the jury what kind of gun this is, if you're able to tell?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   [KELLY TOOMER]: My revolver, .38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   [THE STATE]: You don't remember this being one of the two guns that was in the Crown Vic glove compartment?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   [KELLY TOOMER]: No, I had [a] .38. I don't know if that was the gun though.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   To assist Kelly Toomer's recollection, the State introduced a portion of a document that Kelly Toomer had identified as his signed plea agreement entered into following his arrest on August 31, 2008. The following portion of the plea agreement was read before the jury:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   On August 31, 2008 Kelly and Derrick Toomer were together with James Nelson and [Appellant]. Derrick Toomer handed [Kelly Toomer] a .38 revolver. Both James Nelson and [Appellant] observed this transaction between father and son.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   [Kelly Toomer] and [Appellant] then left together in a red Crown Victoria. At approximately 1:30 in the afternoon, [Appellant], who was driving the Crown Victoria, became thirsty and pulled over in the 2300 Block of Biddle Street.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   He left the car running with Kelly Toomer in the front seat while he went to find something to drink.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   At the same time officers were patrolling in the block when an unknown male approached the officer with information that two African-Americans had just robbed someone and that they were both armed with handguns.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   Officer[s] McCullough and Jones approached the car to further investigate the allegation. They observed [Appellant] exit the vehicle but did not approach until their backup arrive[d].\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   They approach[ed] the vehicle and s[aw] [Kelly Toomer] in the front seat. The officers also receive[d] information that the car [wa]s not register[ed]. The officers order[ed] a tow truck and conduct[ed] an inventory search pursuant to policy, discovering the .38 handgun in the glove box. All events took place in Baltimore City, Maryland.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Thereafter, the circuit court resolved to admit into evidence the portion of the plea agreement that had been read before the jury, along with the caption on the cover page.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Following Kelly Toomer's testimony, the State called Officer Reginald Jones. Officer Jones testified that he conducted the August 31 search of the Crown Victoria and recovered the .38 revolver from the vehicle. Upon identification by Officer Jones, the \"black, snub nose .38 with a brown wooden handle[,]\" was admitted into evidence as State's Exhibit 20 without objection from Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    E. DNA Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   On March 24, 2014, Baltimore City Crime Lab technician Jennifer Ingbretson testified that she compared DNA swabs from both Appellant and Derrick Toomer to DNA swabs collected from the vehicle in which Mr. Hall was killed and\n   from Mr. Hall's clothing. Her analysis identified Appellant as a contributor to a DNA sample collected from the steering wheel. Ms. Ingbretson also testified that Appellant could not be excluded as a contributor to samples taken from \"the pockets and adjacent areas of [Mr. Hall's] jeans.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   That same day, Baltimore City Firearms Examiner, Christopher Faber, testified that he was asked to compare the .38 revolver found in the burgundy Crown Victoria to the two lead bullets recovered from Mr. Hall's body. Mr. Faber testified that both bullets were of the .38/.357 caliber class and, although he was unable to determine whether the bullets were fired from the same gun, that the two \"bear the same class characteristics.\" Similarly, Mr. Faber was unable to determine definitively whether the two bullets were fired with the .38 revolver in this case. However, he indicated that the rifling in the revolver barrel had \"6 lands and grooves on a left hand twist\" and that the dimensions between the lands and grooves \"were almost exactly the same as [the markings on] the bullets.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Security Footage\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Det. Moran narrated as the security footage from the KIPP Academy parking lot was played for the jury. He described the relevant portion of the security footage, beginning at approximately 8:30 p.m. on July 29, 2013 when \"a dark color four door vehicle pulls up, [and] backs into a spot in the same parking lot where Mr. Hall [wa]s found.\" His narration highlighted the moment when Mr. Hall's Ford Expedition pulled into the parking lot and a person from the other vehicle sat in the vehicle with Mr. Hall. After a few minutes, passed Det. Moran instructed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   If you could just pay attention to the door of the driver's side vehicle. The body falls out. The door opens up and the body falls out of the vehicle.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The individual walks around the back of the vehicle. See the lights on the bottom here?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   The individual is standing next to the body. Still standing. The individual now bends over.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   Still bent over. Now kneels down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   The individual stands up. The door opens. See the lights? He gets in. The door shuts. The brake lights come on. He backs up. He leaves the parking lot. Mr. Hall is still on the ground.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    G. Codefendant's Refusal to Testify\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   On March 25, 2014, the State sought to call codefendant Derrick Toomer as a witness. Toomer had already been convicted of Hall's murder, and his case was on appeal. Toomer's counsel, Celia A. Davis, would later explain during a post-trial motions hearing that on the fourth day of trial, March 24, 2014, \"after 5:00 p.m. [she] received a phone call from [the prosecutor] indicating that he wanted to speak to Mr. Toomer, [her] client, about his testimony in [Appellant's] murder case.\" Ms. Davis testified that she then spoke with her client via video conference and arranged to speak to him again the following day at the courthouse. After speaking with Toomer, Ms. Davis met with the prosecutor. Regarding their conversation, Ms. Davis testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   I told [the prosecutor] that my client would not testify. That he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. That [Toomer] was not interested in signing the immunity agreement, and he was well aware that he could be held in contempt of court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Notwithstanding that exchange, at trial the State went ahead and called Derrick Toomer as a witness. The following occurred:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   [THE STATE]: Your Honor, I apologize for approaching. Before I announced the witness in the presence of a jury, I just wanted to see if Mr. Toomer is here and his attorney\n   and give them one last chance to reflect on the decision not to-\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   THE COURT: Do you want a break?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   [THE STATE]: I think it is probably helpful just in light of the precariousness of this witness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   THE COURT: All right. All right. We'll get him in and see if there are any preliminaries we have to do before the jury comes down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   [THE STATE]: Thank you, Your Honor.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (At 10:39:59 a.m., counsel returned to trial tables and the following occurred in open court:)\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   THE COURT: Ladies and gentlemen, our next witness will take a moment to get set up, so why don't [I] give you a slight break.

Nevertheless, the State was prepared to grant Toomer use and derivative use immunity in order to compel his testimony. Toomer's counsel averred that Toomer could not be compelled to testify because he had a pending appeal and his testimony could be used against him in a federal prosecution. The Court allowed the State to ask a few questions of Toomer-outside the presence of the jury-to \"explor[e] whether there are any areas about which Mr. Toomer would be willing to talk.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Toomer, however, continued to refuse to answer any questions.

Something that was unnecessary. I don't believe prejudicial, but we could have accomplished this before the jury even came down.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   [THE STATE]: That was my aim, but I didn't appreciate that this was how it was going to unfold. So, I would apologize to the Court. I think that the State does not need to ask Mr. Toomer any questions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-177\">\n   THE COURT: Very well.

The State\n   pointed to Kelly Toomer's testimony establishing that he and Appellant were both in the vehicle where the .38 revolver was found; ballistics evidence indicating that the bullets recovered from Mr. Hall's body were fired from a .38 revolver; and Nelson's description of the .38 revolver that he testified Appellant used in the murder. The State argued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   Before the ballistics confirmed that the bullet[s] that killed [Mr. Hall] were fired from a weapon with a six left twist, James Nelson told you it was this .38 caliber revolver that Kelly Toomer was arrested with which happens to be a Colt revolver that an expert told you is one of the few weapons that has a six left twist.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   Shortly thereafter, the jury found Appellant guilty on all counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   <strong>\n    H. Motion for a New Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   On April 1, 2014, Appellant filed a motion for a new trial. During two separate hearings held on April 23 and May 2, Appellant raised four arguments to support his motion: (1) that the State, in its closing rebuttal, raised facts not in evidence when it suggested that DNA evidence was found inside (rather than near) the victim's pants pockets;\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) that the State improperly displayed a gun that had not been admitted into evidence during closing argument; (3) that the State improperly placed Derrick Toomer on the stand when it knew that he would assert his Fifth Amendment privilege and refuse to testify; and (4) that the State violated Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(B) and the principles of\n   <em>\n    Brady v. Maryland,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    373 U.S. 83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    83 S.Ct. 1194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11716714\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/373/83/\">\n    10 L.Ed.2d 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1963) by not disclosing that James Nelson was a State's witness in another unrelated murder case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   During the May 2, 2014 hearing, (as we already discussed) Derrick Toomer's attorney affirmed that she had advised the State that Toomer would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege prior to his testimony. Then, in support of his\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation charge, Appellant offered two exhibits, obtained as supplemental discovery in unrelated cases. Appellant maintained that one disclosure revealed that Nelson was a witness in another homicide case and the other disclosure named \"James Mitchell\"-who Appellant believed was actually Nelson-as a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-187\">\n   The State rebutted Appellant's charge by calling Bethany Durand, the primary prosecutor in the other case in which Nelson was named as a witness. Ms. Durand testified that Nelson was given no promises, agreements or assurances in exchange for his testimony. Ms. Durand also testified that \"James Mitchell\" was indeed a separate person and that she was unaware of any other pending prosecutions in which Nelson was a witness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-188\">\n   The circuit court denied the motion for a new trial. In its oral ruling on May 2, 2014, the circuit court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-189\">\n   As to ... the admission of the gun and the demonstration of the gun to the jury, guns have taken on a different significance now. There's no question about that, but when an object is entered into evidence, it is fair game for it to be used as a prop in one's presentation to the jury and argument.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-190\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-191\">\n   As to the involvement of Derrick Toomer in the trial, considering\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift,\n   </em>\n   and the analysis that I am to make, a few observations. Number one, his appearance here was brief. I will concede it was dramatic, but I do not think all things considered, it was prejudicial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-192\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-193\">\n   Now, as to the specific areas of concern. Was there anything about his presentation in the court that would have caused the jury to conclude, other than the other evidence that was presented, focusing on his presentation here, that he was particularly involved in the case or that [Appellant] was particularly involved in the case[?] We never got to that level. We got past him reluctantly even telling us who he was to the point of saying I'm not saying anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-194\">\n   Did the prosecution anticipate the assertion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-195\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-196\">\n   Did they know he was going to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege particularly in the modern circumstance where immunity can be granted and the Court can then hold in contempt and accumulate some sentences against a person who refused to cooperate who's been given immunity[?] I don't know that they could absolutely anticipate that the power of my personality and the power of my office would not be able to at least encourage Mr. Toomer to participate here.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-197\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-198\">\n   As soon as Mr. Toomer's reluctance was demonstrated, I sent the jury out, and then we interviewed Mr. Toomer to\n   develop, I assume, our joint group impression that there was nothing that could be done under any circumstances that would persuade Mr. Toomer to actually testify in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-199\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-200\">\n   But counsel were given the full opportunity to address the jury and to make argument to them about any conclusions they should draw from this circumstance. Under the circumstances, I do not find that brief event in the course of a long trial to be of such significance as to cause the granting of a new trial.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-201\">\n   Now, that brings us to the issue today. The new issue as to whether or not there was a violation of Maryland Rule 4-263(d)(6)(B) sufficient to cause the grant of a new trial. I am not satisfied that exists. I am not satisfied that upon consideration of the proffer of the State ... plus the testimony of Ms. Durand, I do not believe there is any evidence whatsoever to suggest that there are any type of promises, inducements or benefits which have been presented to Mr. Nelson.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   That same day, the circuit court sentenced Appellant to life in prison for the murder of Mr. Hall; 20 years for use of a handgun in a crime of violence (to run consecutive to the life sentence); five years without the possibility of parole for possession of a regulated firearm (also consecutive); and a concurrent sentence of life in prison for conspiracy to murder Mr. Hall. Appellant filed a timely notice of appeal on May 5, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   Additional facts will be introduced as required in the following discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-204\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-205\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   The central issue in this case is whether Appellant was denied his right to a fair trial when the State called his separately-tried-and-convicted codefendant, Derrick Toomer,\n   before the jury with knowledge that Toomer would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege. Before this Court, Appellant points out that by the time Toomer was called to testify, \"the jury had heard much about [Toomer's] alleged involvement in the murder,\" and that \"while Toomer's testimony in front of the jury was short, the jury was informed that he was incarcerated ... [his case] was pending appeal, and watched him invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege just as the\n   prosecutor asked him if he had been convicted of murder.\" Appellant maintains that there was \"no confusion\" about whether Toomer would invoke the privilege. He asserts that \" [t]he prosecution's act of calling Derrick Toomer to the stand with full knowledge that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege was an attempt to add critical weight to [the State's] case ... and constituted flagrant misconduct.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   The State advances the threshold argument that Appellant failed to object to Toomer's testimony at the time it was offered. To the extent that Appellant's claim of error may be preserved, however, the State underscores that the relevant case law \"does not stand for the proposition that a prosecutor may never call a witness who declines to answer questions[.]\" The State concedes that \"Toomer's testimony was 'dramatic,' \" but maintains that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the testimony was not harmful to Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift, supra,\n   </em>\n   does not explicitly set out a standard of review for conducting the unique examination under its enumerated factors. We conclude, upon review of\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   and its progeny, that although we will not hesitate to overturn a circuit court decision resting on erroneous legal conclusions, we accord deference to the court's weighing and balancing of the\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Adkins v. State,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals related that the \"\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factors serve [only] as guidelines to assess the overall circumstances of the invocation of the privilege.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037305\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/1/#p13\">\n    316 Md. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 13,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037305\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/1/#p13\">\n    557 A.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). Where a trial court must\n   determine whether evidence that was presented or an event that occurred during trial might unfairly prejudice the defendant, that finding is ordinarily accorded deference because the trial judge is best situated to evaluate the degree of harm to the defendant in the proceeding. For example, in\n   <em>\n    State v. Faulkner,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals observed that, \"[t]he necessity for and probative value of the 'other crimes' evidence is to be carefully weighed against any undue prejudice likely to result from its admission. This segment of the analysis implicates the exercise of the trial court's discretion.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033021\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/630/#p635\">\n    314 Md. 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 635,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2033021\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/314/630/#p635\">\n    552 A.2d 896\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (internal citations omitted).

Toomer invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege just as the prosecutor said \"Mr. Toomer, you were originally charged in the murder....\" The record demonstrates that Mr. Toomer appeared to have been \"closely implicated in the defendant's alleged criminal activities\" so that his invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege after he was put on the stand and asked whether he was originally charged in a murder weighs heavily against the State under the first\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Adkins,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037305\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/1/#p13\">\n    316 Md. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2037305\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/316/1/#p13\">\n    557 A.2d 203\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Interestingly, in\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift,\n   </em>\n   the Court of Appeals determined that the appellant did not preserve for appellate review the question of whether he was prejudiced by the State's decision to call codefendants to the stand, knowing they would refuse to testify.\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1932054\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/237/305/#p309\">\n    237 Md. at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    206 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Then, after the State indicated that it was prepared to compel Toomer to testify in front of the jury, Appellant's counsel objected a second time. Although counsel did not state the specific reason for his objection at that time, we are mindful of the broader context-in which the State, defense counsel, and counsel for Toomer had been contesting\n   whether it was proper to call Toomer before the jury after he had stated his intention to invoke the Fifth Amendment privilege. Indeed, addressing this issue at the hearing on Appellant's motion for a new trial, the circuit court stated, \"I'm satisfied that the defense put us on notice that the defense didn't want this show to take place.\" Likewise, we conclude that the issue was raised in the trial court sufficiently to bring it on appeal before this Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md. Rule 8-131(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   Notwithstanding our conclusion that the issue is properly before this Court, we note that the fourth factor, as articulated in\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift,\n   </em>\n   requires that Appellant make a \"timely objection\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   t[ake] exception to the prosecutor's misconduct.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1932054\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/237/305/#p309\">\n    237 Md. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    206 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). On March 25,\n   <em>\n    counsel for Mr. Toomer\n   </em>\n   certainly interjected and argued to preserve Toomer's right not to be required to present evidence against himself. Appellant's counsel, on the other hand, following his general objection after Toomer invoked that privilege, did not participate in the discussion regarding Toomer's testimony or the ability of the court to compel Toomer to testify. Thus, it cannot be said that Appellant made the circuit court aware of any concerns regarding alleged prosecutor misconduct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   The Court in\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   found that the fourth factor was not satisfied because the appellant failed to ask that a curative instruction be given and failed to move for a mistrial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    at 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    206 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Likewise, in the present case Appellant never requested any curative instruction or action, nor did he move for a mistrial. After Toomer was excused, Appellant made no arguments of error or requests for relief of any kind, and the State simply moved on to the next witness. Although Appellant's general objection was sufficient to place the broader issue before this Court, this\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factor is not satisfied and weighs against reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   <strong>\n    e.

Here, as noted above, Appellant never requested any type of curative instruction, action, or admonition from the circuit court. Indeed, the first time Appellant raised the contention that the State endangered his right to a fair trial by calling Toomer was in the hearing on Appellant's motion for a new trial on April 23, 2014-nearly a month after Appellant's trial and conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Notwithstanding Appellant's failure to apprise the trial court of his concerns about Toomer's reliance on the Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury, the court was quick to act on its own initiative. The circuit court recounted what occurred at trial during its May 2 oral ruling:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-257\">\n   As soon as Mr. Toomer's reluctance was demonstrated, I sent the jury out, and then we interviewed Mr. Toomer to develop, I assume, our joint group impression that there was nothing that could be done under any circumstances that would persuade Mr. Toomer to actually testify in this case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-258\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-259\">\n   But counsel were given the full opportunity to address the jury and to make argument to them about any conclusions they should draw from this circumstance.

Even when the court declined to compel Toomer to\n   testify and was preparing to dismiss Toomer, the State persisted:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-262\">\n   [THE STATE]: Court's indulgence, Your Honor.

Notably, the State's principal witness testified that Appellant admitted his role in Mr. Hall's murder and had discussed it with him \"eight or nine times.\" Appellant was also linked to the .38 revolver through the testimony of three separate witnesses, including a police officer who recovered the weapon from a vehicle driven by Appellant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   Expert testimony presented by the State revealed that the bullets recovered from Mr. Hall's body were consistent with having been fired by the same caliber, make, and model of weapon as that recovered from the vehicle. Additionally, DNA evidence placed Appellant in Mr. Hall's Ford Expedition, and Appellant could not be excluded as a contributor to DNA found on Mr. Hall's body. Security footage played for the jury also showed the murder being committed by a man who arrived at the scene in a vehicle that witness testimony\n   connected to Appellant and Toomer. Moreover, as the State points out, although Toomer's brief testimony was \"dramatic,\" \"[i]t does not ... follow that the testimony was harmful to [Appellant].\" The jury might reasonably have drawn an inference contrary to the State's theory of the case-inferring, for example, that Toomer, not Appellant, was the shooter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Because the circuit court in this case acted swiftly to halt questioning and excuse the jury, we agree that the \"brief event in the course of a long trial\"-in which a great deal of evidence was presented to support conviction-was not of such significance to prejudice the proceedings and warrant a new trial. Balancing all of the\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that the actions of the prosecutor in the case before us-although not a model to follow-were not unduly prejudicial, nor were they calculated solely to gain the benefit of \"the effect of the claim of privilege on the jury.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1932054\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/237/305/#p309\">\n    237 Md. at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=206%20A.2d%20250\">\n    206 A.2d 250\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Specifically, Appellant argues that \"the State failed to disclose the fact that Nelson was a State's witness against at least two other murder defendants whose cases (unrelated to appellant's) were pending at the time of his testimony.\" Appellant maintains that disclosure of this information was required pursuant to Md.

Appellant urges that the failure to disclose this \"impeachment evidence\" deprived Appellant of his Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness and his right to a fair trial.

In light of the circuit court's quick action, the record reflects that Appellant was not inclined to (and did not) request any further relief during the course of the trial. Indeed, Appellant failed to present any specific argument regarding the impropriety of calling Toomer as a witness or allege any prejudice created thereby prior to his post-verdict motion for a new trial. Weighing the\n   <em>\n    Vandegrift\n   </em>\n   factors in context, we agree with the circuit court that this \"brief event in the course of a long trial\" did not prejudice the Appellant and does not warrant a new trial. Moreover, we perceive no error in the circuit court's denial of Appellant's motion for a new trial and conclude that Appellant was not denied his right to a fair trial.
