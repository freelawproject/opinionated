For the reasons explained below, we hold that the definition of a credit services business\n   does not contain a broad direct payment requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   A person or entity engaged in providing credit services business is subject to regulation under Maryland law. Under CL \u00a7 14-1901(e),\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) \"Credit services business\" means any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (i) Improving a consumer's credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (ii) Obtaining an extension of credit\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   for a consumer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (2) \"Credit services business\" includes a person who sells or attempts to sell written materials containing information that the person represents will enable a consumer to establish a new credit file or record.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Under CL and FI, a credit services business must comply with various requirements imposed by statute. Most relevant to this case is the requirement that a credit services business is prohibited from assisting \"a consumer to obtain an extension of credit at a rate of interest which, except for federal preemption of State law\" would exceed the maximum annual percentage rates under Maryland Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   CL \u00a7 14-1902(9).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   CL \u00a7 12-102. Although federal law\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   allows federally\n   insured banks to charge out-of-state consumers the same interest rate permitted by the bank's home state, regardless of the interest rate caps imposed by the law of the consumer's resident state, \"a credit services business may not, under the MCSBA, assist a consumer in obtaining a loan, from any in-state or out-of-state bank, at an interest rate prohibited by Maryland law.\"\n   <em>\n    Maryland Comm'r of Fin. Regulation v. CashCall, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    225 Md.App. 313\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 325,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    124 A.3d 670\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 677 (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    CashCall's Business Activities\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   CashCall marketed high-interest loans to consumers through television and internet advertisements. The advertisements contained information regarding CashCall's website and telephone number. CashCall offered loans to consumers at three different interest rates: 59%, 89%, or 96%.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   These interest rates greatly exceeded the interest rates permitted by Maryland law, which caps the interest rate at 33% on all loans below $6,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Between January 2006 and December 2010, through CashCall, Maryland consumers received 5,651 loans in amounts less than $6,000 with interest rates greater than 33%.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Maryland consumers who visited the CashCall website or called CashCall directly were directed to fill out an online loan application though CashCall's website. CashCall then forwarded the completed application to a federally insured out-of-state bank that is exempt from Maryland's usury laws. Once a bank approved a loan application, the bank would place, in the consumer's bank account, the requested loan amount less a $75 fee designated as an \"origination fee.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following example is illustrative of a typical transaction: In the case of a $2,600 approved loan, the consumer receives $2,525, which is the principal amount owed on the loan less the $75 origination fee. The consumer is required to pay the holder of the loan\n   $2,600, plus interest. In other words, \"the consumer ultimately pa[ys] the origination fee as he or she repa[ys] the loan in monthly installments to whomever [holds] the loan.\"\n   <em>\n    CashCall, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    225 Md.App. at 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    124 A.3d at 673\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Specifically, CashCall had entered into partnerships with First Bank &amp; Trust, a South Dakota-chartered bank and First Bank of Delaware, a Delaware-chartered bank. Pursuant to contracts between CashCall and each bank, CashCall was required to purchase a loan three days after\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the loan was originated and the funds dispersed to the consumer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   CashCall paid the bank the full value of the loan, i.e., the $2,600 from the example\n   above, plus the three days of interest that had accrued on the loan. The banks also paid CashCall a \"royalty\" fee of $5 to $72.22 per loan depending on the amount of the loan and the bank that disbursed the funds. Upon CashCall's purchase of the loan, all of the bank's rights and interests in the loan were assigned, without recourse, to CashCall. This gave CashCall the right to enforce the terms provided in the loan documents, including the right to collect payments of the principal, interest and other fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, if the bank mistakenly received a payment from a consumer on a\n   loan CashCall purchased, the bank was required to hold the payment \"in trust\" and forward the payment to CashCall no later than the following business day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Given the nature of the partnership between CashCall and the banks, Maryland consumers who obtained loans through CashCall dealt primarily with CashCall. A consumer's contact with the bank was limited to a single transaction: the bank's deposit of money into the consumer's bank account. Maryland consumers communicated with CashCall, and made all loan payments whether it be for principal, interest, or any other fees directly to CashCall.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Enforcement Action\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Between 2007 and 2011, eighteen Maryland residents filed complaints with the Commissioner. Based on these complaints, the Commissioner initiated an investigation into the business practices of CashCall and Reddam.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   On June 23, 2009, in a \"Summary Order to Cease and Desist,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   the\n   Commissioner found that\n   \"[Petitioners] engaged in illegal and predatory business activities which directly resulted in Maryland consumers obtaining usurious loans from national banks\" in violation of the MCSBA. In response, on July 7, 2009, Petitioners requested a hearing in the Office of Administrative Hearings (\"OAH\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On September 14, 2010, administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") Nancy E. Paige held a hearing on the Summary Order. In ALJ Paige's December 2, 2010 \"Proposed Decision,\" she concluded that Petitioners violated the MCSBA and the licensing provisions of the Maryland Consumer Loan Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Characterizing each of the 5,651 loans Petitioners offered to a Maryland consumer as a first offense, ALJ Paige proposed a penalty of $1,000 for each loan, for a total civil penalty of $5,651,000. ALJ Paige further recommended that the Commissioner \"[e]nter a final Order that [Petitioners] cease and desist from engaging in the 'credit services business[ ]' \" and ordered CashCall to pay the full civil penalty of $5,651,000. Petitioners filed exceptions to the ALJ Paige's \"Proposed Order\" on January 20, 2011. The parties agreed to stay the matter pending the outcome of a case for which we had granted\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   on October 24, 2011,\n   <em>\n    Gomez v.

In his Final Order, Commissioner Kaufman explained that the representative promissory note and disclosure statement ALJ Paige admitted into evidence demonstrates how consumers made payments directly to CashCall:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [Petitioners'] Exhibit # 1 (admitted in the OAH hearing) is the First Bank &amp; Trust Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement, dated as of December 12, 2006 (the \"Promissory Note\") for a $2,600 consumer loan. The \"financed\" amount of the loan is shown as $2,525.00. This is the amount received by the consumer. A \"Prepaid Finance Charge/Origination Fee\" is listed at $75.00. The $75.00 fee is rolled into the principal amount of the loan. As a result, the total amount of principal due from the consumer is $2,600.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   In order to understand the significance of the $75 fee, one must turn back to the Sealed Agreements [contracts between CashCall and the bank].... [W]hen CashCall purchased a loan, CashCall paid for the outstanding balance due, including all principal, interest origination fees, and other charges or sums owed by the borrower. In other words, CashCall paid $2,600 for the loan. Because the loan was transferred from the bank to CashCall three days later, the consumer did not make a single payment to the bank.... The consumer, however, directly paid CashCall, not the bank,\n   because CashCall collected on the loan, which included the $75.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   (footnote omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Moreover, Commissioner Kaufman rejected Petitioner's argument that\n   <em>\n    Gomez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    427 Md. at 128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    46 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   443 applied to the Petitioners' case. He distinguished\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   factually:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Gomez,\n   </em>\n   the fees to Jackson Hewitt for\n   <em>\n    tax preparation\n   </em>\n   were rolled into the principal amount of the loan\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the lending bank, not Jackson Hewitt, collected on the loan. The lending bank then paid Jackson Hewitt, resulting in no direct payment by the consumer to Jackson Hewitt. Here, the consumer paid CashCall for the principal, interest, and\n   <em>\n    fees\n   </em>\n   on the loan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (emphasis in original). Commissioner Kaufman also conducted an analysis of\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   and concluded that \"\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   applies to tax preparers who were marketing refund anticipation loans in the context of tax preparation services.\" He explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   One of the concerns of the Court of Appeals was that allowing indirect payment to trigger the application the MCSBA in the context of refund anticipation loans could lead to \"the absurd results in applying the statute to tremendous numbers of retailers throughout Maryland who have never registered under the [M]CSBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Gomez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    427 Md. at 138\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    46 A.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. Specifically, the Court was concerned that \"department stores, electronic retailers, big box retailers, bookstores, gas stations[, and] clothing retailers\" would be subject to the MCSBA when assisting consumers in applying for credit offered by third-party banks.\n   <em>\n    Gomez,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    427 Md. at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   [\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3710066\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/427/128/\">\n    46 A.3d 443\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]. The Court was clearly focused on the fact that the extension of credit was related to the services of the facilitator of the loan,\n   <em>\n    but\n   </em>\n   the primary commercial and contractual relationship between Ms. Gomez and Jackson Hewitt was related to tax preparation, not obtaining an extension of credit. The extension of credit was merely collateral to Jackson Hewitt's primary service of preparing tax returns. On the other hand, CashCall's solicitation, website applications, support services and assistance to consumers, and processing all zeroed in on obtaining a loan for a consumer. The record in this matter contains no evidence that CashCall provided any other services to the consumers. Application of the MCSBA to CashCall in this context creates no risk that department\n   stores, retailers, or gas stations could be swept within the scope of the MCSBA.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   (alterations and emphasis in original). Commissioner Kaufman also emphasized this Court's detailed analysis of the legislative history of the MCSBA. After recounting the legislative history of the MCSBA, as discussed in\n   <em>\n    Gomez,\n   </em>\n   he concluded that \"a 'marketer' of loans for out-of state banks who receives an indirect payment from a consumer for providing services to facilitate a high-interest, small-dollar consumer loan is subject to the MCSBA and the Commissioner's jurisdiction to enforce the MCSBA.\" Thus, he ordered that Petitioners \"cease and desist from engaging in the 'credit services business [ ]' \" and pay to the Commissioner \"a civil penalty of $5,651,000.00 within 30 days.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On December 7, 2012, CashCall filed a timely petition for judicial review of the Final Order and a motion to stay the Final Order in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City. Reddam did not file a petition for judicial review at that time. On April 11, 2013, however, CashCall and Reddam filed an amended petition for judicial review solely for the purpose of adding Reddam as a petitioner. The Circuit Court dismissed the amended petition for judicial review as untimely, eliminating Reddam as a party to the judicial review proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Despite noting that CashCall may be \"a predatory entity preying on the consumers of Maryland and has developed a scheme to evade the usory [sic] laws of Maryland,\" the Circuit Court reversed the Final Order on July 3, 2013. In its \"Memorandum and Order,\" it explained that the\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   decision requires a direct payment between a business and a consumer under the MCSBA. Therefore, it concluded that CashCall was not a \"credit services business\" under the MCSBA. The Circuit Court further issued a \"\n   <em>\n    Nun Pro Tunc\n   </em>\n   Order\" to clarify that its reversal of the Final Order applied only to CashCall and not Reddam because Reddam was not a party to the judicial review proceeding. As a result, the Final Order against Reddam was intact and enforceable against him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   On September 18, 2013, the Commissioner filed a Notice of\n   Appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The intermediate appellate court conducted a comprehensive review of this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   and of the MCSBA, including its legislative history.

Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). The loans CashCall \"marketed\" meet this definition. Once again, we refer to the example of a typical transaction between\n   CashCall and a Maryland consumer. CashCall offered unsecured loans of varying amounts. Where the consumer obtained a $2,600 loan, the stated interest rate was 99.24%. The short-term\n   nature of the loan is clear because the expected date the consumer would receive funding was December 13, 2006-the first payment was due on January 01, 2007, less than a month after the consumer received the loan. Commissioner Kaufman recognized the same and discussed the limits of\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   in the Final Order:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   The Court in [\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   ] did not consider the circumstances in which the consumer engages in a single commercial transaction with the credit services business.... CashCall helped consumers obtain loans from out-of-state banks at rates that would otherwise be usurious under Maryland law ... To make the applicability of the MCSBA contingent on whether a consumer has made a \"direct\" payment to CashCall would lead to absurd results.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Accordingly, it is appropriate to limit the \"direct payment\" requirement set forth in\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   to \" 'mainstream' businesses that, like Jackson Hewitt, offer loan arrangement services as an ancillary service, separate and distinct from the principal services they provide to Maryland consumers.\"\n   <em>\n    CashCall, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    225 Md.App. at 332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    124 A.3d at 681\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <strong>\n    CashCall engaged in a \"credit services business\n   </strong>\n   \"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   A \"credit services business\" is\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   any person who, with respect to the extension of credit by others, sells, provides, or performs, or represents that such person can or will sell, provide, or perform, any of the following services in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   (i) Improving a consumer's credit record, history, or rating or establishing a new credit file or record;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   (ii) Obtaining an extension of credit for a consumer; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   (iii) Providing advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   CL \u00a7 14-1901(e)(1).

According to CashCall, the phrase \"in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration\" requires that the consumer make a direct payment to the person or company providing \"advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... obtaining an extension of credit.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As discussed above, the \"direct payment\" requirement discussed in\n   <em>\n    Gomez\n   </em>\n   is limited to the factual boundaries of that case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   The facts in the record establish that CashCall \"provid[ed] advice or assistance to a consumer with regard to ... obtaining an extension of credit.\" CL \u00a7 14-1901(e). CashCall marketed loans through television and internet advertisements, directed consumers to fill out loan applications through CashCall's website and forwarded completed loan applications to various out-of-state banks. These actions comprised the entirety of CashCall's business model and resulted in Maryland consumers obtaining short-term loans with interest rates that greatly exceeded those permissible under Maryland law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To be a \"credit services business\" the services \"with respect to the extension of credit by others\" must be provided \"in return for the payment of money or other\n   valuable consideration.\" CL \u00a7 14-1901(e). As we noted previously, \"in return\" means \"in reciprocation, compensation, or repayment.\" Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1066 (11th ed. 2003). As the Commissioner contends, \"CashCall did not perform these loan arrangement services in Maryland for free; it was amply compensated for its loan operation.\" In exchange for CashCall's role in assisting consumers to obtain the aforementioned loans, CashCall received, through contracts with the banks, the exclusive right to collect all payments of principal, interest and fees, including the origination fee. This arrangement, in essence, rendered CashCall the\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   lender. This is evident when we look at the fact that CashCall received payment from the consumer for the \"origination fee.\" An\n   \" origination fee\" is \"[a] fee charged by a lender for preparing and processing the loan.\" Black's Law Dictionary 732 (Bryan A. Garner ed., 10th ed. 2014). Although the lending bank originally charged the origination fee, \"[t]he bank never received payment of that fee from the consumer but, as noted, CashCall did.\"\n   <em>\n    CashCall, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    225 Md.App. at 334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4360571\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md-app/225/313/#p325\">\n    124 A.3d at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Furthermore, CashCall's raison d'etre was to profit by purportedly providing advice and assistance to consumers in obtaining loans from the banks it had partnered with so that it would receive, \"in reciprocation\" the legal right to receive payments from consumers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary 1066 (11th ed. 2003). This arrangement proved to be a lucrative business for CashCall due to the high interest rates on the loans and the late fees it was entitled to charge. Because CashCall provided the consumer with \"advice or assistance\" in the obtention of an \"extension of credit by others,\" and was compensated for doing so, we conclude that CashCall engaged in a credit services business. CL \u00a7 14-1901(e).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   We now discuss whether there was substantial evidence in the record before Commissioner Kaufman to support his finding that \"there was a direct payment from the consumer to CashCall in connection with obtaining the loan and that CashCall provided credit services to Maryland consumers.\" The Commissioner asserts that there was. We agree and conclude that CashCall is subject to the requirements of the MCSBA. Moreover, even if the payments had not been direct, there was\n   substantial evidence in the record before Commissioner Kaufman that CashCall was engaged in a credit services business.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   At the Exceptions hearing, the record before Commissioner Kaufman consisted of the Exceptions filed, the Proposed Decision, the Proposed Order, the transcript of the OAH proceedings in this matter, and all of the exhibits admitted at the OAH hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Consumer Loan Marketing,\n   Origination, and Sale Agreement, between CashCall and First Bank &amp; Trust of Milbank and the amendment to that agreement (\"the Sealed Agreements\") supported Commissioner Kaufman's conclusions that CashCall was \"\n   <em>\n    obligated\n   </em>\n   to purchase the loans\" and \"upon assignment of a loan from the bank to CashCall, the bank's right, title and interest in the loans were assigned to CashCall.\" (emphasis in original). It also indicated that a \"close review\" of the Sealed Agreements \"demonstrated that CashCall received fees directly from the consumers in connection with its role.... marketing and soliciting the loans and transmitting the application to the lender.\" These agreements further obligated CashCall \"to repurchase the loans three days after the loans were disbursed.\" Commissioner Kaufman specifically refers to \"the First Bank &amp; Trust Promissory Note and Disclosure Statement, dated as of December 12, 2006\" to explain how the consumers \"paid fees directly to CashCall[:]\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-87\">\n   [F]or a $2,600 consumer loan[,] [t]he \"financed\" amount of the loan is shown as $2,525.00. This is the amount received by the consumer. A \"Prepaid Finance Charge/Origination Fee\" is listed at $75.00. The $75.00 fee is rolled into the principal amount of the loan. As a result, the total amount of principal due from the consumer is $2,600.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-88\">\n   In order to understand the significance of the $75 fee, one must turn back to the Sealed Agreements. Pursuant to the Sealed Agreements, when CashCall purchased a loan, CashCall paid for the outstanding balance due, including all principal, interest, origination fees, and other charges or sums owed by the borrower. In other words, CashCall paid $2,600 for the loan. Because the loan was transferred from the bank to CashCall three days later, the consumer did not make a single payment to the bank.... The consumer [ ] directly paid CashCall, not the bank, because CashCall collected on the loan, which included the $75.00.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-89\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-90\">\n   Here, the consumer paid CashCall for the principal, interest, and\n   <em>\n    fees\n   </em>\n   on the loan. Therefore, CashCall received direct payments from the consumer for fees in connection with the application and origination of the loan, as stated on the Promissory Note.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original). As the Final Order explained, there was ample evidence in the record to support the factual finding that Maryland consumers made \"direct payments\" to CashCall for assistance in obtaining an extension of credit. Therefore, we hold that there was substantial evidence in the record to support the Commissioner's finding that by collecting the full value of the loan, including the origination fee paid by the consumer, CashCall engaged in a \"credit services business.\" In addition, we hold that even if the record did not establish that \"direct payments\" were made to CashCall, there was substantial evidence in the record to support the conclusion that CashCall's conduct met the definition of a \"credit services business.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED; COSTS TO BE PAID BY THE PETITIONERS.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    The MCSBA is codified in Md.
