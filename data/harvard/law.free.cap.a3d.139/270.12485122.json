R.J.W. contends the ALJ erred in: (1) issuing an adjudication that is not supported by substantial evidence; (2) prohibiting the viewing and admission of videotape evidence of a forensic interview; and, (3) permitting the Department to amend a determination of \"founded\" child abuse to \"indicated.\" Upon review, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Indicated Report of Sexual Abuse\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2011, the Washington County Office of Children and Youth Services (CYS) received a report of possible child abuse involving a child, L.F. (Child), and her father R.J.W. Child is a female born in October 2006. The alleged abuse occurred before the report was made, when Child was between four and five years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   In October 2011, after its investigation, CYS filed an indicated report identifying R.J.W. as the perpetrator of child sexual abuse in the nature of sexual assault involving Child.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 2a-3a. R.J.W. appealed, and the BHA assigned an ALJ to hear the appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    B. ALJ's Adjudication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Findings\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The ALJ held three days of evidentiary hearings at which CYS presented the testimony of Child, Child's mother, R.F. (Mother), Michelle McIntyre (McIntyre), R.N., Emergency Service Practice Specialist at Washington Hospital, who serves as a sexual assault nurse examiner (SANE), Linda Chambers, R.N., an emergency room nurse who is also a SANE nurse, Tamara Miller (Miller), a licensed professional counselor, Amy Russell (Russell), M.S.Ed., J.D., NCC, Deputy Director of the National Child Protection Training Center, Jennifer Lytton (Lytton), a forensic interviewer for Washington County and Gina Zacios, a CYS caseworker. For his part, R.J.W. testified on his own behalf and presented as character witnesses the testimony of two friends and his girlfriend, as well as the testimony of Dr. Bruce Chambers, Ph.D., a licensed psychologist. The parties submitted briefs. The ALJ subsequently issued an adjudication recommending denial of R.J.W.'s appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   More particularly, based on the evidence presented, the ALJ found the following\n   facts. In September 2011, CYS received a report of possible child abuse. A Child Protective Service Investigation Report alleged that incidents of abuse occurred between October 2010 and September 2011. The abuse allegedly included, \"daddy [ (R.J.W.) ] rubs me and puts his fingers up inside of me.\" ALJ's Adj., 10/16/14, Finding of Fact (F.F.) No. 6 (quoting Ex. C-4). CYS made its decision to register R.J.W. based solely on Child's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In November 2011, CYS referred Child to Southwestern Pennsylvania Human Services (SPHS) for an intake assessment. CYS made the referral based on \"indicated\" sexual abuse and for symptoms of \"hyper-vigilance ... crying, tearfulness[,] fear of sleeping in her own room, having night mares [sic], diurnal enuresis.\" F.F. No. 10 (quoting ALJ's Hearing, Notes of Testimony (N.T.), 3/7/12, at 108). Child underwent 10 sessions at SPHS in a therapeutic setting with Miller, an outpatient therapist and counselor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Miller opined that, based on the symptoms Child displayed during her sessions, testifying at the hearing would cause Child emotional distress. Miller acknowledged that if Child testified while R.J.W. was not present, her distress would be relieved. The hyper-vigilance Miller observed in Child related to fear of certain people or places. In her sessions with Miller, Child avoided any conversations about R.J.W. and was fearful R.J.W. would harm her or Mother if Child disclosed anything. The fear expressed by Child extended to fear that her stuffed rabbit, Easter, would be damaged. Miller opined that conversations about the alleged abuse could trigger severe emotional distress in Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The ALJ ultimately determined that Child, who was five-years-old at the time of the hearings, was competent to testify. As a result, Child testified at the hearings. The ALJ stated that Child understood the difference between \"what is real and what is not.\" F.F. No. 22 (citing N.T. at 128). When Child testified at the hearing, she stated clearly her \"daddy\" hurt her; he \"licked her after he removed her clothing with his tongue on her arm, her leg and on her 'bum.' \" F.F. No. 23 (quoting N.T. at 133). \"When [Child] talked about her 'bum,' she pointed to her front genitalia.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Child refers to her \"butt\" as the part of her body that she sits on. F.F. No. 28 (quoting N.T. at 140). \"[Child] disclosed that [R.J.W.] sticks his fingers up inside her and rubs her on her front genitals.\" F.F. No. 24 (citing N.T. at 134). Child testified that when R.J.W. \"put his fingers inside of her that it hurt her.\" F.F. No. 25 (citing N.T. at 135). R.J.W. threatened to set Easter, Child's stuffed rabbit, on fire or to run Easter over with his truck if Child revealed the alleged abuse. \"[R.J.W.] inappropriately touched [Child] when she was at his house and there were no other people around.\" F.F. No. 27 (citing N.T. at 137).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   McIntyre, a SANE nurse, physically examined Child on September 15, 2011 at Washington Hospital. No one asked Child questions during her physical examination. However, Child made a spontaneous statement during the course of her physical examination. Prior to being asked to assist McIntyre with Child, Linda Chambers, R.N., had no experience with Child. The physical examination consisted of visual and swabbing of the outside of Child's genitals. When McIntyre placed Child in a position for examination, Child reached down and pushed her hand away and said: \"Don't touch me there like Daddy does.\" F.F. No. 34 (quoting N.T. at 174). Child returned home after visiting R.J.W. on September 11, 2011. On September 12, 2011, in the evening, Child was taking a bath when Mother noticed her vaginal area was red.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   From January through September 2011, R.J.W. had visitation with Child from 5:00 p.m. on Fridays until 8:00 p.m. on Sundays, every other weekend, and either Mondays or Thursdays from 5:00 p.m. until 8:30 p.m. Child became extremely upset when she had to visit R.J.W. for a weekend. Before Mother noticed the redness around Child's vagina, Child had nightmares and \"wet the bed a lot\" after she came home from a visit with R.J.W. F.F. No. 41 (citing N.T. at 212). Child's bed wetting occurred \"after she was fully potty trained.\" F.F. No. 42 (citing N.T. at 214).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Mother corroborated that Child refers to her vaginal area as her \"bummy\" and her rectum as her \"butt.\" F.F. No. 43 (quoting N.T. at 215). When Child was on the toilet or in the bathtub after she came home from a weekend visit with R.J.W., Child would spontaneously say \"my bummy is itchy\" or \"my bum hurts.\" F.F. No. 44 (quoting N.T. at 219). Mother related a story of Child's statements on September 12, 2011, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   And I went, and I got her pajamas and brought them in; and she was sitting on the bed. When she laid back, I kind of went to push her legs back like you would change a baby's diaper to look to see if it was red, if it was a rash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   She completely-she started screaming and crying and pushing my hands away and kicking at me, and I sat her up; and I said, 'Honey,' I said, 'What is the matter?' I said, 'I'm just looking to see-you know, you might have a rash,' and she just continued to scream and cry; and she said, 'Please don't touch me there,' and I said, 'Touch you where, baby,' and she said, 'There.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   And I said, 'I don't understand what you mean.' And she said, 'Please don't touch me there like my daddy does.' And I said, \"What do you mean, 'like your daddy does?' I said, 'Nobody is allowed to touch you there,' I said, 'unless they're helping you get a bath or, you know, helping you wipe if you can't.' And she said, 'My daddy does.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-27\">\n   And I said, 'Are you sure that he wasn't drying you off and maybe he scratched you or bumped you,' and she said 'No.' And I said, 'You need to show me or tell me exactly what it is that he does.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   And she took her right hand, and she put it outside of the front of her; and she started rubbing herself and in-between there. And then she went to put her fingers inside of her, and I stopped her; and I said, 'Stop.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   F.F. No. 45 (quoting N.T. at 221-22).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On the same date, Mother brought Child to the Monongahela Valley Hospital Emergency Room for examination. On the way to the emergency room, Child questioned Mother, \"Am I going to get shots?\" and \"Daddy said that I'm going to get shots if I tell on him.\" F.F. No. 46 (quoting N.T. at 223). Before they arrived at the emergency room, Child vomited all over the rear of the vehicle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The next day, Mother scheduled an appointment for Child for a forensic interview. Two days later, Lytton conducted a forensic interview. During the interview, Lytton made notes of her observations and notes of Child's statements. Child stated R.J.W. hit her in the face with the back of his hand. Child also stated R.J.W. touches her \"bum\" with his \"nail.\" F.F. No. 53 (quoting N.T., 5/11/12, at 447). When Lytton identified body parts, Child pointed to her vaginal area and identified the area as her \"bum.\" F.F. No. 54 (quoting N.T., 5/11/12, at 448). Child stated: \"It was after her bath when her dad was drying her off. She said that her dad was drying her off when his nail touched her in the bum. She said that it stayed still.\" F.F. No. 55 (quoting N.T., 5/11/12, at 451).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   For her part, Russell, the Deputy Director of the National Child Protection Training Center, agreed that by the way a forensic interviewer phrases her questions or by her body language, the interviewer has the power to suggest the desired responses. The forensic interview of Child was recorded, but the recording was maintained as confidential by the Washington County Child Advocacy Center (CAC). CYS did not introduce the recording into evidence during the hearings. Russell agreed that the fact that no recording of the forensic interview was presented made it difficult to assess the reliability of the information Child conveyed during the interview. Russell also agreed that, the younger the child, the greater the suggestibility. Additionally, she agreed younger children may be led to claim an event occurred when it was only suggested by the interviewer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Ultimately, the ALJ found the testimony of Mother, Child and SANE nurse Linda Chambers credible. F.F. Nos. 66, 68, 69. The ALJ found the testimony of R.J.W. not credible. F.F. No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    2. ALJ's Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The ALJ first observed that the three hearings in this case occurred before our Supreme Court reversed this Court's decision regarding the appropriate level of proof required to maintain a perpetrator's information on the ChildLine registry.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.V. v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7312196\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/52/434/\">\n    52 A.3d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.2012) (\n   <em>\n    en banc\n   </em>\n   ),\n   <em>\n    rev'd,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/625/280/\">\n    625 Pa. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n    91 A.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) The ALJ observed that another factor that affected the progress of this case were the criminal proceedings against R.J.W. in which he initially pled not guilty to multiple counts relating to sexual abuse of a child. After the criminal trial commenced, R.J.W. agreed to plead\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to one count of endangering the welfare of a child. Based on R.J.W.'s\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea, CYS amended R.J.W.'s initial registration from \"indicated\" to \"founded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   In order to understand why he ultimately decided this case on the merits of the \"indicated\" registration, the ALJ explained, it was necessary to understand how the case progressed. In September 2011, CYS received a report of possible child abuse. After investigating the report, CYS registered R.J.W. on ChildLine with an \"indicated\" status. R.J.W. received notice of the \"indicated\" status, which he appealed, through counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The BHA scheduled a hearing for January 2012 to determine whether the Department correctly registered R.J.W. with an \"indicated\" status. At CYS' request, the BHA moved the hearing to March 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The ALJ held hearings over the course of three days in March, May and June 2012. In August 2012, the BHA notified CYS that this Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    G.V.,\n   </em>\n   adopted a clear and convincing evidence standard for these proceedings, and the BHA offered CYS an opportunity to file a new brief or reargue the appeal based on the new standard. The BHA denied a motion to stay these proceedings pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the appeal in\n   <em>\n    G.V.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Thereafter, the BHA stayed the proceedings pending resolution of the criminal proceedings involving R.J.W. In August 2013, the common pleas court accepted R.J.W.'s plea of\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to one count of endangering the welfare of a child. In turn, CYS amended R.J.W.'s registration status from \"indicated\" to \"founded.\" CYS also requested that the BHA dismiss R.J.W.'s administrative appeal because the common pleas court accepted R.J.W.'s\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea. R.J.W. responded that his\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea was unrelated to the allegations of sexual abuse by CYS. The Department\n   subsequently amended R.J.W.'s registration status from \"indicated\" to \"founded.\" CYS notified R.J.W. that his registration status was changed from \"indicated\" to \"founded.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The BHA then scheduled a hearing to determine whether R.J.W.'s \"founded\" registration status was correctly characterized. At the hearing, CYS failed to justify its decision to amend R.J.W.'s registration status, and it agreed to have the appeal adjudicated on the merits of the \"indicated\" status. Thereafter, the Department again amended R.J.W.'s registration status from \"founded\" to \"indicated.\" After the Department filed its brief, the ALJ closed the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   As to the merits, the ALJ explained that the Department initially registered R.J.W. after an investigation based primarily on Child's statements taken at several different times and in several different settings. The ALJ stated Child was only four and five years old when she alleged R.J.W. inappropriately touched her \"bum.\" ALJ's Adj. at 14. Child refers to her genitalia as her \"bum.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The ALJ explained that from January through September, 2011, Child visited R.J.W. on alternate weekends including overnight visits. Child became extremely upset when she had to visit her \"daddy\" on weekends in which she stayed over with him.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   She would become upset; she would cry and vomit before she went for the visit. During the months Child stayed with R.J.W., when she returned home, she had nightmares, she would wake up screaming and at one point she stuttered. When Mother asked Child about her dreams, Child only cried.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Further, many times after Child returned from visiting R.J.W., she stated that her \"bum\" was itchy or sore.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   On September 12, 2011, when Child was taking a bath, Mother noticed her genitals were red. The redness looked like a rash. After Child finished bathing, Mother placed Child on her bed to examine the rash. Child \"screamed, hollered [and] kicked at [Mother] and pushed her hands away. She said 'please don't touch me there like my Daddy does.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   When Mother asked Child what she meant, Child took her right hand and started rubbing her genitals. When she started to put her fingers inside of her vagina, Mother stopped her.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   As to this testimony, the ALJ stated: \"\n   <em>\n    I believe this occurred. I believe [Child] made the oral statement without prompting by [Mother].\n   </em>\n   My belief is corroborated by the fact that [Mother] took [Child] on September 12, 2011 to the Mon Valley Emergency Room for an examination.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   On the way to the hospital, Child asked whether \"she was going to get shots and vomited in the car.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ stated: \"I interpret the reaction to mean that [Child] was frightened about something. [Mother] testified that [Child] told her that her Daddy told her that she would get shots if she told on him. I find that [Child's] fear could easily be attributed to that kind of threat.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   After Child was examined at the hospital, she was scheduled for a forensic interview, which occurred at the CAC by Lytton. Lytton made an audio-video recording of the interview; however, CYS did not request the recording from CAC, and the recording was not used as evidence during the hearings. The ALJ explained that, generally, CAC does not provide recordings of interviews absent an order from a common pleas court. The ALJ further stated the recording was not in CYS' possession nor was it used as evidence by CYS at the hearings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Counsel for R.J.W. objected to Lytton's testimony on the ground that he was not\n   provided with a copy of the recording of the interview. R.J.W. argued he was prejudiced by the witness because there was no way for Dr. Chambers, his expert, to analyze Lytton's interview style. The ALJ overruled the objection on the ground that the forensic interviewer was present, and she testified about Child's statements and behavior during the interview. The ALJ permitted R.J.W. to conduct extensive cross-examination of Lytton. The ALJ overruled R.J.W.'s objection because \"after a child has testified at a hearing her hearsay may be admitted ... once the child has been determined competent to testify and ... testifies at the expunction hearing.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Here, the ALJ found Child was competent, and she testified at the hearing. The ALJ found Child's hearsay statements to Ms. Lytton were admissible \"as they would be if she made them to Mother or another person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, the ALJ further gave Child's hearsay statements little weight as they were only corroborative of Child's statements and demeanor as observed by others. The ALJ stated: \"It was not so much what [Child] said but what [Child] did that provided substantial evidence of the correctness of [CYS'] decision to register [R.J.W.].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The ALJ further explained that, after her interview, McIntyre, a SANE nurse, examined Child at the hospital. Linda Chambers, R.N., assisted McIntyre. Chambers' job was to distract Child so McIntyre could more easily examine Child. The examination consisted of a visual examination of Child's genitals and some external swabs in the genital area. During the examination, Child was fussing and crying. She reached down and tried to push McIntyre's hands away. She said, \"Don't touch me there like Daddy does.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16. The ALJ credited Linda Chambers' observations of Child's actions to prevent being examined as well as her recollection of Child's statement. Linda Chambers had no prior relationship with Child or Mother and asked Child no questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The ALJ also explained that, at the recommendation of CYS, Mother placed Child into therapy. Miller of SPHS was Child's therapist. CYS referred Child for therapy subsequent to sexual abuse. Mother also believed therapy was necessary based on Child's symptoms of hyper-vigilance, crying, fear of sleeping in her own room, nightmares and bed wetting. The ALJ explained that hyper-vigilance is a sign of a person suffering some prior distress. Other symptoms that show Child suffered distress were that she would avoid topics related to the cause of the distress; thus, she would avoid topics related to R.J.W. Child was afraid R.J.W. would harm her or Mother if she disclosed any information regarding the cause of her distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Miller also disclosed that R.J.W. caused Child's distress. Child's emotional distress when presented with conversations about what occurred was severe. The ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   [Child's] avoidance of any topic related to her father, her demonstrated fear that her father might harm her or [Mother], her tantrums related to anybody touching her 'bum[,]' the fact that [Child's] vagina was red and sore after she visited with her father; and, [Child's] bed wetting and nightmares after visiting with her father all provide corroboration that her statement, 'Don't touch me there like Daddy does,' was not coached or a product of taint. The statement related something that had occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   In addition, the ALJ explained, at the hearing, Child showed she understood the\n   difference between fact and fiction. The ALJ permitted Child to testify with the provision that if she became uncommunicative, she would be excused to avoid traumatizing her. The ALJ excluded R.J.W. from the hearing during Child's testimony because Child's therapist opined that he might cause her distress. Child's relevant testimony was that her daddy hurt her. He licked her on her arm, her leg, and on her \"bum.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Child referred to her vagina as her bum. When asked, Child correctly pointed to her arm, leg and to front genitals. Child testified she was wearing clothes when R.J.W. licked her, but R.J.W. removed them. Child testified R.J.W. licked her more than once. The ALJ stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-54\">\n   [Child] also testified [R.J.W.] sticks his fingers up inside of her and rubbed her and he pushed her. [Child] pointed to her front genitals when she identified the part that [R.J.W.] rubbed. [R.J.W.] touched her when she was at his house. If R.J.W. were in the room, it would make [Child] sad because he hurt her.\n   <em>\n    Even under significant cross-examination, [Child] restated that [R.J.W.] 'sticked his fingers up inside me.' [Child's] testimony, in light of her previous observed demeanor when she was talking about [R.J.W.] or when someone was examining her, was credible.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   <em>\n    Consistent with my analysis above, I find that the Department was correct when it registered [R.J.W.] on ChildLine with an 'indicated' status.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 16-17 (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The BHA subsequently entered an order adopting the ALJ's adjudication in its entirety. In response, R.J.W. filed an application for reconsideration, which the Department granted. After reconsideration, the Department's Acting Secretary issued an order upholding the BHA's order for the reasons the BHA stated. R.J.W. now petitions for review to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

First, he contends the ALJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and this Court should disturb the ALJ's findings as to weight and credibility on appeal. Additionally, R.J.W. asserts the ALJ committed an error of law or abuse of discretion in prohibiting the viewing and admission of videotape evidence of Child's forensic interview. Finally, R.J.W. argues the ALJ committed an error of law or abuse of discretion by permitting the Department to amend a determination of \"founded\" child abuse to \"indicated.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Substantial Evidence\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   R.J.W. first argues CYS did not meet its burden of proving an indication of child abuse by substantial evidence. He contends that an individual may only be registered as an indicated child abuser if an investigation by the Department or county agency determines that substantial evidence of the alleged abuse by a perpetrator exists based on any of the following: (i) available medical evidence; (ii) the child protective service investigation; or, (iii) an admission of the acts of abuse by the\n   perpetrator. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303 (defining \"indicated report\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   55 Pa.Code \u00a7 3490.4. Here, R.J.W. asserts, CYS presented no medical evidence nor did R.J.W. admit to the acts of abuse. Thus, CYS had the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, that its investigation revealed substantial evidence to register R.J.W. as an indicated child abuser.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   R.J.W. points out that Section 6303 of the CPS Law defines \"substantial evidence\" as \"[e]vidence which outweighs inconsistent evidence and which a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   He contends the accuracy of the evidence presented, preserved for the record and documented for appellate review is paramount in the determination. Expungement of an \"indicated\" registration is required if the registration is inaccurate or maintained in a manner inconsistent with the CPS Law. 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6341(a)(2).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   R.J.W. argues CYS bore the burden of proving, by substantial evidence, that the \"indicated\" report was accurate.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bucks Cnty. Children &amp; Youth Servs. Agency v. Dep't of Pub.

Thus, the evidence an agency presents must outweigh all contrary evidence,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303 ;\n   <em>\n    C.F. v. Dep't of Pub.

Because an appellate court may not reweigh or examine credibility determinations, \"[i]t is the factfinder's job to make and explain credibility determinations when conducting the 'weighing dynamic' required by 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a).

R.J.W. asserts the ALJ further ignored the following salient points, which he made during his case-in-chief:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   \u2022 [R.J.W.] and Mother were going through a bitter custody dispute when the allegations of sexual abuse were made;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \u2022 [R.J.W.] and [Child] had a loving and fruitful father/daughter relationship;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \u2022 Three witnesses testified on [R.J.W.'s] behalf as to [R.J.W.'s] character and relationship with [Child], as well as their own, personal interactions with [R.J.W.] and Child;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   \u2022 Dr. Chambers, [R.J.W.'s] expert witness regarding forensic examinations, severely doubted the veracity of the allegations given the known interview techniques and the inability for anyone to view a video recording of the forensic interview; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   \u2022 [R.J.W.'s] belief that Mother had coached [Child] into making the accusations regarding sexual abuse.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Br. for Pet'r at 24-25. Indeed, R.J.W. contends, the ALJ summed up the entirety of the evidence and testimony R.J.W. presented as follows: \"[R.J.W.] did not testify credibly.\" F.F. No. 67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   R.J.W. argues that in\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   this Court found such a \"capricious disregard of evidence\" mandates, at a minimum, vacating and remanding to the ALJ for a complete and thorough weighing of all the evidence presented.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n    at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . R.J.W. asserts the ALJ's capricious disregard of record evidence here is even more egregious than that of the ALJ in\n   <em>\n    A.P.\n   </em>\n   Here, R.J.W. argues, there was no analysis, no relation of testimony, no weighing of contrary evidence. Instead, the ALJ simply stated: \"[R.J.W.] did not testify credibly.\" F.F. No. 67. Such a finding, without anything more, is the very definition of \"[a] dismissal of one side's evidence with a conclusory credibility determination.\"\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n    98 A.3d at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   R.J.W. further contends this Court can review the record as a whole and determine CYS did not meet its burden, without disturbing the ALJ's credibility determinations, because the accuracy of the indicated report is highly questionable and therefore not supported by substantial evidence. R.J.W. acknowledges the testimony of the alleged victim alone is sufficient to constitute substantial evidence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    G.S. v. Dep't of Pub. Welfare,\n   </em>\n   104 Pa.Cmwlth. 84,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356657\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/104/84/\">\n    521 A.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1987). However, he argues, because CYS did not have medical evidence or an admission from R.J.W., CYS had the burden to prove by substantial evidence that its investigation was sufficient to register R.J.W. Even placing Child's testimony on the pedestal that the ALJ did, R.J.W. argues, the investigation, as relayed at the hearing, was rife with flaws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   First, R.J.W. contends, not a single investigator, nor R.J.W. or his expert, Dr. Chambers, viewed the videotape of the forensic interview. The ALJ, citing the testimony of CYS' expert, Russell, found as fact that the lack of a \"video or audio recording of the ... forensic interview ... introduced as evidence makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the information conveyed at the interview by [Child].\" F.F. No. 59 (citing N.T. at 323). The ALJ, again citing Russell's testimony, further determined that the younger the child, the higher the risk of suggestibility, and younger children \"may be led to claim that an event occurred when it was only a suggestion by the interviewer.\" F.F. Nos. 60-61 (citing N.T. at 324). R.J.W. contends CYS filed the indicated report immediately after the forensic interview, and CYS bore the burden of proving the accuracy of the indication as determined by its investigation. R.J.W. argues these findings by the ALJ reveal that CYS' investigation was inaccurate, and therefore reversal is mandated.\n   <em>\n    Bucks Cnty. Child. &amp; Youth Servs. Agency.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   In addition, R.J.W. argues, Child's testimony is full of inconsistencies. R.J.W. asserts Child's credibility, which cannot be assailed on appeal, is different than the accuracy of her testimony, particularly where Child's testimony alone may sustain CYS' burden. R.J.W. contends on multiple occasions during cross-examination, Child testified she did not know what words such as \"rub,\" \"inside,\" \"lick,\" \"hurt\" or \"touch\" mean. N.T. at 144-45, 150. Child also testified she was \"a baby\" and \"one\" year-old when the alleged abuse occurred.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356657\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/104/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356657\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/104/84/\">\n    at 141-42\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Child further testified R.J.W. performed the abusive acts of \"touching [and] rubbing\" while she and R.J.W. were around \"all kinds of other people\" at an amusement park.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356657\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/104/84/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1356657\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/104/84/\">\n    at 152-53\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . R.J.W. argues the entirety of CYS' investigation accused R.J.W. of \"rubbing\" Child's vaginal area, sticking his fingers \"inside\" of her, \"hurting\" and \"touching\" Child, and \"licking\" Child on the arm and leg, based solely on Child's statements. F.F. No. 7. However, R.J.W. asserts, Child credibly (\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   F.F. No. 66) testified she did not know the meaning of\n   those words. Again, R.J.W. argues, even assuming proper credibility determinations, CYS did not meet its burden, and reversal is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

[Child] is young. She was only four years old and five years old when she alleged that her father had inappropriately touched her 'bum.' [Child] refers to her genitalia as her 'bum.' [R.J.W.] makes a strong argument that [Child's] statements were a product of suggestion by [Mother] and by improper interviewing techniques. While I agree with [R.J.W.'s] position that [Child's] statements could have been tainted by [Mother],\n   <em>\n    after a careful review of her testimony and spontaneous statements, I find [Child] credible. [Child's] observable reaction to the stimulus of someone trying to examine her genitals speaks volumes. Her observable reaction when she was being sent for a weekend to her father's is illustrative of fear of something.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-91\">\n   From January 2011 until about September, 2011 [Child] visited her father's [home] on alternate weekends including overnight visits. [Child] became extremely upset when she had to visit her 'daddy' on weekends where she stayed over. She would become upset; she would cry and vomit before she went for the visit. During the months that [Child] stayed over at her father's, when she returned home, she had nightmares, she would wake up screaming and at one point she stuttered. When [Mother] asked her about her dreams [Child] only cried. She wet the bed 'a lot.' Before she started visiting her father, [Child] was fully potty trained.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-92\">\n   Many times when [Child] returned from visiting her father, she said that her 'bum' was itchy or that it was sore. On September 12, 2011 when [Child] was taking a bath, [Mother] noticed that [Child's] genitals were red. The redness looked like a rash. After [Child] had finished bathing, [Mother] put her on her bed to examine the rash. [Child] screamed, hollered, kicked at [Mother] and pushed her hands away.\n   <em>\n    She said 'please don't touch me there like my Daddy does.' When [Mother] asked what she meant, [Child] took her right hand and started rubbing her genitals. When she started to put her fingers inside of her vagina, [Mother] stopped her. I believe this occurred. I believe [Child] made the oral statement without prompting by [Mother]. My belief is corroborated by the fact that [Mother] took her on September 12, 2011 to the Mon Valley Emergency Room for an examination.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   On the way to the hospital, [Child] asked whether she was going to get shots and vomited in the car.\n   <em>\n    I interpret the reaction to mean that [Child] was frightened about something.

We explained the ALJ did not consider all the evidence in conflict with the child's statement or adequately explain his credibility determinations. Specifically, the ALJ capriciously disregarded the cousin's testimony that she expected the child to confide\n   in her and affirm his abuse claims, but he did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   In addition, we determined the ALJ utilized an impermissible \"double standard\" when assessing the evidence by, among other things: (1) rejecting the uncle's witnesses because of a perceived familial bias but not invoking the concept of familial bias against the child's parents; (2) rejecting the testimony of the uncle's girlfriend as biased even though the girlfriend and the uncle had not dated for several years; (3) criticizing the uncle for not presenting testimony by the child's teachers or friends as to the child's reputation despite the fact that the county, not the uncle, bore the burden of proof; and, (4) finding the child's testimony \"clear\" despite deficiencies and lapses in memory, which the ALJ attributed to the passage of time while, at the same time, finding the uncle's inability to remember details fatal to his credibility.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 744-45. In light of these deficiencies, we vacated and remanded for consideration of the record in accordance with the required statutory weighing dynamic. We directed the ALJ to undertake this weighing of the evidence with reference to demeanor and substance of the testimony. We also stated a dismissal of one side's evidence with a conclusory credibility determination was insufficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Here, unlike in\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   the ALJ adequately employed the statutory \"weighing dynamic\" standard when he determined that the testimony of Child, which was corroborated by SANE nurse Linda Chambers, therapist Tamara Miller, forensic interviewer Jennifer Lytton, and Mother outweighed the inconsistent evidence presented by R.J.W. As indicated above, the ALJ provided a detailed analysis that was sufficient to resolve the issues raised. Additionally, unlike the testimony of the child in\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   the testimony of Child in this case was amply corroborated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   Finally, unlike in\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   the ALJ here did not simply dismiss R.J.W.'s evidence with a conclusory credibility determination. Rather, the ALJ specifically considered R.J.W.'s position that Child's statements could have been tainted by Mother. The ALJ made an extensive analysis of the evidence regarding R.J.W.'s position, most of which related to Child's conduct viewed by others. The ALJ explained reasons for expressly rejecting R.J.W.'s \"taint\" contention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   <strong>\n    B.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   R.J.W. next argues CYS improperly withheld probative evidence from the agency file: a videotape of Child's forensic interview. He asserts the ALJ, in turn, refused to mandate the turning over of the videotape or any other appropriate sanction. R.J.W. maintains both actions violate the CPS Law as well as guarantees of due process under the Pennsylvania Constitution. Thus, he contends, if this Court does not reverse the BHA's order denying his expunction request, a remand is required with an order directing CYS to turn over the videotape.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

On September 15, 2011, [Child] was interviewed at [CAC] by [Lytton]. [Lytton] made an audio-video recording of the interview but\n   <em>\n    the recording was not requested of CAC by CYS and was not used as evidence in the hearing.\n   </em>\n   Generally, recordings of interviews are not provided by CAC absent a court order from the court of common pleas.\n   <em>\n    The recording was not in CYS possession, nor was it used as evidence by the agency in the expunction hearing.\n   </em>\n   [R.J.W.] objected to testimony by [Lytton] because it had not been provided with a copy of the recording of the interview. [R.J.W.] argued that it was prejudiced by the witness since it had no way for its expert to analyze the interview style.\n   <em>\n    The ALJ overruled the objection since the forensic interviewer was present and testifying about what [Child] had said and done in the interview. [R.J.W.] was permitted extensive cross-examination of the witness.\n   </em>\n   The ALJ overruled [R.J.W.'s] objection because after a child has testified at a hearing her hearsay may be admitted ... once a child has been determined competent to testify and is either found unavailable or testifies at the expunction hearing.\n   <em>\n    [Child] was competent. She testified at the expunction hearing. I find that [Child's] hearsay statements to [Lytton] are admissible, as they would be if she made them to [Mother] or another person. [Child's] hearsay will be given little weight as it is only corroborative of [Child's] statements and demeanor as observed by others. It was not so much what [Child] said but what the child did that provided substantial evidence of the correctness of the CYS decision to register [R.J.W.].\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   ALJ's Adj. at 15. Upon review, we reject R.J.W.'s assertions that a remand is appropriate here based on R.J.W.'s inability to view the videotape of the forensic interview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-254\">\n   More particularly, before the ALJ, R.J.W. objected to Lytton's testimony after learning Lytton videotaped her forensic interview of Child, but the videotape was not made available to R.J.W. N.T. at 429. The ALJ declined to exclude Lytton's testimony regarding her recollection of her forensic interview of Child based on the absence of the videotape. N.T. at 434-\n   35. To that end, in response to R.J.W.'s objection, counsel for CYS explained: the videotape was never in CYS' possession, counsel for CYS did not view the videotape, and counsel for CYS did not intend to offer the videotape into evidence because, at that point, Child already testified live before the ALJ. N.T. at 434. Counsel for CYS further stated the videotape was in the possession of CAC, which, generally, will not release it without an order from a common pleas court. N.T. at 433, 436. Thus, the hearings here proceeded as if no videotape existed. N.T. at 432, 434-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   Moreover, no abuse of discretion is apparent in the ALJ's decision to overrule R.J.W.'s objection to allowing Lytton to testify at the hearing on the ground that R.J.W. did not receive a copy of the videotape of Lytton's forensic interview of Child. To that end, Lytton explained she works as a Program Specialist Forensic Interviewer at A Voice for Me Child Advocacy Center. N.T. at 414. She attended a forensic interviewing training program, she participates in ongoing education in her field, and she began conducting forensic interviews in 2003. N.T. at 417-18. Lytton provided background on the manner in which she communicates with children and assesses their development and communication skills. N.T. at 420-27, 443-44. Additionally, at the hearing, the ALJ only permitted Lytton to testify regarding her recollection of the interview after she refreshed her memory of the interview with her notes and report. N.T. at 435. Lytton then offered testimony regarding her interview of Child. N.T. at 445-57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   Nevertheless, R.J.W. argues his inability to use and view the videotape, \"significantly impeded his ability to challenge the allegations made against him\" in violation of his constitutional rights. Br. for Pet'r at 34. However, during the course of the hearings, R.J.W. elicited testimony from CYS witness Amy Russell, who serves Deputy Director of the National Child Protection Training Center, which the ALJ considered, regarding the suggestibility of young children. Specifically, Russell testified that the manner in which a forensic interviewer phrases questions can suggest responses from a child. N.T. at 321-22. Russell also testified that without a recording of the interview with Child it was difficult to assess the reliability of the information conveyed by Child during the interview. N.T. at 323. R.J.W. contends this testimony shows the videotape was necessary to assess the credibility of the forensic interview. It is clear from the ALJ's discussion, however, that the ALJ afforded little weight to the forensic interview in reaching his decision. ALJ's Adj. at 15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   To that end, in his findings the ALJ summarized Russell's testimony that the lack of a videotape of a forensic interview can make it difficult to assess the reliability of the information conveyed by a child during an interview, and that younger children may be more susceptible to suggestions made by the interviewer. F.F. Nos. 59-61. Despite this acknowledgement, the ALJ based his decision to uphold the indicated report of abuse on the live, credited testimony of Child, which was corroborated by the live testimony of Linda Chambers, Tamara Miller and Mother. The ALJ gave little weight to Child's hearsay statements made during the forensic interview as those statements were merely corroborative of Child's statements and demeanor as observed by others. ALJ Adj. at 15. Thus, even if Lytton's testimony concerning Child's statements during the forensic interview were excluded based on R.J.W.'s inability to view the videotape of the forensic interview, the ALJ's decision to uphold the indicated report of abuse was adequately supported. As a result,\n   the absence of the videotape simply does not provide a basis for a remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   <strong>\n    C.

Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   As a final issue, R.J.W. asserts the ALJ impermissibly and without statutory authority permitted CYS to amend R.J.W.'s registration from \"indicated\" to \"founded\" and back to \"indicated,\" and then decided the merits of the second indication based on evidence and testimony taken from the first registration of \"indicated.\" He argues that, if CYS wished to file a new \"indicated\" report after it determined it lacked sufficient evidence to justify the change in R.J.W.'s registration status from \"indicated\" to \"founded,\" it could do so, but the case would have to begin anew after that filing. Because the ALJ lacked authority to permit CYS to amend R.J.W.'s registration from \"indicated\" to \"founded\" and back to \"indicated,\" R.J.W. contends reversal of the order denying his request for expunction is proper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

R.R. at 2a-3a. R.J.W. sought to expunge the \"indicated\" report of abuse. R.R. at 1a. The ALJ held hearings on R.J.W.'s appeal of his \"indicated\" registration status in March, May and June 2012. Thereafter, in August 2013, R.J.W. pled\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to one count of endangering the welfare of a child. ALJ's Adj. at 13.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   Shortly thereafter, CYS amended R.J.W.'s registration status from \"indicated\" to \"founded\" based on R.J.W.'s\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea, and it filed a motion to dismiss R.J.W.'s appeal on the ground that a common pleas court accepted R.J.W.'s\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 14.

The ALJ initially questioned whether he could decide this case based on R.J.W.'s appeal of his \"indicated\" registration status in light of CYS's amendment of R.J.W.'s registration status from \"indicated\" to \"founded.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 25-26. However, after further discussion,\n   <em>\n    by agreement of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    the parties,\n   </em>\n   the ALJ determined he would decide the case based on R.J.W.'s initial request for expunction of his \"indicated\" registration status on the record created by the parties at the three hearings in 2012.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 41.

Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-281\">\n   For the above reasons, we discern no error in the BHA's determination that CYS established by substantial evidence the accuracy of its indicated report of child sexual abuse against R.J.W. Accordingly, we affirm the BHA's order denying R.J.W.'s appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-282\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     ORDER\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   <strong>\n    AND NOW,\n   </strong>\n   this 17th day of May, 2016, the order of the Department of Human Services is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-284\">\n   DISSENTING OPINION BY Senior Judge PELLEGRINI.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-285\">\n   I respectfully dissent because the Administrative Law Judge's (ALJ) opinion did not comply with due process or the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 501 -508, 701 -704, as it did not discuss or even mention the evidence that R.J.W. proffered at the hearing in his defense. I also dissent because the ALJ allowed the forensic interviewer to testify about what the Child told her in the interview over the\n   objections of R.J.W. to such testimony absent the videotaped interview of the Child being produced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-286\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-287\">\n   In this case, R.J.W. put on a full defense of the charges against him. He testified on his own behalf, including that he and the Child's Mother were going through a bitter custody dispute when the allegations of sexual abuse were made, and that he believed the Child's Mother coached the Child on what to say. Also, three other individuals testified as character witnesses and described the loving relationship the Child had with R.J.W. as well as their observations of the personal interactions between the Child and R.J.W. Finally, Dr. Bruce Chambers, Ph.D., a licensed psychologist, testified as an expert witness regarding forensic examinations. Dr. Chambers seriously doubted the veracity of the allegations given the known interview techniques used, as well as the inability for anyone, including him, to view the video recording of the forensic interview of the Child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-288\">\n   In a 16-page single-spaced opinion, with 69 findings of fact, the ALJ did not discuss or even mention any of the evidence that R.J.W. presented. The sole reference to the evidence that R.J.W. presented was found in finding of fact 67, where the ALJ found that \"[R.J.W.] did not testify credibly.\" That is it. The majority finds that alone offers sufficient reasoning to comply with due process. I do not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   Included in both an individual's constitutional rights and procedural rights guaranteed by the Administrative Agency Law is the requirement that an agency explain its decision. An agency is already obligated by federal due process to state reasons for its decision.\n   <em>\n    Goldberg v. Kelly,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/\">\n    397 U.S. 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/\">\n    90 S.Ct. 1011\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12052726\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/397/254/\">\n    25 L.Ed.2d 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970). Because of the rise of federal due process jurisprudence, the procedural requirements set forth in the Administrative Agency Law are often overlooked, but those provisions also require that an agency must set forth the reasons behind its decision. Section 507 of the Administrative Agency Law, 2 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 507, provides that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-290\">\n   All adjudications of a Commonwealth agency shall be in writing, shall contain findings and the reasons for the adjudication, and shall be served upon all parties or their counsel personally, or by mail.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   When an agency arrives at a decision where the losing party has presented evidence that could require the agency to arrive at a different outcome, both due process and the Administrative Agency Law require the agency to, at the very least, show that it considered that evidence in arriving at its decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   Moreover, in\n   <em>\n    G.V. v. Department of Public Welfare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/625/280/\">\n    625 Pa. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n    91 A.3d 667\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania established that the proper evidentiary standard in child abuse expunction cases is the \"legislatively established substantial evidence standard.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4216680,6965138\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/667/\">\n    at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Child Protective Services Law, 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7\u00a7 6301 -6386, defines \"substantial evidence\" as \"[e]vidence which\n   <em>\n    outweighs\n   </em>\n   inconsistent evidence and which a reasonable person would accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\" 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a) (emphasis added). As the majority admits, this statutory standard incorporates a \"weighing dynamic\" that goes beyond a traditional deferential substantial evidence review.\n   <em>\n    A.P. v. Department of Public Welfare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n    98 A.3d 736\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 742-43 (Pa.Cmwlth.2014). No \"weighing dynamic\" took place in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Anyone who reads the ALJ's opinion would conclude that R.J.W. did not even\n   put on a case. As mentioned previously, the opinion fails to discuss\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of R.J.W.'s evidence or the contentiousness of the parties, and merely concludes that \"[R.J.W.] did not testify credibly.\" This conclusory statement without any examination of R.J.W.'s evidence fails to constitute the required \"weighing dynamic.\"\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n    98 A.3d at 744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"It is the factfinder's job to make and explain credibility determinations when conducting the 'weighing dynamic' required by 23 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6303(a).\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   Both because the ALJ's adjudication does not satisfy due process and because the ALJ did not employ the required weighing dynamic, I would vacate and remand for consideration of the record in accordance with the required statutory weighing dynamic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    A.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6925281\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/98/736/#p743\">\n    98 A.3d at 745\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that \"dismissal of one side's evidence with a conclusory credibility determination does not suffice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   Equally troubling is the ALJ's decision to overrule R.J.W.'s objection regarding the lack of production of the Child's videotaped interview. Three days after the Child's Mother brought her to the emergency room, Jennifer Lytton (Lytton), a forensic interviewer for Washington County, conducted a forensic interview. Lytton made notes of her observations and of the Child's statements, and the interview was also audio-video recorded. During the hearings, counsel for R.J.W. objected to Lytton's testimony regarding the Child's forensic interview on the ground that he was not provided with a copy of the recording made of that forensic interview. R.J.W. argued that he was prejudiced by Lytton's testimony because there was no way for his expert to analyze Lytton's interview style.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   The ALJ overruled the objection on the circular ground that Lytton was present and testified about the Child's statements and behavior during the forensic interview. The ALJ permitted R.J.W. to conduct extensive cross-examination of Lytton, and also noted that the Child herself also testified. These grounds do not support allowing Lytton to testify, given that the videotape is the best evidence of what the Child told her, which is confirmed by the testimony offered by the Washington County Office of Children and Youth Services (CYS).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   CYS presented the testimony of Amy Russell (Russell), Deputy Director of the National Child Protection Training Center. Russell testified that a forensic interviewer has the power to suggest the desired responses through her body language or the way she phrases her questions. Citing the testimony of CYS' own expert, the ALJ found as fact the lack of a \"video or audio recording of the ... forensic interview ... introduced as evidence makes it difficult to assess the reliability of the information conveyed at the interview by [Child].\" F.F. No. 59. Again, citing Russell's testimony, the ALJ determined that the younger the child, the higher the risk of suggestibility, and younger children \"may be led to claim that an event occurred when it was only a suggestion by the interviewer.\" F.F. Nos. 60-61. Lytton's testimony of what the Child told her should have been excluded because the videotape was the best evidence of what the Child actually told her and how that testimony was elicited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   Moreover, as the majority points out, the use of out-of-court statements by children in expungement cases is controlled by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania's decision in\n   <em>\n    A.Y. v. Department of Public Welfare,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775545\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/537/116/\">\n    537 Pa. 116\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775545,11296751\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/1148/\">\n    641 A.2d 1148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1994). In\n   <em>\n    A.Y.,\n   </em>\n   the Court held that uncorroborated hearsay cannot satisfy the agency's burden unless it \"was accurately recorded by audio\n   or video equipment,\" and \"the statement was not made in response to questioning calculated to lead the minor to make a particular statement and was not the product of improper suggestion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775545,11296751\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/1148/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"775545,11296751\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/641/1148/\">\n    at 1153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Given the potential issues with forensic interviews of extremely young children-issues which were admitted by CYS' own expert as well as the ALJ-the testimony of Lytton should not have been allowed absent production of the videotaped interview. Because the videotape was not provided, on this basis, I would vacate the decision and remand for its introduction and evidence that goes to the forensic interview that Lytton conducted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-303\">\n    At the time the conduct at issue occurred here, Section 6303 of the CPS Law defined \"child abuse\" as, among other things, \"[a]n act ... by a perpetrator which causes ... sexual abuse or sexual exploitation of a child under 18 years of age.\" In turn, Section 6303 defined \"sexual abuse or exploitation\" as, among other things: \"[t]he employment, use, persuasion, inducement, enticement or coercion of a child to engage in or assist another individual to engage in sexually explicit conduct.
