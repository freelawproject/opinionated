Rieffel, appeal from the summary judgment rendered on their complaint in favor of the defendants, Penelope D. Johnston-Foote, Rayh Foote, also known as Ray Foote, Diane Jones, Michael B. Jones, Dan Tredwell, Lucinda Tredwell, Sue Baker, Attorney Daniel W. Moger, Jr., Daniel W. Moger, LLC, the Penelope Johnston-Foote Family Qualified Personal Residence Trust (trust), and LWT Associates, LLC (LLC).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In their complaint, the plaintiffs sought damages for vexatious litigation and abuse of process against several of their neighbors individually (Johnston-Foote, Foote, the Tredwells, the Joneses, and Baker), the owners of property on which certain neighbors resided (the trust and the LLC), the neighbors' attorney (Moger) and his law firm (Daniel W. Moger, LLC), for having filed a forcible entry and detainer action against the plaintiffs, which subsequently was withdrawn.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the\n   plaintiffs claim that in rendering summary judgment in the defendants' favor the court improperly concluded that (1) the attorney defendants had probable cause to pursue the underlying forcible entry and detainer action; (2) the affidavits of several of the neighbor defendants were competent evidence of their special defense to the vexatious litigation counts of reliance on the advice of counsel; (3) the trust and the LLC were not properly named as defendants because they were not parties to the underlying forcible entry and detainer action; and (4) the defendants' pursuit of the underlying action was not an abuse of process because the exclusive remedy available to the neighbor defendants was an action to quiet title. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Evidence of the following facts appears in the record. The plaintiffs and the individual neighbor defendants all live in a secluded neighborhood on a private road, known as Thrushwood Road, off of Indian Head Road in the Riverside section of Greenwich. An unnamed right-of-way and a portion of Thrushwood Road are located on the land of the plaintiffs. For purposes of the summary judgment action and this appeal, rights of ingress and egress to the respective residences of the individual neighbor defendants over the unnamed right-of-way and Thrushwood Road are conceded by the plaintiffs. Near the head of Thrushwood Road, a small open shed or wooden stanchion, located on the plaintiffs' property, contained the mailbox of the\n   plaintiffs and four mailboxes of the individual neighbor defendants. The individual neighbor defendants' mailboxes had existed at this particular location for periods of time ranging from ten years to more than forty years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In an undated letter addressed to \"Dear Neighbors,\" Bich-Ha Henriette Rieffel demanded that the individual\n   neighbor defendants remove the stanchion and their mailboxes on or before November 27, 2012. On or about December 10, 2012, the plaintiffs served several of the neighbor defendants with a \"Notice of Termination of License,\" informing them that their \"license and privilege to maintain a mailbox ... on the property owned by [the plaintiffs] ... is hereby terminated....\" The notice advised the neighbor defendants that their license terminated as of December 17, 2012, and that the mailboxes and the stanchion should be removed by the close of the business day on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The individual neighbor defendants objected to the plaintiffs' demands and retained Moger in December, 2012, to protect their interests. Between December 17, 2012, and January 8, 2013, counsel for the plaintiffs and Moger exchanged correspondence regarding the dispute. On or about January 25, 2013, the plaintiffs removed the four mailboxes and the stanchion; the mailboxes of the individual neighbor defendants were left in the driveways of their respective properties. After Moger recommended to his clients the institution of a forcible entry and detainer action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43, the individual neighbor defendants authorized the action against the plaintiffs. An unsigned summons and complaint was presented to a judge, who signed the summons on January 29, 2013. Service subsequently was made on the plaintiffs. A court date of February 7, 2013, was set at the housing session of the Superior Court in Norwalk. On that date, the housing court judge apparently expressed some doubts about the strength of the case, and the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment. Another court date was set, but, after consulting with his clients, Moger withdrew the entry and detainer action on February 19, 2013.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 6, 2013, the plaintiffs commenced this action against the attorney defendants and the individual neighbor defendants who had been plaintiffs in the forcible entry and detainer action. In addition, the trust and the LLC were named as defendants although they were not parties to the forcible entry and detainer action. The complaint contained twenty-four counts. Each of the individual neighbor defendants, the trust, and the LLC were sued for common-law vexatious litigation, statutory vexatious litigation pursuant to both General Statutes \u00a7 52-568(1) and (2),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   common-law abuse of process, and common-law abuse of process with malice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The attorney defendants\n   were sued for\n   common-law vexatious litigation, statutory vexatious litigation pursuant to \u00a7 52-568(1) and (2), and common-law abuse of process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   All of the defendants filed answers denying the essential allegations of the plaintiffs' complaint. The neighbor defendants all pleaded the special defense of reliance upon the advice of counsel. Subsequently, all of the defendants filed motions for summary judgment accompanied by supporting memoranda of law and affidavits. The attorney defendants also annexed exhibits to their motion, on which, in addition to Moger's affidavit, the neighbor defendants additionally relied. The plaintiffs responded, objecting to the granting of summary judgment, with memoranda and counteraffirmations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court, by memorandum of decision,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   granted the motion for summary judgment filed by the attorney defendants after determining that the evidence presented by the parties, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, failed to establish a genuine issue as to any material fact and that, as a result, the attorney defendants were entitled to judgment in their favor as a matter of law. The court first determined that the evidence did not reveal the existence of a genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the attorney defendants had probable cause to recommend to clients and to commence the forcible entry and detainer action against the plaintiffs. On the basis of the evidence before it, the court determined that such probable cause existed. The court stated that \"[t]he\n   existence of probable cause eliminates the major necessary predicate for the various vexatious suit claims asserted by the plaintiffs....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Next, the court determined that the evidence demonstrated\n   that the attorney defendants did not abuse process because the forcible entry and detainer action was not instituted for a purpose for which such an action was not designed, thereby rejecting the plaintiffs' claim that the attorney defendants actually intended to bring a quiet title action. The court determined that what was sought only was the retention of the neighbor defendants' claimed possessory rights to their mailboxes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, the court determined that the plaintiffs, in their abuse of process claims against the attorney defendants, had failed to allege or prove that the attorney defendants engaged in specific\n   misconduct intended to cause specific injury outside the normal contemplation of private litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With respect to the motions for summary judgment filed by the neighbor defendants, the court, in a separate memorandum of decision, determined that the evidence presented by the parties, when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, failed to establish a genuine issue as to any material fact and that, as a matter of law, the neighbor defendants were entitled to judgment in their favor. The court determined that the evidence demonstrated that the neighbor defendants had provided Moger with any and all facts concerning the mailboxes, including their removal and placement on their properties, and that there was no evidentiary support for the plaintiffs' claim that the neighbor defendants' disclosure of facts to Moger was less than candid or incomplete.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further concluded that Bich-Ha Henriette Rieffel's affirmation, which she filed in response to the neighbor\n   defendants' motions for summary judgment, did not give rise to an issue of material fact with respect to her assertion of bad faith or malice against the neighbor defendants attributable to the removal of the mailboxes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On the basis of its assessment of the submissions before the court, the court then determined that the\n   neighbor defendants had established the essential elements of their special defense of advice of counsel to the vexatious litigation claims of the plaintiffs. Finally, the court determined that the individual neighbor defendants did not abuse process because they did not bring their action to settle or quiet title, as the plaintiffs asserted, and therefore did not use legal process against the plaintiffs primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it was not designed. The court rejected the plaintiffs' assertion that the only appropriate legal action was a quiet title action pursuant to \u00a7 47-31 and that, as it had discussed in its decision on the attorney defendants' motion for summary judgment, the forcible entry and detainer action was not clearly a frivolous claim. In rendering summary judgment in favor of the trust and the LLC, the court observed that there was no support for the plaintiffs' claims that, along with the individual neighbor defendants, the trust and the LLC had initiated the underlying forcible entry and detainer action against the plaintiffs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As previously stated, the plaintiffs claim on appeal that in rendering summary judgment in the defendants' favor, the court improperly concluded that (1) the attorney defendants had probable cause to pursue the underlying forcible entry and detainer action; (2) the affidavits of the individual neighbor defendants were competent evidence of their special defense to the vexatious litigation counts of advice of counsel; (3) the trust and the LLC were not properly named as defendants because they were not parties to the underlying forcible entry and detainer action; and (4) the defendants' pursuit of the underlying action was not an abuse of process because the exclusive remedy available to the neighbor defendants was an action to quiet title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Our standard of review of a trial court's ruling on a motion for summary judgment is well established. \"Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent.... When documents submitted in support of a motion for summary judgment fail to establish that there is no genuine issue of material fact, the nonmoving party has no obligation to submit documents establishing the existence of such an issue.... Once the moving party has met its burden, however, the opposing party must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue. ... It is not enough, however, for the opposing party merely to assert the existence of such a disputed issue. Mere assertions of fact ... are insufficient to establish the existence of a material fact and, therefore, cannot refute evidence properly presented to the court under Practice Book \u00a7 [17-45].... Our review of the trial court's decision to grant [a] motion for summary judgment is plenary.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   (Citation omitted; internal quotations marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bonington v.

The defendants, who are the owners or inhabitants of those five residences, protested the rather curt announcement by the plaintiffs, but the shed was removed, and the neighbors' mailboxes were left on their respective properties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Subsequently, the neighbors (now defendants, and referred to herein as the neighbor defendants) consulted with Attorney Daniel W. Moger, Jr., who advised them to pursue a forcible entry and detainer suit, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43, in the housing session of the Superior Court in Norwalk. With the neighbor defendants' consent, such a lawsuit was prepared and filed by Moger on January 29, 2013, on behalf of the defendants, and subsequently served on the plaintiffs herein. Shortly thereafter, on February 7, 2013, a hearing occurred in the matter before\n   <em>\n    Hon. Jack L. Grogins,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, at which time the plaintiffs presented a motion for summary judgment\n   dismissing the action. The hearing was adjourned without judicial action, although apparently Judge Grogins evidenced some skepticism of the entry and detainer claim. On February 19, 2013, Moger, acting for his clients, withdrew the lawsuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The plaintiffs' twenty-four page second amended complaint (Docket Entry 111.00), which is the operative complaint in this case, asserts claims of (1) common-law vexatious litigation; (2) statutory vexatious litigation pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568(1) (double damages); (3) statutory vexatious litigation pursuant to \u00a7 52-568(2) (triple damages based on malice); (4) common-law abuse of process; and (5) common-law abuse of process with malice against Sue Baker, the owner and resident of 81 Indian Head Road, against the Penelope Johnston-Foote Family Qualified Personal Residence Trust, Penelope D. Johnston-Foote and Ray Foote, the owners and residents of property known as 87 Indian Head Road against LWT Associates LLC Lucinda W. Tredwell and Dan Tredwell, owners and residents of property known as 89 Indian Head Road, against Michael B. Jones and Diane Jones, owners and residents of 93 Indian Head Road, and against Attorney Moger and his business entity. All of the defendants have moved for summary judgment dismissing the claims against them. This memorandum will discuss and decide the motions made by the neighbor defendants, namely, the Johnston-Foote family trust, Johnston-Foote and Foote (168.00), LWT Associates, LLC, and the Tredwells (177.00), Baker (179.00) and Michael Jones and Diane Jones (172.00). The plaintiffs have filed memoranda and two affirmations opposing the four motions (219.00, 221.00, 226.00, 228.00, 229.00 and 230.00). Moger and his law firm also seek summary judgment, and the plaintiffs oppose that motion, which will be dealt with in a separate decision. All motions were heard and argued on October 27, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   SCOPE OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \"In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Appleton v.

The Moger affidavit, dated February 14, 2014 (exhibit A to Docket Entry 157.00), includes information that he learned from consulting with his clients, such as the length of time certain of their mailboxes had been located at the covered stand (i.e., for up to forty years).

In their affidavits, the neighbor defendants state they gave Moger \"any and all facts surrounding the circumstances of my mailbox,\" including its removal and placement on their properties. Given the fact that their attorney was aware of how long each mailbox had been in the wooden shed or on the stanchion, it appears to the court that full and fair disclosure was made.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Verspyck v.

Therefore, it was clearly a question to be presented to a jury for resolution. Here, however, that is not the case because the court finds no evidentiary support provided by the plaintiffs that the neighbor defendants' disclosure of facts to Attorney Moger was less than candid or incomplete.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   The issue of malice or bad faith is adverted to mainly in Mrs. Rieffel's affirmation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   In that document (found at Docket Entry 228.00), particularly in paragraph 19, Mrs. Rieffel specifies numerous incidents and occurrences during her residence on Thrushwood Road that in her words \"allow an inference of malice on the part of the [neighbor] defendants [and if reported to Attorney Moger] allow an inference of malice attributable to Attorney Moger....\" Rieffel Affirmation, \u00b6\u00b6 19 and 20. The court concludes that Mrs. Rieffel's affirmation does not provide an evidentiary basis for an assertion of bad faith or malice against the neighbor defendants. For the most part, the complaints described by Mrs. Rieffel evidence a prickly relationship with the neighbor defendants after the Rieffels moved to the Thrushwood Lane area in June, 2012. How much of this state of affairs resulted from Mrs. Rieffel's undated and somewhat peremptory letter stating that the neighbor defendants' mailboxes would be removed from her property by November 27, 2012, is unknown. Docket Entry 213.00, exhibit 24. At least one such complaint by Mrs. Rieffel seems highly overstated in describing a note left on her driveway as \"threatening\" when the note asked\n   her to \"please fill in the hole in our driveway. Your neighbor.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=643%20A.2d%201226\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   exhibit 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   The court turns to the five \"essential\" elements of the advice of counsel defense. There is no material fact in question that the neighbor defendants did consult with Attorney Moger about instituting the entry and detainer action. This is confirmed in the affidavits of Attorney Moger and various neighbor defendants, and there is no evidence to the contrary. Second, these affidavits evidence full disclosure by the clients, and there is no evidentiary basis for Mrs. Rieffel's hints to the contrary. The plaintiffs' counsel's suggestion that because the neighbor defendants' affidavits employ the same language there must have been collusion is not evidence that the affidavits are untrue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The court is not aware of any evidence that Attorney Moger was not an attorney from whom the neighbor defendants could receive an accurate, impartial opinion on the merits of their claim, and the plaintiffs do not contend otherwise. E.g., Opposition to Johnston-Foote motion (Docket Entry 230.00), p. 19. The fourth element requires the neighbor defendants to have actually relied on Attorney Moger's advice. There has been no evidentiary basis offered by the plaintiffs to create a material fact issue about this element, and obviously the neighbor defendants did rely on Moger's advice by consenting to the commencement of the forcible entry and detainer action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   The fifth element is whether reliance by the neighbor defendants on Moger's advice was in good faith. The plaintiffs' opposition to the neighbor defendants' motions is focused on the arguments made at pp. 41-45 of the plaintiffs' brief opposing Attorney Moger's summary judgment motion. See Docket Entry 230.00, p. 13. These pages are found at Docket Entry 218.00 (for some reason, parts of the lengthy memoranda are located\n   at Docket Entries 216.00, 217.00 and 218.00). But the arguments made therein are directed primarily at the lack of probable cause for the entry and detainer claim, and some statements made by Attorney Moger. Bad faith by the neighbor defendants cannot be established by asserting that their attorney did not have probable cause for the action or by other statements by the attorney.\n   <em>\n    Vandersluis v.

The neighbor defendants never sought legal title to the plaintiffs' real property, and to assert, as the plaintiffs do, that a quiet title action pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47-31 is the only appropriate legal action is incorrect. Indeed, as pointed out in the discussion of probable cause in connection with Attorney Moger's motion for summary judgment, the entry and detainer suit was not clearly a frivolous claim.

Moger, Jr., and his business entity, Daniel W. Moger, Jr., LLC (collectively, Moger), have moved for summary judgment dismissing claims of common-law and statutory vexatious litigation, pursuant\n   to General Statutes \u00a7 52-568, and abuse of process, contained in the second amended complaint of the plaintiffs. The background of this litigation involves the announcement by the plaintiff Mrs. Bich-Ha Henriette Rieffel of plans to remove a shed or stanchion located on the plaintiffs' property containing the plaintiffs' mailbox and those of five neighboring residences, leaving the appropriate mailbox on each neighbor's driveway, and then carrying out that plan in spite of the unanimous objections of the neighbors. The plaintiffs and the neighbors all own residences on a private road known as Thrushwood Road, off of Indian Head Road, in the Riverside section of Greenwich, Connecticut. The neighbors, all of whom are also defendants in this case, retained Moger to protect their interests. After certain communications between Moger and the plaintiffs' attorney, and the filing by the plaintiffs of a notice of termination of any rights the neighbors had in the former location of their mailboxes (Moger Affidavit, exhibit A-5, found as exhibit A to Docket Entry 157.00), Moger recommended to his clients the institution of a legal action against the plaintiffs pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 47a-43.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The neighbors authorized the suit\n   against the plaintiff Mr. Marc A. Rieffel, and Mrs. Rieffel; the unsigned summons and complaint was presented to Judge William J. Wenzel, who signed the summons on January\n   29, 2013, and that summons and the complaint, signed by Moger, were served on the Rieffels thereafter, and a court date of February 7, 2013, was set at the housing session in Norwalk. On that date,\n   <em>\n    Hon. Jack L. Grogins,\n   </em>\n   judge trial referee, apparently expressed some doubts about the strength of the case, and a motion to dismiss was filed on behalf of the Rieffels. Another court date was set, and in the meantime Moger consulted with his clients, and a withdrawal of the entry and detainer case occurred on February 19, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The Rieffels commenced this action against Moger and the neighbors who were plaintiffs in the entry and detainer case (neighbor defendants). In addition, a family trust and an LLC were named as defendants, although they were not parties to the entry and detainer case. The neighbor defendants have also moved for summary judgment dismissing the claims against them, and those motions are the subject of a separate memorandum of decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   SCOPE OF REVIEW\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. \"In deciding a motion for summary judgment, the trial court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <em>\n    Appleton v.

There is no such evidence in the record that they sought any legal ownership rights to any part of the Rieffels' property. What was sought was retention of their possessory rights to the mailboxes on the Rieffels' property. Therefore, the assertion that \u00a7 47-31 is the proper action because the Rieffels say it is a statute \"allowing a landowner who is put out of possession to maintain an action asserting his title\" (Plaintiffs' Memorandum, p. 46) is simply incorrect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Mozzochi v.

The court concluded that\n    <em>\n     Bowman\n    </em>\n    provided a reasonable basis for Moger to consider bringing the entry and detainer action against the plaintiffs. Despite the plaintiffs' focus on the impropriety of the defendants' use of an action for forcible entry and detainer under these circumstances, the court was not required to decide the merits of the underlying forcible entry and detainer action in considering these motions for summary judgment. If, on the basis of the facts known to the attorney defendants, the filing of the prior action was objectively reasonable, the court necessarily determined that the litigation the plaintiffs were subject to was not unjustified. The following rationale is persuasive: \"When the court has made such a determination, there is no persuasive reason to allow the plaintiff to go forward with its tort action even if it can show that its adversary's attorney did not perform as thorough an investigation or as complete a legal research job as a reasonable attorney may have conducted. Permitting recovery on such a basis would provide the plaintiff with a windfall; since the prior action was objectively tenable, the plaintiff could properly have been put to the very same burden of defense if its adversary had simply hired more thorough counsel.\"\n    <em>\n     Rockwell v.

The first argument seems strained not only because the statute requires the judge to issue the summons \"forthwith,\" intimating a certain lack of discretion, but also because Moger signed the complaint and arranged for service on the Rieffels. Moger Affidavit, \u00b6 20. The second argument might have some merit, as the law requires both initiation and prosecution. Nevertheless, almost three weeks passed from initiation and withdrawal, so, at best for Moger, it is a close question.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
