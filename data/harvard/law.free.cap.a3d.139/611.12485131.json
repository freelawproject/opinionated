A truck being driven by an employee of the defendant's insured, Tony's Long Wharf Transport, LLC (Tony's), collided with a car being driven by the plaintiff, causing the plaintiff injuries. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against Tony's for negligence, and the judgment remains unpaid. The plaintiff sought to collect the unpaid judgment from the defendant, Tony's insurer, but the defendant denied responsibility under its policy with Tony's. The parties disagree whether the MCS-90 endorsement included in Tony's policy applies only to liability arising during\n   <em>\n    interstate\n   </em>\n   transportation, or whether it applies more broadly to liability arising from any accident caused by the negligence of a motor carrier with an MCS-90 endorsement on its policy, even if the accident occurs during an entirely\n   <em>\n    intrastate\n   </em>\n   trip. If the endorsement applies only to interstate transportation, the parties also dispute whether the particular trip at issue here was interstate in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We conclude that the MCS-90 endorsement does not apply to the accident at issue because it applies only to liability arising from the transportation of property in interstate commerce, and the accident at issue occurred while Tony's truck was on an intrastate trip entirely within Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Federal law requires certain motor carriers-essentially, companies that transport goods by motor vehicle-to maintain minimum levels of financial responsibility to cover liability arising from the motor\n   carrier's transportation of property in interstate commerce.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031139\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The defendant issued a commercial insurance policy to Tony's that included an MCS-90 endorsement. Tony's is a towing company based in New Haven that operates in Connecticut and New York. On the date of the accident, Tony's directed one of its employees in New Haven to drive to Hamden to pick up repair parts for its tow trucks from a dealer, and drive them back to its New Haven facility. Tony's intended to use the parts to repair tow trucks that would later be used outside of Connecticut. The employee drove one of Tony's trucks, a wrecker, to travel to the parts dealer. While traveling from New Haven to Hamden, the truck driven by Tony's employee collided with a car driven by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff sustained injuries during the crash. The plaintiff obtained a judgment against Tony's for negligently causing her injuries, but Tony's has not paid the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The plaintiff brought the present action against the defendant as a judgment creditor pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 38a-321, claiming that Tony's insurance policy issued by the defendant requires the defendant to pay the judgment. Although the policy did not list the truck involved in the accident as a covered vehicle on the date the accident occurred, the plaintiff has claimed that payment is nevertheless due under the MCS-90 endorsement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant denied that it was responsible for Tony's liability for the accident and moved for summary judgment. The defendant argued that the MCS-90 endorsement applies only to liability arising from the\n   <em>\n    interstate\n   </em>\n   transportation of property, and not to any liability for accidents occurring while the motor carrier's vehicle is on a purely\n   <em>\n    intrastate\n   </em>\n   trip. Under this interpretation, commonly called a \"trip-specific\" interpretation, coverage turns on whether the specific trip\n   at issue by the motor carrier was interstate in nature. According to the defendant, the accident at issue in the present case did not qualify because it occurred during a trip entirely within the state of Connecticut.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff objected to the motion. Disagreeing with the defendant's trip-specific approach, the plaintiff urged the trial court to adopt a broader interpretation of when the MCS-90 endorsement applies. The plaintiff argued that the MCS-90 endorsement covers a commercial carrier's liability for\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   accident caused by the motor carrier's negligence, irrespective of whether the particular trip was interstate or not, as long as the carrier had the endorsement on its liability insurance policy at the time of the accident. Alternatively, the plaintiff argued that, even if the MCS-90 endorsement applies only to interstate travel, the accident at issue here qualifies for coverage because it occurred while Tony's truck was en route to pick up parts that would be installed in trucks that would later move across state lines in interstate commerce.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The trial court rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendant. Relying on a case from the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,\n   <em>\n    Lyons v. Lancer Ins. Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884762\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/50/#p57\">\n    681 F.3d 50\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 57-60 (2d Cir.2012), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=133%20S.%20Ct.%201242\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1242\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=185%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20178\">\n    185 L.Ed.2d 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013), the trial court adopted the defendant's suggested trip-specific interpretation, and concluded that the MCS-90 endorsement applied only to accidents occurring while the motor carrier's vehicle was moving in interstate commerce. Applying the trip-specific interpretation to the undisputed facts, the trial court determined that the MCS-90 endorsement did not apply because Tony's truck was engaging in a purely intrastate trip to pick up repair parts when the accident occurred. According to the trial court, Tony's intention to install those parts into trucks that it intended to later use across state lines did not change the intrastate character\n   of the specific trip at issue. The trial court thereafter rendered judgment in favor of the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of the trial court to the Appellate Court, which affirmed the judgment on an alternative ground.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Martinez v.

Summary judgment is appropriate when the record before the trial court reveals that there is no genuine dispute of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=9%20A.3d%20347\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The material facts of the present case are undisputed; we therefore must determine whether, on the basis of those facts, the MCS-90 endorsement is inapplicable as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our analysis proceeds in two parts. We first consider whether the MCS-90 endorsement applies to liability arising out of any accident caused by the negligence of a commercial motor carrier, or only to liability for those accidents occurring while the motor carrier's vehicle is traveling in interstate commerce. Because we conclude that the MCS-90 endorsement applies only to liability for accidents involving vehicles traveling in interstate commerce, we then consider whether the trip at issue in the present case was interstate in nature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The text of the MCS-90 endorsement and its governing statutes and regulations suggest that the MCS-90 endorsement applies only to accidents occurring while the motor carrier's vehicle is traveling in interstate commerce, except in limited circumstances, described later\n   in this opinion, that are not present here. The MCS-90 endorsement requires the insurer to cover liability for a motor carrier's negligence in the operation of its \"motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of [\n   <extracted-citation index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031139\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ]....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.15\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , illustration I. The statute cited by the MCS-90 endorsement, however, does not directly explain which vehicles are subject to its requirements; instead, it commands the secretary to adopt regulations to create financial responsibility requirements that shall apply to liability for \"the transportation of property by motor carrier ... in the United States between a place in a [s]tate and ... a place in another [s]tate....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031139\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b). The regulations provide that they apply generally to \"for-hire motor carriers operating motor vehicles transporting property in interstate or foreign commerce.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a). The requirements apply to the\n   <em>\n    intrastate\n   </em>\n   transportation of property only when the transported property is hazardous in nature; there is no evidence in the present case that the repair parts were considered to be hazardous under federal law.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 387.3(b). Given the statutory and regulatory language limiting application of the financial security requirements to the\n   <em>\n    interstate\n   </em>\n   transportation of property, with the exception of hazardous materials, it follows that those requirements do not apply to wholly\n   <em>\n    intrastate\n   </em>\n   transportation and, consequently, that a motor carrier's vehicle traveling in intrastate commerce is not \"subject to the financial security requirements\" of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2031139\">\n    49 U.S.C. \u00a7 31139\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -a necessary condition for coverage under the MCS-90 endorsement.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.15\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , illustration I.

Although the plaintiff's suggested interpretation of the MCS-90 endorsement might be simpler to apply, and could potentially bring relief to a greater number of persons injured in accidents on the highway (albeit at the expense of motor carriers and their insurers), we are not at liberty to disregard the approach adopted by the Second Circuit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Additionally, we observe that, although the \"trip-specific\" interpretation limits the application of federally mandated insurance coverage to trips that are interstate in nature, the states nevertheless remain free to create their own regulations governing insurance requirements for motor carrier transportation within their state borders. See, e.g., T. Hershewe, \"Hiding in Plain Sight,\" 51 Trial 46, 48-49 (February 2015). In fact, Connecticut has adopted regulations that generally mirror the federal regulations and that apply to motor carriers engaging in intrastate travel. See Regs., Conn. State Agencies \u00a7 14-163c-1 et seq. Connecticut's regulations impose more stringent requirements for triggering coverage requirements than the federal regulations, and neither party has argued that Connecticut's regulations apply in the present case. See id.; see also 2 M. Leizerman, Litigating Truck Accident Cases (2015) \u00a7 16:8, pp. 523-24 (summarizing Connecticut's regulations that roughly parallel federal motor carrier regulations). If policy considerations dictate that insurance mandates for motor carriers should be extended to intrastate travel, that extension must come from state agencies and the legislature, not through an expansion by this court of the meaning of federal law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We therefore conclude that the MCS-90 endorsement covers liability for a motor carrier's negligence only when the liability arises while the motor carrier's vehicle involved in the accident is engaged in the transportation of property in interstate commerce at the time the accident occurs. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We next consider whether the truck at issue was transporting property in interstate commerce when the accident occurred. The parties do not dispute that the accident occurred during a trip within Connecticut. Nevertheless, the plaintiff argues that the trip should be considered as interstate transportation because it was one leg of a broader interstate movement of goods, in this case, the movement of the repair parts that Tony's truck was en route to pick up when the accident occurred. According to the plaintiff: Tony's\n   truck was traveling to Hamden to pick up the repair parts at the time of the accident; those repair parts were to be installed into Tony's tow trucks; and Tony's intended to use those tow trucks at a later date to cross state lines as part of its towing business. The plaintiff contends, therefore, that the travel to Hamden to pick up the repair parts was the first leg of a continuous interstate journey for the repair parts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant disagrees and argues that, for purposes of applying the MCS-90 endorsement, any later movement of the repair parts after their installation into other vehicles must be considered a separate trip from the one at issue in the present case.

We are not persuaded by the plaintiff's argument that the trip at issue was part\n   of a larger interstate movement. Any later movement of the repair parts after their installation into tow trucks would be part of a new and distinct trip. The intended installation of the repair parts into other trucks would substantially alter the \" 'character, utility, and value' \"; id.; of the repair parts. Once installed, the repair parts would, for all practical purposes, no longer be considered individual parts, but would become an integral part of another commodity-Tony's tow trucks.

The MCS-90 provides in relevant part: \"In consideration of the premium stated in the policy to which this endorsement is attached, the insurer (the company) agrees to pay, within the limits of liability described herein, any final judgment recovered against the insured for public liability resulting from negligence in the operation, maintenance or use of motor vehicles subject to the financial responsibility requirements of [\u00a7\u00a7] 29 and\n   30 of the [act]\n   <em>\n    regardless of\n   </em>\n   ...\n   <em>\n    whether or not such negligence occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the insured or elsewhere\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.15\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , illustration I.

Rather than include such language, however, the MCS-90 contains broad language providing that it applies regardless of the route on which negligence occurs, which reasonably encompasses an accident that occurs during an intrastate trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Heron v.

In addition, I would add that the phrase \"regardless of ... whether or not such negligence occurs on any route or in any territory authorized to be served by the insured or elsewhere\" in the MCS-90 must be read to enlarge insurance coverage, not restrict it.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.15\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Certainly, there is nothing in this language that would lead a court to mandate a trip-specific\n   approach when determining the existence of coverage under the MCS-90.

The courts that have adopted a trip-specific\n   approach to determine the applicability of liability coverage under the MCS-90 have done so by reasoning that the MCS-90 does not apply if the accident at issue occurred during a wholly intrastate trip.

If the nature of the trip determined whether a motor carrier was \"for-hire\" as contemplated by \u00a7 387.3(a), the definition of \"[f]or-hire carriage\" set forth in \u00a7 387.5 would have used the term \"act\" rather than the term \"business.\" Therefore, I would conclude that the nature of the motor carrier's business, rather than the nature of the trip determines whether the \"for-hire\" element of \u00a7 387.3(a) is satisfied in a particular case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the policy underlying the enactment of the act fortifies my understanding of the MCS-90.

In my view, the majority's application of a trip-specific approach to determine liability coverage under the MCS-90 is at odds with the express policy underlying the act and the purpose of the MCS-90. It would be contrary to the remedial purpose of the act to apply a trip-specific approach, which\n   <em>\n    decreases\n   </em>\n   rather than increases the instances when coverage under the MCS-90 is triggered.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Furthermore, although I agree with the majority that it is a well settled principle of our court that the \"[d]ecisions of the [United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit], [though] not binding on us, are particularly persuasive\" when resolving issues of federal law;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    Turner v.

Ordinarily, I would follow the reasoning of the Second Circuit; however, it is my strong opinion that my interpretation of the relevant federal regulations in the present case furthers the purpose of the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   In my view, the trip-specific approach creates uncertainty with respect to the applicability of the MCS-90 and, thus, increases costs for both the court and the litigants by requiring that each case be decided upon its own specific facts. The majority, however, endorses this approach and explains that \"a trip within only one state may nevertheless be considered interstate in nature if the trip is one leg of a continuous interstate movement of goods.\" The majority further states that \"a brief pause in the movement of goods ... will not mark the beginning of a new trip for the purposes of motor carrier regulations....\" It is my opinion that, because the trip-specific approach focuses on each specific trip made by a motor carrier, its resolution leads to an unworkable case-by-case analysis, which often involves a fact intensive analysis of whether the shipper intended to travel interstate. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bilyou v. Dutchess Beer Distributors, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11419310\" index=\"211\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/300/217/#p223\">\n    300 F.3d 217\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 223-24 (2d Cir.2002) ;\n   <em>\n    Roberts v.

Its application raises numerous questions about when liability coverage under the MCS-90 is triggered. For example, would there be liability coverage under the MCS-90 if the shipper intended to travel interstate, but was involved in an accident on his way to a stop that entailed several hours of loading, before ever leaving the state? What if it were required to\n   wait overnight for the vehicle to be loaded? Such artificial dichotomies should not be favored, especially when there is nothing in the act suggesting that Congress would have endorsed such an approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   My interpretation of the definition of \"[f]or-hire carriage\" in\n   <extracted-citation index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.5\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.5\n   </extracted-citation>\n   in this dissent, however, precludes\n   such a fact specific examination. In my view, assuming the weight of the motor vehicle is over 10,000 pounds; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    49 C.F.R. \u00a7 387.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1) ; there are only two inquiries that must be answered in the affirmative before the MCS-90 applies. First, was the entity or individual in the business of transporting property in interstate commerce? Second, did the accident at issue occur during a time that the authorized agent of the named insured was acting within the scope of his employment? If the answers to these two inquiries are in the affirmative, then I would conclude that the MCS-90 provides coverage for the accident at issue. This conclusion is supported by the requirement that a motor carrier be \"for-hire\" in order for it to be subject to the financial responsibility requirements of the act;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 387.3(a) ; and the definition of \"[f]or-hire carriage\" set forth in the federal regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 387.5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Contrary to the majority's conclusion, in my view, the vehicle operated by Tony's Transport was \"subject to the financial responsibility requirements\" of the act as required by the MCS-90;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7 387.15, illustration I; and, therefore, the MCS-90 provides coverage for the accident at issue in the present case. First, there is no question that Tony's Transport engaged in the business of transporting vehicles in interstate commerce. Thus, Tony's Transport was the owner of a vehicle that was subject to the financial responsibility requirements of the act and was required to obtain and have in effect the minimum levels of coverage set forth in the federal regulations.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20387.3\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at \u00a7\u00a7 387.3(a) and 387.7(a). Second, repairing tow trucks is a required part of operating a towing business. Accordingly, the employee of Tony's Transport was acting within the scope of his employment when he drove the vehicle to Hamden in order to retrieve motor vehicle parts to repair vehicles owned by Tony's Transport. Therefore, I would conclude that the vehicle that was involved in the accident in the\n   present case was operating \"for-hire\" within the meaning of \u00a7 387.3, and that, therefore, the MCS-90 provided coverage for the accident. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   In summary, I find nothing in the language of the act, the relevant federal regulations, or the MCS-90 to support a trip-specific analysis. The language of the MCS-90 and the relevant federal regulations is intentionally broad and should be read to support coverage. The decisions reached by the majority and the Appellate Court, in my view, frustrate the policy behind both the act and the MCS-90. Indeed, if an insured is engaged in the business of interstate shipping, such that compliance with the minimum levels of financial responsibility set forth in the federal regulations is required, it should not matter if the accident occurs during an intrastate trip.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   Therefore, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Pursuant to the federal regulations, all motor carriers that operate vehicles transporting hazardous materials are subject to the financial responsibility requirements of the act, regardless of whether the motor carrier is for-hire.

Neither party, however, contends that Tony's Long Wharf Transport, LLC (Tony's Transport), was transporting hazardous materials at the time of the accident in the present case, or that it was in the business of transporting such materials.
