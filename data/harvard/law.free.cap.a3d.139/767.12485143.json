This court stated that the jury reasonably could have found the following facts: \"The [petitioner] and the [victim] lived together in an apartment in Bristol.

After watching a baseball game on television at the home of the [petitioner's] brother, the [victim] began to drive both of them home. The [petitioner] insisted that he should drive because she was too inebriated to do so. He assaulted her physically to force her to relinquish the driving of the car to him. Instead of driving them home to their apartment, the [petitioner] drove to a desolate dirt road in Burlington where he resumed his physical assault of the [victim], removed her underclothes and engaged in sexual conduct with her. Eventually, the [petitioner] drove the [victim] to his mother's house in Bristol. The next morning he allowed her to drive herself home....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"[The victim] called the police, whom she accompanied to the dirt road where the [petitioner] had taken her.

As the habeas court aptly concluded, \"the restraint necessary, if any, for the [petitioner] to have assaulted the victim in this case was minimal in comparison to the amount of time that he held her against her will.\" Indeed, in its closing argument at the petitioner's criminal trial, the state argued that the restraint had begun prior to their arrival in Burlington. The state further argued that the petitioner had assaulted the victim in the car as they travelled to and reached the dirt road in Burlington. The state did not argue that any physical assaults occurred after they left Burlington. In fact, the state emphasized that the petitioner continued to restrain the victim long after he had ceased assaulting her: \"the\n   two of [them] remain[ed] in the car that night. And finally the following morning [the petitioner] [let] her go home.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The state's theory-which was supported by the evidence-that the restraint encompassed the entire period the victim was in the car after the petitioner started driving,\n   <em>\n    including the overnight period,\n   </em>\n   only confirms that the lack of the\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction was harmless. After the couple left Burlington, and after the assaults had concluded, the petitioner continued to prevent the victim's liberation for another several hours until morning. Thus, as the habeas court found, the petitioner \"forc[ed the victim] to remain in the car overnight at his mother's house\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the assault occurred....\" (Emphasis added.) This final, lengthy period of restraint-after leaving Burlington and lasting until morning-is overwhelming evidence of the petitioner's intent to restrain the victim's liberty for a longer duration than necessary to commit another crime. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Nelson,\n   </em>\n   supra, 118 Conn.App. at 861,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=986%20A.2d%20311\">\n    986 A.2d 311\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The fact that the petitioner drove the victim from one town to another further demonstrates that the restraint here was not merely incidental to the assaults.

Strong,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5766864\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/122/131/#p143\">\n    122 Conn.App. 131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 143,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=999%20A.2d%20765\">\n    999 A.2d 765\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (defendant's prolonged restraint of victim in car for more than one hour while forcing her to drive from one town to another not merely incidental to threats made before and during restraint), cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4344217,4343564\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/907/\">\n    298 Conn. 907\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%2073\">\n    3 A.3d 73\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Furthermore, the petitioner's prolonged confinement of the victim in this case reasonably could not be considered merely incidental to the assaults that already had concluded by the time he drove from Burlington to Bristol and forced her to remain in the car until morning. Certainly, by the time the petitioner restrained the victim in the car at his mother's house, a jury could conclude that the assaults had helped the petitioner to\n   restrain the victim. Conversely, no jury reasonably could conclude that the restraint at this point was incidental to any assault. Thus, this case-namely, one in which the assaults were incidental to the kidnapping-appears to be the converse of a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   situation. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v. Winot,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768355\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/753/\">\n    294 Conn. 753\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 764 n. 7,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=988%20A.2d%20188\">\n    988 A.2d 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   rule not applicable where, even if defendant's restraint of victim also could be found to have violated other criminal statutes, \"no jury reasonably could conclude that the kidnapping was incidental to [the] commission of those crimes, rather than the converse\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In sum, after reviewing all of the evidence presented, we do not believe that a rational jury, even if properly instructed, could find that the petitioner's restraint of the victim was inherent in, or incidental to, assault or any other crime. As a result, it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the failure of the trial court to give a\n   <em>\n    Salamon\n   </em>\n   instruction did not contribute to the guilty verdict and, therefore, was harmless. Accordingly, the habeas court properly denied the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    Count one, in which the petitioner alleged the ineffective assistance of trial counsel, is not at issue on this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-38\">\n    The respondent, the Commissioner of Correction, filed a return in which he asserted the affirmative defense of procedural default on the basis of the petitioner's failure to raise his claim at trial or on direct appeal. In his reply to the return, the petitioner asserted that his claim was not procedurally defaulted because he had good cause for failing to raise the claim previously and had been prejudiced by the trial court's failure to instruct the jury properly on the kidnapping charge. The habeas court concluded that the claim had not been procedurally defaulted. The habeas court's ruling on procedural default is not challenged in this appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-39\">\n    The petitioner held the victim against her will for somewhere between six and seven hours. Specifically, the evidence showed that the restraint commenced somewhere between midnight and 1 a.m. The victim testified that it was 11:30 p.m. and the petitioner testified that it was approximately 12:45 or 1 a.m. when he took over driving the car. When he finally permitted her to leave his mother's house several hours after he had co-opted the victim's car, the victim testified that it was starting to grow light outside, and the petitioner testified that it was approximately 7:30 a.m.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-40\">\n    As it relates to the kidnapping, the state argued the following in its closing argument at the petitioner's criminal trial. When the petitioner and victim left his brother's house, they were in agreement that they were going home, and the victim was driving. At some point during the drive, there was violence between them, the petitioner took over driving the car, and he decided that they were not going to go home. Instead, he drove them to the deserted dirt road in Burlington. As they travelled to Burlington, the victim attempted to get out of the car, but the petitioner prevented her from doing so. After they left Burlington, the petitioner still did not permit her to leave; rather, he made her remain with him in the car until he finally let her go in the morning.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    The victim testified that the petitioner hit her several times while he drove the car.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
