Dumaresq's (Acting Secretary) November 5, 2013 order reinstating Jones to his position as a teacher and professional employee from August 10, 2009 to December 15, 2010, and sustaining Jones' employment termination as of December 15, 2010. The District presents six issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the procedures the District used to terminate Jones' employment complied with the Public School Code of 1949 (School Code);\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) whether the School Code requires the School Reform Commission (SRC) to resolve before the issuance of charges that evidence existed that, if true, justified employment termination; (3) whether the District was required to present evidence that the SRC read or knew about the charges or the transcript of the employment termination hearing; (4) whether the August 10, 2009 letter imposed a suspension without pay upon Jones; (5) whether the SRC would have violated Jones' due process rights if it made a pre-charge determination; and (6) if the Court rules that there were procedural defects, whether the proper remedy is remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jones presents six issues for this Court's review: (1) whether the District failed to comply with the mandatory procedures set forth in the School Code when the District terminated Jones' employment as a teacher on August 10, 2009 without a hearing, and then belatedly held a hearing eight months later which also did not comply with the School Code, and finally resolved to ratify Jones' illegal employment termination another seven months later on December 15, 2010; (2) whether the failure of the District and the SRC to comply with the procedural safeguards of the School Code is a Due Process Clause violation of the United States (U.S.) Constitution; (3) whether the Acting Secretary erred when, on reconsideration, she changed Secretary of Education Ronald J. Tomalis' (Secretary) decision to sustain the illegal termination of Jones' employment as of December 15, 2010, when there was no legal basis\n   for such partial reversal; (4) whether the two year undue delay of the Acting Secretary in issuing her reconsidered Opinion created the appearance of impropriety and fatally compromised Jones' due process rights by inhibiting the impartiality of the tribunal; (5) whether the SRC met its burden of proof to sustain a charge of immorality where the SRC presented no unbiased witness who said that Jones' conduct offended the morals of the community, and whether the SRC Chairman improperly refused to allow Jones' witness, Eugene Woehr (Woehr), a department head at Dobbins Area Vocational Technical School (AVTS), to testify that Jones did nothing which rose to the level of immorality within the community, and that the allegations against Jones were, in his words, absurd; and (6) whether the Acting Secretary improperly took words and phrases from Jones' conversations with individual students out of context and purposefully reconstructed them in an inflammatory manner, without proper citation to the record, in order to rationalize the reversal of the Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Background\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The District hired Jones as a teacher and professional employee on September 1, 2002. Jones was a vocational teacher at AVTS for six years until the electronics program was discontinued at that location. During the 2008-2009 school year, Jones was assigned as a math teacher at Mastbaum AVTS (Mastbaum). On or about April 30, 2009, Mastbaum's principal Mary Dean (Dean) received a letter containing alleged statements Jones made in his classroom while teaching. The letter was signed by the project manager and three corps members of City Year Greater Philadelphia (City Year) that spent time in Jones' classroom working with him to help his students. City Year members include assistant teachers, tutors and mentors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In the City Year letter, the corps members related specific instances of Jones speaking unprofessionally to his students, including using foul language and inappropriate discussion topics such as sex.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 628a-630a. Upon receiving the City Year letter, Dean asked a school police officer to conduct an investigation by randomly selecting pupils from a list of Jones' students and asking them to write a statement about Jones. Seven students prepared written statements, five of which confirmed the allegations set forth in the City Year letter regarding Jones' speaking improperly to his students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   After Dean received the statements from Jones' students, she conducted an investigatory conference on June 1, 2009, which included Jones, Philadelphia Federation of Teachers (PFT) representative Evette Jones (PFT Jones), and the District's labor relations assistant Ted Bywalski (Bywalski). Jones admitted to making some of the statements, but asserted that they were taken out of context in some cases and were misinterpreted in others. He also maintained that he was trying to create an atmosphere of trust and rapport with his students.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the June 1, 2009 investigatory conference, Dean prepared an unsatisfactory incident report (SEH-204) and recommended that Jones' employment with the District be terminated. Jones sent a letter dated June 15, 2009 to Dean responding to the SEH-204, wherein, he apologized for his remarks and repeated that he was trying to build trust and rapport with the students, and that some remarks were taken out of context and misinterpreted while others were inaccurate and a misrepresentation of what happened in the classroom. Jones further stated that since he received the concerns from Dean and the City Year\n   members, he immediately changed his approach and apologized multiple times.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On June 24, 2009, Assistant Regional Superintendent James Douglass (Douglass) held a second-level conference regarding the SEH-204. In attendance were PFT Jones and Bywalski. PFT Jones spoke on Jones' behalf and stated that Jones apologized, that the tactic he used to gain respect of the students was not appropriate, that his comments were taken out of context and that he was dedicated to his students. After the June 24, 2009 meeting, Douglass recommended that Jones be discharged from his employment with the District.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   By August 10, 2009 letter, signed by the District Superintendent and the SRC Chairman, Jones was notified that the charges against him constituted \"a willful violation of or failure to comply with the School Laws of this Commonwealth, and other improper conduct such as to constitute cause pursuant to ... Section [1122] of the [School Code, 24 P.S. \u00a7 11-1122.]\" R.R. at 727a. The letter informed Jones that they would recommend to the SRC that his employment with the District be terminated, and that he had a right to request an SRC hearing. In the same letter, Jones was told that the District's payroll department would be advised to make the necessary salary adjustments. Jones requested a hearing which was held on April 16, 2010 before the SRC Chairman.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Thereafter, on December 15, 2010, the SRC resolved to dismiss Jones, effective August 14, 2009. Jones appealed from the SRC's decision to the Secretary. On September 13, 2011, the Secretary reversed the SRC's decision, reinstated Jones and ordered payment of any compensation that he lost due to his dismissal. On September 28, 2011, the District filed a petition for reconsideration (Reconsideration Petition) of the Secretary's order pursuant to Section 35.241(a) of the General Rules of Administrative Practice and Procedure, 1 Pa.Code \u00a7 35.241(a). On October 11, 2011, the District appealed from the Secretary's order to this Court. On October 27, 2011, the Secretary granted the District's Reconsideration Petition and issued a briefing schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On December 6, 2011, this Court denied the District's request to stay this matter pending the Secretary's reconsideration decision because the Reconsideration Petition was a ity. However, this Court construed the application for stay to include a request to remand the matter to the Secretary, and remanded the case to the Secretary with directions to consider the District's Reconsideration Petition within thirty days. On December 20, 2011, the Secretary granted the District's Reconsideration Petition. On November 5, 2013, the Acting Secretary reinstated Jones' employment from August 10, 2009 to December 15, 2010, and terminated Jones' employment as of December 15, 2010. The District and Jones appealed to this Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Jones' Non-School Code Arguments\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <strong>\n    Two Year Delay\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Jones argues that the two year undue delay of the Acting Secretary in issuing\n   her reconsidered decision created the appearance of impropriety and fatally compromised Jones' due process rights by inhibiting the impartiality of the tribunal. Jones cites\n   <em>\n    Lyness v. State Board of Medicine,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831237\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/529/535/\">\n    529 Pa. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1831237\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/529/535/\">\n    605 A.2d 1204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992), to support his position. The District rejoins that the delay did not constitute a due process violation because Jones did not allege harm or prejudice caused by the delay, and cites\n   <em>\n    Kinniry v. Abington School District,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7861684\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/673/429/\">\n    673 A.2d 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Pa.Cmwlth.1996).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Lyness,\n   </em>\n   the Pennsylvania Supreme Court held: \"Whether or not any actual bias existed as a result of the [b]oard acting as both prosecutor and judge is inconsequential; the potential for bias and the\n   <strong>\n    appearance of non-objectivity\n   </strong>\n   is sufficient to create a fatal defect under the Pennsylvania Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1210 (emphasis added). The appearance of impropriety in\n   <em>\n    Lyness\n   </em>\n   was specific to the non-objectivity of the board. Here, although there may have been a delay in the decision, the Acting Secretary was not involved in the SRC hearing or resolution.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   Thus, because she did not act as prosecutor and judge, there is not even an appearance of non-objectivity. Accordingly,\n   <em>\n    Lyness\n   </em>\n   is inapposite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Moreover, the\n   <em>\n    Kinniry\n   </em>\n   Court held:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   We have previously held that\n   <strong>\n    a petitioner seeking to establish that his or her due process rights have been violated bears the burden of proving that some harm or prejudice to his or her interests was caused by the delay.\n   </strong>\n   Here, [the petitioner] alleges only that the passage of time between hearing and final adjudication was too long; he has not alleged that he was harmed or prejudiced in any way as a result of the delay. Although we do not condone unnecessary delay in adjudicating the fate of a person's livelihood, without evidence that [the petitioner] suffered any prejudice or harm as a result of the delay, we cannot conclude that [the petitioner's] due process rights were violated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 433 (citation omitted; emphasis added).\n   <em>\n    Kinniry\n   </em>\n   controls the instant case. Because Jones has not offered any evidence that he suffered some prejudice or harm to his interests from the delay, we cannot conclude that Jones' due process rights were violated by said delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    Immorality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Jones next contends that the SRC failed to meet its burden of proof to sustain a charge of immorality because the SRC presented no unbiased witness who said that Jones' conduct offended the morals of the community, and the SRC Chairman refused to allow Jones' witness, Woehr, to testify that Jones did nothing which rises to the level of immorality within the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   This Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   Immorality is not defined in the ... School Code. Our appellate courts have defined 'immorality' as conduct that 'offends the morals of the community and is a bad example to the youth whose ideals a teacher is supposed to foster and to elevate.'\n   <em>\n    Horosko v.

To establish immorality, the school district must prove three elements: (1) that the alleged immoral act actually occurred; (2) that the act offends the morals of the community; and (3) that the act sets a bad example for students. The moral standards of the community will not be presumed; they must be proved by substantial evidence. Immoral conduct is\n   something more serious than unprofessional conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    McFerren v. Farrell Area Sch.

Further,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   [w]e have previously held that a school board's finding that a professional employe[e] was guilty of offending the moral standards of the community by his actions would not be disturbed on appeal if supported by substantial evidence....

In addition, our careful review of the record convinces us that \"a reasonable man, acting reasonably\" could have reached the decision made by the Acting Secretary, whose findings represent a fair and supportable amalgam of the whole.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=387%20A.2d%201006\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Several students and City Year corps members testified at the SRC hearing to the numerous incidents of unacceptable interaction between Jones and his students. Moreover, City Year corps members, who were not students and/or agents of the school, are a fair representative of the community and they were so offended by Jones' behavior that they wrote the letter that initiated the investigation into Jones' conduct. Finally, this Court cannot fathom how a teacher repeating and joining in his students'\n   <strong>\n    bad\n   </strong>\n   behavior can set a\n   <strong>\n    good\n   </strong>\n   example for the students. Accordingly, the Acting Secretary properly determined that the SRC met its burden of proving that Jones' conduct offended the moral standards of the community.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With respect to Woehr's testimony, because Jones has not developed this argument by providing case law or record evidence, we are precluded from addressing this issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Condemnation of Land for S.E. Cent. Bus. Dist. Redevelopment Area No. 1,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8384625\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/946/1154/#p1156\">\n    946 A.2d 1154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1156 (Pa.Cmwlth.2008) ( \"Arguments not properly developed in a brief will be deemed waived.\"). Notwithstanding, Woehr's testimony cited in Jones' brief is irrelevant to the immorality standard, i.e., in answer to the question \"[f]rom your experience working with [ ] Jones and observing him, do you think he is a clear and present danger to the school children of Philadelphia?\" Woehr responded: \"The idea is [a]bsurd! He is just totally not. He always has had the best interests of students at heart, always[.]\" Jones Br. at 31 (quoting Notes of Testimony April 16, 2010 at 177-178; R.R. at 535a-536a.) The issue is not whether Jones' conduct is a clear and present danger to his students, but rather, whether his conduct offends the morals of the community and is a bad example to his students. Because substantial evidence supports the Acting Secretary's finding that Jones' conduct constitutes immorality, we cannot disturb that finding.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Out of Context\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Jones also maintains that the Acting Secretary improperly took words and phrases from Jones' conversations with individual students out of context and purposefully reconstructed them in an inflammatory\n   manner, without proper citation to the record, in order to rationalize the reversal of the Secretary's decision. Specifically, Jones contends that his discussions and joking with students were taken out of context and improperly reconstructed to demonize him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   First, virtually all of Jones' statements contained in the Acting Secretary's findings of fact contain accurate record citations, those that do not, reference from where they were taken, i.e., the SRC hearing testimony of specific students. More importantly, in his brief, Jones does not deny that he made the statements, but rather explains them and admits to their inappropriateness. Specifically, Jones' counsel rationalizes:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   [ ] Jones made the mistake that many teachers do-he became too familiar with the students at times. They felt a bit too free to joke with [ ] Jones about such things as Viagra. That is normal in high schools because students see Viagra commercials on television and they sometimes joke with teachers. [ ] Jones, who is a jovial and friendly personality [sic], was willing to respond in a humorous way.\n   <strong>\n    That may be inappropriate\n   </strong>\n   but it is not immorality.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Jones Br. at 31 (emphasis added).

If that is what the District intended then it could have so communicated. Rather, the unambiguous words reveal finality and the District's intent to immediately discharge Jones. Moreover, the District's actions immediately after issuance of the letter in stopping Jones' pay with no statement beyond the words that the District recommends his immediate discharge further evidences a termination, not a suspension. \"[A]ssuming arguendo that there was ambiguity, doubtful language is construed most strongly against the drafter thereof.\"\n   <em>\n    Rusiski v.

In\n   <em>\n    Oxford\n   </em>\n   , the due process violation occurred when the board failed to provide an impartial and unbiased hearing and thus, the violation could be cured with a remand for a new hearing. In contrast, the Superior Court in\n   <em>\n    Swink\n   </em>\n   found that the school board's action in employer dismissing a tenured teacher without following the statutory procedure for employment termination constituted a\n   <strong>\n    fatal defect.\n   </strong>\n   The facts herein are similar to those of\n   <em>\n    Swink.\n   </em>\n   Notably, the\n   <em>\n    Swink\n   </em>\n   Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   Our appellate courts have frequently held that a valid and enforceable contract between a teacher and a school district could be created only by compliance with the strict requirements of the statute.

The board of school directors cannot be relieved of the consequences of its failure to observe the essential statutory requirements in dismissing a teacher any more than a teacher can be relieved from showing the vital and essential elements required to make a valid and enforceable contract between the teacher and the school district when such teacher seeks to enforce such contractual obligation.\n   <strong>\n    The procedure which the board adopted was irregular and fatally defective.\n   </strong>\n   There was\n   <strong>\n    no required statement of charges\n   </strong>\n   before dismissal,\n   <strong>\n    no proper notice of hearing\n   </strong>\n   before dismissal, and\n   <strong>\n    no recording on the minutes how each member voted\n   </strong>\n   after such hearing.\n   <strong>\n    The action of the board,\n   </strong>\n   and the affirmance of such action by the court below,\n   <strong>\n    must be reversed for want of compliance with the provisions.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 204 (emphasis added). Failure to follow the statutory mandatory termination procedures is fatal and requires reversal of the District's action as opposed to remanding (as in\n   <em>\n    Oxford\n   </em>\n   which involved the denial of an impartial and unbiased hearing). Here, the specific procedural defects are as follows. Pursuant to well-established case law, the District was required to pass a resolution that it had sufficient evidence to support Jones' employment termination prior to sending him a notice of charges and intent to terminate his employment. The District did not do so. Further, pursuant to the School Code, Jones' notice was required to be attested by the SRC Secretary. It was not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Most importantly, the date of Jones' notice of charges and hearing date was actually the effective date of Jones' employment termination because it expressly stated: \"This is to advise you that we shall recommend to the [SRC] that your\n   <strong>\n    employment with\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    t\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    he\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    District\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    be terminated effective immediately.\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    The\n   </strong>\n   [\n   <strong>\n    District's\n   </strong>\n   ]\n   <strong>\n    Payroll Department shall be advised to make the necessary salary adjustments.\n   </strong>\n   \" R.R. at 727a (emphasis added). The fact that his pay was stopped as of that date makes it undisputable that Jones' employment was terminated as of that date which is directly contrary to the School Code's requirement that a hearing pre-date the employment termination. Indeed, the required resolution took place\n   <strong>\n    after\n   </strong>\n   the hearing. As the\n   <em>\n    Swink\n   </em>\n   Court held: dismissing a teacher without a prior hearing violated the statutory procedure in effect at that time. These deviations from the statutory procedures constitute\n   <strong>\n    'fatal defects,'\n   </strong>\n   making the school board's dismissal an\n   <strong>\n    'illegal' act.\n   </strong>\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 203 (emphasis added).

Given our conclusion that the District failed to adhere to the mandatory provisions of the School Code when it terminated Jones' employment, and the precedential effect of this Court's decision on subsequent employment actions involving tenured professional employees by this and other school districts, we are constrained to reverse the Acting Secretary's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The Legislature enacted the School Code and provided \"explicit procedural safeguards\" that it\n   <strong>\n    required\n   </strong>\n   school boards to use when terminating the employment of a tenured professional.\n   <em>\n    Neshaminy Fed'n v. Neshaminy Sch. Dist.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782487\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/501/534/\">\n    501 Pa. 534\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782487\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/501/534/\">\n    462 A.2d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636 (1983). Our Supreme Court clearly and unambiguously stated that there must be\n   <strong>\n    full compliance\n   </strong>\n   with the provisions of the School Code in order to effectuate employment termination of a tenured professional. Were we to affirm the Acting Secretary's order, allowing her review to cure the District's non-compliance with the School Code, we would eviscerate the very statutory protections that the Legislature afforded tenured professionals, thereby contravening legislative intent. In essence, we would be amending the statute. This we may not do.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mohamed v. Dep't of Transp., Bureau of Motor Vehicles,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207730,4209510\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/615/6/\">\n    615 Pa. 6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4207730,7315583\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/40/1186/\">\n    40 A.3d 1186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012). We may not, and will not encourage school boards and other government entities whose decisions are subject to review to disregard their mandatory statutory duties based on the belief that their malfeasance will be cured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   For all of the above reasons, the Acting Secretary's order is reversed and the matter is remanded to the Secretary of Education with the direction to reinstate Jones and to calculate the compensation which he is due taking into consideration Jones' obligations to mitigate his damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <em>\n    ORDER\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   AND NOW, this 2nd day of June, 2016, the Acting Secretary of Education's November 5, 2013 order is REVERSED.

I write separately to reference an issue not fully developed by the parties: the consequences of\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review by the Secretary of Education. An argument could be made that\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   review by the Secretary could cure certain procedural problems which occurred at an earlier stage of teacher termination proceedings. However, the School District does not\n   make that argument. Accordingly, I need not address it in this case. Hopefully, the result here will clarify procedures to be followed in the future in the Philadelphia School District when a professional employee chooses a School Code remedy over a collective bargaining agreement remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   Judges COHN JUBELIRER and McCULLOUGH join in this concurring opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Act of March 10, 1949, P.L. 30,\n    <em>\n     as amended,\n    </em>\n    24 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 1-101 -27-2702.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-141\">\n    No other SRC members participated in the hearing.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-142\">\n    \"This Court's standard of review of a decision of the Secretary of Education is limited to [the] determination of whether substantial evidence supports necessary factual findings, and whether an error of law or constitutional violation was committed.\"\n    <em>\n     Curl v.
