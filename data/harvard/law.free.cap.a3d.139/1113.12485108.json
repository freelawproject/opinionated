He was convicted, after a jury trial, on seventeen various counts, resulting in a cumulative sentence of 390 years in prison. Bey argues in this appeal that he is entitled to a new trial because of procedural\n   errors, including the implicit denial of an alleged request to discharge his counsel and the admission of certain demonstrative evidence and testimony regarding DNA, and, in any event, his sentence was improper in significant regard. We disagree with Bey on the first two contentions, but agree that his sentence was improper.\n   Therefore, he shall not receive a new trial, but rather is entitled to a new sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The female victim, a minor at the time of the sexual abuse and at trial, testified that the abuse, all of which occurred in the family home, began in 2010 and continued until about February 2014. She recalled that the first instance of abuse was in the summer of 2010 (when she was ten years old) when Bey, the victim's putative father, performed cunnilingus on her. After this initial incident, the sex acts\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   continued multiple times a week during the ensuing four year span.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 2013, the victim, believing she was pregnant, told some friends that she had been molested. Following revelation to Bey of her pregnancy concern, he took her to a doctor, who confirmed the pregnancy. Ultimately, she had the fetus aborted at the University of Maryland Medical Center. Donna Young, a nurse from the hospital, testified that the abortion was performed on 3 February 2014, when the victim was 14 years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After this procedure, the victim saw a therapist on 12 February 2014, whom she told about the abuse. The therapist reported the abuse to appropriate governmental and law enforcement authorities. An investigation ensued by the Frederick County Department of Social Services and the Frederick County Sheriff's Office. Detective Ronald Dement, a member of the Sheriff's Office, and Shannon Pulsipher, an investigator for Social Services, were responsible principally for the investigation by their respective agencies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The victim was brought to the Sheriff's offices to make a statement regarding the abuse. After recording her statement, including a representation that Bey forced her to perform oral sex on him earlier that very day, Detective Dement obtained promptly a search warrant to conduct a forensic sexual assault exam on Bey. Oral and genital swabs were taken from both Bey and the victim. Julie Kempton, a forensic scientist, concluded from testing of the swabs that, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, the victim's DNA was present on Bey's penis, according to her testimony at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Also analyzed for DNA evidence was the eleven week old aborted fetus. The fetal tissue was obtained by Detective Dement from Melissa Sheriff, a pathologist assistant for the pathology lab at the University of Maryland Medical Center, and delivered subsequently by him to the Sheriff's Office's property department. Sarah Shields, a DNA analyst, testified that, after conducting genetic tests, she was able to conclude, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, that Bey was the biological father of the fetus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The State introduced also a recorded jail telephone call in which an inmate, referring to himself as \"Speedy,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   admitted to\n   having his daughter perform oral sex on him. During this same phone call, the inmate requested the other party to the call to cause his backpack to be brought to him. When the law enforcement authorities intercepted Bey's backpack, additional evidence was uncovered from a cell phone found within. Detective Gene Alston testified that the cell phone contained data showing Bey's web history, which included visits to \"about 65 pornography web sites, more than a thousand times,\" between May 2013 and March 2014. Finally, Detective Dement testified that Bey asked him to tell the victim that he \"was sorry for everything that he had done.\"\n   A jury convicted Bey of seventeen of eighteen charged counts: five counts of sexual abuse of a minor, ten counts of a continuing course of conduct against a child, and two counts of third degree sexual offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court sentenced Bey cumulatively to 390 years in prison. Bey filed a self-represented Motion for a New Trial, received by the circuit court on 16 September 2014, asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. The Public Defender's office, which represented Bey at trial, appealed to this Court on 4 May 2015. Additional facts will be provided as necessary to our analysis of Bey's appellate questions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    QUESTIONS PRESENTED\n   </strong>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Appellant presents three questions for our consideration, which we rephrase here:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   1. Did the circuit court err in not granting Bey's request, made during trial, to discharge his counsel?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   2. Was a proper chain of custody established to allow the circuit court to admit properly the fetal tissue DNA evidence against Bey?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   3. Was Bey sentenced properly on multiple counts of continuing course of conduct with a child?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   For the following reasons, we hold that the circuit court did not err with regard to the questions directed to the conduct of Bey's trial, but hold that its sentencing of Bey, as challenged in his third question, was in error. Thus, we affirm the\n   judgments of conviction, but vacate the sentence and remand for a new sentencing proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Request to Discharge Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Bey contends that the circuit court erred in not granting his implicit trial request to discharge counsel when he stated that he and his attorney had a fundamental disagreement about the scope of cross-examination of the victim and that Bey believed his attorney was \"winging it\" generally during the trial to that point. The State responds that \"Bey did not make any statement from which the trial court reasonably could have concluded that he wanted to discharge his counsel.\" Moreover, because the alleged disagreement was over a matter of trial strategy, there was insufficient meritorious basis given by Bey for his complaint to be worthy of relief. Additionally, the State maintains that, due to the timing of any perceived\n   discharge request, it was within the circuit court's soundly exercised discretion to deny such during trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   How trial judges are obliged to address a defendant's request to discharge counsel made before trial commences is regulated by Maryland Rule 4-215(e). The Rule explains what mandatory action is to be taken by the circuit court when such a request is made and how appellate review is to be conducted.\n   <em>\n    State v. Hardy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    415 Md. 612\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 621,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    4 A.3d 908\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 913 (2010) (citing\n   <em>\n    Williams v.

When the request for discharge is made after voir dire and during the trial, however, this rule does not apply and we are asked instead to \"evaluate the trial court's ruling on a motion to discharge counsel under the far more lenient abuse of discretion standard.\"\n   <em>\n    Hardy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    415 Md. at 621\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    4 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   913 (citing\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the statement made by a defendant does not need to be an \"explicit request to discharge\" in order to be understood as a request to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The timing of a request, however, is rather important in the appellate analysis of the circuit court's eventual decision as to whether the request should be granted. In\n   <em>\n    Hardy,\n   </em>\n   it was made clear that the timing of the request determined whether \"the trial judge's consideration of that request is governed purely by its discretion, or whether it should be circumscribed by the procedural demands of Rule 4-215(e).\"\n   <em>\n    Hardy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    415 Md. at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    4 A.3d at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Appeals concluded in\n   <em>\n    Hardy\n   </em>\n   that Rule 4-215(e) \"does not apply literally once voir dire begins, and, therefore, the trial judge was not obliged necessarily to adhere to the Rule's strict procedural\n   requirements in considering [the defendant's] request.\"\n   <em>\n    Hardy,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    415 Md. at 624\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3694660\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/415/612/#p621\">\n    4 A.3d at 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

His comments about disagreeing with his attorney as to questions to put to the victim during cross-examination came between conclusion of the direct examination and before potential cross-examination of her. At this point, disposition of any request to discharge counsel would be within the circuit court's sound exercise of its discretion. The established rule in Maryland is \"[g]enerally, the longer the defendant waits to request discharge of counsel, the stronger the rationale must be to warrant counsel's dismissal.\"\n   <em>\n    Brown,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1999240\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/342/404/#p429\">\n    342 Md. at 429\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1999240,1999278\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/676/513/\">\n    676 A.2d at 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Bey's counsel brought his client's concern to the attention of the circuit court and explained why he was choosing not to cross-examine the victim. He believed\n   principally that to do as his client wished might destroy any possible sympathy for Bey (by risking being perceived as \"attacking\" anew the young victim) and that it was his strategy to focus on challenges to the DNA evidence linking Bey to the asserted sexual misconduct:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   COUNSEL: Your Honor, pursuant to our discussion Mr. Bey and I are having a fundamental disagreement on how the strategy of the case should proceed, particularly at this point of the, ah, trial about the cross examination of the witness that is still on the stand ... Practically speaking, um ... it is my opinion that cross examining [the victim] could have a detrimental effect.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bey's trial counsel explained that he had two main reasons for electing not to cross-examine the young victim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   [T]wo main reasons, one would be that it would give the State quite frankly an opportunity to perhaps clean up some of the testimony that [ ] I believe as we sit here was not fully elicited for some of the charges. Furthermore, there is going to be a recording of Mr. Bey from one of the jailhouse calls where he [ ] stated that he is going to break the witness down, meaning [the victim]. To the extent that there is a strain of sympathy or hope as we can relate our defense to the jury in this case, um [...] doing exactly what Mr. Bey had alluded to or said in the tape I think would do more harm than good in cross-examining [the victim].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On the record, the circuit court listened to Bey's explanation for his objection to the decision made by his attorney not to cross-examine the victim:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   THE DEFENDANT: He said character or, or reputation and that's what he said and that's not what my intention was. It was specifically regarding the, um, Ju-June 2010 incident as well as the, ah, area space that was in the upstairs floor where she said this incident happened at[sic], far as the space-wise. It was also, um, far as who was in the\n   household, far as if [the victim] needed assistance or anything of that nature, um, did I prevent [the victim] by any way from, ah, making commotion, kicking, screaming,\n   yelling or saying she needed assistance or did I refuse in any way by stopping her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   ...\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   [A]ll my questions is solely regarding the evidence that they had gaven (sic) me.

That, that I would, I would actually ask you to look over that because I feel as though just because [the victim] did not state a specific date that still does not, ah, ah, ah, um without a reasonable doubt or say that the ah, what the State is trying to prove course of conduct and the time period that she's trying to say that all this has happened. So due to the fact that, you know, the, the, the, the State got to prove their case and I feel as though the questions that regarding strictly to what they gave me is irr-is irrelevant.

Even assuming, as we do, that Bey's comments could be understood as a request to discharge counsel, the timing of Bey's comments placed the decision within the sound discretion of the circuit court of what, if any, action to take. The circuit court believed that Bey's concerns went only to his attorney's trial strategy (which strategy appears to have a rational basis for not cross-examining the victim, especially in light of the State's other evidence inculpating Bey, with questions that could be perceived by the jury as attacking her credibility as to whether the sexual abuse occurred wholly or in part as she testified on direct examination). Bey's tag-along generic and unsubstantiated description of his counsel as \"winging it\" generally is, without more, not a rational basis to discharge counsel in mid-trial, especially when counsel indicated he intended to focus ultimately on the scientific evidence linking Bey to the alleged misconduct. We cannot conclude on the record before us that the circuit court abused its discretion in not granting an implied\n   request to discharge counsel for the reasons offered by Bey.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    II.

Bey maintains that the lack of recollection by Melissa Sheriff, the pathology assistant, as to the name of the law enforcement officer to whom she gave the tissue sample does not satisfy the State's burden under the Maryland rules. The State responds that it established a chain of custody for the evidence because the container was marked and sealed.

The State set forth a chain of custody for the fetal tissue DNA evidence, based on the testimony of Detective Dement and Melissa Sheriff. Detective Dement testified that all of the forensic evidence, including the Sexual Assault Forensic Exams (\"SAFE\") and the fetal tissue were placed in sealed packages, with his initials and an identification number on it. When asked to authenticate the fetal tissue at trial, Detective Dement explained this chain:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   Q: Okay.

When Sarah Shields, a DNA analyst at Bode Technology, received the container, the seal was still intact. It is clear from this testimony that there was no reasonable opportunity for tampering to occur and that the State established properly a chain of custody sufficient to allow for the admission of the fetal tissue DNA evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Bey argues that Sheriff's inability to recall the officer's name is sufficient standing alone to disrupt the State's chain of custody. We disagree with this proposition because the State was able to provide testimony which showed that the container was labeled and sealed the entire time it was being transported between the tissue collection point at the University of Maryland Medical Center and the penultimate resting place in the evidence locker at the Frederick County Sheriff's Department. There is no evidence that tampering occurred. A tangential lapse in a witness's memory is not enough to\n   discount the chain of custody established by the State. The circuit court did not abuse its discretion by allowing receipt of this demonstrative evidence and the related testimony to be introduced at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

The State asserts that the language of Crim.

That case, however, applies specifically to the application of Maryland Rule 4-215(e). The Court of Appeals remanded that case to the trial court (affirming of the Court of Special Appeals's judgment) because the circuit court failed to ask the proper questions of the defendant to determine if there was a meritorious reason for dismissal or discharge of his attorney in a pre-trial context. The facts of the case before us are quite different, due to the timing of any \"request,\" as well as the circuit court's on-the-record discussion with Bey about the basis of his disconcert with his counsel.

Law \u00a7 3-315 is a choice that the prosecution elects to make; it is not a requirement under Maryland law. The State could choose to charge each individual sexual act and be burdened with the responsibility of proving specifically every occurrence of each sexual act alleged during the time frame. This statute provides relief to the prosecution from this challenging burden, made difficult inherently with younger victims who struggle with articulating exactly what sexual act occurred and with remembering the exact details and dates of each incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    At this hearing, because no issues with Bey's other convictions (for five counts of sexual abuse of a minor and two counts of third degree sexual offense) were raised before this Court, those convictions and one conviction for a continuing course of conduct under Crim. Law \u00a7 3-315 may be considered in fashioning a new sentence for Bey.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    The State argues also that each type of prohibited sexual activity may constitute a separate course of conduct. Thus, Bey was convicted of courses of conduct related to each rape, cunnilingus, and fellatio, even during overlapping time periods. The State supports this argument by reference to the disjunctive \"or,\" rather than the conjunctive \"and,\" in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-315(a). We do not think this argument floats the State's boat grammatically. Moreover, we find it implausible that the Legislature intended to treat the separate types of illegal sex acts as separate units of prosecution. Bey's convictions of course of conduct for each act must merge for sentencing purposes.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"14\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    Either because (1) one might read Crim. Law \u00a7 3-315(d)(1) as not requiring a prosecutor to charge all events as one course of conduct, but as allowing a continuation to charge and prove individual acts as separate crimes, so long as the acts fall outside a period charged; (2) one might attribute significance to the Legislature's apparent declination to include in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-315 an express limitation on charging more than one count of continuing course of conduct, despite its consideration during the relevant legislative session of model legislation from California and Arizona that contained such a prohibition (\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    Lynn McLain,\n    <em>\n     Reforming the Criminal Law: University of Baltimore School of Law Group Goes to Annapolis,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=34%20U.%20Balt.%20L.F.%202\">\n     34 U.

F. 2\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 9 &amp; n.99-100 (2003) ); (3) one might question the Legislature's purpose in establishing the 90-day minimum if the entire period of a defendant's conduct determines the course of conduct context; and/or (4) one were to conclude that it is more likely than not that the Legislature intended for prosecutors to determine the unit of prosecution, so long as the time period exceeded the statutory minimum.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n <opinion type=\"concurrence\">\n  <author id=\"p-98\">\n   FRIEDMAN, J., concurring.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   I concur. I join Sections I and II of the Court's Opinion without reservation. With respect to Section III, however, I conclude that Section III(b)(1) is but one possible interpretation of Criminal Law \u00a7 3-315, while n.14 argues for another (to me, more plausible) interpretation. Thus, I am persuaded that the statute is ambiguous and, therefore, subject to the rule of lenity.
