The defendant entered these pleas after the trial\n   court's denial of his motion to suppress certain evidence discovered following the execution of an administrative search warrant at his apartment. On appeal, the defendant contends that the trial court improperly denied his motion to suppress because the administrative search warrant was invalid and improperly executed. Specifically, the defendant contends that the administrative search warrant was invalid because it was: (1) issued without authority; (2) not supported by probable cause; and (3) improperly issued during an ex parte proceeding. The defendant further contends that the search was unlawful because excessive force was used during its execution. We disagree with the defendant's claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed facts and procedural history. The defendant lived in an apartment located in the basement of a building in the city of Stamford (city). That building was zoned and assessed by the city as a two-family residence. After receiving a complaint indicating that the building had several entry doors and three mailboxes, the city's Department of Health and Social Services (health department)\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   attempted to conduct an inspection, but was refused entry by the defendant. After two additional attempts to inspect the building proved unsuccessful, the health department presented an application for an administrative search warrant (application) to a judge of the Superior Court. The application included an affidavit signed by two inspectors from the health department, Marjorie Beauchette and Renford Whynes, stating that they had probable cause to believe that an illegal apartment existed in the building in violation of \u00a7 146-34(A) of the Stamford Code of Ordinances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The application noted, in particular, the possibility of an illegal apartment in the basement. The Superior Court judge reviewed the application in an ex parte proceeding, determined that probable cause existed, and issued the administrative search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Subsequently, pursuant to the health department's standard policy, Beauchette scheduled a date for the execution of the administrative search warrant by a team comprised of various city officials\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and two officers from the Stamford Police Department. During the inspection, the city officials observed that the first and second floors of the building contained a total of three apartments. In addition, the city officials noted numerous health, fire, and safety violations. Because the application\n   alleged the potential existence of an illegal apartment in the basement, and because there was no apparent entrance to the basement from the interior of the\n   building, the city officials searched for an exterior entrance. In the backyard, they discovered a locked, fenced area enclosing a staircase that led to a basement door. One of the police officers used a tool to break the lock on the fence, descended the stairs, and knocked on the basement door.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After a considerable period of time, the defendant opened the basement door and identified himself as the property owner.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The police officers informed the defendant about the administrative search warrant and asked him to secure his dogs. The police officers conducted a cursory safety check of the threshold area of the basement and then permitted the city officials to enter the basement while the police officers waited outside. One of the city officials observed what he believed to be a pipe bomb and informed one of the police officers of what he had seen. After inspecting the object, the police officer evacuated the premises and contacted the bomb squad. Upon arrival, the bomb squad X-rayed the object and determined that it did not contain any explosive material, but did include hex nuts and other metallic material consistent with shrapnel. The bomb squad also conducted a protective sweep of the basement and observed items in plain view that were consistent with bomb making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Consequently, the police officers obtained a criminal search warrant to search the premises for items related to bomb making. Pursuant to this criminal search warrant, the police officers seized the suspected pipe bomb, three computers, and other items related to bomb making.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Additionally, a second criminal search warrant was issued to search the hard drives of the seized computers, which resulted in the discovery of child pornography.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant thereafter moved to suppress the seized items on the ground that an administrative search warrant does not authorize the entry of police officers into a private residence and that a criminal search warrant pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-33a could not properly issue in this case. Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court issued a ruling from the bench denying the defendant's motion to suppress. In so ruling, the trial court concluded that the administrative search warrant in the present case satisfied the probable cause standard for a targeted administrative inspection and that the police officers had only a \"passive\" presence during the execution of the administrative search warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The defendant then entered pleas of nolo contendere to one count of manufacturing a bomb in violation of \u00a7 53-80a and one count of possession of child pornography in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-196d (a)(1), conditioned on his right to appeal the denial of his motion to suppress. See General Statutes \u00a7 54-94a. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   At the outset, we set forth the standard of review. \"[O]ur standard of\n   review of a trial court's findings and conclusions in connection with a motion to suppress is well defined.

In the present case, neither the state nor the defendant challenges the factual findings of the trial court. Our review, therefore, is limited to a determination of whether the trial court's legal conclusions-that the administrative search warrant was properly issued and that the subsequent search was properly executed-were legally and logically correct.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Before addressing the merits of the parties' claims, we begin by setting forth certain constitutional provisions relevant to regulatory inspections conducted pursuant to city ordinances. \"The fourth amendment to the United States constitution, which is made applicable to the states through the fourteenth amendment ... provides that [t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized....

Rejecting the notion that an individual's fourth amendment protections are merely peripheral in the context of a regulatory inspection, the Supreme Court\n   stated, [i]t is surely anomalous to say that the individual and his private property are fully protected by the [f]ourth [a]mendment only when the individual is suspected of criminal behavior.... Therefore, administrative searches of residences must comply with the fourth amendment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bozrah v.

Because the record is adequate for review, and the defendant's claim that the issuance of the administrative search warrant without authority violated his right against unreasonable searches and seizures is of constitutional magnitude, our inquiry focuses on whether the violation alleged by the defendant exists and deprived him of a fair trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Section 19a-220 provides: \"When any person refuses to obey a legal order given by a director of health, health committee or board of health, or endeavors to prevent it from being carried into effect, a judge of the Superior Court may issue\n   <em>\n    his warrant\n   </em>\n   to a proper officer or to an indifferent person, therein stating such order and\n   <em>\n    requiring him to carry it into effect, and such officer or indifferent person shall execute the same.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The use of the term \"his warrant\" necessarily implies that an administrative search warrant was contemplated by the legislature as a means of enforcing public health ordinances. The term \"his warrant\" is not defined in this statute or related provisions. \"In the absence of a definition of terms in the statute itself, [w]e may presume ... that the legislature intended [a word] to have its ordinary meaning in the English language, as gleaned from the context of its use....

Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) defines \"warrant\" as, inter alia, \"a precept or writ issued by a ... magistrate authorizing an officer to make an arrest, a seizure, or a search or to do other acts incident to the administration of justice....\" See also Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed.2011) (same). The American Heritage College Dictionary (4th Ed.2002) similarly defines \"warrant\" as, inter alia, a \"judicial writ authorizing an officer to make a search, seizure, or arrest or to execute a judgment....\" Applying the dictionary definition of \"warrant\" indicates that the legislature intended \u00a7 19a-220 to authorize the issuance of an administrative search warrant for suspected violations of local ordinances pertaining to the protection of public health.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The defendant nevertheless claims that \u00a7 19a-220 does not authorize an administrative search warrant. The defendant asserts that, unlike General Statutes \u00a7 29-305,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   which the Appellate Court has concluded\n   authorizes\n   the issuance of administrative search warrants for a suspected violation of a municipal fire code, \u00a7 19a-220 does not specifically reference a right of inspection or of entry onto private property.

We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The promulgation and enforcement of local health ordinances constitute a valid exercise of the state's police power. See\n   <em>\n    DeMello v.

This court has previously explained that \"[t]he abatement of nuisances and the enforcement of the public health code by municipal health officials ... [is] authorized by [what is now \u00a7 19a-220 ].... The promulgation of public health ... codes and the regulation and abatement of uses of property and nuisances [that] threaten the health and safety of the general public constitute legitimate subjects for the exercise of the state's police power. This power comprehends a system of internal regulation ... to enable people to live together in close association, preserving to each his individual rights and privileges but so controlling them that their enjoyment is reasonably consistent with the enjoyment of like rights and privileges by others.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%2071\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   \"The police power regulates the use of property or impairs the rights in property, because the free exercise of these rights is detrimental to public interest.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., at 679,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=368%20A.2d%2071\">\n    368 A.2d 71\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   This court has, therefore, recognized that the promulgation of municipal health and safety ordinances is a\n   proper exercise of the state's police powers. We conclude that \u00a7 19a-220 codifies that police power. When read in conjunction with the aforementioned dictionary definitions, \u00a7 19a-220 expressly authorizes a judge of the Superior Court to issue an administrative search warrant and requires \"a proper officer\" or \"indifferent person\" to \"carry\" that warrant \"into effect\" and \"execute the same.\" This explicit grant of authority amounts to a recognition of the state's inherent police power to protect the health and safety of the public and provides an enforcement mechanism for the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's contention, the absence of express language concerning a right of inspection or entry does not justify the inference that\n   \u00a7 19a-220 does not authorize the issuance of administrative search warrants. In fact, an examination of related statutes reveals that General Statutes \u00a7 19a-207\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   authorizes the city to adopt ordinances to promote the health and well-being of the public, so long as those ordinances do not frustrate the achievement of the state's objectives in this field. Pursuant to this authority, the city authorized the health department to inspect residential properties located within the city in order to ensure that they are maintained in accordance with the city's housing code. See Stamford Code of Ordinances, c. 146, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 146-5 and 146-6.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we conclude that the health\n   department has the statutory authority, pursuant to \u00a7 19a-207, to adopt regulations requiring the inspection of residential properties for violations of the city's housing code, and that \u00a7 19a-220 provides the means for the enforcement of the health department's inspection orders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Lastly, the defendant contends that if \u00a7 19a-220 applies, the statutory language contemplates the issuance of a restraining order, rather than an administrative search warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The defendant's interpretation is contrary to the plain language of \u00a7 19a-220. There is nothing in the language of the statute to indicate that the legislature intended to restrict the scope of \u00a7 19a-220 to the issuance of restraining orders. Instead, the term \"his warrant\" supports the conclusion that the legislature intended \u00a7 19a-220 to constitute a broad grant of authority to the judges of the Superior Court, a grant that reasonably includes the power to issue administrative search warrants as a means of enforcing local housing ordinances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It seems logical to believe that the legislature intended to authorize city officials to take reasonable steps, such as obtaining an administrative search warrant, to fulfill their inspection obligations under the city's ordinances. We conclude that the plain language of \u00a7 19a-220 authorizes the issuance of an administrative search warrant for suspected violations of local ordinances pertaining to the protection of public health when a property owner or occupant refuses to obey an order of inspection given by the health department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In the present case, the health department sent two notices of inspection to the listed property owner in accordance with the standards set forth in \u00a7 146-5 of the Stamford Code of Ordinances and was refused entry onto the premises on the scheduled inspection dates. Because the property owner and the defendant failed to obey the health department's order of inspection, the trial court had the authority pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 19a-220 to issue an administrative search warrant to carry out the health department's order. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   's third prong and that, therefore, his constitutional claim must fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The defendant next contends that, even if this court were to conclude that \u00a7 19a-220 provides authority for the issuance of an administrative search warrant, the warrant in the present case was invalid because the Superior Court judge\n   that issued it failed to apply the proper legal standard. Specifically, the defendant contends that an application for an administrative search warrant that targets a particular property must satisfy a standard of probable cause \"more rigor[ous] than would be applied to a search warrant ... in a criminal proceeding.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   We are not persuaded.\n   This court has previously decided the standard of probable cause that is applicable to administrative inspections that target a particular property.

The health department received a complaint alleging that there were several entry doors and three mailboxes on the outside of the building, which was zoned and assessed as a two-family residence. As a result of having received this complaint and having reviewed the city records, the health department believed that the property was being operated in violation of an ordinance prohibiting the operation of a \"multiple dwelling\" without an operating license.

On the scheduled\n   inspection date, the defendant refused to permit entry onto the property. The following week, the health department attempted to inspect the property without notice, but was unable to do so. A second notice of inspection was subsequently mailed to the property owner. On the scheduled inspection date, Beauchette and Whynes attempted to inspect the property, but again were unable to do so.

Beauchette and Whynes alleged in the application that they had personally observed three mailboxes, three entrances, and three different address numbers on the building.

The search and seizure provision in our 1818 constitution, then article first, \u00a7 8, closely resembles the\n   fourth amendment to the United States constitution. Although its enumeration was changed to article first, \u00a7 7, when the 1965 constitution incorporated article first, \u00a7 4, into article seventh, its language has not been altered since its original adoption.... The language of article first, \u00a7 7, which was based upon the fourth amendment, was adopted with little debate.... Thus, the circumstances surrounding the adoption of article first, \u00a7 7, lend weight to the view that, in most cases, a practice permitted under the fourth amendment is permissible under article first, \u00a7 7.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

LaFave. This treatise comments that\n   <em>\n    Camara\n   </em>\n   \"could have better protected the right of privacy by permitting the use of administrative warrants enforceable only after giving the householder an opportunity to be heard in\n   court.\" 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure: A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment (5th Ed.2012) \u00a7 10.1(d), p. 29. The treatise further concludes that \"adversary proceedings in advance of inspection can be had without risk to the government interests being pursued.\" Id., p. 28. For the reasons which follow, however, we are not persuaded by this reasoning and, instead, conclude that the imposition of an adversarial hearing requirement under the circumstances of the present case would be detrimental to the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   First, in\n   <em>\n    Bozrah v. Chmurynski,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174472\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/676/#p683\">\n    303 Conn. at 682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=36%20A.3d%20210\">\n    36 A.3d 210\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , we concluded that \"notwithstanding the trial court's characterization of its order as a temporary injunction,\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   the trial court's order that the municipality could search the property over the objection of the defendants was an \"appealable final judgment.\" Appeals from judicial orders enjoining individuals from interfering with an administrative inspection would greatly delay the orderly progress of administrative inspection schemes. Consequently, such a delay would hinder enforcement of municipal ordinances that were enacted for the purpose of protecting the health and welfare of the public.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, we disagree with the defendant's characterization of the violation at issue in this case as \"a relatively small problem.\" A violation of this seemingly minor ordinance could lead to harmful results. In the present case, the judge who issued the administrative search warrant determined that there was probable cause to believe that an illegal apartment could be found on the premises. As a result, that judge could have reasonably concluded that the health department would find more serious violations on the property, and issued a warrant that authorized a search for fire safety, housing, and building code violations. For example, the maintenance of illegal apartments may result in the overburdening of the building's electrical system and\n   such apartments are often heated with space heaters and ovens. These practices present serious fire hazards that can lead to significant property damage, injury, and death. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Enis v. Ba-Call Building Corp.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1361726\" index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/639/359/#p363\">\n    639 F.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 363 (7th Cir.1980) (tenant's practice of boiling water in turkey kettle on kitchen stove to provide heat in unheated apartment led to children's injuries when water from kettle spilled on them). Furthermore, illegal apartments may not have an adequate number of exits or operational smoke detectors, which could result in injurious consequences in the event of an emergency. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Zhan Tang Huang,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4073781\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mass-app-ct/87/65/#p66\">\n    87 Mass.App. 65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 66,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=25%20N.E.3d%20315\">\n    25 N.E.3d 315\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (man and two small children living in illegal basement apartment that only had one exit and lacked\n   operational smoke detectors died when fire broke out in building). While these situations do not rise to the level of an emergency or exigent circumstances, they demonstrate how delaying an administrative inspection, when there is probable cause to believe a housing code violation exists on the property, could potentially lead to disastrous results. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Kendrick,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20212\">\n    314 Conn. 212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 226-31,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20821\">\n    100 A.3d 821\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (explaining exigent circumstances and emergency exceptions to fourth amendment warrant requirement).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Lastly, we emphasize that, in the present case, the health department sent two notices of inspection to the property owner and attempted to inspect the property on those scheduled dates. The health department also made another attempt to inspect the property without notice and was unable to do so. Thus, this was not a case where the health department, upon receipt of a complaint, resorted immediately to the warrant process. Rather, the health department made reasonable efforts to place the property owner on notice of its need to inspect the property prior to seeking a warrant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Considering all of the\n   <em>\n    Geisler\n   </em>\n   factors, we conclude that the defendant's rights under article first, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution were not violated. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Lastly, the defendant claims that his rights under the fourth amendment to the United States constitution were violated because one of the police officers accompanying the city officials exercised \"excessive force\" when he broke the lock on the fence in order to access the basement door.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   In response, the state contends that the police officer acted reasonably when he broke the lock in order to enable the city officials to enter the basement and conduct their inspection.\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Officers executing a valid search warrant are still bound by the fourth amendment standard of reasonableness.

We now apply this balancing test to the facts of the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   First, as previously noted in this opinion, the city officials had a legitimate interest in inspecting the property\n   to determine whether there were any illegal apartments. See part III of this opinion. In the present case, after making unsuccessful attempts to obtain the property owner's consent to inspect, the health department obtained a valid administrative search warrant supported by adequate probable cause. See part II of this opinion. Evidence adduced at the suppression hearing supports the conclusion that the only way the city officials could determine whether there was an illegal apartment in the basement, as alleged in the application, was to break the lock on the fence enclosing the staircase that led to the basement. During their inspection of the first and second floors of the building, the city officials observed that there was no apparent entrance to the basement from the interior of the building. Consequently, they searched for an exterior entrance to the basement and located the aforementioned fenced area in the backyard. Thus, the police officer had good reason to damage the lock, as this action was necessary to carry out the search effectively.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Second, the intrusion on the defendant's fourth amendment rights was minimal. The police officer here broke a single lock on a fence that enclosed a staircase that led to an exterior entrance to the basement. Once he opened the fence's gate, the police officers then descended the stairs and knocked on the basement door. After knocking, the police officers and the city officials waited a considerable period of time before the defendant opened the door. The police officers informed the defendant about the administrative search warrant and asked him to secure his dogs before they conducted a cursory safety check of the threshold area of the basement. There is no evidence in the record that the police officers or the city officials\n   had a less intrusive means of entering the basement. Accordingly, weighing the purpose of the search-to inspect for conditions that may potentially endanger the inhabitants\n   of the building-against the extent of the property damage-a broken fence lock-we conclude that the manner in which the entry was accomplished was reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The defendant, nevertheless, contends that the administrative search warrant did not authorize the police officers to use force while accompanying the city officials during the execution of the warrant. We disagree. As the United States Supreme Court has stated, \"[n]othing in the language of the [United States constitution] or in this [c]ourt's decisions interpreting that language suggests that ... search warrants also must include a specification of the precise manner in which they are to be executed. On the contrary, it is generally left to the discretion of the executing officers to determine the details of how best to proceed with the performance of a search authorized by warrant-subject of course to the general [f]ourth [a]mendment protection 'against unreasonable searches and seizures.' \" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Dalia v. United States,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779836\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/238/#p258\">\n    441 U.S. at 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1779836\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/441/238/#p258\">\n    99 S.Ct. 1682\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   The defendant's final contention is that the administrative search should have ended when the city officials found an illegal apartment on the upper floors of the building.

The application requested the authority to search the premises \"to positively determine how many units [were] in the dwelling\" and specifically alleged that there was a \"possible illegal [basement].\" Furthermore, it was reasonable for the city officials to believe, upon discovery of an illegal apartment on the upper floors of the building, that there might be an additional apartment in the basement.

The defendant claims that the present case is distinguishable from those involving OSHA inspections because an OSHA violation could be concealed if the subject of the search received notice. Specifically, the defendant contends that evidence of municipal housing code violations is either of a continuing nature that cannot be concealed or could only be concealed by the desired remedial action, thus rendering an immediate ex parte hearing unnecessary. The defendant asserts, therefore, that the efficiency of inspections for violations of the city's housing code would not be impeded by the imposition of a requirement that an adversarial hearing be conducted in the event a property owner or occupant denies consent.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    We consider the situation presented in the present case to be similar in context to cases involving OSHA inspections. In both situations officials are authorized by statute to inspect private property for regulatory violations. Furthermore, we are not persuaded by the defendant's argument distinguishing OSHA violations from city housing code violations. Contrary to the defendant's contention, not all evidence of OSHA violations may be easily concealed. See\n    <em>\n     Marshall v.

See General Statutes \u00a7 51-286b (\"[t]he assistant state's attorney or deputy assistant state's attorney assigned to handle housing matters may initiate prosecutions for violations of any state or municipal housing or health law, code or ordinance either upon the affidavit of an individual complainant or upon complaint from a state or municipal agency responsible for the enforcement of any law, code or ordinance concerning housing matters\"); see also General Statutes \u00a7 47a-68 (6) (defining housing matters as \"[a]ll actions involving one or more violations of any state or municipal health, housing, building, electrical, plumbing, fire or sanitation code, including violations occurring in commercial properties, or of any other statute, ordinance or regulation concerned with the health, safety or welfare of any occupant of any housing\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"26\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    We note that, while there is no evidence that the defendant himself received notice of the scheduled inspections, the application specifically identified the defendant as the individual who refused to permit entry to the health department on the first scheduled inspection date. Therefore, the defendant was aware of at least one of the health department's attempts to inspect.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"27\">\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    The defendant has also alleged violations of state constitutional rights in regard to his claim of excessive force, but he has failed to provide an independent analysis of them as required by\n    <em>\n     State v. Geisler,\n    </em>\n    supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"546505\" index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/222/672/#p684\">\n     222 Conn. at 684-86\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=610%20A.2d%201225\">\n     610 A.2d 1225\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Contrary to the defendant's contention, his analysis under\n    <em>\n     Geisler\n    </em>\n    with respect to his previous claim that the issuance of the administrative search warrant in an ex parte proceeding was constitutionally improper does not satisfy this requirement. See part III of this opinion. \"We have repeatedly apprised litigants that we will not entertain a state constitutional claim unless the defendant has provided an independent analysis under the particular provisions of the state constitution at issue.... Without a separately briefed and analyzed state constitutional claim, we deem abandoned the defendant's claim.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     State v.

See Practice Book \u00a7 60-5. We disagree. The trial court denied the defendant's motion to suppress and concluded that the police presence during the execution of the administrative search warrant was \"passive\" and \"not intrusive in any way.\" We can infer from our review of the transcript of the trial court's ruling on the defendant's motion to suppress that all claims presented by the defendant in support of his motion were denied.
