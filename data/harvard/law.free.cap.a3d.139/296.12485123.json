BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Licensees are four adult residents of the County that have received a License from the Sheriff's Office. Licensees filed an eight-count Class Action Complaint (Complaint) against Defendants on December 19, 2014. Therein, Licensees allege that since prior to January 1, 2009, Defendants have notified individual License applicants that their applications have been approved, denied, or that their Licenses were revoked utilizing un-enveloped postcards through the United States Postal Service (USPS). (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 18-19, 21.) The writing exposed on the postcards allegedly includes the applicant's name, address, and a statement that the application has been approved, denied, or License revoked. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 18-19.) Licensees further allege that since before January 1, 2009, Defendants have issued renewal notices to\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   License holders using postcards through the USPS stating: \"Pistol Permit-Our Records indicate that your Permit to Carry a Firearm will soon expire....\" (Compl.\u00b6 21.) Licensees allege that because the information was sent on a postcard, the approval, denial, revocation, and renewal notices were \"visible by all individuals processing, mailing[,] and serving the mail, as well as, by any individual receiving the postcard at the address, who may or may not be the applicant or license holder.\" (Compl.\u00b6 22.) Licensees also allege that Licensees paid a fee to the County when they received their prior License that includes a $1.50 renewal notice processing fee and that Defendants did not\n   send the required renewal notices or refund the $1.50 to two of the Licensees-John Doe 1 and Jane Doe 1-and other similarly situated License holders. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 20, 36, 52.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Counts I-IV of the Complaint allege that, by sending renewal, approval, denial, revocation, and renewal notices via a postcard instead of enclosing the information within an envelope, the County (Count I), the Sheriff's Office (Count II), Sheriff Anthony (Count III), and Employee Does (Count IV) disclosed confidential information in violation of Section 6111(i) of the UFA, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111(i).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 69-84.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Count V alleges that Defendants and Employee Does violated Licensees' \"right to privacy and invaded their seclusion, solitude, and private affairs, by, but not limited to, publicly disclosing confidential information....\" (Compl.\u00b6 86.) Licensees allege that in addition to their statutory right of privacy under Section 6111(i) of the UFA, they have a right to privacy that is incident to the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, and that \"[t]he disclosure of confidential information is highly offensive to a reasonable person and is not of legitimate concern to the public.\" (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 87-88.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Count VI of the Complaint alleges that pursuant to Section 6109(h) of the UFA, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(h), Defendants County, Sheriff's Office, and Sheriff Anthony are required, and owed Licensees a fiduciary duty, to \"either utilize the $1.50 [paid to the County by Licensees] in the issuance of renewal notices or to refund the money to [Licensees].\" (Compl.\u00b6 94.) Relatedly, Count VII alleges that these Defendants are liable for conversion for failing to either use the funds for renewal notices or refund $1.50 to Licensees. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 96-98.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The final count of the Complaint, Count VIII,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleges that Defendants have violated the law and Licensees will be irreparably harmed if the practices complained of above are allowed to continue. (Compl.\u00b6 100.) Licensees seek various forms of injunctive and declaratory relief, including: (1) an injunction prohibiting Defendants from disclosing confidential information to those not authorized under the UFA; (2) an injunction requiring Defendants to train its employees on confidentiality; (3) an injunction requiring Defendants to use $1.50 of the License application fee for issuing renewal notices; (4) declaratory relief declaring that Defendants' policy of requiring License applicants to provide references on License applications violates Section 6111(i) of the UFA; and (5) an injunction barring Defendants from requiring License applicants to provide references on License applications. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 102-04.) In addition to the equitable relief sought in Count VIII, Licensees seek damages of $1000 \"per Defendant, per disclosure [of confidential information], per Class Member,\" $1.50 per licensee for each five-year period where renewal notices were not issued, and an award of attorney fees, expenses, costs, and interest. (Compl. Prayer for Relief \u00b6\u00b6 8-11.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Defendants filed POs on February 2, 2015, demurring to the allegations in the Complaint and alleging that the averments lacked specificity. Defendants' POs allege\n   as follows:\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   (1) some or all claims are barred by the applicable statute of limitations, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 23-28); (2) Defendants did not violate Section 6111(i) of the UFA because confidential information was not disclosed to the public, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 20-22); (3) Sheriff Anthony is immune from suit under the doctrine of high public official immunity, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 11-15); (4) the Sheriff's Office is not a proper defendant because it is not a legal entity separate from the County itself, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 16-17); (5) Licensees have no available civil cause of action to recover damages for, or a refund of, the $1.50 notice processing fee, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 53-61); (6) the County itself, including the Sheriff's Office, is immune from suit under the act popularly known as the Political Subdivision Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act),\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (POs \u00b6\u00b6 29-35); (7) Licensees have not stated a claim for invasion of privacy because they have not pleaded facts showing that all the elements of the claim have been met, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 36-52); (8) Licensees' request for injunctive relief must fail because Licensees have no clear right to relief, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 62-65); (9) the policy of requesting references is lawfully performed pursuant to a duty imposed upon Sheriff Anthony by the UFA, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 66-70); and (10) the Complaint lacks the specificity required to inform Defendants of the factual grounds upon which their claims are based, (POs \u00b6\u00b6 71-86).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Defendants filed a Motion to Supplement Preliminary Objections (Motion to Supplement) on March 25, 2015, seeking to add an objection alleging that Act 5 of 1997, which amended the UFA and included the provisions at issue in Licensees' Complaint, is unconstitutional under both the single-subject rule of Article III, Section 3 of the Pennsylvania Constitution and the original purpose rule of Article III, Section 1 of the same. Pa. Const. art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3 ; (R.R. at 149a-51a). Licensees filed an Answer to Defendants' Motion to Supplement and included New Matter alleging that: (1) Franklin County Local Rules and the Rules of Civil Procedure prohibited supplementing POs; (2) Defendants are estopped from raising the issue because they failed to take timely action after they became aware of the objection; (3) Defendants' constitutional argument is foreclosed by the doctrine of laches; and (4) Defendants failed to join two indispensable parties-the Pennsylvania State Police (State Police) and, possibly, the General Assembly. (R.R. at 270a-73a.) The Motion to Supplement was granted by common pleas over Licensees' objection on May 8, 2015. (C.R. at Item 12.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Common pleas issued an Order and Memorandum Opinion on August 13, 2015, sustaining many of Defendants' POs and dismissing the Complaint. First, common pleas held that Sheriff Anthony was immune to all claims seeking damages under the doctrine of high public official immunity. (Op. at 6-8.) Second, common pleas held that the Sheriff's Office was not an independent legal entity that could be subject to liability. (Op. at 8-9.) Third, common pleas sustained Defendants' POs to Licensees' invasion of privacy and conversion claims on the basis that Defendants are immune from such claims under the Tort Claims Act; however, common pleas overruled the POs alleging Defendants' immunity to Counts I-IV of the Complaint pursuant to the Tort Claims Act. (Op. at 9-10.) Fourth, common pleas sustained Defendants' demurrer to Count VI of the Complaint on the grounds that Section 6109 of the UFA does not create a private right of action for the recovery of $1.50 of\n   the License application fee. (Op. at 10.) Fifth, common pleas analyzed Section 6111(i) of the UFA and concluded that Licensees did not state a claim for relief under Section 6111(i) of the UFA because Licensees did not plead facts indicating that Defendants publicly disclosed confidential information. (Op. at 11-13.) Finally, common pleas held that Licensees did not sufficiently establish a clear right to injunctive and declaratory relief and sustained the demurrer to Count VIII of Licensees' Complaint. (Op. at 13-14.) Having sustained POs addressing every claim asserted by Licensees, common pleas dismissed the action without addressing Defendants' POs alleging insufficient specificity, that the actions are time-barred by the applicable statute of limitations, or Defendants' supplemental PO alleging that Act 5 of 1997 was enacted in a constitutionally infirm process.

Claims Under the UFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Confidentiality Under Section 6111(i) of the UFA\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Counts I-III of Licensees' Complaint allege that Defendants violated Section 6111(i) of the UFA by sending information pertaining to their License applications via postcards instead of enclosing the information within envelopes. Section 6111(i) of the UFA provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) Confidentiality.-\n   <strong>\n    All information\n   </strong>\n   provided by the potential purchaser,\n   transferee or applicant, including, but not limited to, the potential purchaser, transferee or\n   <strong>\n    applicant's name or identity,\n   </strong>\n   furnished by a potential purchaser or transferee under this section or any applicant for a license to carry a firearm as provided by section 6109\n   <strong>\n    shall be confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\n   </strong>\n   In addition to any other sanction or penalty imposed by this chapter,\n   <strong>\n    any person,\n   </strong>\n   licensed dealer,\n   <strong>\n    State or local governmental agency or department that violates this subsection shall be liable\n   </strong>\n   in civil damages in the amount of $1,000 per occurrence or three times the actual damages incurred as a result of the violation, whichever is greater, as well as reasonable attorney fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6111(i) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The key phrase in the statute for purposes of the instant matter is: \"[a]ll information provided by [the License applicant] ...\n   <strong>\n    shall be confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6905803\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/103/859/6905803/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Defendants understand the above provision as establishing two conditions precedent for a violation to occur: that the information provided by the License applicant is (1) treated non-confidentially; and (2) disclosed to a\n   <strong>\n    substantial number\n   </strong>\n   of people. Common pleas, agreeing with Defendants' construction, reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   There are only two (2) sentences in the subsection. In the first, in pertinent part, the legislature ordained that \"All information provided ... shall be confidential\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   not subject to public disclosure.\" (Emphasis added.) The use of the conjunction \"and\" is critical and signifies an intent by the legislature that the words and phrases used are connected and must be read together. In this regard, the legislature has provided that \"[W]ords and phrases shall be construed according to rules of grammar and according to their common and approved usage; ...\". 1 Pa.C.S.[\u00a7] 1903. In the second sentence, the cause of action for violating this subsection is created. In the context of this case therefore, in our view, Plaintiffs in order to state a claim for relief under Section 6111(i) were obligated to plead facts indicating that a defendant publicly disclosed confidential information provided by a Plaintiff in the course of obtaining a ... [L]icense or a renewal thereof.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The statute does not define the concept of \"public disclosure\" but the Superior Court of Pennsylvania has given definition to the comparable concept of \"publicity\".

Easton Pub[lishing] Co[mpany],\n   </em>\n   ... 48[3] A.2d 1377 (Pa.Super.1994), the Court said \"publicity\" requires the matter is made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Op. at 12-13 (emphasis in original).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of the General Assembly.\" Section 1921(a) of the Statutory Construction Act of 1972 (Statutory Construction Act), 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a).

To effectuate the statute's purpose, Section 6109(a) of the UFA requires individuals seeking to carry \"a firearm concealed on or about one's person or in a vehicle throughout this Commonwealth\" to obtain a License. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(a). Applicants must apply to the sheriff of the county in which the applicant resides, or in the case of a city of the first class, to the chief of police of that city. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   In order to obtain a License, an applicant must supply the sheriff with the reasons for obtaining the License and authorize the sheriff to inspect relevant records. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(c). \"The decision to issue a [License] is solely for the sheriff, subject to certain absolute statutory prohibitions.\"\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania State Police v.

First, Section 6109(e)(5) of the UFA addresses the safeguarding of information once an applicant is granted a License by the sheriff. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(e)(5). Pursuant to Section 6109(e)(5), the licensee is given an original License from the sheriff and a copy of the License is forwarded to the State Police.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090206\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/800/#p803\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   A second copy is retained by the sheriff for seven years.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090206\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/800/#p803\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   At the end of the seven-year period, and unless the License is renewed, the copies of the License held by the sheriff and State Police and the application for a License \"shall ... be destroyed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090206\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/800/#p803\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The General Assembly's concern for the confidentiality of a licensee's information is further supported by the General Assembly's enactment of Section 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) of the UFA, 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ), and its subparts. Section 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ) addresses the Firearms License Validation System administered by the State Police, which enables the State Police to respond to inquiries from law enforcement regarding the validity of a License 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(1). Understanding that License information given to sheriffs and, in turn, to the State Police, is confidential and would, absent this provision, not be subject to disclosure to local police forces, the General Assembly enacted Section 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2), which provides: \"\n   <strong>\n    Notwithstanding any other law regarding the confidentiality of information,\n   </strong>\n   inquiries to the Firearms License Validation System regarding the validity of any Pennsylvania license to carry a firearm may\n   <strong>\n    only\n   </strong>\n   be made by law enforcement personnel acting within the scope of their official duties.\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2) (emphasis added). The General Assembly, evincing additional concern for the confidentiality of the License-related information provided by citizens of the Commonwealth, further limited the information subject to disclosure to out-of-state law enforcement personnel to only \"the name of the licensee, the validity of the license and [criminal history information].\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4). If the General Assembly intended to allow disclosure of License information so long as the information is not disclosed to the public at large, Sections 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(2) and 6109(\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   )(4)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   would be superfluous because these permitted disclosures to law enforcement personnel are not to the public at large. In addition, the General Assembly would not have gone to such great lengths to detail the maintenance and destruction of License-related information in Section 6109(e)(5).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   It may appear that the General Assembly's use of both \"confidential\" and \"not subject to public disclosure\" is duplicative. \"Confidential\" is defined as \"meant to be kept secret,\" Black's Law Dictionary 294 (7th ed.1999), and a \"disclosure\" is defined as \"a revelation of facts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 477. Thus, information that is revealed to the public is not kept secret, and information that is kept secret cannot be revealed to the public. Yet, we must, if possible, give effect to every word of the statute. 1 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 1921(a). To do so in this instance, we must presume that the General Assembly intended some nonpublic disclosure of information; otherwise, the word\n   <em>\n    public\n   </em>\n   before\n   <em>\n    disclosure\n   </em>\n   would be unnecessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Nonetheless, given the extent to which the General Assembly built confidentiality into the UFA, we cannot agree with common pleas' construction of the term \"public disclosure\" in Section 6111(i) as incorporating the requirement of \"publicity\" necessary to prove the common law tort of invasion of privacy. A cause of action for common law invasion of privacy through giving publicity to matters concerning the private life of another is established only if private facts are \"made public, by communicating it to the public at large, or to so many persons that the matter must be regarded as substantially certain to become one of public knowledge,\" and the disclosure is \"highly offensive to a reasonable person.\"\n   <em>\n    Harris,\n   </em>\n   483 A.2d at 1384. We will not graft the common law elements of this tort onto Section 6111(i) of the UFA without clear indications that the General Assembly intended such elements to apply.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Instead, in light of the purpose and structure of the statute, we conclude that the General Assembly included both the term \"confidential\" and the phrase \"not subject to public disclosure\" in Section 6111(i) so that issuing sheriffs may disclose the information to those necessary for law enforcement or criminal justice purposes. While the sheriff is given the sole discretionary authority under the UFA statutory scheme to grant a License, the UFA provides roles for other entities in the process of determining whether a License should be granted or revoked. Because License applicants apply directly to the sheriff and the decision to issue Licenses belongs to the sheriff alone, absent the phrase \"not subject to public disclosure,\" issuing sheriffs could be required to keep the information secret from everyone, including those entities given a role in the licensing process by statute,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   criminal justice agencies,\n   or those involved in the administration of the sheriff's office. We therefore interpret Section 6111(i) of the UFA to mean that \"any person, licensed dealer, State or local governmental agency or department\" violates Section 6111(i) of the UFA by revealing an \"applicant's name or identity\" to a person not (1) authorized to receive such information by statute; (2) involved in the operation or management of the sheriff's office; (3) representing a law enforcement or criminal justice agency; or (4) otherwise authorized by an applicant. Disclosure to any other person constitutes \"public disclosure\" for purposes of this section. Any other interpretation of Section 6111(i) of the UFA where a License applicant's confidentiality is not safeguarded would be inconsistent with the UFA's purpose and structure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   This interpretation aligns with the State Police's regulations implementing the UFA which also contains the terms \"confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\" Section 33.103 of the State Police's regulations provides:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   (a) Information furnished under this chapter by an applicant, purchaser, transferee or licensee, or collected by the designated issuing authority under this chapter,\n   <strong>\n    is confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   (b) Information collected or maintained under this chapter by the State Police is\n   <strong>\n    confidential and not subject to public disclosure.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (c)\n   <strong>\n    Nonpublic disclosure\n   </strong>\n   by the State Police of information collected, furnished or maintained under this chapter\n   <strong>\n    is restricted to:\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   (1) Disclosure upon request of the applicant, licensee, purchaser or transferee, as described in sections 6109 and 6111 of the act (relating to licenses; and sale or transfer of firearms), upon documentary certification that the requestor is in fact the applicant, licensee, purchaser or transferee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (2) Disclosure upon request of a county sheriff or a criminal justice agency, defined as any court, including the minor judiciary, with criminal jurisdiction or any other governmental agency, or subunit thereof, created by statute or by the State or Federal constitutions, specifically authorized to perform as its principal function the administration of criminal justice, and which allocates a substantial portion of its annual budget to this function.

(Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 92-94.) The Complaint alleges that Licensees John Doe 1 and Jane Doe 1 did not receive renewal notices, but paid a prior License application fee that included a renewal notice processing fee of $1.50. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 36, 52.) Licensees seek a refund of $1.50 per Licensee that did not receive renewal notices for each five-year period that renewal notices were not issued. (Compl. Prayer for Relief \u00b6 9.) Licensees also allege that the renewal notices received by those licensees that received such notice stated: \"Pistol Permit-Our Records indicate that your Permit to Carry a Firearm will soon expire. You may pick up an application for renewal at our Office.... Application is available online at www.co.franklin.pa.us.\" (Compl.\u00b6 21.) Defendants demur to these claims by alleging that the UFA does not require Defendants to refund any portion of the License application fee and does not provide a cause of action relating to its breach. (POs \u00b6\u00b6 55-58.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Section 6109(h) provides, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   (1) In addition to fees described in paragraphs (2)(ii) and (3), the fee for a license to carry a firearm is $19. This includes all of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   (i) A renewal notice processing fee of $1.50.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   (ii) An administrative fee of $5 under section 14(2) of the act of July 6, 1984 (P.L. 614, No. 127), known as the Sheriff Fee Act.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-58\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   (5) The fee is payable to the sheriff to whom the application is submitted and is payable at the time of application for the license.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-60\">\n   (6) Except for the administrative fee of $5 under section 14(2) of the Sheriff Fee Act,\n   <strong>\n    all other fees\n   </strong>\n   shall be refunded if the application is denied but\n   <strong>\n    shall not\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    be refunded if a license is issued\n   </strong>\n   and subsequently revoked.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-61\">\n   (7) A person who sells or attempts to sell a license to carry a firearm for a fee in excess of the amounts fixed under this subsection commits a summary offense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(h) (emphasis added). In enacting Section 6109(h)(1), the General Assembly indicated its intent that the $19 License fee include a renewal notice processing fee and an administrative fee, and that, except for the administrative fee, the other fees be refunded if the application is denied but not if the license is issued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   In this case, Licensees all applied for a License which was issued. Therefore, under the plain terms of Section 6109(h)(6) of the UFA, there is no provision for refund of any of the application fee. Licensees argue that in enacting Section 6109(h)(1) of the UFA, the General Assembly\n   <em>\n    required\n   </em>\n   sheriffs to use $1.50 of the $19 Licensee fee to process renewal notices. Licensees read Section 6109(h) of the UFA in conjunction with Section 6109(f)(2) of the UFA that provides: \"At least 60 days prior to the expiration of each license, the issuing sheriff shall send to the licensee an application for renewal of license. Failure to receive a renewal application shall not relieve a licensee from the responsibility to renew the license.\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(f)(2). Notably, Section 6109(h) of the UFA refers to \"renewal\n   <strong>\n    notice\n   </strong>\n   processing,\" and Section 6109(f)(2) of the UFA refers to \"an\n   <strong>\n    application\n   </strong>\n   for renewal of license.\" Licensees do not comment on the different terms used in the two provisions, but assume that the application for renewal of license described in Section 6109(f)(2) is the renewal notice for which the $1.50 for processing is included in the application fee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   However, even construing these provisions together would not entitle Licensees to a refund of the $1.50. In Section 6109(f)(2), the General Assembly addressed the consequence of a renewal application not being received. The only consequence is that the failure does not relieve the licensee of the burden of renewing the License. Had the General Assembly intended to permit a refund of the $1.50, it could have done so, as it provided for a refund in Section 6109(h)(6) ; however, it did not do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Licensees argue that Section 6109(f)(2) requires the Sheriff to send an application for renewal to Licensees and that this statutory \"mandate\" creates a private right of action for them. However, even if Licensees are correct that there is a statutory \"mandate,\" there is no private remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   When a statute provides a mandate upon a government actor without a specific remedy, \"we are required to consider whether the statute implicitly creates a private remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    Estate of Witthoeft v.

Licensees thus admit that the General Assembly did not intend to create a remedy because it did not anticipate that sheriffs would not perform their obligations. We agree that there is no indication in the text of the statute that the General Assembly intended to create a private right of action for return of the $1.50 renewal notice processing fee in Section 6109(h)(1) of the UFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is not our role to create a cause of action when the General Assembly did not anticipate the need for one.

Because a county sheriff is a local government agency under the UFA, and the General Assembly utilized its constitutional authority to create a targeted form of liability that may be imposed upon a local agency that breaches the confidentiality of License-related information, we conclude that Sheriff Anthony is not entitled to high public official immunity should it be proved that he violated Section 6111(i) of the UFA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   It was therefore error to sustain Defendants' PO to Count I of the Complaint alleging that Sheriff Anthony is shielded by high public official immunity, and we reverse common pleas in this regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   <strong>\n    5.

Common pleas sustained Defendants' POs based on its conclusion that \"[t]he factual basis for the requests is the same conduct [it] [ ] concluded does not support causes of action for monetary damages,\" and that Licensees did not meet their burden to \"plead facts that indicate a clear right to relief.\" (Op. at 13-14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   In their Complaint, Licensees seek the following equitable relief: (1) \"an injunction prohibiting Defendants and their employees from disseminating any confidential [License] application information in violation of [Section 6111(i) of the UFA]\"; (2) \"an injunction requiring Defendants to properly train their employees regarding the confidentiality of [License] application information under [Section 6111(i) of the UFA]\"; (3) \"an injunction requiring Defendants to properly utilize the $1.50 for purposes of issuing renewal notifications pursuant to [Section 6109(f)(2) of the UFA]\"; (4) a declaration that the policy and practice of \"requiring [License] applicants to provide references on the [License] Application and contacting those references\" violates Section 6111(i) of the UFA; and (5) \"an injunction prohibiting Defendants from enforcing the policy and practice\" of requiring License applicants to provide references and contacting said references. (Compl.\u00b6\u00b6 101-04.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   Though ultimately, the party seeking injunctive relief must prove, with probative evidence that the \"right to relief is clear,\" a remedy at law is insufficient, and \"greater injury will result from refusing rather than granting the relief requested,\" a court of common pleas should only sustain a preliminary objection in the nature\n   of a demurrer to a claim for injunctive relief if the court \"find[s] that the petition is clearly insufficient to establish a right to injunctive relief, and any doubt must be resolved in overruling the demurrer.\"\n   <em>\n    P.J.S. v.

If Licensees are able to prove that Defendants violated Section 6111(i), an injunction prohibiting the disclosure of confidential License-related information and requiring training of employees may be warranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   Second, Licensees argue that in enacting Section 6109(h) of the UFA, the General Assembly required sheriffs to use $1.50 of the $19 Licensee fee to process renewal notices, and based on the mandatory nature of Section 6109(f)(2) of the UFA, Licensees have a clear right to an injunction requiring Defendants to utilize $1.50 of the License fee for processing renewal notices. However, consistent with our discussion above, we do not construe Sections 6109(h) or 6109(f)(2) as imposing a mandatory duty with regard to the use of the $1.50. Accordingly, we conclude that common pleas did not err by sustaining Defendants' PO related to Licensees' request for injunctive relief requiring Defendants to use $1.50 of the License application fees to issue renewal notifications.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   Finally, we agree with common pleas that Defendants' PO to Licensees' request for declaratory and injunctive relief related to Defendants' alleged policy and practice of requiring License applicants to provide references and to contact said references must be sustained.

(POs \u00b6 69.) Licensees argue in response that disclosure of a License applicant's name to references breaches the confidentiality required by Section 6111(i) of the UFA, and that Defendants may determine a License applicant's reputation and character without violating confidentiality by searching court dockets to discover any civil or criminal matters brought against the applicant. We agree with Defendants. While a sheriff could determine that an individual falls into some of the categories listed in Section 6109(e) by searching court dockets and criminal records, such a review would not necessarily return information regarding whether an individual is \"not of sound mind\"; \"addicted to or is an unlawful user of marijuana or a stimulant, depressant or narcotic drug\"; \"habitual drunkard\"; or \"whose character and reputation is such that the individual would be likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(e)(i), (v), (vi), (vii).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   The UFA's statutory scheme places sheriffs in the position of both safeguarding License applicants' confidentiality and protecting the public by making an informed determination that an applicant is qualified to receive a License. Sheriffs and the State Police have, in a uniform\n   manner throughout the Commonwealth, struck the balance by requiring License applicants to self-verify that they meet the requirements of Section 6109(e) of the UFA and to provide two references that are not members of the applicants' family that can speak to an individual's qualifications.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Application for a Pennsylvania License To Carry Firearms, Compl. Ex. B.) We see no legal infirmity in the balance struck by law enforcement. Section 6109(c) of the UFA requires License applicants to sign a statement on the application form that authorizes \"the sheriff, or his designee\" to inspect \"records or documents relevant to information required for this application.\" 18 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6109(c). By providing two references and signing the application form, an applicant authorizes the limited disclosure of their name and the fact they are seeking a License to the two persons named as references. Thus, because the disclosure to two references is required in order for sheriffs to conduct an investigation and to make an informed determination regarding a License applicant's qualifications, and disclosure to references is authorized by applicants, we conclude that Licensees have not sufficiently alleged their right to the injunctive relief requested.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
