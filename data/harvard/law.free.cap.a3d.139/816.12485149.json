On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the evidence was insufficient to support his adjudication for having committed conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and (2) the court erred in denying his motion to dismiss based on the state's failure to obtain and produce a relevant videotape that\n   contained evidence used against him. We agree with the defendant's first claim. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of adjudication as a youthful offender and remand the case to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court, and procedural history are relevant to our analysis. On March 8, 2013, the minor defendant and four of his friends were inside a local market, near the defendant's home, at approximately 10:30 p.m. The defendant wore a monitoring device on his ankle. The market had a video surveillance system that recorded the defendant's presence and his interactions with the market employee, but it had no audio component. The defendant asked a market employee if he could use the telephone, but the employee said no. The defendant then used a cell phone to make a call. While on the phone, the defendant asked the employee for the address of the store, but the employee was unsure; the defendant then asked for the zip code, which the employee gave to him. The employee overheard portions of the defendant's telephone conversation and thought he was ordering something. After completing the telephone call, the defendant and his friends left the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   At approximately 10:40 p.m., Pizza Hut in Bridgeport received a telephone call from someone purporting to be \"Sarah.\" Sarah placed a food order for one large pizza and two orders of chicken wings to be delivered to 319 East Avenue, which was just a few doors down from the market. At approximately 10:55 p.m., the deliveryman was dispatched to deliver the order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   When the deliveryman arrived at 319 East Avenue, he saw a young man on the porch, who was wearing\n   sweatpants. He asked the young man if he had ordered a pizza, and the young man responded affirmatively. The deliveryman then got out of his vehicle, with the items that had been ordered, and approached the porch. When he got to the porch, he was approached on the right by a masked man holding a shotgun, who told him to \"hold it right there.\" Then, another person approached the deliveryman from the left, and all three then attacked, punching, kicking, and hitting the deliveryman in the head with the shotgun. The attackers took money from the deliveryman's pockets and then went through his vehicle, stealing his cell phone, global positioning system (GPS) holder and other things. After beating and robbing the deliveryman, the attackers ran down the street. There was no evidence that the defendant was present at the scene of the robbery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When investigating the robbery, members of the Bridgeport Police Department stopped at the market to ask questions. While there, they viewed the surveillance video, and the market employee pointed out the defendant and his friends on the video. Jose Morel, the owner of the market, recognized the defendant on the video as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The officers then received a tip that people involved in the robbery were located in a multiunit garage near the market. The police went to this multiunit garage, and, when they opened the garage door, they heard people running. Police then discovered the deliveryman's GPS holder, a chicken wing box, and the pizza warmer bag. The police apprehended an individual as he was running from the garage, and arrested him. They recovered a cell phone from him, which matched the phone number of the cell phone used to call Pizza Hut for the delivery to 319 East Avenue. The police recognized this person as one of the people on the surveillance video standing near the defendant at the market.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   There was no evidence that the defendant was present in this multiunit garage when the police arrived there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendant was arrested on March 9, 2013, and charged as a youthful offender with robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-134 (a)(4) and 54-76b, assault\n   in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-59 (a)(4) and 54-76b, and conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree in violation of \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48, 53a-134 (a)(4), and 54-76b. Following the state's case, the defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal on all charges. The court,\n   <em>\n    Cradle, J.,\n   </em>\n   granted the motion as to the robbery and assault charges, finding that there was no evidence that the defendant was present at the scene of the robbery, but denied it as to the charge of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. The court later adjudicated the defendant a youthful offender for having committed conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, and it sentenced him to four years incarceration, suspended after two years, followed by three years probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On appeal, the state concedes, and we agree, that the evidence was insufficient to support the defendant's adjudication as a youthful offender for committing conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree because there was no evidence, direct or circumstantial, that the defendant had agreed or intended that his coconspirators would use a firearm during the robbery. Cf.\n   <em>\n    State v. Pond,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6778405\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/138/228/#p234\">\n    138 Conn.App. 228\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 234,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20950\">\n    50 A.3d 950\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012) (for conviction of conspiracy to commit robbery in second degree, state must prove that defendant specifically agreed and intended that what was represented to be deadly weapon or dangerous instrument would be used or displayed during robbery), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20451\">\n    315 Conn. 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n    108 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) ; see also\n   <em>\n    State v.

Thus, the state concedes that the defendant's adjudication as a\n   youthful offender for committing conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The state argues, however, that by finding that the defendant had conspired to commit robbery in the first degree, the court necessarily found that he had committed the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree. Therefore, the state contends that the appropriate disposition is to remand the matter to the trial court with direction to modify the basis of the adjudication to the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree as a youthful offender in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-48, 53a-136 (a), and 54-76b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant counters the state's contention by arguing that, not only was there no evidence of an agreement to use a firearm, there was no evidence that the \"defendant conspired with anyone to commit a robbery....\" He further argues, however, that even if there is inferential evidence that he conspired to commit robbery in the third degree, which there is not, after we reverse the present judgment of adjudication as a youthful offender based on the crime of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree, the matter should be remanded to the trial court with direction to render a judgment of acquittal. The defendant argues that this is appropriate because the state never sought to charge him with a lesser included offense. He also contends that his trial strategy might have been different if the state had charged him in the alternative. Ultimately, he contends that it would be unfair to modify the basis of his adjudication as a youthful offender to a lesser included offense under the circumstances of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On the basis of\n   <em>\n    State v.

Accordingly, we conclude that the law has not changed recently, and, therefore, this factor is not relevant to the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Second, we consider whether there is reason to believe that the state, for strategic purposes, chose not to charge the defendant with the lesser included offense of conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree.\n   <em>\n    State v. LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20115\">\n    307 Conn. at 147\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant argues that the state \"could have either charged the\n   defendant with conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree, or it could have argued that such a conviction was appropriate during summation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The state did neither one of these things, and it should not be rewarded on appeal when it never put the defendant on notice that it was seeking a conviction for conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree.... [T]he state ... had the responsibility to bring the proper charges and to put the defendant on notice as to those charges.\" (Citation omitted; footnote added.) We agree with the defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   As stated previously, the state was on notice of the elements required to prove\n   that the defendant was guilty of conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree. Despite its knowledge of the required elements of that offense, the state chose not to charge the defendant with the lesser included offense. Thus, knowing that\n   <em>\n    Pond\n   </em>\n   already had changed the law in 2012, the state strategically sought an adjudication solely on the greater offense without giving the court the option of an adjudication on the lesser included offense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The third factor we consider is whether there was a change in the law after the defendant's trial and whether the defendant is seeking to benefit from that change without having raised the issue himself on appeal.\n   <em>\n    State v. LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20115\">\n    307 Conn. at 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As previously stated in our discussion of the first factor, the law has not changed recently, and the defendant in this case has raised the relevant issue, namely, that on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Pond,\n   </em>\n   his adjudication as a youthful offender for conspiracy to commit robbery in the first degree cannot stand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The fourth factor we consider is whether the defendant has voiced an objection to the state's request for a modification of the conviction.\n   <em>\n    State v. LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=307%20Conn.%20115\">\n    307 Conn. at 150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We conclude that the defendant has objected and has fully briefed his objection to this court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, the fifth factor we consider is whether we can be sure that the defendant would not have undertaken a different trial strategy had he been charged with the lesser included offense. Id., at 151,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    51 A.3d 1048\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As our Supreme Court noted in\n   <em>\n    LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   \"we cannot be sure that the defendant in the present case did not forgo a particular trial strategy due to the lack of a lesser included offense charge. Regardless of whether the defense challenged the state's claims as to elements of the lesser included charge, trial strategy ... [is] inevitably colored by the inclusion of a lesser included charge to the jury.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20A.3d%201048\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   We take this language to mean that whether a defendant's trial strategy is colored turns, in this context, on the presence or absence of a lesser included offense rather than the fact that it is a jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In the present case, we not only have this general truism from\n   <em>\n    LaFleur\n   </em>\n   regarding the inevitable coloring of a defendant's trial strategy when a lesser included offense is in play, but the defendant also explicitly argues that he may have defended his case differently had he also been charged with this lesser included offense. Indeed, when asked during oral argument to give one example of something he may have done differently at trial, the defendant responded that he had not contested that he was at the market shortly before the Pizza Hut deliveryman was beaten and robbed just a few doors down from the market, and that he likely would not have left that factual assertion uncontested. Thus, like the court in\n   <em>\n    LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   we cannot conclude that the defendant's trial strategy would not have been different had the state also charged him with the lesser\n   included offense. See id.; see also footnote 2 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   On the basis of these factors, guided by our Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    LaFleur,\n   </em>\n   we cannot conclude that it would be fair to the defendant to order a modification of the judgment of adjudication as a youthful offender. Accordingly, the judgment must be reversed and a judgment of acquittal directed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to render a judgment of acquittal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    Because we conclude that the defendant's conviction must be reversed and a judgment of acquittal ordered, we do not consider his second claim on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Even if we were not constrained by our Supreme Court's decision in\n    <em>\n     LaFleur,\n    </em>\n    we are not necessarily persuaded that we would automatically remand the case to the trial court with direction to modify the basis of the adjudication as a youthful offender to conspiracy to commit robbery in the third degree, which is the specific modification the state is requesting. Although the state concedes that there was no evidence that the defendant knew or agreed that his coconspirators would employ the use of a firearm in this case, we question what evidence there is, inferential or otherwise, that the defendant knew or intended that his coconspirators would use or threaten the use of force in obtaining the pizza and related items that he is alleged to have ordered on their behalf. As our Supreme Court explained in\n    <em>\n     State v. Pond,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=315%20Conn.%20451\">\n     315 Conn. 451\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 453,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n     108 A.3d 1083\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015) : \"General Statutes \u00a7 53a-48 (a), Connecticut's criminal conspiracy statute, provides that '[a] person is guilty of conspiracy when, with intent that conduct constituting a crime be performed, he agrees with one or more persons to engage in or cause the performance of such conduct, and any one of them commits an overt act in pursuance of such conspiracy ...' [which means that] ... to be convicted of conspiracy, a defendant must specifically intend that every element of the planned offense be accomplished, even an element that itself carries no specific intent requirement.... [W]e are not persuaded that the legislature intended to punish offenders for conspiring to commit crimes that they never agreed or intended to commit....\" (Footnote omitted.) Because we are reversing the judgment on the basis of\n    <em>\n     LaFleur,\n    </em>\n    however, we need not conduct a separate and complete analysis of this issue.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    We offer no opinion on the defendant's statement that the state, during closing argument, could have argued for a possible conviction of a lesser included offense without having given the defendant notice of its intention to do so.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
