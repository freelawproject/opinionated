On appeal, the defendant argues that the court improperly concluded that his application to vacate the arbitration award\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was untimely and that it should have denied the defendant's application to confirm the arbitration award. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history informs our resolution of the defendant's appeal. On December 1, 2011, the parties entered into an agreement for legal services whereby they agreed to submit any fee disputes to the Connecticut Bar Association for binding arbitration.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On March 3, 2014, the plaintiff petitioned the legal fee resolution board of the Connecticut Bar Association (board) to resolve a fee dispute that had arisen between the parties. After a hearing, a panel of three arbitrators found in favor of the plaintiff. The defendant received notice of the board's award on December 24, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On January 26, 2015, the plaintiff filed an application to confirm the arbitration award in the Superior Court for the judicial district of Hartford. On February 2,\n   2015, the defendant filed an application to vacate the arbitration award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On March 17, 2015, the court held a hearing on the application to confirm and the application to vacate. The plaintiff argued, among other things, that the court could not consider the defendant's application to vacate because it was untimely. The defendant countered that although his initial attempt to file the application to vacate was unsuccessful, the application nevertheless was timely filed at the time of the initial attempt. At the conclusion of the hearing, the court rendered an oral decision granting the plaintiff's application to confirm the arbitration award.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n   On appeal, the defendant claims that the court incorrectly concluded that his application to vacate was untimely and should have denied the plaintiff's application to confirm for one or more of the following reasons: the defendant was deprived of due process in the commencement of and during arbitration; the arbitration panel demonstrated bias by failing to consider his testimony and evidence; the panel's findings were erroneous; and the award was contrary to public policy. The plaintiff argues, inter alia, that because the defendant did not file the application to vacate within thirty days of receiving notice of the arbitration award, as required by General Statutes \u00a7 52-420(b), the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the application to vacate and was obligated to confirm the award. We agree with the plaintiff that because the defendant did not make a timely application to vacate the arbitration award, the court, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 52-417, properly granted the application to confirm the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Our resolution of the defendant's appeal requires us to determine whether the court properly confirmed the arbitration award under the circumstances of this case. \"[A] party may apply for the confirmation of an arbitration award within one year after it has been rendered. Section 52-417 provides that upon such an application, [t]he court or judge\n   <em>\n    shall\n   </em>\n   grant such an order confirming the award\n   <em>\n    unless the award is vacated, modified or corrected\n   </em>\n   as prescribed in [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 ] 52-418 and 52-419....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"[Section] 52-418(a) provides that a court shall grant a motion to vacate if it finds one of the following enumerated defects: (1) If the award has been procured by corruption, fraud or undue means; (2) if there has been evident partiality or corruption\n   on the part of\n   any arbitrator; (3) if the arbitrators have been guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing upon sufficient cause shown or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy or of any other action by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced; or (4) if the arbitrators have exceeded their powers or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made. General Statutes \u00a7 52-420(b) creates a time limitation on bringing a motion to vacate: No motion to vacate, modify or correct an award may be made after thirty days from the notice of the award to the party to the arbitration who makes the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The trial court lacks any discretion in confirming the arbitration award unless the award suffers from any of the defects described in ... \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419.... Furthermore, if a motion to vacate, modify or correct is not made within the thirty day time limit specified in ... \u00a7 52-420, the award may not thereafter be attacked on any of the grounds specified in \u00a7\u00a7 52-418 and 52-419.\" (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Directory Assistants, Inc. v.

Thus, pursuant\n   to \u00a7 52-420(b), the mandatory thirty day deadline to make an application to vacate the award was Friday, January 23, 2015. Notwithstanding his unsuccessful initial attempt to file an application to vacate, which was returned to him for several reasons; see footnote 3 of this opinion; the defendant did not make an application to vacate the award until he successfully filed it on February 2, 2015; see\n   <em>\n    Van Mecklenburg v.

Consequently, by the time he actually filed his application to vacate, the defendant had lost the ability to raise any statutory or common-law grounds for vacating the award.\n   <em>\n    Asselin &amp; Connolly, Attorneys, LLC v. Heath,\n   </em>\n   supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5753625\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/108/360/#p366\">\n    108 Conn.App. at 366\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=947%20A.2d%201051\">\n    947 A.2d 1051\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the defendant did not timely move to vacate, modify or correct the arbitration award, the trial court had no choice but to confirm the award.\n   <em>\n    Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1588 v. Laidlaw Transit, Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1329736\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/33/1/#p4\">\n    33 Conn.App. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4-5,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=632%20A.2d%20713\">\n    632 A.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993). Accordingly, the court properly granted the plaintiff's application to confirm the award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendant also argues that \"the motion to vacate the award was made when it was properly served upon [the] plaintiff.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   We disagree. There is ample\n   authority that it is the timely filing of an application to vacate that amounts to compliance with \u00a7 52-420(b), not timely service. \"A proceeding to vacate an arbitration award is not a civil action, but is rather a special statutory\n   proceeding.... As a special statutory proceeding, it is not controlled by the formal requirements for service of process....

A New Britain Superior Court clerk returned the initial application to the defendant accompanied by a return of papers form indicating numerous reasons for return, including the lack of certification, case title, docket number, and fee, and the return to the wrong court.
