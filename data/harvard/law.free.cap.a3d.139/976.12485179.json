In 2009, Jackson filed a petition for post-conviction relief pursuant to the Uniform Postconviction Procedure Act, in which he alleged that he was actually innocent of the crime of rape; that the State withheld exculpatory evidence; that his guilty plea was not knowing, intelligent and voluntary; and that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance of counsel. Jackson's Petition was denied, but Jackson was permitted to file a belated Motion for Reconsideration of Sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Jackson again filed a petition for DNA testing in 2013, which the Circuit Court denied.

Senate Bill 694 from which Chapter 418 emanated had been introduced as a response to a nationwide trend in which various states and the federal government had \"considered establishing procedures for postconviction DNA identification testing for certain felony offenses.\" Revised Fiscal Note, Department of Fiscal Services, Bill File S.B. 694. DNA testing had been recognized as a \"law enforcement tool, used to establish either the guilt or innocence of suspected or convicted offenders\", which also could be utilized to exonerate defendants who were \"wrongfully convicted or sentenced.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Chapter 418, a portion of which was later codified as Section 8-201(c), provided in relevant part that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   (c) Subject to subsection (d)\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   of this section, a court shall order DNA testing if the court finds that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (1)(i) The scientific identification evidence was not previously subjected to the DNA testing that is requested for reasons beyond the control of the petitioner; or\n   (ii) The type of DNA test being requested is different from tests previously conducted and would have a reasonable likelihood of providing a more probative result than tests previously conducted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   (2) The scientific identification evidence was secured as provided in subsection (i) of this section, in relation to the crime for which the petitioner was convicted;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   (3) The scientific identification evidence to be tested has been subject to a chain of custody as provided under subsection (i) of this section that is sufficient to establish that it has not been substituted, tampered with, replaced, or altered in any material aspect;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   (4) Identity was an issue in the trial that resulted in the petitioner's conviction;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   (5) A reasonable probability exists that the DNA testing has the scientific potential to produce results materially relevant to the petitioner's assertion of innocence; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   (6) The requested DNA test employs a method of testing generally accepted within the relevant scientific community.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   2001 Maryland Laws, Chapter 418.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   That language of Section 8-201(c)(1) through (4) that would have precluded various successive DNA testing petitions was removed when Chapter 240 of the Laws of 2003 was enacted.

Easing restrictions on successive DNA petitions was in direct contrast to what the General Assembly had done in 1995, when Chapter 110 of the Laws of 1995 limited the number of successive petitions under the Uniform Post Conviction Procedure Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In enacting Rule 4-704\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   in 2009, we\n   recognized that successive petitions filed post conviction could be filed without any exclusion for successive DNA petitions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (a)\n   <strong>\n    Content.\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    In General.\n   </em>\n   Each petition shall state:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (C) a description of all previous proceedings in the case, including direct appeals, motions for new trial, habeas corpus proceedings, post-conviction proceedings, and all other\n   collateral proceedings, including (i) the court in which each proceeding was filed, (ii) the case number of each proceeding, (iii) the determinations made in each proceeding, and (iv) the date of each determination[.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Filing successive DNA testing petitions, thus, was anticipated by our adoption of Rule 4-704 that implemented Section 8-201(c), as amended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The issue of whether the doctrine of\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   could bar the filing of successive petitions, moreover, was raised during the Rules Committee process for Rule 4-704. In a colloquy between the Honorable Alan Wilner, the Chair of the Rules Committee, and Richard Karceski, a member of the Rules Committee,\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   as a bar was discussed:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   [KARCESKI]: Pursuant to section (c), if there is a withdrawal of the petition before the court orders DNA testing or a search of a database, it should be without prejudice. However, if the order has been issued, the leave to withdraw shall be with prejudice unless the court for good cause orders otherwise. When the Subcommittee discussed this, the conclusion was that there is no limit to the number of petitions that can be filed.

We, however, do find persuasive the reasoning of the intermediate appellate court of Ohio in\n   <em>\n    State v. Ayers,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3863059\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ohio-app-3d/185/168/\">\n    185 Ohio App.3d 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=923%20N.E.2d%20654\">\n    923 N.E.2d 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). In that case, Ayers appealed the denial of his second successive petition for DNA testing; the trial court had applied\n   <em>\n    res judicata\n   </em>\n   as a bar. The Ohio intermediate appellate explored the fact that the Ohio General Assembly had amended the DNA testing statute and thereby had lowered the threshold for DNA testing in order to enable more robust opportunities to secure DNA testing:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In 2006, the General Assembly amended Ohio's DNA testing statutes. The amendments, among other things, made postconviction DNA testing more available to inmates and lowered the outcome-determinative standard for establishing entitlement to DNA testing. Under the prior version of R.C. 2953.71(L), \"outcome determinative\" meant that had \"the results of DNA testing been presented at the trial * * * and been found relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for which the inmate * * * is requesting the DNA testing * * * no reasonable factfinder would have found the inmate guilty of that offense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Under the amended statute, \" 'outcome determinative' means that had the results of DNA testing of the subject\n   inmate been presented at the trial * * * and been found relevant and admissible with respect to the felony offense for which the inmate * * * is requesting the DNA testing * * *,\n   <em>\n    and had those results been analyzed in the context of and upon consideration of all available admissible evidence related to the inmate's case * * *, there is a strong probability\n   </em>\n   that no reasonable factfinder would have found the inmate guilty of that offense.\" (Emphasis added.) R.C. 2953.71(L).\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   The addition of the words \"strong probability,\" among others, in the current version of R.C. 2953.71(L), in essence lowers the definition of \"outcome determinative\" from a showing of innocence beyond a reasonable doubt to one of clear and convincing evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   Although there is no legislative statement of intent in the amended R.C. 2953.71(L), there can be no doubt that the rise of DNA testing as an investigative tool prompted the General Assembly to lower the statutory standard for what constitutes \"outcome determinative.\" The United States Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, has recognized that \"DNA technology has become one of the most powerful tools to ensure that justice is done through our criminal justice system. It helps identify offenders and eliminate innocent suspects. Increasingly, DNA is also used to exonerate the wrongly convicted.\" See Ritter, Postconviction DNA Testing Is at Core of Major NIJ Initiatives (Mar.2009), National Institute of Justice Journal, No. 262.1 And the United States Supreme Court recently stated in\n   <em>\n    Dist. Attorney's Office v.

Since its first use in criminal investigations in the mid-1980s, there have been several major advances in DNA technology, culminating in STR technology. It is now often possible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty. While of course many criminal trials proceed without any forensic and scientific testing at all, there is\n   no technology comparable to DNA testing for matching tissues when such evidence is at issue. DNA testing has exonerated wrongly convicted people, and has confirmed the convictions of many others.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (Citations omitted.)

If DNA testing has the proven ability to \"exonerate[ ] wrongly convicted people,\" we can perceive no viable argument that matters of judicial economy should supersede the law's never-ending quest to ensure that no innocent person be convicted. The refinement of DNA testing has shown that law and science are intersecting with increasing regularity. When scientific advances give the courts the tools to ensure that the innocent can go free, those advances in science will necessarily dictate changes in the law.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pickett v.

In his 2015 Petition for DNA testing, Jackson alleged that testing of a piece of Patricia M.'s underwear for the presence of his DNA, as well as testing of additional material collected on laboratory microscope slides, which remained from a SAFE exam that had been performed on Patricia M., \"ha[ve] the potential to show that Petitioner's\n   DNA is not on the complainant's underwear, evidence that would have been inconsistent with her undisclosed statements that he ejaculated and that she had not showered or douched since then\" and \"would also clarify this issue by producing exculpatory or mitigating evidence.\" Jackson's Petition also requested that Touch DNA be utilized in testing, because it could \"provide exculpatory evidence that was not available in 2006.\"\n   Jackson's counsel attempted to clarify Jackson's 2015 Petition before us at oral argument when she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   Under Jackson's theory of the events that night, Jackson did not take her clothing off and that she did. So, if she took her clothing off, then only her DNA would be shed on the underwear and there would be none of his DNA on the underwear and that would support his claim that he never took her clothing off and never touched her in that way. He wants to have the underwear tested to show that his DNA is not on the underwear because that would exculpate him.... He's now arguing that he did not have sex with her, that they were engaged in foreplay, that she told him to stop and that he stopped and that the purpose of testing the underwear is that she took her clothing off, that only her DNA is on the underwear. He didn't touch her underwear. He didn't force her to take her clothing off. If he hadn't taken her underwear off, then his DNA wouldn't be on it. That's why he wants the underwear tested.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In rebuttal argument in response to the State's claim that Jackson did not sufficiently clarify his reasons for testing the underwear, Jackson's counsel stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   Additionally, while Petitioner did argue that the absence of his DNA on her underwear was specifically talking about semen that doesn't change the fact that her underwear could produce exculpatory evidence not just because of the dispute about who took her clothing off but because she alleges that he raped her and that she put her underwear on. The GMBC report is clear that she put the underwear back on and she immediately left the home and she had\n   someone take her to the hospital so that underwear would certainly have his DNA on it regardless of whether or not he took it off of her.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Judge Ballou-Watts denied Jackson's 2015 Petition without a hearing, pursuant to Rule 4-709, when she ordered:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   Now upon consideration of Petitioner Steven Jackson's 'Petition for DNA Testing Pursuant to MD Code Crim.

Jackson, however, in his Motion for Reduction of Sentence filed in 1994, which he ratified in his brief before us, recounted what the State recited in the Alford plea colloquy regarding what would have been proven were the case to have gone to trial:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   The Motion [for Reduction of Sentence] recapitulates that in support of the plea, the State advised the court that on October 19, 1993, the Defendant invited the complaining witness, Patricia M., back to his house after the couple had been out for drinks at two (2) bars. The State advised the court that once in the Defendant's bedroom, the Defendant told the complaining witness to be a good girl your mine, put your arms up and that the Defendant then proceeded to push the complaining witness on to the bed where he took the complaining witness' clothing off and then engaged in vaginal sex by inserting his penis into the complaining witnesses' vagina. The State advised the court that the complainant continuously told the Defendant to stop yet the Defendant persisted. The State\n   relied on a police report prepared by Officer Alexander.... In said report the complaining witness was unsure if the Defendant ejaculated or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   We evaluate whether Touch DNA testing of Patricia M.'s underwear and of laboratory microscope slides left from the SAFE exam could or would have had the scientific potential with a reasonable probability to produce exculpatory evidence of his wrongful conviction for second degree rape. In so\n   doing, we determine that Jackson's 2015 Petition was properly denied without a hearing by the Circuit Court Judge, albeit without her including factual findings; we choose not to remand for inclusion of further findings, however, because of the obvious futility of Jackson's assertions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   A conviction for second degree rape in 1993, and now, requires vaginal intercourse \"by force or threat of force against the will and without the consent of the victim[.]\"\n   <em>\n    State v.
