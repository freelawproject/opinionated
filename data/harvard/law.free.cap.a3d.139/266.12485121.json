FRIEDMAN.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   Quality Bicycle Products, Inc. (Employer) petitions for review of that portion of the July 28, 2015, order of the Workers' Compensation Appeal Board (WCAB) affirming the decision of a workers' compensation judge (WCJ) to grant James Shaw's (Claimant) claim petition. The WCJ concluded that Claimant suffered an injury in the course and scope of his employment as defined in section 301(c)(1) of the Workers' Compensation Act (Act), Act of June 2, 1915, P.L. 736,\n   <em>\n    as amended,\n   </em>\n   77 P.S. \u00a7 411(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   On December 3, 2013, Claimant filed a claim and penalty petition, alleging that he suffered a fractured right patella on November 13, 2013, while in the course and scope of his employment. (WCJ's Findings of Fact, Nos. 1-2, 3e.) On December 17, 2013, Employer filed an answer denying that the injury was work-related. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 1.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On January 29, 2014, the WCJ held a bifurcated hearing, at which the only issue was whether Claimant was within the course and scope of his employment at the time of the injury. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 2.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Claimant testified that on November 13, 2013, he was working in Employer's warehouse when he was paged over the intercom system and advised that he had a telephone call. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 3b.) Claimant's fianc\u00e9e was hysterical on the telephone and told Claimant that he needed to come home because their nine-year-old daughter was missing from school. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Claimant told his manager that he had to leave due to a family emergency. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 3c.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Claimant ran to his locker and got his coat and keys. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Claimant attempted to clock out, but the manager told Claimant that he would clock him out. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Claimant left the building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As Claimant was hurrying to his vehicle and was about 10-12 feet into the parking lot, he felt a pop in his knee and excruciating pain. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Claimant fell to the ground, unable to bear any weight on his leg. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 3c-d.) Claimant's manager and a coworker followed Claimant into the parking lot, helped him, and called an ambulance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 3e; WCJ's Op., 6/6/14, at 8.) Claimant underwent surgery on November 20, 2013. (WCJ's Findings of Fact, No. 8.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Claimant further testified that he was injured in the parking lot where he has always parked for work, where all of Claimant's coworkers park for work, and where Employer told Claimant to park for work. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 10a-c.) Claimant stated that Employer is the only tenant in the building where he works, but agreed that there are other buildings adjacent to Employer's building. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 12.) Claimant testified that people park in front of the buildings that they work in. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 13.) Claimant agreed that there was no specific condition or abnormality in the parking lot that caused his fall. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 14.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The WCJ found Claimant's testimony credible and persuasive. (\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   No. 16.) The WCJ concluded that Claimant was on Employer's premises in the course and scope of his employment at the time he was injured. (WCJ's Conclusions of Law, No. 2.) The WCJ granted Claimant's claim petition. Employer appealed to the WCAB.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The WCAB affirmed that portion of the WCJ's decision that granted Claimant's claim petition. (WCAB's Op., 7/28/15, at 1.) Employer now petitions this court for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Employer contends that the WCAB and WCJ erred in concluding that Claimant's knee injury occurred in the course and scope of his employment. Specifically, Employer asserts that Claimant was not furthering the interest of Employer's business at the time of his injury and no evidence was presented to establish that the injury was caused by a condition of Employer's premises or the operation of Employer's business thereon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In a claim petition, the claimant bears the burden of proving all of the elements necessary to support an award.\n   <em>\n    Berks County Intermediate Unit v.

Whether the claimant's injury arose in the course and scope of employment is a question of law that is determined based on the WCJ's findings of fact.\n   <em>\n    Markle v.

An employee who is not furthering the business or affairs of his employer must prove he or she is within the course of his or her employment by satisfying the following three conditions: \"(1) the injury must have occurred on the employer's premises; (2) the employee's presence thereon was required by the nature of his employment; and (3) the injury was caused\n   <em>\n    by the condition of the premises\n   </em>\n   or by the operation of the employer's business thereon.\"\n   <em>\n    Markle,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9456927\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/785/151/#p153\">\n    785 A.2d at 153\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Here, Employer agrees that Claimant satisfied the first two prongs of the test but disagrees that Claimant satisfied the third prong of the test.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Employer asserts that Claimant failed to show that his injury was caused by a condition of the premises or by the operation of Employer's business thereon.

Claimant fractured his kneecap while running across Employer's parking lot to his car. Claimant heard a popping noise and felt excruciating pain. Claimant's foot then made contact with the parking lot and he collapsed, unable to bear any weight on his leg. The parking lot did not cause or contribute to the causative chain to Claimant's injury. Further, Claimant did not allege that the parking lot caused or contributed to his injury. In fact, Claimant admitted that there was no physical condition of the parking lot that caused his injury.
