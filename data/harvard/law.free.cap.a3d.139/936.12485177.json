Vol.), which defines \"neglect\" as \"the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor's physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The statute carries a penalty of \"imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.\" Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.), Section 3-602.1(c) of the Criminal Law Article.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Beverly Annetta Hall, the Petitioner, had been convicted by a jury in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County of neglect of her minor son and was sentenced to twenty days' incarceration. Ms. Hall appealed the judgment of the Circuit Court to the Court of Special Appeals, arguing that the definition of\n   \"neglect\" contained in Section 3-602.1(a)(5)(i) of the Criminal Law Article was unconstitutionally vague and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Circuit Court, and we granted certiorari to address the following questions:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-11\">\n   1. As an issue of first impression, is Md.Code Ann., Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, the criminal neglect of a minor statute, unconstitutional because it is vague?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   2. Was the evidence sufficient to support conviction for neglect of a minor?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    Hall v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=444%20Md.%20638\">\n    444 Md. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%20766\">\n    120 A.3d 766\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). For the reasons that follow, we assume, without having to decide, that the criminal neglect of a minor statute is constitutional but reverse the judgment of the Court of Special of Appeals, because we hold that the evidence was insufficient to support Hall's conviction for criminal child neglect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Early in 2013, Beverly Hall was charged by criminal information in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County with one count of neglect of her minor son A.,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in violation of Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   ostensibly for having, over a two day period, beginning on February 24 and ending on February 26, 2012, left A. under the supervision of his fourteen-year-old sister, D. Ms. Hall filed a motion to dismiss the charge, arguing, among other things, that Section 3-602.1 was unconstitutionally vague, because the statute \"fail[ed] to inform\n   the ordinary person what conduct is prohibited by its enactment[,]\" and \"fail[ed] to delineate at which point personal parenting choices escalate to neglect, [leading] to arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.\" The motion was denied orally by the circuit court judge who remonstrated that Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article contained an \"awful broad definition of neglect,\" but determined that it was not vague:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   I understand the argument, and I understand what the defense is saying here and I guess the bottom line is you may win this argument upstairs. I don't know, but I'm not going to-I just don't find it to be void for vagueness ... I'm not going to find that the statute is void for vagueness. You know, that's something the Court of Special Appeals is going to have to do.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The evidence subsequently adduced at trial, taken in the light most favorable to the State,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   reflected that in the Fall of 2011, Ms. Hall, her fianc\u00e9, and three children-two daughters, thirteen-year-old D. and ten-year-old M., and a son, three-year-old A.-were living in a single family home on Lima Drive in Silver Spring, Maryland. Nyree Wannall, a licensed clinical social worker with Montgomery County Child Welfare, had been providing services to Ms. Hall's family since May of 2011.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Ms. Wannall would perform home visits with Ms. Hall and her family two times monthly, except during the children's summer vacation when all three visited their maternal grandmother in Florida.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Based on Ms. Wannall's observations during her home visits, three-year-old A. \"ran rampant[,]\" \"was very, very difficult to control[,]\" and was \"very active.\" Ms. Wannall described A.'s behavior as: \"[y]ou would be there during a home visit, and he would pick up something, and it wouldn't be surprising if he picked something up and threw it at his sister, or threw it at the TV, and just was always moving.\" During\n   one of Ms. Wannall's home visits in September of 2011, A. threw a bottle at his sister's face, threw a bottle at the T.V., and bit Ms. Wannall's foot. He then opened the closed front door of the residence, ran outside, and entered the truck of a postal worker who was in the neighborhood, all during the time his mother was present. D., A.'s sister, retrieved A. from the mail truck, and Ms. Hall did not attempt to control or discipline A. during this episode.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   During Ms. Wannall's home visits, she would meet with Ms. Hall and the children and would discuss \"issues that may have come up with the individuals in the house[.]\" A recurring issue raised during Ms. Wannall's discussions with Hall was that \"[D.] needed to spend her time on her studies in school, needed to be a child and not have as many responsibilities in the home[,]\" and \"[D.] having too many responsibilities with [A.]\" By February 15, 2012, Ms. Hall had agreed with Ms. Wannall that \"[A.] was too difficult for [D.] to watch [,]\" and that she \"would only allow [D.] to watch [M.], her younger sister.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   During the afternoon of Wednesday, February 22, 2012, D. (now fourteen years of age) and M. had finished the school day and went to A.'s babysitter to pick him up. After bringing A. home, D. was upstairs doing her homework, but came downstairs to find that the front door was open and A. was missing; Ms. Hall was not present at 4:30pm that day, Officer Jim Walsh, responding to a call at a different location, found A. without supervision, wearing only a t-shirt and a diaper, whereupon the Officer went looking for A.'s parents. D. and M. approached Officer Walsh and stated that they \"didn't know [A.] got out.\" Officer Walsh then brought A. back to the house on Lima Drive and retrieved Hall's phone number from\n   D. and attempted to call Ms. Hall \"at least five\" times. He was unable to contact her, and did not recall whether he had left any voicemail messages but left A. under the supervision of D. Ms. Wannall learned of this incident the following day, on February 23, 2012, but did not contact Ms. Hall, as she did not want to interfere with any investigation that might be triggered by Officer Walsh reporting the incident to Child Protective Services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   According to D., A.'s escape from the home on February 22nd was the third time that she had gone to the playground to retrieve him while he was under her supervision. On a previous occasion, although police had been notified, D. was able to retrieve A. before the police arrived at the playground. The police did follow-up, and came to the house on Lima Drive and instructed D. to have Ms. Hall contact them. D., however, did not inform Ms. Hall of any of these occasions on which A. had escaped to the playground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On Friday, the 24th of February, Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 attempted to bring the children to their godmother's home in Prince George's County, where the children would spend the weekend. Ms. Hall, however, was unable to locate the godmother and returned home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Once home, the children unpacked their belongings, placed some food in the refrigerator, and got ready for bed by taking baths and changing into their \"night clothes.\" Ms. Hall did not tell the children where she was going or how long she would be gone, but left an emergency cell phone with D. and told her to call if she needed anything. Ms. Hall also told D. that she would call her \"when she [got] to her destination, because she [had] to charge her phone.\" Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 then left at around 10:00 or 11:00 p.m., and D. locked the door behind them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Following Ms. Hall's departure, the children began watching a movie in the living room. While watching the movie, A., M., and ultimately D., fell asleep. D. then\n   awoke between midnight and 1:00 a.m. to find that A. was no longer on the couch. D. searched the house for A. to no avail and noticed\n   that the front door to the residence was open. D. attempted to call Hall three to four times, but each of the calls went straight to voicemail. D. also called the fianc\u00e9, whose phone number was programmed in the emergency phone, but no one answered. D. thought she heard someone pick up on one of them but the person on the other line hung up shortly thereafter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After failing to reach her mother, D. called the police and searched the neighborhood, while M. stayed at the house. After D. returned without having found A., she made several additional calls to the police. Two police officers, including Officer Rodney Campbell, arrived around 2:30 am and informed D. that they had found A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Shortly after 2:00 a.m., Officer Campbell had responded to a call at the intersection of New Hampshire Avenue and Hollywood Avenue (located some 300 to 400 yards from Ms. Hall's home) and encountered a gentleman pulled over on the side of the road. The man explained to Officer Campbell that he had a baby in his car and that he had almost struck the child, who had been in the middle of the six lane roadway. The child was dressed only in sweatpants and a t-shirt. Officer Campbell, after determining the child's name was A., contacted other officers and gave out A.'s name and asked whether any of the officers \"had dealt with the child before.\" Officer Walsh, who had come across A. earlier that week, arrived at the intersection and led Officer Campbell to A.'s home.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After the officers arrived at A.'s home, they attempted to call both Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9, but were unable to reach either of them. The officers then took the children, including A., to the police station where the officers again were unsuccessful in contacting Ms. Hall. As a result, the officers contacted Child Protective Services (\"CPS\") and Laura Erstling, the on-call social worker with the Montgomery County Department of Health and Human Services, Child Welfare Service Program, arrived at the police station around 3:30 a.m. Ms. Erstling instructed the officers to leave a note on the door of the home telling Ms. Hall how to reach her and how to get in touch with the children. Ms. Erstling attempted around 4:00\n   a.m. to contact Ms. Hall, but was not successful and left a voicemail detailing who she was and how Ms. Hall could reconnect with her children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Having had no success contacting Hall, Ms. Erstling drove the children to an emergency foster home at 7:30 a.m. Ms. Hall called Montgomery County Child Protective Services at 10:20 am on the morning of February 25, 2012 \"to inquire about the whereabouts of her children.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Ms. Hall then was charged with one count of criminal child neglect in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County. After an initial trial in which the jury had failed to reach a unanimous verdict, the State retried Ms. Hall. A second jury did convict Ms. Hall, after which the Judge imposed a sentence of 20 days' incarceration. Ms. Hall then noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On appeal, Ms. Hall contended that Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article was void for vagueness and that the evidence was insufficient to support her conviction. The Court of Special Appeals, in an unreported opinion,\n   <em>\n    Beverly Annetta Hall v. State of Maryland,\n   </em>\n   September Term, 2013, No. 2473 (April 21, 2015), affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The court determined that the statute was \"not vague as applied to the facts of the instant case\" because \"[Hall] was fully aware that D[.] was not a proper caregiver for A[.]\":\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   A reasonably intelligent person would not have to speculate whether leaving a three year-old alone with an improper caregiver for any length of time, much less overnight, and without an effective way to be contacted in case of an emergency, would constitute neglect as defined in the statute. The statute is not vague as applied to the facts of the instant case.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 9. The Court of Special Appeals also rejected Hall's argument that she was inadequately notified of conduct that could violate the statute:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The risk of harm to such a young child, especially one who is \"very, very difficult to control,\" is not limited to the harm that might come from the child exiting the house and wandering outside unsupervised. There are any number of\n   injuries that could foreseeably result from knowingly leaving an improperly supervised and rambunctious three year-old inside the home as well. [Hall] saw the child throw a dangerous object at people in the home and bite Ms. Wannall on the foot. [A.] also ran out of the house on the day Ms. Wannall was meeting with [Hall] for a home visit. Certainly [Hall] knew or should have known that [A.] could and did leave the house on his own.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 10-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Concerning sufficiency of the evidence, the intermediate appellate court observed that an appellate court must \" 'view[ ] the evidence, and all inferences fairly deducible from the evidence, in a light most favorable to the State.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18-19, quoting\n   <em>\n    Twine v. State,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5264229\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/395/539/#p554\">\n    395 Md. 539\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5264229\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/395/539/#p554\">\n    910 A.2d 1132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1141 (2006). The Court then remonstrated that Ms. Hall was present on at least one occasion where A. ran out of the house, and Ms. Hall had agreed that D. should not be responsible for A.'s supervision. Furthermore, \"despite this agreement, [Hall] intentionally left [D.] in charge of [A.] for an unspecified amount of time, including overnight hours, and did not answer calls in the middle of the night from [D.], nor did [Hall] answer calls or return messages from the police and CPS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19. In light of the above, the court opined that, \"there was sufficient evidence before the jury for it to find beyond a reasonable doubt that [Hall] neglected [A.] by intentionally leaving him in the care of [D.] in excess of twelve hours, without any effective means to reach her in case of an emergency.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Ms. Hall, before us, initially raises the issue that the \"neglect of a minor statute is unconstitutionally vague on its face and as applied to the particular facts of this case[.]\" Because we shall hold that there was not sufficient evidence to sustain Ms. Hall's conviction under Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article, the criminal child neglect statute, we need not reach the constitutional issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The criminal neglect statute, Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article, provides, in relevant part, that \" 'Neglect' means the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor's physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\" Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.), Section 3-602.1(a)(1) (5)(i) of the Criminal Law Article.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The intentional failure relates to that\n   of \"[a] parent, family member, household member, or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Although the Court of Special Appeals correctly characterized intent only with reference to whether Ms. Hall failed to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical health of A., throughout its opinion the court speculated as to the harm that could have befallen A. because of his having been left by Ms. Hall in the care of his fourteen-year-old sister. It is not conjecture about potential harm, however, that governs, but rather whether the conduct at issue, evaluated objectively, created a substantial risk of harm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs ... of a minor\n   <em>\n    that\n   </em>\n   creates a substantial risk of harm ...\" is the pivotal statutory phrase. \"[C]reates a substantial risk\" in Section 3-602.1(a)(5)(i) is the same language used in our reckless endangerment statute, Section 3-204 of the Criminal Law Article, Maryland Code (2012 Repl. Vol.), which states, in relevant part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (a) A person may not recklessly:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (1) engage in conduct that\n   <em>\n    creates a substantial risk\n   </em>\n   of death or serious physical injury to another.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The similarity between Section 3-602.1, the criminal child neglect statute, and the reckless endangerment statute, Section 3-204, was noted in testimony in 2011 against the passage of Senate Bill 178, the origin of Section 3-602.1, provided by Melissa S. Rock of Advocates for Children and Youth,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   who suggested that the proposed child neglect statute was unnecessary because, \"[w]e also have a reckless endangerment statute through which a person can be prosecuted for placing another individual at a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury.\" The Office of the Public Defender provided similar testimony in opposition to S.B. 178, arguing that the bill \"[was] largely duplicative of existing law\" by referencing, among other statutes, Section 3-204 of the Criminal Law Article, the reckless endangerment statute, which states that the crime of reckless endangerment is a person acting \"recklessly\" by \"engag[ing] in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious physical injury to another.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   We set forth the elements of a\n   <em>\n    prima facie\n   </em>\n   case of reckless endangerment in\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

The evidence, however, taken in the light most favorable to the State was insufficient to satisfy the standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   Ms. Hall left her three year-old son, A., a child who was, admittedly, difficult to handle, in the overnight care of his fourteen year-old sister, D., after ensuring that he had been fed and was ready to go to bed. After Ms. Hall and her fianc\u00e9 departed, the door to the house was locked and the children, including A. and D., fell asleep.

Majority op. at 320, 139 A.3d at 937. In my view, the former holding necessarily entails a decision that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague. For the Court to hold that the evidence is insufficient to support a guilty verdict, the Court must conclude that no rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\n   <em>\n    Moye v.

For the reasons that Judge Hotten's dissent ably explains, I do not believe that the statute is unconstitutionally vague. However, for the reasons that the Majority Opinion elucidates, I do not believe the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   <em>\n    A Before-the-Fact Standard\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Additionally, I understand the Majority Opinion to apply a before-the-fact standard, rather than an after-the-fact standard. According to the statute, we must examine whether Ms. Hall's actions created a \"substantial risk\" of harm to A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Maryland Code, Criminal Law Article, \u00a7 3-602.1. We must guard against considering the risk of a harm to be substantial merely because we know, after the fact, that some harm materialized. The proper inquiry is whether the risk should be considered substantial at the time that the\n   parent or other caretaker acted. One who creates a very small risk of harm to a child is not criminally negligent simply because an unforeseeable tragedy follows. On the other hand, a parent or caretaker may be criminally negligent when that individual creates a substantial risk of harm, whether or not the harm actually befalls the child. In this case, this standard means that we consider what Ms. Hall could be reasonably expected to foresee as possible outcomes of leaving A. at home with D. Whether A. in fact ran out of the house afterward or stayed on the couch sleeping all night is not relevant; what matters is whether Ms. Hall's actions created a substantial risk, not what\n   harm actually ensued. I understand the Majority Opinion's analysis to apply this standard, so I concur.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Chief Judge BARBERA has indicated that she joins this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   HOTTEN, J., dissenting, in which GREENE and WATTS, JJ., join.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion.

Law \u00a7 3-602.1 (emphasis added), the term \"physical needs,\" will determine \"necessary assistance and resources\" in a given case. The term \"needs,\" when used as a noun, is defined as the \"physiological or psychological requirements for the well-being of an organism.\" M. WEBSTER'S NEW COLLEGIATE DICTIONARY 829 (11th ed. 2008). Thus, the term \"physical needs\" simply excludes the \"psychological requirements,\" and includes basic requirements for physical well-being of a child, like shelter, safety, food, supervision, clothing, water or sanitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The common understanding of \"physical needs\" is confirmed by the General Assembly's use of similar terms in Maryland's elder abuse and neglect statute, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604(a)(7)(i). In addition, case law interpreting the term \"neglect\" in Maryland's\n   Child In Need of Assistance statute, Md. Code (2006 Repl. Vol. 2013), \u00a7 3-801(s) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings (\"Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc.\") Article, provides additional notice of what is encompassed by the term \"neglect\" in the case at bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Similar to the child neglect statute, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604(a)(7)(i) defines \"neglect\" of a vulnerable adult as the:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of a vulnerable adult, including:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   1. food;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   2. clothing;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-119\">\n   3. toileting;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-120\">\n   4. essential medical treatment;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-121\">\n   5. shelter; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-122\">\n   6. supervision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Although Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 contains no specific examples of what is included amongst the \"physical needs of a minor,\" the specific examples of \"the physical needs of a vulnerable adult\" confirm the types of essentials that are encompassed by the common understanding of \"physical needs.\" According to Petitioner, the General Assembly's decision to define what is necessary for the physical needs and resources of a vulnerable adult also indicates that the term \"necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs\" is a vague term. However, several out-of-state courts, in addressing vagueness challenges, have looked to definitions provided in related statutes to determine whether there is notice of a term's meaning in the law at issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

A \"vulnerable adult\" is defined in terms of a condition-\"an adult who lacks the physical or mental capacity to provide for the adult's daily needs[,]\" Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604(a)(10) -so there is likely a somewhat finite understanding of what is required for the physical needs of such a person. To the contrary, a minor (anyone under the age of 18) is defined by reference to age, and there are minors within this range that require drastically different levels/types of assistance to meet their physical needs. Therefore, the term \"necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs\" is susceptible to a definition with concrete examples in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-604, but not in Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   The amendments made to S.B. 178 (Md. 2011), which ultimately created Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, reveal that the General Assembly recognized the difficulty involved in drafting legislation comprehensive enough to encompass all that is necessary for the physical needs of a minor, as compared to a vulnerable adult. As S.B. 178 was originally introduced in the Senate, \"neglect\" was defined in the exact same manner as the vulnerable adult statute: \"the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs of a minor, including:\"\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   (I) Food\n   (II) Clothing\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   (III) Toileting\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   (IV) Essential Medical treatment\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   (V) Shelter; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   (VI) Supervision\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   S.B. 178 (as introduced and first read in the Senate, January 24, 2011) (capitalization omitted). However, S.B. 178 was subsequently approved with amendments by the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, which deleted the \"laundry list (food, clothing, toileting, essential medical treatment, shelter or, or supervision)[,]\" and instead \"require[d] that the failure to provide creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor's physical or mental health[.]\" SENATE JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS COMMITTEE: FLOOR REPORT, S.B. 178 at 1 (Md. 2011). This comprehensive definition of \"neglect\" in S.B. 178 was ultimately signed into law, and the decision to deviate from the definition of \"neglect\" in the vulnerable adult statute evidences the General Assembly's intent to encompass a range of conduct that was not limited by the \"laundry list\" used in the vulnerable adult statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Williams,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2016037\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/329/1/#p9\">\n    329 Md. at 13\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2016037\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/329/1/#p9\">\n    616 A.2d at 1280-81\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that \"all broad laws attempting to punish a range of criminal conduct\" are not \"susceptible to vagueness challenges insofar as they could be drawn more narrowly and precisely.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In addition to the vulnerable adult statute, \"neglect\" is also defined in a similar fashion in the Maryland Child In Need of Assistance (\"CINA\") statute. Cts. &amp; Jud. Proc. \u00a7 3-801(s). Petitioner contends that the body of law addressing \"neglect\" in CINA cases is of limited relevance because Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 is a criminal statute designed to punish caregivers, whereas a CINA proceeding is a civil proceeding that serves to protect minors. Petitioner also notes that the language of the statutes are different. It is true that a criminal proceeding serves an interest not necessarily served by a CINA proceeding because \"the legislative intention underlying a CINA proceeding is not to punish the parent[.]\"\n   <em>\n    In re Blessen H.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3042713\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/392/684/#p707\">\n    392 Md. 684\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 707-09,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3042713\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/392/684/#p707\">\n    898 A.2d 980\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 994 (2006)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    In re John P. and Thomas P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071810\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/311/700/\">\n    311 Md. 700\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -709,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2071810,2071804\" index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/537/263/\">\n    537 A.2d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 268 (1988) ). Furthermore, while the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies to both criminal and civil statutes, the Supreme Court has noted that the U.S. Constitution is more tolerant of vagueness in civil enactments than criminal enactments.\n   <em>\n    Vill. of Hoffman Estates v.

Law \u00a7 3-602.1 both serve the legitimate State interest of protecting Maryland children. Additionally, although the results of the two proceedings will be different, each constitutes an interference with the fundamental constitutional right of a parent to raise their child how they see fit.\n   <em>\n    In Re Yve S.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739025\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/373/551/#p565\">\n    373 Md. 551\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 565,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"739048,739025\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/819/1030/\">\n    819 A.2d 1030\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1038-39 (2003) (discussing the fundamental rights of a parent in relation to their child). Thus, notice of the conduct sufficient to constitute neglect under the CINA statute is certainly relevant in providing notice of the conduct comprising criminal neglect, as the statutes are related in both purpose and result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   CINA refers to \"a child who requires court intervention because: (1) [t]he child has been abused, has been neglected, has a developmental disability, or has a mental disorder; and (2) [t]he child's parents, guardian, or custodian are unable or unwilling to give proper care and attention to the child and the child's needs.\" Cts. &amp; Jud.

This standard also provides a safeguard against the use of hindsight to prosecute caregivers in scenarios where a minimum risk of harm materializes, notwithstanding the reasonableness of the caregiver's actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In light of the above, I would hold that the standard of conduct prescribed by Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 could be fairly understood by Petitioner. As discussed in further detail in Section I,\n   <em>\n    supra,\n   </em>\n   Petitioner was fully aware that A. was a difficult child, and conceded that it was inappropriate for D. to supervise A. Petitioner would therefore have been placed on notice that leaving A. with D. overnight, without any way for D. to contact Petitioner, would likely deprive A. of the necessities for his physical well-being, and that doing so was not \"objectively reasonable[.]\" Maj. Op. at 335, 139 A.3d at 945.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   I would further hold that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 provided a fixed standard that, from the perspective of law enforcement, was clearly applicable to Petitioner's conduct. According to\n   Petitioner, the fact that Officer Walsh, after finding A. at the playground without supervision on February 22, 2012, returned A. home with only D. and M. present, \"illustrates the lack of guidance the statute provides to law enforcement.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   To the contrary, I believe law enforcement's actions were reflective of the scienter requirement in the child neglect statute. As discussed in detail above, Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 required that Petitioner should have foreseen that her conduct would likely result in the \"failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs ... of a minor [.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1(a)(5)(i). In light of this\n   <em>\n    mens rea\n   </em>\n   requirement, it is highly likely that law enforcement personnel, in this case Officer Walsh, would not know that a crime had been committed until more circumstances regarding an individual case were ascertained. This is because a child may be found in a situation where, despite the absence of criminal neglect, there was a substantial risk to the child's physical health. Therefore, it is entirely reasonable that Officer Walsh, when discovering A. at the park, would not know that a crime has been committed until he became aware of the circumstances that reflected a lack of child supervision. Accordingly, there was no reason to believe that a law enforcement officer who returned A. to D.'s supervision, and waited to consult with social workers before pursuing charges under Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1, was left without \"adequate guidelines\" for enforcement of the statute. Officer Walsh's actions simply reflect that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 insulates innocent parenting mistakes from criminal liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   In summation, I would hold that Crim. Law \u00a7 3-602.1 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to Petitioner, and that the evidence was sufficient to sustain Petitioner's conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   GREENE and WATTS, JJ., authorized me to state they join in this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-154\">\n    Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article provides:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-155\">\n    (a)(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-156\">\n    (2) \"Family member\" has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-157\">\n    (3) \"Household member\" has the meaning stated in \u00a7 3-601 of this subtitle.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    (4) \"Mental injury\" means the substantial impairment of a minor's mental or psychological ability to function.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-159\">\n    (5)(i) \"Neglect\" means the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor's physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-160\">\n    (ii) \"Neglect\" does not include the failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor when the failure is due solely to a lack of financial resources or homelessness.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-161\">\n    (b) A parent, family member, household member, or other person who has permanent or temporary care or custody or responsibility for the supervision of a minor may not neglect the minor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-162\">\n    (c) A person who violates this section is guilty of the misdemeanor of child neglect and on conviction is subject to imprisonment not exceeding 5 years or a fine not exceeding $5,000 or both.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-163\">\n    (d) A sentence imposed under this section shall be in addition to any other sentence imposed for a conviction arising from the same facts and circumstances unless the evidence required to prove each crime is substantially identical.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-164\">\n    We shall refer to Hall's minor children by their first initials only.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-165\">\n    Section 3-602.1 of the Criminal Law Article provides, in relevant part:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-166\">\n    (a)(1) In this section the following words have the meanings indicated.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-167\">\n    * * *\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-168\">\n    (5)(i) \"Neglect\" means the intentional failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor that creates a substantial risk of harm to the minor's physical health or a substantial risk of mental injury to the minor.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n    (ii) \"Neglect\" does not include the failure to provide necessary assistance and resources for the physical needs or mental health of a minor when the failure is due solely to a lack of financial resources or homelessness.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-170\">\n    We have stated that, when reviewing a conviction to determine the sufficiency of the evidence, \"the critical inquiry on review of the sufficiency of the evidence to support a criminal conviction is whether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n    <em>\n     Smith v.
