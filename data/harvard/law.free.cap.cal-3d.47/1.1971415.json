(Pen. Code, \u00a7 190.1 et seq.; see <em>id., </em>\u00a7 1239, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>subd. (b).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Defendant was convicted of kidnapping for the purpose of robbery (\u00a7 209), robbery (\u00a7211) and first degree murder (\u00a7\u00a7 187, 189). The jury found true the firearm-use allegations (\u00a7 12022.5) and the special circumstance allegations that the murder had been committed during a robbery and a kidnapping (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i), (ii)). In a separate proceeding the jury also found true the special circumstance allegation that defendant had previously been convicted of a first degree murder. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2).) The jury fixed punishment at death. The court ordered the prison terms imposed on the kidnapping for robbery and robbery charges stayed pending imposition of the death penalty. We affirm the judgment in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-4\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b42-5\">I. Guilt Phase</p>\n<p id=\"b42-6\">Myrtle Benham was beaten to death in an abandoned shack in the desert near Daggett, California, on March 20, 1981. The San Bernardino Sheriff\u2019s Department found her body one week later. She was lying face down and nude below the waist. Some of her clothing was around her left foot.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-7\">In a seemingly unrelated incident, defendant and Michael Crenshaw were arrested on March 24, 1981, in San Jose. Two San Jose police officers observed Crenshaw and defendant sleeping in a car while the engine was running. When the officers approached the car and asked defendant, the driver, to get out, defendant drove away, knocking one officer to the ground. Defendant and Crenshaw were arrested after a high speed chase that culminated in their car colliding with a police car.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-8\">During the chase a .25-caliber Raven automatic pistol was thrown from the car. A .25-caliber Galesi pistol was found under the driver\u2019s seat. Credit cards in the names of Minnie Ola White and Jim Rankin were found in the car, as were two tape recorders belonging to Jim Rankin. When defendant was booked, he had in his possession rings belonging to Benham and White.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-9\"><em>Prosecution Evidence. </em>Crenshaw testified at the preliminary hearing, but at trial asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege and refused to testify. The court determined Crenshaw was unavailable as a witness and allowed his preliminary hearing testimony to be read to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-10\">Crenshaw testified he and defendant were driving from Las Vegas on March 20, 1981, when they stopped in Baker at an Exxon gas station where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Benham worked. Defendant emerged from the car with a pistol in each hand, took the money and cash drawer from the register and ordered Benham into the car trunk. Defendant eventually stopped the car near a shack in the desert and told Crenshaw he was going to \u201ctake the lady inside\u201d and have sex with her. When Crenshaw later went inside the shack, he saw defendant, his pants down, lying on top of Benham. Benham was face down, nude below the waist. Defendant hit her in the head with a pipe, then left the area with Crenshaw. After driving to Barstow, the two burned the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Much of Crenshaw\u2019s testimony was corroborated by Charles Laughlin, who claimed to have spoken with defendant on several occasions while the two were in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-6\">Evidence was admitted showing defendant had been convicted of the first degree murder of White. On March 21, 1981, the day after the Benham murder, White\u2019s body was found 14 miles north of Blythe (near Vidal Junction, California) in the trunk of her car. She had been killed by a bullet from the Raven automatic pistol thrown from the car during the March 24 chase in San Jose. A piece of skin tissue consistent with White\u2019s blood type was found on defendant\u2019s trousers when he was arrested. Laughlin testified defendant told him that while driving to California he and Crenshaw had noticed an apparently abandoned car. When they approached the car they found an elderly woman in the front seat. They forced her into the trunk, shot her and took her money and valuables.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">At the time defendant and Crenshaw kidnapped Benham, they were driving a car belonging to Rankin. Rankin was last seen at a Kansas City restaurant on March 18, 1981. Laughlin testified defendant told him about kidnapping a man in Kansas City, putting the man in the trunk of his own car, taking his money and jewelry and then driving off to California.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">Leroy Combs testified that when he saw defendant on March 11, 1981, he was alone and in possession of two firearms\u2014the Raven and Galesi pistols.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-9\"><em>Defense Evidence. </em>The defense introduced evidence of a polygraph test indicating defendant did not himself kill Benham, but he had been present. Evidence was also presented that Crenshaw had pleaded guilty to the first degree murder of White.</p>\n<p id=\"b43-10\">Defendant testified in his own behalf. He admitted he had escaped from Monterey County jail and on March 11, 1981, had kidnapped Combs. Defendant forced Combs to drive to Los Angeles and later placed him in the trunk of the car. After the Combs kidnapping he took a Greyhound bus <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>to St. Louis, Missouri to meet Crenshaw, who lived in nearby Berkeley. He hitchhiked from the Greyhound station to Crenshaw\u2019s house. His plan was to have the two work their way back to California through various robberies and thefts. Although both pistols belonged to him, he carried the Galesi and gave Crenshaw the Raven.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-4\">He and Crenshaw stole Rankin\u2019s car from a Kansas City restaurant for transportation to California. The theft was defendant\u2019s idea. Rankin had left the keys in the car and gone off with a woman in another car. En route to California they drove through Las Vegas to snatch a purse for money; defendant snatched the purse.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Crenshaw and he robbed the Exxon station together. Defendant was the first to pull his weapon and demand money. Afterward, Crenshaw and Benham got into the backseat of the car. Benham was never in the trunk. Defendant drove to the deserted shack to let Benham go. Crenshaw took her into the shack to tie her up and leave her. When Crenshaw returned a few minutes later, he made no mention of raping or killing Benham. Defendant and Crenshaw then drove to Barstow, where defendant stole another car and the two burned Rankin\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-6\">With defendant using Rankin\u2019s credit card in Vidal Junction to pay for gas, the two returned to Las Vegas before turning back towards Los Angeles. While Crenshaw drove, defendant fell asleep. He later awoke near Blythe to find Crenshaw gone and the car parked on a side road. Defendant did not know that White had been killed in the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-7\">Defendant denied Laughlin\u2019s testimony and claimed all of Laughlin\u2019s information resulted from his having gone through defendant\u2019s papers and police reports while the two were in jail together.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-8\">II. Penalty Phase Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b44-9\"><em>Prosecution Evidence. </em>At the penalty phase the prosecution introduced evidence that on March 10, 1981, defendant and one Olden robbed a service station in Arroyo Grande, California. Michael Buss, the attendant, testified Olden wielded a shotgun while defendant ripped out the telephone and took the keys to Buss\u2019s fiancee\u2019s car.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-10\">On March 17, 1981, William Parr, a St. Louis, Missouri cab driver, was dispatched to a building near the Greyhound depot. His body was found in a park several hours later, a bullet through his brain. The bullet came from defendant\u2019s Galesi firearm. Parr\u2019s taxicab was found abandoned near Crenshaw\u2019s residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Thomas Smith, an inmate at Chino State prison, testified that on his arrival at the prison defendant advised him how to protect himself from other inmates and offered him a weapon. Defendant subsequently told Smith he was part of a group that would protect him if Smith would allow its members to sodomize him. Defendant told Smith he had \u201cno choice.\u201d Thereafter defendant held Smith\u2019s head while another man sodomized him. Members of the group subsequently kicked and choked Smith; he did not know if defendant participated in the beating.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">Inmate Laughlin testified to Rankin\u2019s death. Defendant told Laughlin he placed Rankin in the trunk of Rankin\u2019s vehicle, then later let him out and made him plead for his life before shooting him. Defendant partially covered Rankin\u2019s body with dirt and a vinyl tarp. Defendant told Laughlin that Rankin \u201cwas made to beg for his life and he filled his head with lead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\"><em>Defense Evidence. </em>Defendant presented evidence Smith had given inconsistent statements concerning defendant\u2019s part in the sodomy attack on him. Defendant also presented evidence he was not involved in the attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-7\">Terry Caylor, an incarcerated felon, testified Laughlin said he would not have to stand trial in his own case because he was going to testify against defendant. Laughlin told Caylor he and Crenshaw had a \u201cdeal\u201d and he could get all the information he needed from Crenshaw. Caylor saw Laughlin and Crenshaw talking together. The parties stipulated that the escape charge pending against Laughlin had been reviewed and dismissed by a prison review board for insufficient evidence and no further action was taken on the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-8\">The testimony of George Gunn, a Missouri state court justice, at defendant\u2019s Riverside trial for the murder of White was presented. Defendant and a companion robbed Gunn in Missouri in 1979. Defendant\u2019s companion held a revolver to Gunn\u2019s face with the hammer cocked. After the two took Gunn\u2019s money, defendant returned Gunn\u2019s glasses before fleeing.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-9\">Defendant\u2019s family members and numerous teachers and counselors testified to his background and difficult childhood. Defendant was the product of an interracial marriage, which subjected him to racial epithets and left him confused about his identity. His father\u2019s military career led to an unstable family life, with his father, a harsh authoritarian, frequently absent for long periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-10\">Defendant had significant learning and social problems in school, but the schools lacked the resources to give him the help he needed. Expert testimony indicated defendant had some brain damage that affected his behavior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>and personality. He was a hyperkinetic child and continues to suffer from an attention deficit disorder, but he could function in the structured prison environment. Defendant tends to be a follower, not a leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Defendant was close and affectionate with his family. He has fathered two children; he married the mother of one.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">I. Guilt Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">A. <em>Denial of Representative and Impartial Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Defendant contends the exclusion of some potential jurors for cause in accord with <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1968) 391 U.S. 510 [20 L.Ed.2d 776, 88 S.Ct. 1770] denied him his due process and Sixth Amendment rights to an impartial and representative jury. The United States Supreme Court has rejected these contentions <em>(Lockhart </em>v. <em>McCree </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 162 [90 L.Ed.2d 137, 106 S.Ct. 1758]), as have we (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 660, 679 [248 Cal.Rptr. 69, 755 P.2d 253]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 58, 60 [210 Cal.Rptr. 777, 694 P.2d 1149]).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-9\">B. <em>Disclosing Prior-murder-conviction Special Circumstance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b46-10\">Defendant offered to stipulate to the prior-murder conviction underlying the prior-murder-conviction special-circumstance allegation (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(2)) to keep it from the jury before trial. The court rejected the stipulation on grounds it was precluded by article I, section 28, subdivision (f) of the California Constitution (Proposition 8), which provides that \u201c[w]hen a prior felony conviction is an element of any felony offense, it shall be proven to the trier of fact in open court.\u201d As the Attorney General concedes, however, because the charged murder in this case occurred before June 9, 1982, Proposition 8 has no application. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 251 [193 Cal.Rptr. 692, 667 P.2d 149].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>Defendant asserts the court erred in rejecting the stipulation. Citing section 1093,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>section 190.1,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 143 [167 Cal.Rptr. 844, 616 P.2d 826] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Bracamonte </em>(1981) 119 Cal.App.3d 644 [174 Cal.Rptr. 191], he argues he had both a statutory and constitutional due process right to a bifurcated trial on the truth of the prior-murder-conviction special-circumstance allegation.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-5\">Assuming, without deciding, that the court erred in refusing defendant\u2019s stipulation, the error was harmless in light of our determination, <em>post </em>at pages 20-22 that evidence of the prior murder was properly admitted at trial. Moreover, in light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s guilt of the Benham murder, it is not reasonably probable a result more favorable to defendant would have been reached had the jury not been informed of the prior-murder conviction. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b47-6\">C. <em>Admission of Uncharged Crimes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b47-7\">Defendant asserts error in the admission of evidence of the Riverside murder of White, the robbery and kidnapping of Rankin and the kidnapping of Combs.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-8\">The principles governing admission of uncharged crimes are well established. \u201cEvidence of other crimes or prior bad acts is inadmissible solely to prove an accused had the predisposition to commit the charged offense. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (a); <em>People </em>v. <em>Alcala </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 604, 631 [205 Cal.Rptr. 775, 685 P.2d 1126]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Willoughby </em>(1985) 164 Cal.App.3d 1054, 1062 [210 Cal.Rptr. 880].) However, the evidence may be admitted when it is relevant to prove another issue in the case such as opportunity, intent, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 1101, subd. (b).) Because of its inflammatory impact, evidence relevant on one of these theories should be excluded when it is \u2018not relevant to an issue expressly in dispute [citation], . . . \u201cmerely cumulative . . .\u201d [citations], or . . . more prejudicial than probative under all the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>stances. [Citations.]\u2019 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Alcala, supra, </em>at pp. 631-632. Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, 314-318 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883].)\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda </em>(1987) 44 Cal.3d 57, 82-83 [241 Cal.Rptr. 594, 744 P.2d 1127].)  In sum, to be admissible, evidence of other crimes must be relevant to some material fact in issue, must have a tendency to prove that fact, and must not contravene other policies limiting admission, such as Evidence Code section 352. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 86, 109 [246 Cal.Rptr. 245, 753 P.2d 37]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 303, 315-318 [165 Cal.Rptr. 289, 611 P.2d 883].)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">1. <em>The Rankin Offenses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b48-6\">Defendant acknowledges evidence concerning the Kansas City theft of Rankin\u2019s car and credit cards was admissible as intertwined with the charged crimes, in that Rankin\u2019s car was used to transport Benham to the scene of her murder and defendant used his credit cards to buy gas in Vidal Junction. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Viniegra </em>(1982) 130 Cal.App.3d 577, 582 [181 Cal.Rptr. 848].)  Defendant argues the court erred in failing to sever from the admissible evidence the further evidence of Rankin\u2019s kidnapping and murder\u2014his murder implied from evidence he was never seen again after defendant stole his car. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dabb </em>(1948) 32 Cal.2d 491, 500 [197 P.2d 1]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Haston </em>(1968) 69 Cal.2d 233, 245 [70 Cal.Rptr. 419, 444 P.2d 91].)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Before allowing Laughlin to testify to defendant\u2019s jailhouse statements, the trial court ruled admissible evidence concerning the circumstances of the taking of Rankin\u2019s car, including when he was last seen, but ruled inadmissible evidence Rankin is missing or was murdered. Contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion the court did not weigh the evidence\u2019s prejudicial effect against its probative value (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352), the court expressly recognized the \u201cserious consequences\u201d of admitting evidence of the Rankin offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-9\">Thereafter, asked by the prosecutor what defendant had told him about the circumstances surrounding the theft of a car, Laughlin replied defendant said he had stolen a vehicle from a male in the parking lot of a restaurant in Kansas City, had taken money and jewelry from him, and had then placed him in the trunk of the car and left. Defense counsel did not object. Rankin\u2019s wife testified the blue Buick used in the crime resembled her husband\u2019s and identified the stolen credit cards as his. He normally kept the cards in his wallet, which he kept in his pants pocket. He was due back from Kansas City March 20, 1981, but she has not seen him since.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-10\">We believe in its ruling the trial court properly severed the most prejudicial aspects of the Rankin incident from the most relevant portions. (See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number><em>People </em>v. <em>Dabb, supra, </em>32 Cal.2d at p. 500.) Admission of the kidnapping evidence was not error. That defendant had kidnapped Rankin was part of the circumstances of the theft of his car and credit cards and as such was relevant. Although Mrs. Rankin\u2019s testimony she had not seen her husband since March 1981 arguably suggested Rankin was missing, the testimony was not in violation of the court\u2019s ruling, nor did defense counsel object. The evidence, in any event, fell far short of establishing Rankin was dead or had been murdered, nor did the prosecutor exploit the issue. Any error therefore was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-5\">Defendant contends it was prejudicial for the prosecutor to put Rankin\u2019s wife on the stand\u2014\u201cto parade family members of murder victims before the jury.\u201d Mrs. Rankin\u2019s testimony concerning the Buick and the credit cards, however, was relevant and she clearly was the logical witness to establish these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-6\">2. <em>The Combs Kidnapping.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b49-7\">On March 11, 1981, Combs was kidnapped by defendant at gunpoint and forced to drive from Santa Maria to Los Angeles, where defendant placed him in the trunk of his car, but subsequently let him go. The trial court ruled Combs could testify to defendant\u2019s possession of both revolvers (the Raven and the Galesi), but evidence of the kidnapping should be excluded. The evidence came in, however, during cross-examination of defendant, after he denied on direct having been convicted of any serious crimes of violence. Defendant acknowledges defense counsel\u2019s question about his convictions opened the door for the prosecutor to cross-examine defendant on the kidnapping, notwithstanding lack of a conviction for the offense. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 26 Cal.3d 814, 833-834 [163 Cal.Rptr. 601, 608 P.2d 689], vacated <em>California </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 449 U.S. 810 [66 L.Ed.2d 13, 101 S.Ct. 57], reiterated <em>People </em>v. <em>Lanphear </em>(1980) 28 Cal.3d 463 [171 Cal.Rptr. 505, 622 P.2d 950].) He claims, however, counsel was incompetent for creating the situation that permitted the prosecutor to elicit evidence of the other crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-8\">The record shows that in asking defendant about his criminal history, defense counsel misspoke. Although counsel asked defendant, \u201cHave you ever been convicted of any serious crimes of violence such as rape or mayhem or murder or anything like that?\u201d he intended to ask only whether or not defendant \u201chad ever killed anybody or raped or committed murder\u201d; indeed, until the court corrected him, this is the question counsel believed he had asked. Such a slip of the tongue does not, in our view, establish ineffective assistance of counsel.  The issue, in any event, is whether counsel\u2019s error prejudiced defendant. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Fosselman </em>(1983) 33 Cal.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>572, 584 [189 Cal.Rptr. 855, 659 P.2d 1144]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 412, 415 [152 Cal.Rptr. 732, 590 P.2d 859, 2 A.L.R.4th 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-5\">Although the Combs kidnapping tended to suggest defendant played a dominant role in the Benham kidnapping, in that both victims were placed in the trunk of a car, it also strongly reinforced defendant\u2019s defense that, on his own, he did not commit homicides. At defense counsel\u2019s request the jury heard Combs\u2019s prior testimony at defendant\u2019s Riverside trial, wherein Combs related how defendant, on placing him in the trunk, asked if he could breathe and later, during a stop for gasoline, asked if he was \u201cokay\u201d and ultimately released him unharmed. In light of all the other evidence connecting defendant to the Benham crime, including his admission of robbing Benham at the gas station and driving the car to the murder site, his possession of her rings, and Laughlin\u2019s testimony to his confession, it is not reasonably probable a determination more favorable to defendant would have resulted in the absence of counsel\u2019s improvident question. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 425; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 584; see <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington </em>(1984) 466 U.S. 668, 693-694 [80 L.Ed.2d 674, 697, 104 S.Ct. 2052].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-6\">3. <em>The White Murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">White\u2019s body was found one day after and in the same general desert area as Benham\u2019s abduction. Defendant asserts admission of White\u2019s murder was error. We disagree. The evidence, rather, was admissible on the issues of intent and identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">One theory of the prosecution\u2019s case was that defendant personally, wilfully and with premeditation and deliberation, killed Benham. Proof of this theory required that defendant be identified as the actual killer and his intent be proved. Another theory was that defendant aided and abetted Crenshaw in the killing. This theory, too, required proof of defendant\u2019s knowledge and intent. Hence, identity and intent were material issues of importance (see, e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 731, 748-749 [209 Cal.Rptr. 328, 691 P.2d 994, 64 A.L.R.4th 723]), relating to facts actually in dispute (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Thompson, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 315). (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 1222, 1270-1271 [232 Cal.Rptr. 849, 729 P.2d 115] [details of former crimes admissible to show identity and intent].)</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">Defendant cites <em>People </em>v. <em>Bigelow, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 731 for the proposition that even if intent were an issue, the White murder was not probative of his intent and hence was irrelevant. In <em>Bigelow </em>the defendant was convicted of first degree murder with felony-murder special circumstances for a murder committed with an accomplice. Evidence of defendant\u2019s two prior rob<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>beries with the accomplice, in which defendant wielded the weapon, was admitted at the guilt phase. On appeal the Attorney General argued the two uncharged offenses were admissible to prove defendant\u2019s identity as the triggerman in the charged offenses. We concluded otherwise. The only common marks, we observed, were defendant\u2019s presence and that the victim was ordered to lie down. The first, we stated, was immaterial, since the defendant\u2019s presence is not part of any modus operandi, and the second was not sufficiently distinctive to justify admissibility. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 749.) Here, too, defendant argues, the offenses were too dissimilar to raise an inference of identity or intent: Benham was kidnapped, White was not; Benham was beaten to death, White was shot; there was evidence of a sexual assault in connection with Benham\u2019s death, there was none as to White.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The record shows, however, substantial and distinctive similarities between the offenses. Elderly women, alone and vulnerable, were the victims in each. Their murders occurred in isolated desert areas. Items of personal property, including jewelry, were taken in both and were subsequently found in defendant\u2019s possession. A weapon belonging to defendant was used in the White murder and the Benham robbery. In each the victim at some point was placed in the trunk of a car. In each, significantly, the victim was considerably heavier than Crenshaw, who weighed only about 120 pounds and was several inches shorter than defendant\u2014White weighed 180 pounds and Benham was a notably \u201clarge\u201d woman. Arson to destroy evidence was involved in both, as defendant burned the Buick used to transport Benham and burned White\u2019s purse. On these facts, the White offense shared sufficient distinctive common marks with the Benham offense to raise an inference of identity, knowledge and intent. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Robbins </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 867, 879-880 [248 Cal.Rptr. 172, 755 P.2d 355]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Thornton </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 738, 756 [114 Cal.Rptr. 467, 523 P.2d 267], disapproved on other grounds in <em>People </em>v. <em>Flannel </em>(1979) 25 Cal.3d 668, 684, fn. 12 [160 Cal.Rptr. 84, 603 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b51-6\">Defendant argues that even if the White murder was relevant, the court abused its discretion in failing to weigh prejudice against probative value. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 352; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1, 25-26 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468].) Although the court did not expressly weigh the prejudicial effect of the White murder against its probative value, the record is clear the court understood its duty to make such a determination and impliedly did so. Defense counsel argued Evidence Code section 352 to the court; preliminary to its ruling the court observed that \u201cThis is probably the area where the Court can come the closest to committing some kind of error because it\u2019s the area that provides for the greatest leeway of interpretation, I suppose, as to what the law is. [fl] The words are simple, but when you begin to apply those words, it becomes very complex;\u201d and immediately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>after its ruling admitting the White evidence, the court, in ruling on the Rankin offenses, expressly referred to the prejudicial effect of the evidence under section 352. After trial, in ruling on defendant\u2019s new trial motion, the court again recognized \u201cthe fine line in this area of uncharged offenses\u201d and stated that from its research at the time of its rulings it was convinced the material admitted was of evidentiary value although \u201chighly prejudicial to the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">The foregoing suffices to satisfy the requirement that the record \u201caffirmatively show that the trial judge did in fact weigh prejudice against probative value\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d at p. 25) so as to permit meaningful appellate review and ensure that the ruling on the motion is \u201c \u2018the product of a mature and careful reflection on the part of the judge,\u2019 . . .\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>Any error, therefore, in the court\u2019s failure expressly to state on the record its determination that the probative value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial value, on this record is nonprejudicial. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Frank </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 711, 731-732 [214 Cal.Rptr. 801, 700 P.2d 415].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">4. <em>Standard of Prejudice.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Castro </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 301 [211 Cal.Rptr. 719, 696 P.2d 111], defendant maintains that as with error in admitting priors for impeachment purposes, error in admitting other-crimes evidence for the purpose for which it was admitted is a denial of due process and thus subject to a <em>Chapman </em>standard of review. <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California </em>(1967) 386 U.S. 18 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 87 S.Ct. 824, 24 A.L.R.3d 1065].) The Attorney General responds that <em>Watson </em>applies. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson, supra, </em>46 Cal.2d 818.) We agree. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Rivera </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 388, 393 [221 Cal.Rptr. 562, 710 P.2d 362]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tassell </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 77, 89 [201 Cal.Rptr. 567, 679 P.2d 1].)</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">Moreover, as indicated, we believe there was no error in admitting the Rankin evidence. We are of like mind concerning the White evidence. However, assuming arguendo error in admitting the White murder, it was nonprejudicial under <em>Watson. </em>Defendant admitted he robbed Benham and transported her to the site of her death. His lie detector test indicated he was present when she was killed. Crenshaw testified defendant robbed, kidnapped and murdered Benham. Laughlin testified defendant admitted the crimes. Defendant was in possession of the victim\u2019s rings when he was arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">In light of the overwhelming evidence of defendant\u2019s participation in the charged offenses, there is no reasonable probability the result would have been more favorable to defendant had the White murder been excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>D. <em>Admission of Preliminary Hearing Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Although Crenshaw waived his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination for purposes of the preliminary hearing, he subsequently reconsidered his position and declined to testify at trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Over defendant\u2019s objection, the trial court found Crenshaw to be unavailable as a witness (Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 240, 1291, subd. (a)) and permitted his preliminary hearing testimony to be read to the jury. Defendant acknowledges Crenshaw\u2019s waiver of his Fifth Amendment privilege at the preliminary hearing did not preclude him from asserting the privilege at trial, <em>(Overend </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1900) 131 Cal. 280, 284 [63 P. 372]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Maxwell </em>(1979) 94 Cal.App.3d 562, 570 [156 Cal.Rptr. 630].)  He contends, however, the use in a capital case of the transcript of accomplice testimony\u2014testimony recognized to be \u201cinherently untrustworthy\u201d (see <em>In re Miguel L. </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 100, 108 [185 Cal.Rptr. 120, 649 P.2d 703])\u2014denied him his state and federal constitutional rights to confrontation and due process (U.S. Const., 6th\" and 14th Amends.; Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 15; \u00a7 686).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Neither this court nor the United States Supreme Court has ever held the normal rules of evidence do not apply in the guilt phase of a capital case. (Cf. <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio </em>(1978) 438 U.S. 586, 604, fn. 12 [57 L.Ed.2d 973, 990, 98 S.Ct. 2954] [exclusion of irrelevant evidence at penalty phase].) Pursuant to Evidence Code section 240, a declarant who is \u201c[e]xempted ... on the ground of privilege from testifying\u201d is \u201c \u2018unavailable as a witness.\u2019 \u201d Evidence Code section 1291, subdivision (a)(2) provides that evidence of the former testimony of an unavailable witness is not made inadmissible by the hearsay rule if \u201c[t]he party against whom the former testimony is offered was a party to the . . . proceeding in which the testimony was given and had the right and opportunity to cross-examine the declarant with an interest and motive similar to that which he has at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">In the instant case, Crenshaw, having invoked his privilege against self-incrimination, was unavailable as a witness. Defendant at the preliminary hearing had a full opportunity to cross-examine him and did so. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Maxwell, supra, </em>94 Cal.App.3d at p. 571; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Salas </em>(1976) 58 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>Cal.App.3d 460, 468 [129 Cal.Rptr. 871].) Consequently, the statutory prerequisites to use of Crenshaw\u2019s preliminary hearing testimony were satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">It is settled that where, as here, the witness is unavailable and the defendant at the preliminary hearing had the opportunity and similar interest and motive as at trial to cross-examine the witness, admission of the witness\u2019s former testimony does not violate the defendant\u2019s constitutional rights of confrontation and due process. <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts </em>(1980) 448 U.S. 56, 68-70 [65 L.Ed.2d 597, 609-610, 100 S.Ct. 2531]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 543, 564 [244 Cal.Rptr. 121, 749 P.2d 776]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Enriquez </em>(1977) 19 Cal.3d 221, 235 [137 Cal.Rptr. 171, 561 P.2d 261, 3 A.L.R.4th 73].)</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Defendant urges this court to preserve a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights by adopting a judicially declared rule of practice in capital cases (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Aranda </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 518, 530 [47 Cal.Rptr. 353, 407 P.2d 265]) that the former testimony of an accomplice who asserts his Fifth Amendment privilege is inadmissible at trial. In support, he argues that cross-examination at the preliminary hearing cannot compensate for lack of confrontation at trial because the nature and objective of the two proceedings differ significantly. (See <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1968) 390 U.S. 719, 725 [20 L.Ed.2d 255, 260, 88 S.Ct. 1318]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Stritzinger </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 505, 516 [194 Cal.Rptr. 431, 668 P.2d 738] [quoting <em>Barber].) </em>It is established, however, that competing interests \u201cmay warrant dispensing with confrontation at trial\u201d <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>448 U.S. at p. 64 [65 L.Ed.2d at p. 606]) and counterbalancing a defendant\u2019s interest in confrontation is the state\u2019s \u201cstrong interest in effective law enforcement.\u201d <em>(Ibid.; </em>see <em>People </em>v. <em>Ogen </em>(1985) 168 Cal.App.3d 611, 616 [215 Cal.Rptr. 16].) In permitting use of the former testimony of an unavailable witness, the courts have struck an appropriate balance between competing interests. <em>(Ohio </em>v. <em>Roberts, supra, </em>at pp. 64-66 [65 L.Ed.2d at pp. 606-608]; see also <em>Barber </em>v. <em>Page, supra, </em>390 U.S. at p. 722 [20 L.Ed.2d at pp. 258-259].) We see no reason to strike a different balance in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">Defendant asserts that \u201ctrial-by-transcript\u201d in a capital case, especially where the source of the transcript\u2014an accomplice\u2014has been recognized as inherently untrustworthy, contravenes basic notions of fairness and the need for heightened reliability in the fact-finding process that may lead to a defendant\u2019s death. The issue of Crenshaw\u2019s reliability, however, was fully presented to the jury through defense counsel\u2019s extensive cross-examination at the preliminary hearing, which, inter alia, disclosed that Crenshaw was awaiting trial on murder charges in the White case and on special circumstance murder charges in the present case; defense counsel\u2019s argument, which fully explored Crenshaw\u2019s accomplice status and possible motive to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>lie; the prosecutor\u2019s acknowledgment that Crenshaw was trying to exculpate himself; and the court\u2019s instructions relating to accomplice testimony (e.g., CALJIC Nos. 3.11 [corroboration necessary], 3.12 [sufficiency of corroborating evidence], 3.18 [viewing testimony with distrust]). Nor was this a \u201ctrial by transcript\u201d: Crenshaw\u2019s former testimony was amply corroborated by the circumstantial evidence, the testimony of Laughlin that defendant admitted killing Benham and defendant\u2019s own testimony admitting he was present with Benham and that he robbed and kidnapped her. Use of the former testimony was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">II. Special Circumstance Issues</p>\n<p id=\"Af\">A. <em>Intent to Kill.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">The jury was instructed that to find the charged felony-murder special circumstances true it must find the murder was committed in the course or furtherance of the robbery and/or kidnapping for robbery, except, if defendant was not the actual killer, then it must find defendant intentionally aided or abetted the actual killer in the commission of the murder and \u201chave intended that the killing take place.\u201d Relying on <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1983) 35 Cal.3d 131 [197 Cal.Rptr. 79, 672 P.2d 862] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 539 [205 Cal.Rptr. 265, 684 P.2d 826], overruled in <em>People </em>v. <em>Lee </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 666, 676 [238 Cal.Rptr. 406, 738 P.2d 752], defendant argues that the felony-murder special-circumstance findings must be set aside because the court erroneously instructed that intent to kill was required only if defendant were not the actual killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Anderson </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1104 [240 Cal.Rptr. 585, 742 P.2d 1306] we reconsidered our <em>Carlos </em>decision, <em>supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131. We concluded the court need instruct on intent to kill as an element of the felony-murder special circumstance only if there is evidence from which the jury could find the defendant was an accomplice rather than the actual killer. (43 Cal.3d at p. 1147.) The court\u2019s instructions were proper under <em>Anderson.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">Defendant maintains the principles of fair notice inherent in ex post facto and due process analysis prohibit the retroactive application of <em>Anderson. </em>We have recently considered and rejected this argument in <em>People </em>v. <em>Poggi </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 306, 326-327 [246 Cal.Rptr. 886, 753 P.2d 1082], As in <em>Poggi, </em>defendant stands convicted of a murder that preceded our decision in <em>Carlos, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131. <em>Carlos </em>itself concluded the statute was ambiguous with respect to the requirement of intent to kill for a felony-murder special circumstance. <em>(See Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1143.) We therefore reject defendant\u2019s fair-notice argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>B. <em>Prior-murder-conviction Special Circumstance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b56-4\">As proof of the prior-murder-conviction special-circumstance charge, the prosecutor introduced documentary evidence that in 1982 defendant was convicted of the first degree murder of White. Relying on <em>Carlos </em>v. <em>Superior Court, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131 <em>dead People </em>v. <em>Turner </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 302 [208 Cal.Rptr. 196, 690 P.2d 669], defendant contends the prior-murder-conviction special circumstance must be set aside because there was no finding in either the present or prior case that he intended to kill.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Any contrary result, he maintains, would irrationally distinguish between defendants whose multiple murders were joined for trial (see <em>Turner, supra, </em>at pp. 328-329, requiring intent to kill in at least one of two joined felony murders) and those whose offenses were severed or, as here, jurisdictionally precluded from being jointly tried (\u00a7 777; <em>People </em>v. <em>Bradford </em>(1976) 17 Cal.3d 8, 14 [130 Cal.Rptr. 129, 549 P.2d 1225]). Defendant also maintains the prior-murder-conviction special-circumstance finding is invalid because the underlying murder occurred subsequent to the present offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 584, 596 [238 Cal.Rptr. 66, 737 P.2d 1350], we held intent to kill is not an element of the prior-murder-conviction special circumstance. Defendant\u2019s concern that this holding irrationally distinguishes between defendants is answered by <em>Anderson, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1104. In <em>Anderson </em>we rejected the reasoning of <em>Carlos, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 131, and <em>Turner, supra, </em>37 Cal.3d 302, and determined intent to kill is not an element of the felony-murder or the multiple-murder special circumstance unless the defendant was an aider or abettor and not the actual killer. (43 Cal.3d at pp. 1147, 1149-1150.) As indicated, the jury in the instant case was instructed in compliance with <em>Anderson. </em>Thus, application of the prior-murder-conviction special circumstance to render defendant death-eligible results in no irrational distinction between defendants tried jointly and those whose offenses are separately tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Defendant\u2019s further contention that the prior murder must have preceded the present offense was rejected in <em>People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 584, 595-596. \u201cThe order of the commission of the homicides is immaterial.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 596.)</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>III. Penalty Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">A. <em>Failure to Instruct on Informant's Testimony.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">Observing that jailmate Laughlin\u2019s testimony as to defendant\u2019s confession was \u201csome of the most damning evidence\u201d concerning defendant\u2019s role in the Benham crimes and the only direct evidence of his state of mind with respect to Benham\u2019s murder,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> defendant asserts that in a capital case due process requires the court sua sponte to instruct the jury to view the testimony of an informant with caution. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Hovey, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 543, 565-566 we declined to impose a requirement of sua sponte cautionary instructions on informant testimony. We adhere to that ruling here.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">B. <em>Refusal to Re-voir Dire the Jury.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">After completion of the guilt phase of trial, defendant moved for a new jury pursuant to section 190.4, subdivision (c) or, in the alternative, that the jury be voir dired to determine if there were good cause why any juror could not sit in the penalty phase. Both motions were based on the assertion that in light of the inflammatory evidence presented at the guilt phase and the relatively short time it took the jury to reach a verdict (three to four hours), there was a likelihood the verdict was based on passion and the jury therefore could not approach the question of penalty with an open mind. The trial court denied the motions on grounds there was no legal basis for voir dire of the sitting jurors and a new jury would in any event hear the same evidence as the guilt phase jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">Section 190.4, subdivision (c) provides in pertinent part: \u201cIf the trier of fact which convicted the defendant of a crime for which he may be subject to the death penalty was a jury, the same jury shall consider . . . the penalty to be applied, unless for good cause shown the court discharges that jury in which case a new jury shall be drawn.\u201d Defendant maintains the authority to voir dire the jury is implicit in the section, as voir dire is the only meaningful way to determine whether the jurors could consider the penalty phase evidence with open minds and not automatically vote for death by reason of the passions engendered in the first phase of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1168, 1199 [240 Cal.Rptr. 666, 743 P.2d 301], there is no direct authority on the meaning of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>\u201cgood cause\u201d in the context of impanelling a new penalty phase jury. Neither is there any authority concerning how good cause may be shown. Nevertheless, we believe that defendant\u2019s assertions of possible juror bias in this case, based on the inflammatory nature of the guilt phase evidence and the promptness of the verdict, were insufficient to impose any duty of inquiry on the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">First, since the evidence in every capital case is likely to be somewhat inflammatory, defendant\u2019s argument, extended to its logical conclusion, would require the court routinely to re-voir dire the jury. This clearly is not the intent of the statute. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 144, 204-205 [222 Cal.Rptr. 184, 711 P.2d 480] [due process does not require separate penalty jury].) Second, as the trial court observed, the \u201cinflammatory\u201d guilt phase evidence would be presented to the penalty phase jury in any case. That the guilt phase jury initially heard the evidence without mitigating evidence is, like the admission of inflammatory evidence itself, common to all capital cases and thus cannot be sufficient cause for discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">In sum, defendant\u2019s showing raised no duty on the part of the court to question the jurors. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ainsworth </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 984, 1028-1029 [248 Cal.Rptr. 568, 755 P.2d 1017]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">C. <em>Evidentiary Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">Observing that the jury spent more than a day in deliberations (six hours the first day, two hours the second) and requested the rereading of the testimony of three witnesses (Crenshaw, Laughlin and defendant), defendant maintains the jury found the choice of appropriate penalty to be a close question. Given this asserted delicate balance between evidence in favor of life and that in favor of death, defendant contends the following three evidentiary errors require reversal of the penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">1. <em>Impeachment of Terry Caylor.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">At the penalty phase Caylor impeached Laughlin, the jailhouse informer who testified defendant had confessed to the Benham, White and Rankin murders. According to Caylor, Laughlin admitted he was lying about defendant\u2019s involvement; he stated he had an agreement with Crenshaw that he would testify against defendant and indicated his testimony would result in dismissal of the charges pending against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">At the outset of direct examination defense counsel elicited from Caylor that he had previously been convicted of a felony, he was presently awaiting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>trial on another matter, and he had previously been represented by defense counsel, but had discharged him so he could represent himself. On cross-examination the prosecutor elicited that Caylor had been convicted of the felonies of robbery, rape and lewd conduct; he was awaiting trial on an escape charge; he was representing himself; and he had escaped from Patton, a mental institution. Defense counsel failed to object.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">Defendant contends that pursuant to <em>People </em>v. <em>Woodard </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 329, 335 [152 Cal.Rptr. 536, 590 P.2d 391], the prosecutor improperly impeached Caylor with the rape and lewd conduct convictions, which had no bearing on Caylor\u2019s truthfulness.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Because the charged crimes occurred prior to the adoption of Proposition 8, <em>Woodard </em>governs. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 251.) Consequently, although the challenged evidence was related in general to matters raised on direct, had defense counsel objected admission of the evidence likely would have been error: neither the nature of Caylor\u2019s rape and lewd conduct convictions nor the nature of his pending escape charge (as distinguished from the fact he was in jail awaiting trial) had any bearing on his credibility (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Rist </em>(1976) 16 Cal.3d 211, 221 [127 Cal.Rptr. 457, 545 P.2d 833] [rape]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1984) 37 Cal.3d 436, 454-455 [208 Cal.Rptr. 547, 690 P.2d 1207] [escape]) or any other identified issue, and the Attorney General has made no attempt to show how Caylor\u2019s mental problems or election to represent himself had any bearing on his testimony or ability to perceive the matters testified to (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 780, subd. (d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">Although counsel\u2019s failure to object waives the issue in the context of evidentiary error (see Evid. Code, \u00a7 353), the issue is reviewable in the context of whether counsel provided ineffective assistance, discussed <em>post </em>at pages 33-34. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572, 581.)</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">2. <em>Implied Existence of Uncalled Adverse Witnesses.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">Eugene Mazza, defendant\u2019s former manager in the newspaper delivery business, testified to defendant\u2019s reliability, conscientiousness and good character. On cross-examination the prosecutor asked if he \u201cbecame aware that other persons had also been contacted for references,\u201d and if he would know \u201cif some people were called and just didn\u2019t want to come in and testify?\u201d Defendant maintains the sole purpose of this questioning was improperly to insinuate to the jury that there existed untold witnesses who knew defendant and were interviewed by the defense team, but had refused to speak on his behalf. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Wagner </em>(1975) 13 Cal.3d 612, 619-620 [119 Cal.Rptr. 457, 532 P.2d 105]; cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton </em>(1979) 23 Cal.3d 208, 212 [152 Cal.Rptr. 141, 589 P.2d 396] [improper argument].)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>The questions were improper. In light, however, of the 24 witnesses who in fact did testify in defendant\u2019s behalf, including friends, family, teachers, neighbors, counselors, a priest and a state court justice, the error manifestly was harmless under any standard. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 214.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">3. <em>Prison Gang Activity and Appeal to Racial Prejudice. -</em></p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Defendant maintains that through the improper introduction of evidence of prison gang activity, the prosecutor appealed to racial prejudice and implied defendant\u2019s future dangerousness.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Defendant first cites the prosecutor\u2019s questions to a prison guard whether he was aware of gang activity at the prison and the existence of Black gangs that occasionally harmed White inmates. These questions were asked in the context of attempting to rehabilitate prosecution witness Smith, whose testimony concerning defendant\u2019s involvement in a jail sodomy had been impeached by the guard\u2019s testimony on direct that Smith had given inconsistent statements about the incident.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">The prosecutor\u2019s inquiry about gangs arguably was improper: although the prosecutor could show victim Smith\u2019s fear of retaliation, as in fact he did (see fn. 7, <em>ante), </em>absent a showing of gang involvement in the sodomy or gang practice (as opposed to individual or general inmate practice) to engage in retaliation, the existence of prison gangs and the harm done White inmates by Black gangs was irrelevant and potentially prejudicial. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Cardenas </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 897, 904-905 [184 Cal.Rptr. 165, 647 P.2d 569] [plur. opn.]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Perez </em>(1981) 114 Cal.App.3d 470 [170 Cal.Rptr. 619].) Defense counsel, however, failed to object. Because, in our opinion, a timely objection and admonition, when the district attorney first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>asked about gang activity at the prison, would have cured the effect of any impropriety and have deterred further prosecutorial inquiry into such activity without a foundation showing its relevance, the issue is waived. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Murtishaw </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 733, 758-759 [175 Cal.Rptr. 738, 631 P.2d 446].) This being so, the remaining question is whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to object constituted ineffective assistance, discussed <em>post </em>at pages 33-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">Defendant next complains about the prosecutor\u2019s reference to prison gang activity in his cross-examination of psychologist Dr. Craig Rath, who had testified that defendant, under \u201cvery specific conditions,\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> might mature in the structured prison environment, where life prisoners achieve a stable \u201cstatus quo.\u201d The prosecutor asked Dr. Rath whether the \u201cstatus quo\u201d can often take the form of criminal activity by gangs and whether he was aware that often entree into a gang is achieved by killing another inmate. This evidence, defendant maintains, served only to raise the possibility of defendant\u2019s future dangerousness and thus was inadmissible as irrelevant to any aggravating factor. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyd </em>(1985) 38 Cal.3d 762, 773-776 [215 Cal.Rptr. 1, 700 P.2d 782]; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Murtishaw, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 767-768.)</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">Although evidence of future dangerousness is inadmissible in the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief <em>(Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pp. 775-776; <em>Murtishaw, supra, </em>29 Cal.3d at pp. 767-768), such evidence may be introduced in rebuttal where, as here, the defense has raised the issue of defendant\u2019s performance in prison and has presented evidence he would live a law-abiding life in a prison environment <em>(Boyd, supra, </em>at p. 776).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1168, 1211; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 791 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113]; cf. <em>Jurek </em>v. <em>Texas </em>(1976) 428 U.S. 262, 274-276 [49 L.Ed.2d 929, 939-941, 96 S.Ct. 2950] [no constitutional impediment to evidence of future dangerousness].) Here, moreover, the evidence was directed not to defendant\u2019s future dangerousness as such, but rather to the nature of the prison environment\u2014an environment the defense had sought to prove would foster defendant\u2019s maturity and stability. The questioning, as the Attorney General observes, served to cross-examine Dr. Rath on the impression he had left with the jury that prison was a tranquil place where defendant could get counseling and psychiatric care, which would enable him to control the impulsivity that had contributed to his past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>criminal behavior. (See Evid. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 721, subd. (a), 761; cf. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Colm </em>(1974) 11 Cal.3d 639, 646 [114 Cal.Rptr. 128, 522 P.2d 688].)</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">4. <em>Denial of Due Process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Asserting that the prosecution\u2019s routine use of \u201cprofessional snitches\u201d like Laughlin to persuade juries in capital cases is disturbing of itself, defendant contends the prosecutor\u2019s further use in this case of improper means to destroy the credibility of the witness (Caylor) who showed Laughlin to be a liar constituted a denial of due process. As a further denial of due process, defendant cites the prosecutor\u2019s \u201cgratuitous invocation of the image of [B]lack prison gangs attacking hapless [Wjhites,\u201d an image that assertedly exploited the risk of racial prejudice inherent in this case, involving as it does a Black man convicted of killing a White woman in circumstances having sexual overtones.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Defendant\u2019s due process argument rests on the premise the prosecutor engaged in deliberate misconduct. The record is to the contrary. During the guilt phase of trial, when the defense proposed to have defendant\u2019s cellmates impeach Laughlin, the prosecutor specifically noted he had no background information on the witnesses and assumed they had all been convicted of felonies. He asked for assurance there would be no motion for a mistrial if he inquired of that without having the necessary proof. Defense counsel acceded, stating, \u201cI think they will freely admit that they are hardcore criminals.\u201d Thereafter the prosecutor, without objection, asked each of the inmate witnesses what felonies he had been convicted of; as to one prisoner, defense counsel did the same. On this record, and absent a showing of any different understanding at the penalty phase of trial, defendant\u2019s assertion of prosecutorial misconduct in cross-examination of Caylor is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Nor was the prosecutor\u2019s reference to Black gang activity misconduct. The reference was in the context of rehabilitating witness Smith who, according to the defense\u2019s prison-guard witness, had given prior inconsistent statements concerning defendant\u2019s involvement in the sodomy attack against him and had attributed his change of story to confusion and fear. Because defendant is Black and Smith evidently is White, the prosecutor could reasonably have believed the asserted attacks of Black gangs against White inmates were relevant to Smith\u2019s fear of retaliation if he testified against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-8\">We thus reject defendant\u2019s due process contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>5. <em>Waiver and Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Defendant maintains that if we determine counsel\u2019s failure to object waived the errors in admitting evidence of Terry Caylor\u2019s criminal background and of Black prison gang activity, such failure denied him the effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">A defendant who on appeal asserts a claim of ineffective assistance has the burden to show counsel failed to perform as a reasonably competent attorney acting as a diligent advocate and that counsel\u2019s deficiencies prejudiced his case. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 412, 425; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d 572, 584; see <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. 668; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ledesma </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 171, 216-217 [233 Cal.Rptr. 404, 729 P.2d 839].) We have observed that a mere failure to object to evidence seldom establishes counsel\u2019s incompetence. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ghent </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 739, 772 [239 Cal.Rptr. 82, 739 P.2d 1250].) Assuming arguendo, however, that a reasonably competent attorney would have objected to the challenged evidence and, further, that there could be no justifiable tactical reason for counsel\u2019s failure to object (cf. <em>Pope, supra, </em>at pp. 426, 428; <em>Ghent, supra, </em>at p. 773), defendant still must show counsel\u2019s omissions were prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Counsel\u2019s failure to prevent the improper impeachment of Caylor was prejudicial, defendant maintains, because Caylor\u2019s testimony, if believed, discredited Laughlin, whose testimony provided the only direct evidence defendant, and not Crawford, was the perpetrator of the crimes.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We disagree. Even without evidence of Caylor\u2019s felony convictions for rape and lewd conduct and his pending escape charges, the jury was aware that Caylor, like Laughlin himself, was a convicted felon awaiting trial on new charges. The specifics of his criminal history could not have made an appreciable difference. Indeed, arguably it was less prejudicial for the jury to know the nature of Caylor\u2019s priors and pending charges than to leave the question open to speculation. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rollo </em>(1977) 20 Cal.3d 109, 119 [141 Cal.Rptr. 177, 569 P.2d 771].) During the guilt phase, moreover, the jury had heard and evidently rejected similar impeaching evidence concern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>ing Laughlin\u2019s asserted manufacture of his testimony.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The details of Caylor\u2019s criminal background could not in the circumstances have been determinative of the jury\u2019s resolution of the issue of Laughlin\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">Admission of evidence of Black prison gang activity, although arguably improper, likewise was nonprejudicial. As indicated, evidence of prison gang activity in general was properly admitted in the context of describing the environment defendant would interact with were he sentenced to life without possibility of parole, an issue raised by the defense. The single reference to Black gang activity occurred in the course of cross-examination of a prison guard about inmate Smith\u2019s fear of retaliation for reporting the sodomy attack. Dr. Rath, testifying for the defense concerning defendant\u2019s likely behavior in prison, twice stated that defendant is prone to be a \u201cloner,\u201d not a gang joiner\u2014thus neutralizing in part any prejudicial effect of the improper reference. Dr. Rath further testified that defendant is a sociopath with attention-deficit disorder whose problems of hyperactivity, irritability and impulsivity would continue to manifest themselves, and that it would be consistent with defendant\u2019s personality to try to escape. In light of the above testimony and the overwhelming aggravating evidence\u2014particularly that during defendant\u2019s last escape from jail he engaged in a crime and murder spree that left four people dead, and immediately after his commitment to prison for the White murder he engaged in assaultive sexual behavior\u2014the arguably improper reference to Black gangs could not have affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">Throughout most of the lengthy trial, counsel performed as a vigorous and capable advocate. We conclude that even assuming counsel\u2019s failure to object to the challenged evidence was unreasonable, the prejudice defendant suffered, if any, does not warrant setting aside his death sentence. <em>(Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, supra, </em>466 U.S. at pp. 694-695, 698-699 [80 L.Ed.2d at pp. 698, 700-701]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Fosselman, supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 584; <em>People </em>v. <em>Pope, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 423.)</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">D. <em>Excusing Crenshaw From Testifying.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">Defendant\u2019s crime partner, Crenshaw, testified for the prosecution at the preliminary hearing, but invoked his privilege against self-incrimina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>tion when called by the prosecution at the guilt phase of trial, although he testified briefly for the defense. <em>(Ante, </em>fn. 4, p. 23.) At the penalty phase, defendant sought to call Crenshaw again, proposing to ask if he had shot White, the victim in the prior-murder special circumstance. The trial court, informed by Crenshaw\u2019s counsel he would instruct his client not to answer the question, ruled Crenshaw need not testify, based on the assumption he would invoke his privilege against self-incrimination if called. The court ruled further that \u201cbased on the offer of proof,\u201d the subject matter of Crenshaw\u2019s proposed testimony was either not relevant or could be proved by some other means. Defendant contends these rulings were error.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">We first observe that defense counsel did not object to the challenged procedure, but rather, acquiesced in it; hence defendant may not complain on appeal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1979) 93 Cal.App.3d 103, 118 [155 Cal.Rptr. 472].) In any event, the court\u2019s ruling that Crenshaw need not take the stand to reassert his Fifth Amendment privilege was not error. Crenshaw had previously exercised the privilege as to all events between March 19, 1981, and March 24, 1981. (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 4, p. 23.) White\u2019s murder occurred during those dates. Crenshaw\u2019s counsel confirmed he would advise his client not to respond to the proposed question. In these circumstances, the court properly found there was no reason to have Crenshaw personally reassert the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">None of the cases relied on by defendant is apposite because in none did the witness, as here, personally assert the privilege at trial. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Kynette </em>(1940) 15 Cal.2d 731, 747 [104 P.2d 794]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>93 Cal.App.3d at p. 117; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 431, 435-436 [247 Cal.Rptr. 121, 754 P.2d 168].) Although defendant would have us equate the separate phases of trial to separate \u201cproceedings,\u201d so as to require a witness to invoke the privilege at each (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Kynette, supra), </em>we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Likewise meritless is defendant\u2019s argument that absent Crenshaw\u2019s actual reinvocation of the privilege at the penalty phase, the court was in no position to rule whether the privilege applied. Although Crenshaw, based on his guilty plea, had been convicted and sentenced for the White murder and evidently had failed to appeal (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Lopez </em>(1980) 110 Cal.App.3d 1010, 1021 [168 Cal.Rptr. 378] [privilege survives pending resolution of appeal]), thus rendering his conviction final, the same was true at the guilt phase.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In both instances, he had yet to be tried for the Benham <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>murder, in which trial it was more than likely the prosecution, as in defendant\u2019s trial, would seek to introduce evidence of the White murder for purposes of establishing Crenshaw\u2019s guilt. Because a response to defense counsel\u2019s question whether he shot White thus could lighten the district attorney\u2019s burden of proof, Crenshaw was privileged to refuse to answer. (See <em>Prudhomme </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1970) 2 Cal.3d 320, 326 [85 Cal.Rptr. 129, 466 P.2d 673].)</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">We conclude, therefore, the court did not err in determining Crenshaw\u2019s invocation of the privilege extended to the defense\u2019s proposed penalty phase question. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Ford, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 441.) Nor did the court err in its relevance and other-means-of-proof ruling. The record discloses this ruling was directed not to the question whether Crenshaw had shot White, but rather, to matters presented in defense counsel\u2019s \u201coffer of proof\u2019 and subsequently proved by documentary evidence\u2014Crenshaw\u2019s sentence in the White murder (25 years to life) and the charges pending against him in the Benham case (nonspecial circumstance murder). As to these, the court\u2019s ruling was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">E. <em>Prosecutorial Misconduct.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-6\">1. <em>Argument Concerning Unproved Sex Crimes.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b66-7\">As part of the special circumstance allegations, defendant was originally charged with having killed Benham in the course of rape and sodomy (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(iii) and (iv)). The two special circumstances ultimately were dismissed on grounds, inter alia, that there was insufficient corroboration of Crenshaw\u2019s statements implicating defendant in the crimes. In his penalty phase argument, however, the prosecutor described Benham as having been \u201csexually assaulted.\u201d Defendant maintains the prosecutor thereby improperly submitted the rape and sodomy offenses to the jury as aggravating \u201cother crimes\u201d (see \u00a7 190.3, factor (b)) when there was insufficient evidence to permit the offenses to be considered <em>(People </em>v. <em>Robertson </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 21, 53-54 [188 Cal.Rptr. 77, 655 P.2d 279]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 762, 774) and impermissibly attempted to relitigate the court\u2019s prior finding of insufficient evidence (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Haskett </em>(1982) 30 Cal.3d 841, 866-867 [180 Cal.Rptr. 640, 640 P.2d 776]).</p>\n<p id=\"b66-8\">Because defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments, defendant can complain on appeal only if timely objection and admonition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>could not have obviated the prejudicial effects of the remarks. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Haskett, supra, </em>30 Cal.3d 841, 860-861; <em>People </em>v. <em>Green, supra, </em>27 Cal.3d 1, 34.) We are of the view that any harmful effect from the remarks could have been cured by an objection and admonition when the prosecutor first made the challenged reference to a \u201csexual assault.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">We further conclude, however, the prosecutor\u2019s comments were not error. Sexual assault is not a specific crime, nor was it listed among the \u201cother crimes\u201d the court instructed the jury it could consider.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In lay terms an assault is an unwanted touching or a threat to accomplish such; by the same token, a sexual assault is an unwanted sexual advance\u2014i.e., an unwanted touching or threat to touch an intimate body part.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> (Cf. \u00a7\u00a7 240 [assault], 243.4 [sexual battery].) Defendant\u2019s sexual assault of Benham was a circumstance of the crime (\u00a7 190.3, factor (a)), as shown by evidence that she was lying in a face down position, nude below the waist, and Crenshaw\u2019s testimony that defendant was on top of her with his pants down.  We do not believe corroboration is required for that part of an accomplice\u2019s testimony that relates to the circumstances of the crime, rather than commission of a specific offense. (See \u00a7 1111 [distinguishing corroboration connecting defendant to commission of the offense from that directed only to its circumstances]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Szeto </em>(1981) 29 Cal.3d 20, 27 [171 Cal.Rptr. 652, 623 P.2d 213] [corroboration need not establish every fact of the crime].)  Assuming, arguendo, however, that corroboration is required for the circumstance to be used in aggravation of penalty, the sexual assault aspect of Crenshaw\u2019s testimony was sufficiently corroborated by the position and unclothed condition of Benham\u2019s body and Laughlin\u2019s testimony that defendant received some form of sexual gratification from killing people. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Szeto, supra, 29 </em>Cal.3d 20 [corroborative evidence may be slight].)</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">The prosecutor\u2019s references to the sexual assault were made not in the context of defendant\u2019s other criminal activity, but rather, in the context of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the circumstances of the crime and defendant\u2019s capacity to conform his behavior to the law. As such, they were not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">2. <em>Insinuation of Additional Murder.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">In cross-examining defendant during the guilt phase about his kidnapping of Combs, the prosecutor asked if he had told Combs he killed someone earlier that day for doing something stupid. Defendant denied having made such a statement; on the prosecutor\u2019s further inquiry whether he had heard Combs testify to the statement in defendant\u2019s Riverside trial, defendant stated he did not recall. Although defendant did not object at trial, he now asserts the prosecutor deliberately left the jury with the unproven suggestion he committed an additional murder, thereby committing prejudicial misconduct requiring penalty reversal. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Evans </em>(1952) 39 Cal.2d 242, 248-249 [246 P.2d 636]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Wagner, supra, </em>13 Cal.3d 612, 619-620.)</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">Assuming arguendo defendant has not waived the asserted misconduct by failure to object or request an admonition (cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Baines </em>(1981) 30 Cal.3d 143, 149 [177 Cal.Rptr. 861, 635 P.2d 455]), we conclude the questions were not prejudicial error. The asserted basis for the prosecutor\u2019s question was Combs\u2019s testimony at defendant\u2019s previous trial. Combs\u2019s testimony was subsequently read to the jury. In it\u2014contrary to the prosecutor\u2019s question\u2014Combs never attributed such a statement to defendant; hence the prior testimony would have tended to mitigate any harmful effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-7\">Moreover, in light of the overwhelming aggravating evidence, including evidence of defendant\u2019s three other murders in addition to the Benham killing, any implication that defendant may have committed an additional murder must have been harmless under any standard. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Bolton, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d at p. 214.).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-8\">3. <em>Sympathy for Victims.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b68-9\">Relying on <em>Booth </em>v. <em>Maryland </em>(1987) 482 U.S. 496 [96 L.Ed.2d 440, 107 S.Ct. 2529], defendant argues the prosecutor\u2019s request that the jury consider the feelings of William Parr (whose murder was proved as a factor (b) \u201cother crime\u201d [\u00a7 190.3, factor (b)]) and his family constituted federal constitutional error. Assuming arguendo <em>Booth </em>applies to factor (b) crimes, that case, involving introduction into <em>evidence </em>of an extensive victim impact statement, is patently distinguishable from the instant case involving the prosecutor\u2019s <em>argument. </em>In the instant case the prosecutor merely asked the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>jury to \u201cconsider the feelings of Mr. William Parr and his family. . . .\u2019\u2019He acknowledged \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d who his family and friends are, but asked the jury to think about \u201c[h]ow many people cried in the William Parr household the day he was murdered by the defendant?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">The prosecutor\u2019s remarks were brief and mild, making only passing reference to the feelings of unknown persons who may have been affected by Parr\u2019s death. In the circumstances, any error in the comments was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 113; <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 772.)</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">F. <em>Jury Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">1. <em>Instructions on Mitigation, Discretion and Sympathy.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b69-8\">The court instructed the jury in terms of former CALJIC No. 8.84.1,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without clarifying that section 190.3 factor (k) permits the jury to consider any aspect of the defendant\u2019s character or record as mitigating evidence, and instructed it pursuant to a modified version of former CALJIC No. 8.84.2,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> without clarifying that it could assign whatever moral or sympa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>thetic value it deemed appropriate to each of the various factors, including an expanded factor (k), and that it was required to determine if death was the \u201cappropriate punishment\u201d notwithstanding that aggravating factors may outweigh mitigating. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 878 [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1985) 40 Cal.3d 512, 540-541 [220 Cal.Rptr. 637, 709 P.2d 440], revd. on other grounds, <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1987) 479 U.S. 538 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 107 S.Ct. 837].) Pursuant to a modified version of CALJIC No. 17.31,<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the jury was also instructed to consider any guilt phase instruction it felt appropriate, without excluding CALJIC No. 1.00, the \u201cantisympathy\u201d instruction.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Defendant maintains that together these instructions precluded the jury from giving mitigating effect to his background and character evidence and misled it into believing sympathy and mercy were improper considerations in determining penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-4\">A defendant is entitled to have the jury consider in mitigation any background and character evidence he proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death (see <em>Lockett </em>v. <em>Ohio, supra, </em>438 U.S. 586; <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d at p. 878, fn. 10) and, in weighing the aggravating and mitigating evidence, assign whatever moral or sympathetic value it deems appropriate to each of the relevant factors, including the mitigating evidence <em>(People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number><em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 541). We have determined that section 190.3 satisfies these constitutional mandates. <em>(Brown, supra, </em>at pp. 540-541; cf. <em>Easley, supra, </em>at pp. 877-878.) However, in order to avoid any potential misunderstanding, we have imposed the prospective requirement that trial courts expressly inform the jury it may consider defendant\u2019s character and background evidence <em>(Easley, supra, </em>at p. 878, fn. 10) and fully instruct it as to the scope of its sentencing discretion and responsibility in accordance with the foregoing principles <em>(Brown, supra, </em>at p. 544, fn. 17).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">In reviewing cases tried before <em>Easley, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 858, and <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d 512, our task is to determine whether in context the jury may have been misled to defendant\u2019s prejudice concerning the mitigating evidence it could consider and the scope of its sentencing discretion. <em>(Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 544, fn. 17; <em>see People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 730, 786; see also <em>California </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>479 U.S. 538, 546 [93 L.Ed.2d 934, 943] (cone. opn. by O\u2019Connor, J.).) In conducting such an examination we look to \u201c \u2018the totality of the penalty instructions given and the nature of the arguments made to the jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>at p. 786.)</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\"><em>Sympathy. </em>In the instant case there is nothing in the court\u2019s instructions or the prosecutor\u2019s argument to suggest to the jury it should not consider defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence. To the contrary, the court instructed the jury, in reaching its penalty determination, to consider \u201call of the evidence which has been received during any part of the trial. . . except as you may be hereafter instructed.\u201d Twenty-four defense witnesses testified to defendant\u2019s background and character. The prosecutor, moreover, stated that \u201cWe can feel sorry for Mr. Malone. And you will be instructed you can consider sympathy for Mr. Malone.\u201d Although no express sympathy instruction was given, this remark would certainly direct the jury\u2019s attention to the sympathetic aspects of defendant\u2019s background evidence and reinforce the mitigating effect of the section 190.3 factor (k) instruction. Defense counsel, in turn, emphasized the jury\u2019s duty to consider the nature of the offense and <em>the offender </em>in making its penalty determination and argued at length the mitigating effect of defendant\u2019s difficult childhood and upbringing, his need for counseling he did not receive, the love family members had for him, and his good qualities as testified to by friends, family members and a priest. Counsel expressly informed the jury it could take into consideration sympathy for defendant and for his family and that it had the power to extend mercy to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">As we observed in <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1168, 1200, \u201cIt would defy all logic and reason to conclude that the jury which heard seven witnesses testify concerning the defendant\u2019s background and character, was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>directed to consider \u2018all of the evidence,\u2019 and heard defense counsel argue this evidence at length, would somehow have concluded that it could not consider this testimony in its penalty determination.\u201d A fortiori, the same is true here.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On this record, the court\u2019s instruction to the jury to consider any guilt phase instruction it felt appropriate, without excluding CALJ1C 1.00, the \u201cantisympathy\u201d instruction, was insufficient to mislead the jury concerning its duty to consider and give defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence whatever sympathetic value it believed appropriate. We recently have held that although the giving of an antisympathy instruction at the penalty phase is not error, the instruction nevertheless should not be given because in certain cases it might mislead jurors to the defendant\u2019s prejudice. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 123, 152 &amp; fn. 7 [249 Cal.Rptr. 320, 756 P.2d 1348].) Here none was given. In light of the specific penalty phase instructions given, including section 190.3 factor (k), and the evidence and arguments presented, as discussed above, a reasonable jury would not have been misled into believing the guilt phase antisympathy instruction would continue to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\"><em>Scope of Discretion. </em>Although it is not error per se for the court to instruct the jury in terms of former CALJIC No. 8.84.2 <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>40 Cal.3d at p. 544, fn. 17), in the instant case the trial court nevertheless modified the instruction to direct the jury that \u201cIf you conclude the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances, you <em>may </em>impose a sentence of death.\u201d (Italics added; see <em>ante, </em>fn. 16, p. 39.) The prosecutor informed the jury if it found the aggravating circumstances to outweigh the mitigating circumstances, it had \u201cthe option\u201d of voting for the death penalty, and expressed his belief that after the jury had evaluated the aggravating and mitigating circumstances it would find \u201cthe penalty that is appropriate in this case.\u201d Defense counsel reiterated that even if the jury thought aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating ones, it was \u201cstill not required by law to execute [defendant].\u201d In addition counsel emphasized the jury was free to assign whatever weight it felt appropriate to any given factor and that it \u201cemphatically\u201d is not a question of mere numbers\u2014 \u201cthe law says weigh, not add.\u201d Any single factor could be sufficient to justify a life sentence, he argued. \u201cYou alone have to decide what weight to give each factor.\u201d And, he admonished the jury, \u201cin weighing mitigation against aggravation, you want to be very certain, very certain that if you vote for death that death is the only appropriate sentence in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">We conclude that on this record the jury could not have been misled as to the factors it could consider or the scope of its discretion in determining <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>penalty. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 104; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 1168, 1200; <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1222, 1280.)</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">2. <em>Instruction to Disregard the Consequences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">At the guilt phase of trial, the jury was instructed pursuant to CALJIC No. 1.00 that it should \u201creach a just verdict regardless of what the consequences of such verdict may be.\u201d Here, as with the antisympathy instruction discussed above, defendant argues the court committed reversible error in permitting the jury, by virtue of its \u201ccarry-forward\u201d version of CALJIC No. 17.31 <em>(ante, </em>fn. 17, p. 40), to apply this instruction to the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Although it may not be error to instruct the penalty phase jury to disregard the consequences of its decision (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Hamilton, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p. 152; <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucky </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 259, 297-298 [247 Cal.Rptr. 1, 753 P.2d 1052]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 759, fn. 20 [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741]), we nevertheless have held this portion of CALJIC No. 1.00, like the antisympathy direction, should not be given. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wade </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 975, 998 [244 Cal.Rptr. 905, 750 P.2d 794]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Howard </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 375, 443 [243 Cal.Rptr. 842, 749 P.2d 279].) In the instant case, as indicated, the court instructed the jury to apply whichever of the guilt phase instructions it should find to be applicable depending upon its \u201cdetermination of the facts\u201d and to disregard those that applied \u201cto a state of facts [it] determine[d] does not exist.\u201d We reject defendant\u2019s premise that in following this instruction the jury would have believed the guilt phase admonition to disregard the consequences of its verdict was applicable to its penalty decision. First, the court\u2019s instruction by its terms was restricted to previous instructions that bear on the jury\u2019s finding of <em>facts. </em>CALJIC No. 1.00, by contrast, is unrelated to any particular \u201cstate of facts\u201d the jury might find, but rather, is directed to the jury\u2019s responsibility in reaching a verdict once it has found the facts and applied the law, as instructed by the court; hence it is not such an instruction as the jury would believe carried forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">Second, both the prosecutor and defense counsel emphasized to the jury the significance and gravity of its decision. The prosecutor stated that determining the penalty to be death is \u201cnot done in a light vein.\u201d Defense counsel repeatedly referred to the jury\u2019s ultimate responsibility and spoke of the law\u2019s insistence life not be taken lightly and its sensitivity in this area because \u201cyou are dealing with Kelvin\u2019s life.\u201d Counsel admonished the jury that each one had an individual responsibility to be absolutely certain of his or her decision and to remember that if the verdict is death, \u201cyou are sending somebody to the gas chamber.\u201d \u201cThe truth is,\u201d he observed, \u201cwhen you decide to kill a person,. . . you can\u2019t fully see the consequences of your <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>decision. You can\u2019t know what toll it will ultimately take on any of us. [fl] I imagine what the toll might be on Kelvin Malone, but you can\u2019t imagine what the toll will be on his family, on you, even on me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">We conclude the jury could not have believed that in reaching its penalty verdict it was to disregard the consequences of its decision. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 660, 718.)</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">3. <em>Artificial Inflation of Aggravating Circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">Among other factors, the jury was instructed to consider \u201c(a) The circumstances of the crime of which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding and the existence of any special circumstances found to be true. ... [1f] (b) The presence or absence of criminal activity by the defendant which involved the use or attempted use of force or violence or the express or implied threat to use force or violence. [If] (c) The presence or absence of any prior felony conviction.\u201d Relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 36 [201 Cal.Rptr. 782, 679 P.2d 433] (plur. opn.), defendant contends this language improperly required the jury to translate single aggravating acts of defendant into multiple aggravating factors, thus artificially inflating the case for death.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">a. <em>Overlapping Felony-murder Special Circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">The jury found true two felony-murder special circumstances: robbery-murder and kidnapping-for-purposes-of-robbery murder. (\u00a7 190.2, subd. (a)(17)(i) and (ii).) Defendant argues the two felonies necessarily overlap because they describe an indivisible course of conduct having one principal criminal purpose: the robbery of Benham. Consequently, he contends that under <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 36, it was error to instruct the jury to consider each as a distinct aggravating factor under subdivision (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">In <em>Harris, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 36, a plurality of this court held that in cases where there have been alleged and found true multiple felony-murder special circumstances based on an indivisible course of conduct having one principal criminal purpose, the jury should be instructed that for purposes of determining penalty the multiple special circumstances should be considered as one. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 66.) The <em>Harris </em>court reached this conclusion in the belief that to permit the jury to take into account all of such multiple felony-murder special circumstances would artificially inflate the defendant\u2019s conduct and undercut the \u201cconstitutionally mandated objective of focusing on the particularized circumstances of the crime and the defendant.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 62.) The plurality further suggested that separate consideration of such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>\u201coverlapping\u201d special circumstances at the penalty phase would violate \u201c[t]he principles underlying California\u2019s prohibition of double punishment.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 64; see \u00a7 654.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 713 we reconsidered <em>Harris. </em>We determined there was no constitutional impediment to permitting the jury to consider multiple felonies leading to the capital murder <em>(id. </em>at p. 767), so long as the various felonies are not weighed in the penalty determination <em>\u201cmore than once </em>for exactly the same purpose\u201d <em>(id. </em>at p. 768, italics in original).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As we there observed, \u201cit is constitutionally legitimate for the state to determine that a death-eligible murderer is more culpable, and thus more deserving of death, if he not only robbed the victim but committed an additional and separate felonious act, burglary [or, as here, kidnapping], in order to facilitate the robbery and murder.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 767; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 954-955 [760 P.2d 996].) Each of the crimes underlying the felony murder special circumstances invades a \u201cdistinct interest that society seeks to protect.\u201d <em>(Bean, supra; </em>accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Poggi, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 340.)</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In the instant case the jury was properly permitted to consider both the robbery special circumstance and the kidnapping-for-robbery special circumstance as aggravating factors under section 190.3 factor (a).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">b. <em>Multiple Use of Underlying Crime.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Defendant argues the instructions permitted the jury to consider the robbery and kidnapping of Benham as aggravating circumstances under both factors (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">It is settled that factors (b) and (c) of section 190.3 pertain only to criminal activity other than the crimes for which the defendant was convicted in the present proceeding. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 105-106.) Although in <em>Miranda, supra, </em>we expressed doubt that a jury would believe factors (b) and (c) embrace the guilt phase offenses, in order to avoid any possible confusion, we directed trial courts in the future to expressly instruct that factors (b) and (c) refer to crimes other than those underlying the guilt determination. (44 Cal.3d at p. 106, fn. 28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In the case at bench, there could have been no confusion concerning consideration of the guilt phase robbery and kidnapping crimes as section 190.3 factor (b) criminal activity. The trial court specifically instructed the jury as to which of defendant\u2019s alleged criminal acts could constitute \u201ccriminal activity\u201d and prior felony convictions <em>(ante, </em>fn. 13, p. 37); the guilt phase crimes were not among them.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">c. <em>Multiple Use of Prior-murder-conviction Special Circumstance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">The jury was required to consider the murder of White\u2014the murder underlying the prior-murder-conviction special circumstance\u2014under section 190.3 factor (a). In addition, the court in its list of possible other criminal activity and prior felony convictions permitted the jury to consider the murder twice more\u2014once as \u201cThe murder of Minnie Ola White,\u201d and once as \u201cDefendant\u2019s prior conviction of First Degree Murder.\u201d (See <em>ante, </em>fn. 13, p. 37.) Asserting that each of the factors is intended to be exclusive, defendant argues the court erred in permitting a \u201ctriple counting\u201d of the White murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">We have previously rejected the claim that the statutory factors are necessarily exclusive. Although factors (b) and (c) pertain only to criminal activity other than the crimes for which the defendant is convicted in the present proceeding <em>(People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 105-106), a prior felony conviction that involves a crime of violence can be considered under both factors (b) and (c) <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 764-765). The only limitation is that \u201can individual criminal act cannot be counted twice in aggravation <em>for the same purpose.\u201d (Id. </em>at p. 765, italics in original.)</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">The purpose of the prior-murder-conviction special circumstance is \u201cto circumscribe, as the Eighth Amendment requires [citation], the classes of persons who may properly be subject to the death penalty. . . . Unlike recidivism statutes, . . . section 190.2(a)(2) is directed neither to deterring misconduct nor to fostering rehabilitation.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hendricks, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 584, 595.) The purpose of section 190.3 factor (b), by contrast, is to show defendant\u2019s propensity for violence. And the purpose of factor (c) is to show the capital offense was the culmination of the defendant\u2019s habitual criminality\u2014that it was undeterred by the community\u2019s previous criminal sanctions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 764, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 202.) Given these distinct purposes, there is no constitutional impediment to consideration of a defendant\u2019s prior-murder conviction under factors (a), (b) and (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">In the instant case, because the murder of White involved force and violence, it could properly be considered under factor (b). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Melton, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number><em>supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at p. 764.) Had the conviction occurred before the instant offense, it could also be considered under factor (c). But because the conviction occurred after commission of the instant offense, the court erred in permitting the jury to consider it as a \u201cprior felony conviction\u201d under factor (c). <em>(People </em>v. <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 144, 203; see <em>Melton, supra.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">The error, however, clearly was nonprejudicial. Nothing in the argument of either party underscored multiple consideration of the prior conviction. The prosecutor never enumerated the statutory factors as such; he merely discussed defendant\u2019s prior criminal activity and convictions in general, without reference to their relevance to a particular factor or factors. Neither did he indicate to the jury that it was to \u201ccount\u201d aggravating factors. Rather, both he and defense counsel spoke of the jury\u2019s responsibility to \u201cweigh\u201d aggravating and mitigating factors. The jury was fully aware of defendant\u2019s first degree murder conviction for the killing of White, as well as the circumstances surrounding the killing. Nothing in the trial, the instructions or the argument was calculated to lead the jury to believe the White murder was more heinous because it came within three, rather than two, factors. We thus conclude the error in instructing the jury concerning application of section 190.3 factor (c) to the special circumstance murder could have had no bearing on its penalty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">4. <em>Refusal to Delete Inapplicable Mitigating Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">At the conclusion of the penalty phase, the jury was given the standard instruction to consider, \u201cif applicable,\u201d each of the statutory mitigating and aggravating factors, except the court deleted factor (e) (victim\u2019s participation or consent).<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> (\u00a7 190.3; see CALJIC No. 8.84.1.) Defendant argues the court was required to delete factors (f), (g) and (h) from the instructions, as inapplicable to this case. As we recently made clear in <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d 57, 104-105 (1978 law) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 776-777 (1977 law), however, deletion of inapplicable mitigating factors is not required.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">G. <em>Reversal for One Invalid Special Circumstance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Defendant argues that if we determine any one of the three special circumstances is invalid, the penalty verdict must be reversed. We have concluded each of the special circumstance findings is valid. We therefore need not address this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>H. <em>Unadjudicated Other-crimes Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">As evidence in aggravation the prosecutor introduced defendant\u2019s prior robbery conviction and evidence of four unadjudicated criminal acts involving violence (\u00a7 190.3, factor (b)): the murder of Parr, the murder of Rankin, the sodomy of inmate Smith and the robbery of Buss. Defendant maintains the introduction of unadjudicated criminal conduct at the penalty phase constitutes a denial of due process. He recognizes we rejected this contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Balderas, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 144, 204-205, but asks that we reconsider our decision. Because defendant provides no compelling reasons or new argument to justify reconsideration of <em>Balderas, </em>we decline to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Defendant also maintains the trial court erred in not instructing the jury in the penalty phase that it must be unanimous in a finding that other crimes occurred. We recently rejected the identical contention in <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 773-774.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">I. <em>Beeman Error.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">At the guilt phase the trial court instructed the jury on aiding and abetting in terms of the <em>pre-Beeman (People </em>v. <em>Beeman </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 547 [199 Cal.Rptr. 60, 674 P.2d 1318]) version of CALJIC Nos. 3.00 and 3.01.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The court gave no aiding and abetting instructions at the penalty phase, but instructed the jury to use whatever guilt phase instructions it found applicable and, with respect to defendant\u2019s alleged act of sodomy on Smith, expressly instructed that aiding and abetting principles applied.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">Defendant recognizes the court has no sua sponte duty to instruct the jury on the elements of unadjudicated other crimes offered in aggravation at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>the penalty phase. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 247, 281 [221 Cal.Rptr. 794, 710 P.2d 861].) He maintains that regardless of the trial court\u2019s sua sponte duty, any instructions it does give must be accurate. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martinez </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 660, 670 [203 Cal.Rptr. 833] and cases cited.) Because the evidence showed defendant\u2019s only liability for the sodomy of Smith would be as an aider and abettor, defendant asserts that the court\u2019s failure accurately to instruct the jury on the intent element of aiding and abetting constitutes reversible penalty phase error.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Croy </em>(1985) 41 Cal.3d 1 [221 Cal.Rptr. 592, 710 P.2d 392]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Garcia, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d 539.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">In <em>Davenport, supra, </em>a plurality of this court stated that \u201cthe cases do not prohibit a trial court from instructing on the elements of other crimes offered as aggravating factors in an appropriate case where either the defendant or the prosecution requests such instruction or the court itself determines such instruction is vital to a proper consideration of the evidence. [Citations.] Normally, a defendant\u2019s failure to request instruction on the elements of the other-crimes aggravating evidence will preclude him from raising the issue on appeal [citation] and appellant\u2019s claim is thus not properly before us.\u201d (41 Cal.3d at pp. 281-282.) In the case at bench, because the court undertook to instruct the jury that aiding and abetting principles would apply to the alleged sodomy and had earlier instructed it on those principles, a \u201cproper consideration of the evidence\u201d <em>(Davenport, supra) </em>required that the instructions given be accurate. Although <em>Beeman, supra, </em>35 Cal.3d 547, was decided after this case was tried, its holding applies retroactively. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Croy, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 12.)</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">The question is whether the inaccuracy in the instructions was prejudicial. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Dyer </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 26, 64 [246 Cal.Rptr. 209, 753 P.2d 1], we determined the appropriate standard of review for <em>Beeman </em>error after <em>Rose </em>v. <em>Clark </em>(1986) 478 U.S. 570 [92 L.Ed.2d 460, 106 S.Ct. 3101], and <em>Pope </em>v. <em>Illinois </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 497 [95 L.Ed.2d 439, 107 S.Ct. 1918], is the <em>Chapman </em>harmless error rule <em>(Chapman </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711]). Applying the <em>Chapman </em>standard, it appears the <em>Beeman </em>error was harmless. The instructions as given required that an aider and abettor have acted with knowledge of the perpetrator\u2019s unlawful purpose; hence one aspect of defendant\u2019s mental state was before the jury. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Croy, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 13-14.) According to the prosecution\u2019s evidence, defendant participated in the sodomy as an instigator with full knowledge and intent that the act occur. Defendant\u2019s defense, by contrast, was essentially a denial of any participation in the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>of sodomy.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If the jury believed the prosecution\u2019s case, therefore, it could not have determined that defendant, although knowing the perpetrator\u2019s criminal purpose, participated without intent to further that purpose; rather, the jury would have concluded either that defendant knew of and shared the perpetrator\u2019s intent or that he had nothing to do with the sodomy. Omission of the shared-intent element thus was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">J. <em>Accomplice Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">Defendant contends the court\u2019s guilt phase instructions on accomplice testimony require penalty reversal because Crenshaw\u2019s credibility was crucial to the determination of whether it was he or defendant who committed the charged and other murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">At the guilt phase the trial court delivered the standard instructions on the suspect nature of accomplice testimony.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Defendant argues the court undermined the effectiveness of the instructions and improperly enhanced Crenshaw\u2019s credibility by the improper modification of CALJIC No. 3.16 and the delivery of CALJIC No. 2.11.5 and a modified version of No. 2.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">1. <em>CALJIC No. 2.11.5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">CALJIC No. 2.11.5 advises the jury there has been evidence in the case indicating someone other than the defendant was or may have been involved in the crime for which the defendant is on trial and instructs the jury not to discuss or give any consideration as to why the other person is not being prosecuted or whether he has been or will be prosecuted. Defendant argues that, contrary to this instruction, the jury should have given thorough consideration to why Crenshaw was not being prosecuted along with defendant and what he might have hoped to gain from his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Although defendant is correct that CALJIC No. 2.11.5 should not be given in cases when the other person is a witness for either the prosecution or the defense (see use note to CALJIC No. 2.11.5 (4th ed. 1979); <em>People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number><em>Williams </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 1268, 1313 [248 Cal.Rptr. 834, 756 P.2d 221]), its use here could not have been prejudicial. The jury knew that Crenshaw had entered a plea in the White murder, that he was involved in the present offenses, that his counsel had approached the district attorney about negotiating a plea and obtaining \u201cthe best possible disposition\u201d of his case,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and that although Crenshaw initially had been charged with a special circumstance murder, at the time of trial he was facing only a non-special-circumstance charge. The jury was told it could consider the bias, interest and motives of any witness (CALJIC No. 2.20) and if defendant committed the crimes charged, Crenshaw was an accomplice as a matter of law whose testimony should be viewed with distrust (CALJIC No. 3.16, as modified; see also <em>ante, </em>fn. 25, p. 50). Implicit in the direction to view an accomplice\u2019s testimony with distrust is the judgment that an accomplice has an implied motive to testify in a manner beneficial to himself. Defense counsel emphasized this point, informing the jury Crenshaw was an accomplice as a matter of law and the reason it would be instructed to view his testimony with distrust is \u201che may want to escape prosecution and it may take some of the heat off of him in some fashion if he can wriggle his way out of this mess.\u201d The prosecutor, although informing the jury it was not to speculate as to what would happen to Crenshaw, readily acknowledged that \u201cMr. Crenshaw is up to here (indicating) in this case. There is no question in my mind at all about that. I don\u2019t know that there should be in your minds either. . . . Certainly he tried to exculpate himself from the situation, but certainly as well, he was a follower. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">In sum, the jury had before it evidence, argument and instructions underscoring Crenshaw\u2019s possible motive to lie and its duty to view his testimony with distrust. In the circumstances we believe \u201ca reasonable juror would continue to act in accordance with the court\u2019s charge on accomplice testimony, but would simply refrain from discussing or giving any consideration to the separate issue why [Crenshaw] was not being prosecuted in the present action or whether he . . . would be prosecuted.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1313.) Any error in giving CALJIC No. 2.11.5 was harmless. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Silva </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 604, 627 [247 Cal.Rptr. 573, 754 P.2d 1070].)</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>2. <em>CALJIC No. 3.16.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">Defendant maintains the trial court nullified the rule of section lili<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> and diluted the admonition to view accomplice testimony with distrust, by improperly modifying CALJIC No. 3.16, to state that \u201cIf the crime of kidnapping and/or robbery and/or murder was committed <em>by the defendant, </em>the witness Michael K. Crenshaw was an accomplice as a matter of law and his testimony is subject to the rule requiring corroboration.\u201d (Italics denotes modification.)<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The modification, defendant argues, made a finding of defendant\u2019s guilt a prerequisite to viewing Crenshaw\u2019s testimony with distrust and thus prevented the jury from applying the distrust and corroboration requirements to Crenshaw\u2019s testimony in the process of deciding defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">We believe the court\u2019s modification is potentially confusing and should not have been given. In determining whether error occurred, however, \u201cwe must look to the entire charge, rather than merely one part,...\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Chavez </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 823, 830 [218 Cal.Rptr. 49, 705 P.2d 372].) The jury was fully instructed on the need to view accomplice testimony with distrust and the need for corroboration. Both the prosecution and defense proceeded on the premise Crenshaw was an accomplice and argued whether his testimony was corroborated. \u201cOn review even if an erroneous instruction is included reversal is required only when it appears the error was likely to have misled the jury.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1983) 150 Cal.App.3d 148, 158 [197 Cal.Rptr. 655]; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 1313.) In the case at bench, the reference to defendant in CALJIC No. 3.16 could not have misled a reasonable juror into believing the accomplice instructions were inapplicable to Crenshaw\u2019s testimony as it applied to the question of defendant\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">3. <em>CALJIC No. 2.50.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">Defendant contends the court improperly modified former CALJIC No. 2.50 (1979 rev.) (evidence of other offenses) to permit the jury to consider evidence of other crimes to corroborate Crenshaw\u2019s testimony, as well as for identity and motive.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This modification, he argues, is unsupported by logic and authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>In <em>People </em>v. <em>Tassell, supra, </em>36 Cal.3d <em>11, </em>decided after trial in this case, we held other-crimes evidence is inadmissible solely to corroborate the prosecuting witness. CALJIC No. 2.50 has since been revised to omit any reference to corroboration. In <em>Tassell </em>we recognized, however, that if evidence of other crimes is admitted for some legitimate purpose, it will often tend to corroborate the victim of the charged crime. (See <em>id. </em>at p. 87.)</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Here, unlike <em>Tassell, </em>the court\u2019s modification referred not to a witness, but to an accomplice. The guilt phase evidence of defendant\u2019s other crimes\u2014the White murder, the Combs kidnapping, the Rankin kidnapping\u2014was, as indicated, properly admitted. The distinctive features of those offenses, including defendant\u2019s propensity to put his victims in the trunk of a car, logically tended to corroborate Crenshaw\u2019s testimony concerning the circumstances of the instant offense and would have been viewed in that light, even absent the court\u2019s modification. The penalty phase evidence of additional crimes\u2014the Parr murder and the Rankin murder \u2014was also properly admitted for purposes other than corroboration of Crenshaw and likewise tended to corroborate his testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The court instructed the jury that the other-crimes evidence could not be used to show defendant\u2019s disposition to commit crimes. There was ample other evidence to corroborate Crenshaw\u2019s testimony, including defendant\u2019s confession to Laughlin and physical evidence. The evidence in aggravation was overwhelming. We thus find no reasonable possibility of a more favorable result had the court not delivered the modified instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">K. <em>Rejection of Defense Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">1. <em>Disposition of Accomplice\u2019s Case.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Crenshaw, defendant\u2019s crime partner, pleaded guilty in the White case to a nonspecial circumstance first degree murder for which he received a sentence of 25 years to life and, at the time of defendant\u2019s penalty trial, was awaiting trial on a charge of nonspecial circumstance first degree murder in the Benham case. Defendant maintains the court erred in rejecting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>defense instructions that would have directed the jury in determining the appropriate penalty to consider the disposition of the White charge and the noncapital nature of the Benham charge against Crenshaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Belmontes </em>(1988) 45 Cal.3d 744 [248 Cal.Rptr. 126, 755 P.2d 310] we rejected the similar contention that the trial court erred in excluding evidence at the penalty phase of the pleas and negotiated dispositions of the defendant\u2019s accomplices. We stated that evidence of the accomplices\u2019 negotiated plea <em>dispositions\u2014\u201cseparate and apart from evidence of their complicity and degree of involvement in the instant offenses </em>\u2014bore no relevance to the jury\u2019s properly guided function at the penalty phase.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 811, italics in original; accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Dyer, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 26, 69-71.) This conclusion was founded on the principle that the jury, in making its penalty determination, is required to focus on the character and record of the individual offender and, as to these, the disposition of charges against the defendant\u2019s accomplices has no relevance.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">In the case at bench the jury was aware of Crenshaw\u2019s plea and sentence in the White case and the nature of the charges against him in the Benham case. Both sides fully argued Crenshaw\u2019s and defendant\u2019s relative culpability. For the reasons stated in <em>Belmontes, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pages 811-812, we find the court did not err in refusing to instruct the jury to consider the nature or disposition of the charges against Crenshaw in making its penalty determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">2. <em>Definition of Mitigating and Aggravating Circumstances.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Defendant argues the trial court erred in rejecting his proffered instruction relating to aggravating and mitigating circumstances.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">The first two paragraphs of the instruction define aggravating and mitigating circumstances in terms similar to those approved in <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at page 289. Although giving the instructions may <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>have provided a \u201chelpful framework\u201d for the jury\u2019s consideration of the statutory circumstances in aggravation and mitigation <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dyer, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 82), the court\u2019s refusal was not error. \u201cAggravation\u201d and \u201cmitigation\u201d are commonly understood terms. A trial court is not required to instruct on the meaning of terms that are commonly understood. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Page </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 569, 577 [163 Cal.Rptr. 839] [statutory language is generally sufficient].) We believe the jury, without definition of the terms, is capable of deciding which of the statutory factors increase the \u201cguilt or enormity\u201d of a crime <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at p. 289) and which extenuate or reduce the degree of moral culpability <em>(ibid.). </em>(Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. <em>Ill </em>[determining which factors are \u201capplicable\u201d].)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">It is established, of course, that in determining penalty the jury is permitted to consider in aggravation only evidence relevant to the statutorily enumerated aggravating factors, but is required to consider in mitigation any evidence bearing on defendant\u2019s character and background that he proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d 762, 775; <em>People </em>v. <em>Easley, supra, </em>34 Cal.3d 858, 878.) In the instant case no confusion on this point could have occurred: the court fully instructed the jury as to the circumstances it should consider in reaching its penalty determination; there was no prosecutorial argument or other basis for confusion as to which factors were aggravating and which mitigating (cf. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d at pp. 288-290; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 789-790); and defense counsel argued defendant\u2019s mitigating background and character evidence at length.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">The final paragraph of the requested instruction directed the jury to weigh the mitigating and aggravating circumstances in reaching its penalty determination and informed it that defendant\u2019s guilt of first degree murder was not in itself an aggravating circumstance. The first part was essentially duplicative of the court\u2019s modified version of CALJIC No. 8.84.2, pursuant to which the jury was instructed to weigh the applicable factors in making its penalty determination and, moreover, was given the option of not imposing the death penalty even if the aggravating factors did outweigh the mitigating factors <em>{ante, </em>fn. 16, p. 39). The second part was potentially confusing in that it conflicted somewhat with CALJIC No. 8.84.1, par. (a), which told the jury to consider the circumstances of the crime in determining punishment, and also was potentially misleading, in that defendant\u2019s prior murder conviction was a special circumstance which the jury could consider. Refusal of these two proffered instructions thus was not error.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>L. <em>Cumulative Effect of Errors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">Defendant maintains that even if no single error caused sufficient prejudice to warrant reversal, the cumulative effect of the asserted errors denied him a fair penalty trial, mandating reversal of the penalty judgment. We disagree. As penalty phase error we have identified (1) the prosecutor\u2019s insinuations of defense witnesses who refused to testify and an additional murder; (2) <em>Beeman </em>error concerning the Smith sodomy; (3) certain of the accomplice instructions; and (4) consideration of the White murder under factor (c) as well as factors (a) and (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Even in combination, these errors do not warrant reversal. As we have noted, with twenty-four witnesses testifying for defendant, the implication others were asked but refused to testify was patently harmless; the insinuation of an additional murder was refuted by Combs\u2019s prior trial testimony and was insignificant in any event in light of defendant\u2019s four proven murders; the asserted <em>Beeman </em>error was harmless in light of the evidence demonstrating defendant either assisted the sodomy with intent it occur or was not involved; the jury was fully and repeatedly informed by the court\u2019s instructions and both counsel\u2019s argument that Crenshaw\u2019s testimony should be viewed with distrust; and, finally, the jury was fully aware of the White murder and its circumstances, and neither the court\u2019s instructions nor the prosecutor\u2019s argument suggested the murder should weigh more heavily because it came within three, rather than two, statutory factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">The aggravating evidence showed that, alone and with Crenshaw, defendant perpetrated multiple brutal criminal acts, including four murders, during the short period of his freedom after escaping from jail; and that soon after his return to jail he participated in a violent sexual assault on a fellow inmate. The mitigating evidence showed a troubled childhood and a hyperactive and antisocial personality. Under these circumstances, we find there is no reasonable possibility of a more favorable penalty verdict in the absence of the errors. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 432, 448 [250 Cal.Rptr. 604, 758 P.2d 1135]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Lucky, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at pp. 303-304.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>M. <em>Modification Motion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">As reversible error in denying his automatic motion for modification of penalty (\u00a7 190.4, subd. (e)), defendant asserts the court\u2019s findings of no mitigating evidence and lack of remorse and its artificial inflation of aggravating circumstances and mechanical balancing of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">1. <em>Lack of Mitigating Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">Concerning mitigating evidence, the trial court stated in part that it had examined the material offered by defendant in the penalty phase \u201cand finds beyond any reasonable doubt that there are no circumstances which extenuate the gravity of the crime, whether or not such circumstances were a legal excuse. None of the witnesses called on behalf of the defendant could offer any explanation or give any evidence of any conceivable circumstances that the Court finds would extenuate the gravity of this crime.\u201d Reviewing the evidence of defendant\u2019s troubled youth and attention-deficit disorder and his diagnosis as an antisocial personality, the court concluded that in its opinion \u201cNone of this evidence would be a moral justification or extenuation of the brutal murder of the victim ... by defendant and his cohort, Michael Crenshaw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">Defendant contends the court misunderstood the permissible scope of relevant mitigating evidence by restricting its consideration to evidence within the narrow terms of section 190.3 factor (k), i.e., evidence which extenuates the gravity of the crime, without considering other sympathetic aspects of defendant\u2019s character and background that he proffered in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">We are unpersuaded. The record shows the court was aware of the full scope of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence, but determined nothing in this evidence sufficed to explain or mitigate the \u201cbrutal,\u201d the \u201cvicious and wanton, inhumane\u201d nature of the crime. <em>(See People </em>v. <em>Babbitt, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d 660, 723-724.) The court, as it stated at the outset of its ruling, thus agreed with the jury that \u201cthe circumstances in aggravation outweigh[] the circumstances in mitigation\u201d and \u201cthe selection of the proper penalty to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>death is supported by the weight of the evidence.\u201d Finally, in light of the court\u2019s stated view of the nature of the crime as well as the other aggravating factors, including defendant\u2019s four proven murders, the asserted error in the court\u2019s consideration of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence could not have prejudiced defendant. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>46 Cal.3d at p.462.)</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">2. <em>Artificial Inflation of Aggravating Factors and Mechanical Balancing of Factors.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">Defendant asserts the trial court impermissibly considered both felony-murder special circumstances and engaged in the \u201cdouble counting\u201d of aggravating factors under paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of CALJIC No. 8.84.1, thus artificially inflating the circumstances weighing in favor of death. He argues further that the court improperly based its decision on a mechanical balancing process rather than an independent assessment of whether death was the appropriate punishment, an error assertedly compounded by its implied findings that the absence of certain mitigating factors was an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">Nothing in the court\u2019s statement of reasons supports defendant\u2019s assertions of error. The court did not apply the evidence to specific enumerated factors and tally aggravating as against mitigating factors. Rather, it recited the evidence, the special circumstances and the applicable and inapplicable aggravating and mitigating factors as part of an integrated process directed to determining whether the evidence supported the jury\u2019s choice of death as the appropriate penalty in light of the offense and the offender. The court\u2019s instruction to the jury that if aggravating circumstances outweighed mitigating it could (but was not required to) impose a sentence of death <em>{ante, </em>fn. 16, p. 39) refutes defendant\u2019s claim the court understood the process to be one of a mechanical weighing of factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">Nor did the court err in reciting mitigating factors that did not apply, e.g., that defendant did not act under duress or the domination of another person, \u201cto wit: Crenshaw\u201d; he was not an accomplice whose participation was relatively minor; he was not under the influence of mental or emotional disturbance; and his age had no \u201cbearing in mitigating his homicidal conduct.\u201d Because this was a two-person crime and much of the defense was directed to placing primary responsibility on Crenshaw, defendant\u2019s relative culpability was relevant. And because defendant had placed his emotional and mental problems in issue, these too were relevant.  A court does not err in observing the inapplicability of potentially relevant mitigating factors. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 789-790.) Nothing in the court\u2019s statement suggests it considered the absence of the mitigating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>factors a circumstance in aggravation. (Compare <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>with <em>People </em>v. <em>Davenport, supra, </em>41 Cal.3d 247, 288-289.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">3. <em>Lack of Remorse.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">Defendant urges the trial court\u2019s reliance on his asserted lack of remorse impermissibly infringed on his constitutional rights <em>(People </em>v. <em>Coleman </em>(1969) 71 Cal.2d 1159, 1168-1169 [80 Cal.Rptr. 920, 459 P.2d 248]), penalized him for failing in his guilt phase testimony to mention something irrelevant to the issues and thus inadmissible, engaged in speculative inferences from his silence and considered a nonstatutory factor in aggravation in violation of <em>People </em>v. <em>Boyd, supra, </em>38 Cal.3d at pages 775-776.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Ghent, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d 739, 771 (1977 law) and other recent cases (e.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Dyer, supra, </em>45 Cal.3d at p. 82 [1978 law]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Miranda, supra, </em>44 Cal.3d at pp. 111-112 [same]) we have considered and rejected the contention that consideration of a defendant\u2019s lack of remorse is error. We adhere to those decisions here. We note, moreover, that in the instant case the court\u2019s observation that defendant lacked remorse need not have derived from defendant\u2019s silence: defendant\u2019s statements to Laughlin that he got a thrill out of killing people fully supported its finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">The trial court\u2019s charge under section 190.4, subdivision (e) is to review the evidence and, guided by the factors set forth in section 190.3, to determine \u201cwhether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.\u201d In the instant case the court properly concluded the jury\u2019s findings and verdict were supported by the evidence and the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">N. <em>Constitutionality of Statute.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b89-10\">Defendant makes familiar arguments concerning the constitutionality of the 1978 death penalty statute. He maintains the statute is unconstitutional under the due process clause of the California and federal Constitutions (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 7, subd. (a), 15; U.S. Const., Amend. XIV) for failure to require as a prerequisite to imposition of the death penalty that the jury find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors and that death is the appropriate penalty. We have rejected the identical constitutional challenge in <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pages 777-778. (Accord, <em>People </em>v. <em>Gates, supra, </em>43 Cal.3d at p. 1201.)</p>\n<p id=\"b89-12\">Defendant asserts that the 1978 statute is constitutionally infirm as lacking in certain procedural safeguards to ensure against arbitrary death judg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>ments, e.g., specification of aggravating and mitigating factors; a requirement that the jury find aggravating circumstances unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt; written findings as to the aggravating factors relied on in imposing a sentence of death; and appellate proportionality (comparative sentence) review. Each of his arguments has been considered and rejected in recent opinions. (E.g., <em>People </em>v. <em>Allen, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d 1222, 1285; <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at pp. 777-779.)</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">IV.

In the Benham case, pending at the time of this appeal, he initially was charged with capital murder, but the special circumstance allegation was subsequently dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-9\">When called by the prosecution, Crenshaw invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege by refusing to answer all questions relating to his activities between the dates of March 19, 1981, and March 24, 1981.

In <em>Sassounian </em>the court cites testimony by Laughlin that he participated in a plan to incriminate Sassounian in return for anticipated prosecution favors and that he had repeatedly lied to \u201cnearly every representative of law enforcement who contacted him in [the] case.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 392-393.)</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">On cross-examination in this case Laughlin acknowledged he had testified in several other cases, but denied he received anything in exchange. The parties subsequently stipulated that the escape charges pending against Laughlin had been dismissed for insufficient evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b64-8\"> Three cellmates of defendant testified defendant made no statements to Laughlin in their presence and defendant was not \u201ca talker.\u201d Defendant testified he never spoke to Laughlin about his case and Laughlin must have acquired his information by going through defendant\u2019s papers. The parties stipulated defendant had police reports in his possession which reflected the circumstances and investigations of many of the incidents that had been testified to during the trial. During his testimony, moreover, Laughlin admitted he was a witness in four other pending cases and that two of his pending charges had been dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b65-8\">At defendant\u2019s request, we have taken judicial notice of minute orders showing Crenshaw\u2019s nolo contendere plea to White\u2019s murder on November 5, 1982, and his sentencing on December 10, 1982, and of a March 3, 1988, letter of the court clerk stating that court records reveal no notice of appeal in the case. Because judgment against Crenshaw in the White <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>case was entered more than three months before he invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege at the guilt phase of trial and no appeal was taken, the conviction was final at that time.

The majority find it appropriate to allow the jury to rely on each crime which is the basis of a special circumstance finding as a separate aggravating factor since \u201c \u2018[ejach of the crimes underlying the felony-murder special circumstances invades a distinct interest which society seeks to protect by defining these acts as crimes.\u2019 \u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 45, quoting <em>People </em>v. <em>Bean </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 919, 955 [760 P.2d 996].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">I disagree with this holding, for the reasons stated in my dissent in <em>People </em>v. <em>Melton </em>(1988) 44 Cal.3d 713, 772 et seq. [244 Cal.Rptr. 867, 750 P.2d 741]. The use of duplicative aggravating factors falsely inflates the aggravating circumstances of the crime and fails to guide the jury adequately. We should adhere to the plurality view in <em>People </em>v. <em>Harris </em>(1984) 36 Cal.3d 36, 65 [201 Cal.Rptr. 782, 679 P.2d 433], that when two crimes giving rise to separate special circumstance findings arise out of an indivisible course of conduct, the two crimes should be considered as a single aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">I would not reverse the penalty verdict on this basis, since there appears no reasonable possibility that the error in allowing duplicative special circumstances to be used in aggravation affected the verdict. I do dissent from the affirmance of the penalty verdict, however, because of the trial court\u2019s error in ruling on the automatic application for modification of the verdict of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Penal Code section 190.4, subdivision (e) provides that in ruling on the automatic application for modification of the verdict, \u201cthe judge shall review the evidence, consider, take into account, and be guided by the aggravating and mitigating circumstances referred to in Section 190.3, and shall make a determination as to whether the jury\u2019s findings and verdicts that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating circumstances are contrary to law or the evidence presented.\u201d The court must make an \u201cindependent determination whether imposition of the death penalty upon the defendant is proper in light of the relevant evidence and the applicable law.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez </em>(1986) 42 Cal.3d 730, 793 [230 Cal.Rptr. 667, 726 P.2d 113].)</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">It must be apparent that the court cannot fulfill its obligation to make an independent determination whether the penalty is proper if it does not apply the applicable law correctly. It is established that all evidence regarding defendant\u2019s character or background which he proffers as a basis for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>rejecting the death penalty must be considered, whether or not the evidence extenuates or mitigates the gravity of the charged offenses. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Easley </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 858, 875 et seq. [196 Cal.Rptr. 309, 671 P.2d 813].) The record demonstrates that the trial court erroneously limited its consideration of mitigating evidence to the literal terms of Penal Code section 190.3 factor (k), that is, to evidence which actually extenuated the gravity of the crime. As the majority note, the trial court stated that \u201cthere are no circumstances which extenuate the gravity of the crime, whether or not such circumstances were a legal excuse. None of the witnesses called on behalf of the defendant could offer any explanation or give any evidence of any conceivable circumstances that the Court finds would extenuate the gravity of this crime.\u201d The court later reiterated: \u201cNone of this evidence [of defendant\u2019s troubled youth and mental disorders] would be a moral justification or extenuation of the brutal murder of the victim. . . .\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 57.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">The majority are confident that the trial court considered all of defendant\u2019s mitigating evidence, but that none of it mitigated the horror of the charged crimes. (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at p. 57.) However, the law requires that the mitigating evidence be considered not only if it mitigates the charged crimes, but also if it provides a basis for a penalty less than death. It is apparent that the trial court failed to consider the proffered mitigating evidence for this purpose. We should not be reluctant to remand to trial courts for the relatively simple matter of reconsidering their rulings on motions to modify the verdict, when they have erred in applying the law. \u201c[W]hen we consider a judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to modify, there is no reason to tolerate any degree of ambiguity. A remand for a new modification hearing, in contrast to a new trial, involves minimal judicial resources and minimal delay. There is no reason to guess as to whether the trial judge considered the mitigating evidence, or whether it would have made a difference if he had considered it. We can send the case back, direct him to consider it, and find out if it makes any difference.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Hamilton </em>(1988) 46 Cal.3d 123, 160 [249 Cal.Rptr. 320, 756 P.2d 1348] (cone, and dis. opn. of Broussard, J.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">I would vacate the penalty judgment and remand with directions to the trial court to reconsider the application in light of the applicable law. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Rodriguez, supra, </em>42 Cal.3d at p.794.)</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a rehearing was denied January 9, 1989, and the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
