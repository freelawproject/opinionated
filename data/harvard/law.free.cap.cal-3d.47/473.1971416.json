We conclude that ERISA does preempt such an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">Joseph V. Juliano\u2019s employer sponsored an employee benefit plan insured by Commercial Life Insurance Company and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (collectively referred to as Commercial). It is undisputed that the plan was the type regulated by ERISA. The benefits under the plan included group term life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, major medical expense benefits, prescription drug and medicine benefits, and dental care benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">Juliano suffered from diabetes, which adversely affected his eyesight. Doctors recommended surgery. Following the surgery, Juliano forwarded his medical bills to Commercial. Commercial refused payment, claiming that the treatment was not covered by the plan because it arose from a preexisting condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">Juliano brought suit against Commercial. The complaint alleged eight common law causes of action for bad faith, waiver, and estoppel. The complaint also alleged a single statutory cause of action for bad faith under section 790.03, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Commercial answered the complaint. Then, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>prior to trial, Commercial filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, alleging that each cause of action set forth by Juliano was preempted by ERISA. In response, Juliano conceded that <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux </em>(1987) 481 U.S. 41 [95 L.Ed.2d 39, 107 S.Ct. 1549] compelled the conclusion that his common law causes of action were preempted by ERISA. However, he argued that his statutory cause of action under section 790.03, subdivision (h), was not preempted. The trial court agreed with Juliano and denied Commercial\u2019s motion for judgment on the pleadings as to the statutory cause of action for violation of section 790.03, subdivision (h).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">Commercial filed a petition for writ of mandate and/or prohibition in the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal summarily denied the petition. We granted review and issued an alternative writ.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">In his return to the writ, Juliano argues that section 790.03, subdivision (h) is exempt from preemption because it \u201cregulates insurance\u201d within the meaning of ERISA\u2019s \u201csaving clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">ERISA comprehensively regulates employee pension and welfare plans. <em>(Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts </em>(1985) 471 U.S. 724, 732 [85 L.Ed.2d 728, 735-736, 105 S.Ct. 2380]; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1003, 1002.) The act protects interstate commerce and the participants of employee benefit plans by requiring disclosure to participants, establishing standards of conduct and fiduciary duties, and providing for remedies, sanctions, and ready access to federal courts. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001(b).) While ERISA imposes upon benefit plans a variety of substantive requirements relating to participation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>funding, and vesting, it contains almost no federal regulation of the substantive terms of benefit plans. <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 732 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 735-736].)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">ERISA\u2019s civil remedies are comprehensive in their scope. A participant or beneficiary of an ERISA plan may bring a civil action for monetary relief from an administrator\u2019s failure to provide requested information, or to recover benefits or enforce present or future rights under the terms of the plan. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).) Moreover, a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary may sue to enjoin any act which violates ERISA or the terms of the plan, and may also sue for other equitable relief, or for breach of fiduciary duty. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The Secretary of Labor may also bring an action for breach of fiduciary duty, for injunctive or equitable relief, for relief from failure of the administrator to provide information, or to collect any civil penalties under the act. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In addition, ERISA contains detailed provisions for claims enforcement and procedure. (29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1132, 1133.) Moreover, regulations promulgated by the Department of Labor pursuant to 29 United States Code section 1133 provide specific claims-handling rules and procedures. (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 2560.502-1 et seq.)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">ERISA also contains a broad preemption provision. The \u201cpreemption clause\u201d provides: \u201cExcept as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title and not exempt under section 1003(b) of this title. This section shall take effect on January 1, 1975.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).) The breadth of the preemption clause is qualified, however, by the \u201csaving clause,\u201d which provides in pertinent part: \u201c[N]othing in this subchapter shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance, banking, or securities.\u201d (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Our resolution of this case is aided by previous decisions of the United States Supreme Court. In <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Massachusetts, supra, </em>471 U.S. 724, the Supreme Court addressed the question whether ERISA preempted a Massachusetts statute which required certain minimum mental-health-care benefits to be included in employee health-care plans. The Massachusetts statute regulated the substantive terms of insurance contracts by requiring health insurance policies to provide, among other things, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>60 days of coverage for confinement in a mental hospital and certain minimum outpatient benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Noting that there is a presumption against preemption <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 741 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 741]), the court concluded that the Massachusetts statute was saved from preemption because it regulated insurance within the meaning of ERISA\u2019s saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">The court applied the following analysis to determine whether the Massachusetts statute regulated insurance. Initially, the court took a \u201ccommon sense\u201d view of the matter, concluding that the Massachusetts statute regulated insurance because it controlled the substantive terms of insurance policies. <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 740 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 741].)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Next, the court applied three criteria adopted by case law to define the \u201cbusiness of insurance\u201d under the McCarran-Ferguson Act (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1011 et seq.):<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c <em>\u2018first, </em>whether the practice has the effect of transferring or spreading a policyholder\u2019s risk; <em>second, </em>whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured; and <em>third, </em>whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry.\u2019\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 743 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 742], quoting <em>Union Labor Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Pireno </em>(1982) 458 U.S. 119, 129 [73 L.Ed.2d 647, 656, 102 S.Ct. 3002], original italics.)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">The United States Supreme Court found that all three McCarran-Ferguson factors were satisfied. Addressing the first factor, the court held that the Massachusetts statute \u201cobviously\u201d effected the spreading of risk, because the statute \u201cwas intended to effectuate the legislative judgment that the risk of mental-health care should be shared.\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 743 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 742].) Turning to the second factor, the court held that \u201cmandated-benefit laws directly regulate an integral part of the relationship between the insurer and the policyholder by limiting the type of insurance that an insurer may sell to the policyholder.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The third factor was also met, because the Massachusetts statute imposed requirements only on insurers. <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">The Supreme Court had a further opportunity to determine the scope of ERISA preemption in <em>Pilot Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, supra, </em>481 U.S. 41 [95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>L.Ed.2d 39, 107 S.Ct. 1549]. <em>Pilot Life </em>presented the issue whether ERISA preempted common law tort and contract actions arising from the improper processing of a claim for benefits under an insured employee benefit plan. Everate Dedeaux injured his back while working for Entex, Inc. Dedeaux sought disability benefits under an employee benefit plan insured by Pilot Life Insurance Company (Pilot Life). Pilot Life terminated Dedeaux\u2019s benefits after two years, and Dedeaux brought a diversity suit in federal district court. Dedeaux alleged Mississippi common law claims for fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of contract. However, he did not assert any of the causes of action available to him under ERISA. Pilot Life moved for summary judgment, arguing that ERISA preempted all of Dedeaux\u2019s claims. The district court granted summary judgment, but the circuit court of appeals reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-4\">The Supreme Court reversed the court of appeals. Stating that \u201cthe express pre-emption provisions of ERISA are deliberately expansive, and designed to \u2018establish pension plan regulation as exclusively a federal concern\u2019\u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 45-46 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 46, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1552]), the Supreme Court concluded that Dedeaux\u2019s claims were preempted. Although the Supreme Court applied the <em>Metropolitan Life </em>analysis to support its conclusion, it relied primarily on the \u201cclear expression of congressional intent that ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement scheme be exclusive\u201d to find preemption. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 57 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 54, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Proceeding first with the <em>Metropolitan Life </em>analysis, the court applied the \u201ccommon-sense view\u201d to find that the Mississippi common law of bad faith could not be construed as a law that regulated insurance within the meaning of the saving clause. \u201cA common-sense view of the word \u2018regulates\u2019 would lead to the conclusion that in order to regulate insurance, a law must not just have an impact on the insurance industry, but be specifically directed toward that industry.\u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 50 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 49, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1554].)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">The court next applied the McCarran-Ferguson factors. Regarding the first factor\u2014whether the practice has the effect of spreading policyholder risk\u2014the court determined, without explanation, that unlike the mandated-benefits law in <em>Metropolitan Life, </em>the Mississippi common law did not effect a spreading of policyholder risk. <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 50 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 49, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1554].) Addressing the second factor\u2014 whether the practice is an integral part of the policy relationship between the insurer and the insured \u2014the court stated that the Mississippi common law could perhaps be considered a part of the insurer-insured relationship, but that the connection was attenuated at best. \u201cIn contrast to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>mandated-benefits law in <em>Metropolitan Life, </em>the common law of bad faith does not define the terms of the relationship between the insurer and the insured; it declares only that, whatever terms have been agreed upon in the insurance contract, a breach of that contract may in certain circumstances allow the policyholder to obtain punitive damages.\u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 51 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 50, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1555].) Thus, although the common law could be considered a \u201cpart\u201d of the insurer-insured relationship, it could not be considered an \u201cintegral\u201d part. <em>(Ibid.) </em>Finally, applying <em>the </em>third factor\u2014whether the practice is limited to entities within the insurance industry\u2014the court noted that the common law had general application to all members of the community, and was not directed solely to the insurance industry. <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court concluded that the Mississippi common law failed the McCarran-Ferguson test. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 51 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 50, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 1554-1555].)</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\">The court easily distinguished its <em>Pilot Life </em>holding from the holding in <em>Metropolitan Life. (Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 57 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 54, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1558].) <em>Metropolitan Life </em>did not involve a state law that conflicted with a substantive provision of ERISA, because ERISA\u2014unlike the Massachusetts law in <em>Metropolitan </em>Life\u2014\u201cdoes not regulate the substantive content of welfare-benefit plans.\u201d <em>(Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at p. 732 [85 L.Ed.2d at p. 735].) However, in <em>Pilot Life </em>the common law remedies asserted by Dedeaux conflicted with ERISA\u2019s remedies. Therefore, the court in <em>Pilot Life </em>went on to determine whether Congress intended the ERISA remedies to be exclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The Supreme Court concluded that Congress clearly expressed an intent that the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA be the exclusive vehicle for actions by ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits. <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 51-52 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 50, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1555].) The court\u2019s determination of exclusivity is supported by the language and structure of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions and by the legislative history of the act.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>(Ibid.) </em>\u201cIn sum, the detailed provisions of \u00a7 502(a) [of ERISA (29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132)] set forth a comprehensive civil enforcement scheme that represents a careful balancing of the need for prompt and fair claims settlement procedures against the public interest in encouraging the formation of employee benefit plans. The policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA.\u201d The court added: \u201cThe deliberate care with which ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement remedies were drafted and the balancing of policies embodied in its choice of remedies argue strongly for the conclusion that ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement remedies were intended to be exclusive.\u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 54 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 52, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 1556-1557].)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><em>Metropolitan Life </em>and <em>Pilot Life </em>provide helpful guidance in this case, but the Supreme Court has not addressed the precise issue posed here. A number of other courts, however, have faced this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\"><em>Roberson </em>v. <em>Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of US. </em>(C.D.Cal. 1987) 661 F.Supp. 416 involved facts almost identical to those at bar. Plaintiff Donald Roberson brought an action in state court against The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States (Equitable), alleging that Equitable failed to pay all benefits due under an ERISA-regulated employee benefit plan. Roberson\u2019s complaint stated seven common law causes of action. The complaint also stated a single statutory cause of action under section 790.03, subdivision (h), and a single cause of action against his employer, Alpha Microsystems, for ERISA remedies. The defendants removed the case to federal court and moved for summary judgment in light of <em>Pilot Life. </em>Roberson conceded that all of his common law claims were preempted by ERISA, but argued that his statutory claim under section 790.03, subdivision (h) was not preempted because section 790.03, subdivision (h) regulates insurance within the meaning of ERISA\u2019s saving clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">The district court applied the analysis set forth in <em>Metropolitan Life </em>and <em>Pilot Life. </em>The court initially concluded that \u201ccommon sense\u201d suggested that section 790.03, subdivision (h) regulates insurance. \u201cThe most persuasive argument in support of saving the California statute is its obvious connection to regulating insurance. Thus, under the \u2018common sense\u2019 test, it would strain logic to argue that section 790.03(h) is not specifically directed toward the insurance industry.\u201d <em>(Roberson, supra, </em>661 F.Supp. at p.422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">The court determined, however, that section 790.03, subdivision (h) did not satisfy two of the three McCarran-Ferguson criteria. \u201cFirst, it would not appear that 790.03(h) has any effect of transferring or spreading policyholder risk. Unlike the Massachusetts law in <em>Metropolitan Life, </em>section 790.03(h) does not purport to regulate the substantive terms or content of insurance policies by mandating benefits. Rather, subsection (h) of section 790.03 primarily is aimed at the procedural aspect of processing and settling claims.\u201d <em>(Roberson, supra, </em>661 F.Supp. at p. 422.) Turning to the second <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>McCarran-Ferguson factor, the court stated: \u201cDespite its providing for more specific standards of conduct in processing claims for benefits, section 790.03(h) is not \u2018integral\u2019 to the insurer-insured relationship. Section 790.03(h) does not regulate the terms of the contract itself and hence does not regulate \u2018the business of insurance\u2019 as that term is defined under the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court determined that section 790.03, subdivision (h) is directed toward the insurance industry, and therefore the third McCarran-Ferguson factor was satisfied. But the court cited authority for the proposition that the satisfaction of only one factor is insufficient. <em>(Ibid., </em>citing <em>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers </em>v. <em>Pacyga </em>(9th Cir. 1986) 801 F.2d 1157, 1161.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">Finally, the court in <em>Roberson </em>followed <em>Pilot Life\u2019s </em>holding that ERISA\u2019s remedies are exclusive. In <em>Pilot Life, </em>\u201cbecause the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA were intended to provide the exclusive remedies for mishandling of claims, the Mississippi law was in conflict with ERISA and was therefore pre-empted. [If] The same potential for conflict with ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provisions exists with respect to California Insurance Code Section 790.03(h). . . . Section 790.03(h) . . . provides that either an insured <em>or </em>third-party claimant may sue an insurer for engaging in unfair claims settlement practices .... Such provisions reach impermissibly beyond the scope of ERISA. <em>See, e.g. [Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell </em>(1985) 473 U.S. 134, 145-148] (holding that ERISA does not grant a private right of action for delay in processing benefit claims).\u201d <em>(Roberson, supra, </em>661 F.Supp. at p. 423, original italics.) The court concluded: \u201cThus, even assuming that section 790.03(h) regulates insurance and is therefore within the scope of the saving clause, it must be pre-empted for infringing on the same exclusive civil remedy provisions that were dispositive in <em>Pilot Life.\u201d (Roberson, supra, </em>661 F.Supp. at p. 424, fn. omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">In <em>Kanne </em>v. <em>Connecticut General Life Ins. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1988) 859 F.2d 96, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals began where <em>Roberson </em>left off: It found the conclusion inescapable that section 790.03, subdivision (h) is preempted under <em>Pilot Life. </em>Although the Ninth Circuit stated its general agreement with the <em>Roberson </em>opinion <em>(id. </em>at p. 100, fn. 6), it was willing to assume for purposes of its analysis that section \u201c790.03(h) is a law regulating insurance under the savings clause.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 100.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">The <em>Kanne </em>court rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument for limiting <em>Pilot Life\u2019s </em>preemption holding to only those state laws which do not fall within the savings clause: \u201cTo accept this argument, ... we would have to ignore the second half of <em>Pilot Life, </em>107 S.Ct. 1555-58, in which the Court made abundantly clear that its preemption holding was equally based on its acceptance of the Solicitor General\u2019s view that \u2018Congress clearly expressed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>intent that the civil enforcement provisions of ERISA \u00a7 502(a) be the exclusive vehicle for actions asserting improper processing of a claim for benefits.\u2019 \u201d (859 F.2d at p. 100.) The court concluded that it was not possible to read the <em>Pilot Life </em>discussion of congressional intent as permitting a state statute like section 790.03, subdivision (h) to supplement the ERISA civil enforcement provisions available to remedy improper claims processing. (859 F.2d at p. 100.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">Our reading of <em>Pilot Life </em>accords with that of the Ninth Circuit in <em>Kanne. </em>We are persuaded that section 790.03, subdivision (h) would still be preempted by ERISA even if it were found to be within the scope of the savings clause as a law regulating insurance. This conclusion is compelled by the Supreme Court\u2019s discussion of congressional intent, which the court cited as the most significant factor in its determination. (See <em>Pilot Life Ins. </em>v. <em>Dedeaux, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 57 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 54, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1558].)</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">In <em>Pilot Life, </em>the Supreme Court held that Congress intended the remedies set forth in ERISA to be the <em>exclusive </em>remedies available to ERISAplan claimants. <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 50-56 [95 L.Ed.2d at pp. 50-53, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 1555-1557].) However, section 790.03, subdivision (h), as had been interpreted by our decision in <em>Royal Globe, supra, </em>23 Cal.3d 880, provided a private litigant with a cause of action for bad faith settlement practices. (See part IV, <em>post, </em>p. 484.) This remedy is not available under ERISA. (Cf. <em>Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>v. <em>Russell, supra, </em>473 U.S. at pp. 145-148 [87 L.Ed.2d at pp. 105-107] [private right of action for extracontractual damages is neither expressly nor impliedly available under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1109(a)].) Therefore, the remedy available to a private litigant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>under section 790.03, subdivision (h), conflicts with ERISA\u2019s exclusive remedies. This type of conflict was expressly disallowed in <em>Pilot Life. (Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 50-57 [95 L.Ed.2d at pp. 50-54, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 1555-1558].) Moreover, in <em>Pilot Life </em>the Supreme Court held that Congress\u2019s omission of certain remedies was intentional: \u201cThe policy choices reflected in the inclusion of certain remedies and the exclusion of others under the federal scheme would be completely undermined if ERISA-plan participants and beneficiaries were free to obtain remedies under state law that Congress rejected in ERISA. \u2018The six carefully integrated civil enforcement provisions found in \u00a7 502(a) of the statute as finally enacted . . . provide strong evidence that Congress did <em>not </em>intend to authorize other remedies that it simply forgot to incorporate expressly.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at p. 54 [95 L.Ed.2d at p. 52, 107 S.Ct. at p. 1556], quoting <em>Massachusetts Mut.

We conclude that <em>Pilot Life\u2019s </em>express holding controls the resolution of this case.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Pilot Life </em>is directly on point regarding the exclusivity issue, and its conclusion is inescapable.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">We find no merit in the argument that if there is any conflict between ERISA remedies and section 790.03, subdivision (h) remedies, such conflict was created by Congress when it enacted ERISA\u2019s preemption clause and saving clause. The argument asserts that the saving clause allows states to regulate insurance and hence to enact conflicting remedies.  However, while the saving clause may allow states to enact statutes that regulate the <em>substantive </em>terms of insurance policies (see <em>Metropolitan Life, supra, </em>471 U.S. at pp. 740-744 [85 L.Ed.2d at pp. 740-743]), the clause does not allow states to enact statutes that provide conflicting <em>procedural remedies </em>(see <em>Pilot Life, supra, </em>481 U.S. at pp. 50-57 [95 L.Ed.2d at pp. 50-54, 107 S.Ct. at pp. 1555-1558]). A contrary rule would undermine ERISA\u2019s important policy of promoting uniformity in employee benefit-plan remedies, by creating the potential for conflicting standards of recovery. <em>(Powell </em>v. <em>Chesapeake &amp; Potomac Telephone Co. of Va. </em>(4th Cir. 1985) 780 F.2d 419, 422.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">We conclude that ERISA preempts private causes of action under section 790.03, subdivision (h).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Of course, our recent decision in <em>Moradi-Shalal </em>v. <em>Fireman\u2019s Fund Ins.

It would indeed be comforting if that were so. But unfortunately it is not: \u201ccommon sense\u201d is in the eye, or mind, of the beholder.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-12\">United States Supreme Court cases have used the term \u201ccommon sense\u201d in a wide variety of contexts.

(See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v. <em>Maine </em>(1985) 469 U.S. 504, 525 [83 L.Ed.2d 998, 1014].) In other cases, it has equated \u201ccommon sense\u201d with probability. (E.g., <em>Basic Inc. </em>v. <em>Levinson </em>(1988) 485 U.S. 224, 246-247 [99 L.Ed.2d 194, 218, 108 S.Ct. 978, 991].)

Can it be said that by disagreeing with the majority on a point of law Justice Harlan and his colleagues were guilty of not using \u201ccommon sense\u201d? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">In <em>Roschen </em>v. <em>Ward </em>(1929) 279 U.S. 337, 339 [73 L.Ed.722, 728, 49 S.Ct. 336], Justice Holmes declared, \u201cthere is no canon against using common sense in construing laws as saying what they obviously mean.\u201d Sounds simple. But as Justice Story noted in <em>Barlow </em>v. <em>United States </em>(1833) 7 Pet. (32 U.S.) 404, 411 [8 L.Ed. 728, 731], \u201cThere is scarcely any law which does <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>not admit of some ingenious doubt.\u201d Are the doubters necessarily declining to use \u201ccommon sense\u201d? I think not.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">In <em>The Kronprinzessin Cecilie </em>(1917) 244 U.S. 12, Justice Holmes referred to what is apparently a specialized form of \u201ccommon sense\u201d: \u201cBusiness contracts must be construed with business sense . . . .\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 24 [61 L.Ed. at p. 966].) Apparently that did not satisfy the entire court, for Justices Pitney and Clarke dissented. What kind of sense they preferred was not indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">Members of the high court have not been altogether unmindful of the problems associated with \u201ccommon sense.\u201d In <em>Jacksonville Bulk Terminals, Inc. </em>v. <em>International Longshoremen's Association </em>(1982) 457 U.S. 702 [73 L.Ed.2d 327, 102 S.Ct. 2672], one of the parties argued that a \u201ccommon sense\u201d interpretation of a statute should be applied. Said Chief Justice Burger in dissent, \u201cthe \u2018common sense\u2019 meaning of a term is not controlling when Congress has provided ... an explicit definition of a labor dispute. \u2018Common sense\u2019 and legislative history ought not to change the meaning of unambiguous words of a statute.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 727 [73 L.Ed.2d at p. 346] [dis. opn. of Burger, C.

As Justice Rehnquist explained, the term is \u201csubject to manipulation\u201d and therefore lacks substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-10\">Real party in interest Joseph V. Juliano (hereinafter Juliano) brought the underlying action for damages against petitioners Commercial Life Insurance Company and Automatic Data Processing, Inc. (hereinafter collectively Commercial Life). In his complaint Juliano alleged in substance that Commercial Life had issued a policy of insurance, sponsored by his employer, establishing an employee welfare benefit plan that provided group term life insurance, accidental death and dismemberment insurance, and benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>for major medical expenses, prescription drugs and medicines, and dental care; he was entitled to benefits for treatment of diabetic retinopathy and was so informed by Commercial Life; he received treatment including ophthalmic surgery; at first, Commercial Life paid a small portion of his medical bills, but then wrongfully refused to pay the rest. Juliano asserted, among other causes of action, a claim that Commercial Life had violated its statutory duties under the Unfair Trade Practices Act (Ins. Code, \u00a7 790 et seq.), specifically, Insurance Code section 790.03, subdivision (h) (hereinafter section 790.03(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">The majority hold that the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (hereinafter ERISA) (88 Stats. 829, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 et seq.) preempts section 790.03(h) as relevant here and thereby bars Juliano\u2019s claim under that provision. As will appear, they are wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">ERISA regulates, among other matters, \u201cemployee welfare benefit plans\u201d that, \u201cthrough the purchase of insurance or otherwise,\u201d provide \u201cmedical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death, or unemployment . . . .\u201d (ERISA \u00a7 3(1), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(1).) Within its sphere, ERISA purports to preempt state law. The act states in a preemption clause that its provisions \u201cshall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan . . . .\u201d (ERISA \u00a7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a).) ERI-SA, however, may not and does not preempt state law in its entirety. As relevant here, the act declares in a saving clause that \u201cnothing in this [statute] shall be construed to exempt or relieve any person from any law of any State which regulates insurance . . . .\u201d (ERISA \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A).)</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">It is plain that ERISA regulates the plan in which Juliano participated. As stated above, Juliano\u2019s employer sponsored a plan providing a variety of insurance coverage and other benefits for its employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-7\">It is also plain that section 790.03(h) comes within the class of state laws that ERISA purports to preempt. The provision \u201crelate[s] to . . . employee benefit plan[s]\u201d (ERISA \u00a7 514(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a)) by defining \u201cunfair claims settlement practices\u201d (\u00a7 790.03(h)).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-8\">But it is plainer still that section 790.03(h) is saved from preemption by the express terms of ERISA: the provision clearly \u201cregulates insurance\u201d (ERISA \u00a7 514(b)(2)(A), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(b)(2)(A)). As I read their opinion, the majority do not seriously dispute that section 790.03(h) comes within ERISA\u2019s saving clause\u2014nor could they (see <em>Lee </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America </em>(N.D.Cal. 1987) 673 F.Supp. 998, 1000-1001).</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>In spite of the foregoing, the majority hold that section 790.03(h) is not saved from preemption and hence that Juliano\u2019s claim under the statutory provision is barred. In support they assert that ERISA has established a civil enforcement scheme that provides exclusive remedies. That may be true. But ERISA\u2019s scheme defines remedies <em>for the violation of rights granted employees under the terms of plans within the coverage of the act and under the act itself </em>(See ERISA \u00a7 502(a), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By contrast, the Unfair Trade Practices Act, of which section 790.03(h) is a part, has established a civil enforcement scheme that provides remedies <em>for the breach of duties imposed on insurers under the laws of the State of California. </em>In a word, the remedies of ERISA may be exclusive in their own sphere, but they do not extend into the sphere occupied by section 790.03(h). (Cf. <em>Mackey </em>v. <em>Lanier Collections Agency &amp; Service </em>(1988) 486 U.S. 825, [100 L.Ed.2d 836, 844-851, 108 S.Ct. 2182, 2185-2191] [ERISA does not bar a state garnishment action against a covered employee welfare benefit plan: the federal act does not provide an enforcement mechanism for collecting judgments against covered plans and hence does not preempt state law in that area].)</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">Thus, ERISA does not preempt section 790.03(h), but expressly saves the provision as a law \u201cregulat[ing] insurance.\u201d Further, the civil enforcement scheme of the federal statute does not displace the civil enforcement scheme of the state act: the former concerns the rights of employees under covered plans, the latter concerns the duties of insurers under state laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">There is a growing and ominous trend toward federal preemption of issues that belong within the sphere of control by the individual states. And these inroads into traditional federalism are taking place despite their inconsistency with pious rhetoric emanating from Washington about returning government to the people at state and local levels.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">The first Californian to sit on the United States Supreme Court, Stephen Field, saw the problem clearly as long ago as the period immediately following the Civil War. In <em>Ex parte Virginia </em>(1880) 100 U.S. 339, 357 [25 L.Ed. 676, 683], he wrote: \u201cNow, if we look into the Constitution, we shall not find a single word, from its opening to its concluding line, nor in any of the amendments in force before the close of the civil war, nor ... in those subsequently adopted, which authorizes any interference by Congress with the States in the administration of their governments, and the enforcement of their laws with respect to any matter over which jurisdiction was not surrendered to the United States. The design of its frarners was not to destroy the States, but to form a more perfect union between them, and, whilst creating a central government for certain great purposes, to leave to the States in all matters the jurisdiction of which was not surrendered the functions essential to separate and independent existence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">Justice Field took the same position in <em>Virginia </em>v. <em>Rives </em>(1880) 100 U.S. 313, 337 [25 L.Ed. 667, 676]: \u201cIt is difficult to believe that the wise men who sat in the convention which framed the Constitution and advocated its adoption ever contemplated the possibility of a State being required to assert its authority over offenders against its laws in other tribunals than those of its own creation, and least of all in an inferior tribunal of the new government. I do not think I am going too far in asserting that had it been supposed a power so dangerous to the independence of the States, and so calculated to humiliate and degrade them, lurked in any of the provisions of the Constitution, that instrument would never have been adopted.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">In the instant case we have a state regulatory statute at issue. In the <em>Sinking-Fund Cases </em>(1879) 99 U.S. 700 [25 L.Ed. 496, 25 L.Ed. 504], a state-created corporation was involved. On that subject Justice Field was emphatic: \u201cIn a word, the law of the State undertakes to control and manage the corporation, in all particulars required for the service, convenience, and protection of the public; and can there be a doubt in the mind of any one that over its own creations the State has, within its own territory, as against the United States, the superior authority? . . . Under the Constitution the management of local affairs is left chiefly to the States, and it never entered into the conception of its framers that under it the creations of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>States could be taken from their control.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 768-769 [25 L.Ed. at p. 519].)</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">In our case the law regulating insurance was brought into existence by the state. Under these circumstances it could not have been contemplated, within constitutional limitations, that enforcement of this state creation should pass exclusively to Washington.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">In conclusion, I would hold that Juliano\u2019s section 790.03(h) cause of action is not barred. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-7\">Broussard, J., concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-6\"> Section 502(a) of ERISA, codified at 29 United States Code section 1132(a), provides as follows.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\">\u201cA civil action may be brought\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-8\">\u201c(1) by a participant or beneficiary\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-9\">\u201c(A) for the relief provided for in subsection (c) of this section [concerning requests to the administrator for information], or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201c(B) to recover benefits due to him under the terms of his plan, to enforce his rights under the terms of the plan, or to clarify his rights to future benefits under the terms of the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-11\">\u201c(2) by the Secretary, or by a participant, beneficiary or fiduciary for appropriate relief under section 1109 of this title [for breach of fiduciary duty];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-12\">\u201c(3) by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter or the terms of the plan, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violations or (ii) to enforce any provisions of this sub-chapter or the terms of the plan;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">\u201c(4) by the Secretary, or by a participant, or beneficiary for appropriate relief in the case of a violation of 1025(c) of this title [concerning information to be furnished participants];</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-14\">\u201c(5) except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, by the Secretary (A) to enjoin any act or practice which violates any provision of this subchapter, or (B) to obtain other appropriate equitable relief (i) to redress such violation or (ii) to enforce any provision of this subchapter; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-15\">\u201c(6) by the Secretary to collect any civil penalty under subsection (i) of this section [for breach of fiduciary duty].\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
