Susanin, JAGC, USNR, Appellate Government Counsel.</judges>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b1251-12\">Before JONES, C.J., and REED and LAWRENCE, JJ.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b1251-13\">REED, Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b1251-14\">We have examined the record of trial, the assignment of error,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and the Government\u2019s reply thereto, and we have concluded that the military judge erred by refusing to grant appellant\u2019s challenges for cause to two of the court members.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-15\">Contrary to his pleas, appellant was convicted by a special court-martial, composed of officer and enlisted members, of one specification of willfully striking a superior commissioned officer by kicking him in the head, a violation of Article 90, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ), 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 890. He was sentenced to a bad-conduct discharge, forfeitures of $502.00 pay per month for six months, confinement for six months, and reduction to pay grade E-l. The convening authority approved the sentence as adjudged.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-18\">The charge against appellant resulted from an incident which occurred at a battalion field meet at Camp Hansen, Okinawa, Japan, when a group of Marines chased the victim, a chief warrant officer, and \u201cstacked\u201d him.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As the Marines began to unpile, appellant allegedly approached the victim, who was still on the ground, and kicked him in the head. The victim saw appellant trying to move quickly away from the pile, chased him, and pinned him to the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-19\">At trial, three of the officers detailed as court members stated during voir dire that they observed the stacking. Captain Babbie, during group voir dire, disclosed that he was present where this incident occurred and saw events leading up to the alleged offense. He did not see the act itself but \u201csaw immediately after the results of what happened.\u201d During individual voir dire, Captain Babbie indicated that after the \u201cstacking\u201d incident he spoke with the victim who reported to him that \u201c[t]hat guy gave me a cheap shot.\u201d Based on this conversation with the victim, Captain Babbie was successfully challenged for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-20\">Lieutenant Pellegrino was another member who witnessed the \u201cstacking\u201d incident. A portion of the voir dire of this member follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-21\">TC: Now what exactly could you see of the action that was going on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuqT\">MEMBER (2dLT PELLEGRINO): I saw several other stackings that went on; and then in Warrant Officer Warfield\u2019s I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1200\">*1200</page-number>saw the people piling on and then I turned to speak to someone else \u2014 I\u2019m not sure who it was \u2014 and then when I turned back, all I saw was everyone standing up and getting away and Warrant Officer Warfield pushing someone to the ground and then both of them standing up and they both walked away.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-4\">TC: Now did you hear anything that went on over there? You were pretty close.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-5\">MEMBER (2dLT PELLEGRINO): Just a general shouting or whatever may have been involved in the act itself. I don\u2019t know any distinctive voices that I can remember now or anything that was said by any individual in the stacking itself. TC: What was your opinion of what went on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-6\">MEMBER (2dLT PELLEGRINO): Of the whole general idea of stacking I did not view it as a really serious event until perhaps later when I had heard that someone had struck Warrant Officer Warfield and it was like, \u201cHmm,\u201d or the inherent danger of several people jumping on someone else. I didn\u2019t view it as extremely dangerous at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-7\">TC: From who (sic) did you hear that someone had struck Warrant Officer Warfield?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-8\">MEMBER (2dLT PELLEGRINO): I can\u2019t remember any particular name. I would say that most of the people in the Battalion had heard that someone had perhaps struck Warrant Officer Warfield because of Warrant Officer Warfield\u2019s actions later. He was highly upset because of the action that someone had taken because he was visibly angry when he got \u2014 when he was standing after the stacking was done, he was visibly angry at someone; and so I would say, rumor-mill or what have it, that it was known that someone may have struck Warrant Officer War-field in the stacking.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-12\">... I had seen that Warrant Officer War-field was visibly angry after the stacking and so I had assumed that something had went awry, but it had probably been several days before rumors got back to me, especially as an OIC of a section, before I actually heard someone say something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-13\">DC: You said you were about 20 feet away when the stacking occurred, did you ever get closer than 20 feet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aix\">MEMBER (2dLT PELLEGRINO): No, Sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-14\">Trial defense counsel\u2019s challenge for cause of this witness was denied.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We believe this was an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. White, </em>36 M.J. 284 (C.M.A.1993). Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 912, Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States, 1984, indicates that a member shall be excused for cause whenever it appears that the member will be a witness in the court-martial. We interpret this prohibition to include a potential witness, such as Lt Pellegrino, who is an eyewitness to the event itself which results in the offenses for which the accused is charged.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Accord United States v. Aaron, </em>1 M.J. 1052 (N.C.M.R.1976).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-15\">The legitimacy of the court-martial jury of superiors is predicated on and justified by the unique requirement for courts-martial to provide both a <em>fair and impartial forum </em>for resolving criminal misconduct and to foster good order and discipline in the armed forces.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1201\">*1201</page-number><em>United States v. Glenn, 25 </em>M.J. 278, 279 (C.M.A.1987), (citing with approval <em>United States v. Moyar, </em>24 M.J. 635, 638 (A.C.M.R. 1987)) (emphasis added). We do not believe that a member with the knowledge this one had, despite his assertions to the contrary, could still be a \u201cfair and impartial\u201d trier of the facts.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-7\">We reiterate once again that since the military defendant has only a single peremptory challenge, Article 41(b), UCMJ, 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b), challenges for cause should be liberally granted. <em>White; United States v. Smart, </em>21 M.J. 15 (C.M.A. 1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">Similarly, Lt Newman, another member whose challenge for cause was also rejected by the military judge, witnessed the \u201cstacking\u201d incident from about thirty yards away. Although she saw the stacking, she did not witness the kicking, nor the later chase of the accused by the victim warrant officer. Nevertheless, she did remark immediately after the incident: \u201cDid you see that? I can\u2019t believe that just happened.\u201d Our comments regarding Lt Pellegrino apply equally to this member. <em>See United States v. Coffin, 25 </em>M.J. 32 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-9\">Of equal concern to us is also the dictate contained in the Manual for Courts-Martial that a person <em>\u201cshall\u201d </em>be excused for cause whenever it <em>appears </em>that the member \u201c[sjhould not sit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial free from substantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality.\u201d R.C.M. 912(f)(l)(N) (emphasis added). Clearly, the perception to the public at large and other military members, as well as the accused, would be the unfairness of a proceeding where- a witness to an incident sits as a member in judgment of the person charged criminally as the result of such an incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">Accordingly, the findings of guilty and the sentence are set aside. A rehearing may be ordered by the same or a different convening authority.</p>\n<judges id=\"b1253-6\">Senior Judge JONES and Judge LAWRENCE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1251-16\">. THE MILITARY JUDGE ERRED IN DENYING APPELLANT\u2019S CHALLENGES OF TWO COURT MEMBERS WHO WERE PRESENT AT THE FIELD MEET AND WHO BOTH PERSONALLY VIEWED THE \"STACKING\u201d OF CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER WARFIELD.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1251-23\">. A stacking occurs when a group of people pile on top of a person.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-9\">. Trial defense counsel preserved the error for review, after using his peremptory challenge on this witness, by noting he would have used his peremptory against another witness who had also witnessed this incident if his challenge for cause had been granted. <em>See </em>Rule for Courts-Martial (R.C.M.) 912(f)(4), Manual for Courts-Martial (MCM), United States, 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">. It is not every potential witness who is disqualified. For instance, knowledge of an undisputed fact or facts merely collateral or incidental to the act charged will not render incompetent a juror who disclaims any opinion on the merits of the case. <em>See Kunk v. Howell, </em>40 Tenn.App. 183, 289 S.W.2d 874 (Tenn.Ct.App. 1956). In the present case the disqualification occurs because of the intimate knowledge the witness had of the circumstances surrounding the activity that led to the charged misconduct. <em>United States v. Coffin, </em>25 M.J. 32 (C.M.A.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1253-17\">. We believe that any such member could not help but compare his recollection of what occurred to that of other witnesses and either agree or disagree with those witnesses\u2019 perceptions based on the member\u2019s own recollections. Such biases or prejudices would prevent a member from being fair and impartial to the extent required by law. There is also concern that a witness\u2019 testimony will refresh the member's memory of aspects of the event the member could not previously remember when questioned during voir dire. The member could then be placed in the untenable position during a trial on the merits of reinforcing or discrediting the witness\u2019 testimony depending on the member\u2019s recollection of what occurred.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
