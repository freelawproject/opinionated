The National Labor Relations Board granted summary judgment to the UAW. Bally\u2019s timely petitioned this court for review. The NLRB moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and improper venue. We agree and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-12\">An important stage in this dispute was reached on April 11, 2007, when the NLRB certified the UAW as the exclusive collective bargaining representative for certain Bally\u2019s employees. In an effort to test the NLRB\u2019s certification, Bally\u2019s refused to bargain with the UAW. In response, the UAW filed an unfair labor practice charge. The NLRB entered a final order holding that Bally\u2019s had acted unlawfully. An appeal from such a final order is to the court of appeals for the federal circuit where the challenged labor practice occurred, or where the aggrieved party resides or transacts business:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b345-13\">Any person aggrieved by a final order of the Board granting or denying in whole or in part the relief sought may obtain a review of such order in any United States court of appeals in the circuit wherein the labor practice in question was alleged to have been engaged in or wherein such person resides or transacts business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, by filing in such court a written petition praying that the order of the Board be modified or set aside.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b345-14\">29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-15\">The issue on which we rule today is whether Bally\u2019s may bring the appeal to the Fifth Circuit. Bally\u2019s concedes that it does not \u201creside\u201d in Louisiana, Mississippi, or Texas. Instead, Bally\u2019s is incorporated in Delaware and operates facilities only in New Jersey. The labor practice that is said to be unfair was not committed in this Circuit. Thus, this court may accept the appeal only if Bally\u2019s \u201ctransacts business\u201d within the Circuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-16\">There is no statutory definition of this phrase, \u201ctransacts business.\u201d There is little case law either, but we will discuss below what we find relevant among the precedents. The starting premise for our review of the authorities is that Section 160(f) is not a grant of universal jurisdiction. That conclusion is based on nothing more than what we take to be self-evident, that had Congress wanted no limits, there were straightforward ways to make that clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-17\">Whatever \u201ctransacts business\u201d might mean in detail, the term is a focus on contacts of a certain \u2014 though somewhat ambiguous \u2014 type within a federal circuit. \u201cContacts\u201d are not what have propelled Bally\u2019s bringing the appeal here. Since early in the dispute, Bally\u2019s has admitted that the Fifth Circuit is its preferred jurisdiction for review of the NLRB\u2019s decision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>because one of our precedents is said to be supportive of its position on the merits. <em>See Marriott In-Flite Servs., Div. of Marriott Corp. v. NLRB, </em>417 F.2d 563 (5th Cir.1969). Bally\u2019s motives would not cancel a finding that the appeal was properly brought should the statutory term \u201ctransacts business\u201d be satisfied, but it is evident that the case is not here because of physical convenience.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">Bally\u2019s primary argument is that it may borrow the contacts of its parent corporation, Harrah\u2019s Entertainment, Inc. Bally\u2019s maintains that, as a wholly owned subsidiary of Harrah\u2019s, the two are part of an \u201cinterrelated network of entertainment facilities.\u201d Harrah\u2019s certainly does transact business in the Fifth Circuit. Among facilities that it operates in Louisiana and Mississippi are Harrah\u2019s New Orleans, Horseshoe Bossier City, Harralfs Louisiana Downs, Grand Casino Biloxi, Horseshoe Tunica, Grand Casino Tunica, and Sheraton Casino &amp; Hotel Tunica. However, the facts of Harrah\u2019s activities do not justify a finding that Bally\u2019s transacts business in the Circuit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other Circuits maintain a distinction between parent corporations and their subsidiaries in applying the NLRB judicial review provision. <em>See, e.g., Rikal, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>721 F.2d 402, 404 (1st Cir.1983) (a parent corporation who is not a named party in the NLRB\u2019s final order may not seek review in the court of appeals because the parent corporation is not an \u201caggrieved party\u201d under the Act); <em>Pepsico, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>382 F.2d 265, 266-67 (6th Cir.1967) (same). We agree with these precedents and hold that only Bally\u2019s corporate contacts are relevant, not Harrah\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Alternatively, Bally\u2019s alleges that it transacts business in the Circuit in the following ways: it profits financially from patrons who travel from the Fifth Circuit to its New Jersey casinos; by mail solicitation and the Internet, Bally\u2019s advertises to Fifth Circuit customers; and it enters into business contracts with Fifth Circuit residents because customers are permitted to make room reservations via an on-line website. If such contacts were sufficient, though, the statutory provision that we have found to create some limit to the number of Circuits to which a particular appeal may be taken, would become no limitation at all. More is required than these contacts.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-8\">Admittedly, there is a shortage of case law in this area. <em>S.L. Indus., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>673 F.2d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.1982) (noting that, \u201c[ujnfortunately, there are few cases precisely on point\u201d); <em>Farah Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, </em>481 F.2d 1143, 1145 (8th Cir.1973) (noting that \u201cthe scope of the phrase \u2018transacts business\u2019 has received little judicial attention in reported labor decisions\u201d). On occasion, however, courts have sought to flesh out the \u201ctransacts business\u201d requirement. For instance, the Fourth Circuit conducted the following analysis:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AL7\">Davlan\u2019s contacts with the states embraced by this circuit may be summarized briefly. It maintains sales representatives who solicit business for the company in Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, and it has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>purchased goods shipped from establishments in Maryland. Davlan is under contract to supply smoke grenades to a branch of the United States Army which is located in Edgewood, Maryland. This contract \u2014 which constitutes the lion\u2019s share of Davlan\u2019s business \u2014 has necessitated that Davlan executives travel to Maryland, that Army personnel based in Maryland give instructions to Davlan in St. Louis regarding the particulars of the project, and that numerous telephone calls be made between Maryland and St. Louis. Moreover, numerous shipments of goods have been made between Davlan\u2019s operations in St. Louis and the Army facilities in Maryland.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-5\">[W]e hold that Davlan does not \u201ctransact business\u201d in this circuit. It has neither any permanent physical facility nor any employees situated here. If the mere purchase and sale of goods, with its attendant telephone and personal contacts \u2014 which fairly characterizes all Davlan\u2019s contacts with this circuit \u2014 suffices without more as \u201ctransacting business,\u201d we think the force of \u00a7 160(f) as a venue-limiting provision would be effectively eviscerated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b347-6\"><em>Davlan Eng\u2019g, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>718 F.2d 102, 103 (4th Cir.1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">The principal precedent in our own Circuit is consistent with an analysis requiring some sort of physical presence. In the case, a Connecticut gun manufacturer sought review in the Fifth Circuit of an NLRB decision. <em>Olin Indus., Winchester Repeating Arms Co. Div. v. NLRB, </em>191 F.2d 613, 614 (5th Cir.1951). Because the NLRB did not contest jurisdiction, we did not analyze the issue but only noted that the manufacturer owned a warehouse in Texas. <em>Id. </em>at 613 n. 1. Bally\u2019s, however, maintains no physical presence in the Fifth Circuit. We find this fact significant but need not decide if it is dispositive.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">What is dispositive is there is nothing else to which Bally\u2019s can point that equates to business activities. Transacting business in the Circuit sufficient for an appeal will require more than individuals\u2019 within the Circuit connecting with Bally\u2019s through the commonplace and universal reach of modern technology.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">We do not attempt to identify the precise contacts needed to satisfy the Act\u2019s judicial review provision. We hold that, on this appellate record, Bally\u2019s has not shown that it transacts business in the Fifth Circuit. A contrary conclusion would allow almost any corporation to obtain judicial review of an NLRB final order in any Circuit Court of Appeals. That is not what the review statute permits. The NLRB\u2019s motion to dismiss is therefore GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b346-5\">. Bally\u2019s cites us to a precedent discussing citizenship for diversity. <em>J.A. Olson Co. v. City of Winona, </em>818 F.2d 401 (5th Cir.1987). A subsidiary wanted its principal place of business ignored and its parent corporation\u2019s principal place of business imputed to it. Choosing between possible places of citizenship is irrelevant here, but we also stated \"that a corporation may, through another entity or the alter ego doctrine, <em>gain </em>additional places of citizenship.\" <em>Id. </em>at 413-14 (emphasis in original). That case will not carry Bally\u2019s where it wants to go, because nothing in the record supports that Harrah\u2019s is an alter ego of Bally's.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
