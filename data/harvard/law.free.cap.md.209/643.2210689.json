He gave to the police the fictitious name of Robert Johnson as his name, because he had escaped from the Penitentiary and he did not want his identity known.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-13\">Petitioner further alleges that his case came on for trial in the Criminal Court of Baltimore on August 16, 1955, and that while he was on the stand an Assistant State\u2019s Attorney \u201csprang a surprise on him by suddenly asking him about his true identity.\u201d Petitioner was actually Fritzie C. Myers, an escaped prisoner. The case was continued until the next day, when petitioner again took the stand. He was found guilty and was sentenced to the Penitentiary for a term of four years, this sentence to run concurrently with his previous sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-14\"><em>First. </em>Petitioner contends that he did not change his plea to guilty, and that no verdict was rendered by the Court. This contention must be rejected, as the docket <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>entries show that the Court rendered a verdict of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\"><em>Second. </em>Petitioner contends that his past record was not read correctly by the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney. He contends that the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney stated that he had served four consecutive years, whereas he had been given two 2-year sentences to run concurrently. However, he heard the statement and made no objection to it at the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
