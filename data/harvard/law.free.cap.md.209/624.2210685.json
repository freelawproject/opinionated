Petitioner contends that no crime was established by the evidence, that there was an illegal search and seizure, that he was not afforded a reasonable time to prepare his defense, and that he was not arraigned. None of these contentions can be made on <em>habeas corpus, </em>as we have repeatedly held. Petitioner was represented by counsel, and the docket entries show that he submitted under a plea of not guilty and waived a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
