The offence charged in the information, was committed under the act of 1817, and the only question is, .whether the-informaron can be sustained after the time when that act wo.jr- d have expired by its own limitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">The act was to continue in force two years after the 3d of March, 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">On the 20th of April, 1818, Congress passed an act making farther provision ofn the same subject, which repealed all former acts on,that subject, and among these the act of 1817, and annexed to the repealing clause the following proviso, \u201cProvided, nevertheless, that persons having offended against any of the acts aforesaid may be prosecuted, convicted, and punished, as if the same were not repealed, and no forfeiture heretofore incurred by a violation.of any of the acts aforesaid shall be affected by such repeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">The obvious construction of this clause is, that the\u2019 power to prosecute, convict, and- punish offenders against either of the repealed acts, remains as if the repealing act had never been passed. It does not create a power to punish, but preserves that which before existed. Now, it is well settled, that an of-fence against a temporary act cannot be punished after the expiration of the act, unless a particular provision be made by law for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">Sentence affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
