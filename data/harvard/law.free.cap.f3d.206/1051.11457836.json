Defendant pled guilty to a one-count information charging him with armed robbery. At the plea hearing, Defendant admitted to entering the First National Bank of Florida in Pensacola, Florida, approaching a bank teller, displaying what looked like a bomb (two red sticks with a fuse), lighting the fuse, and asking the teller if she knew what \u201cit\u201d was (referring to the bomb-like object). Defendant then told the teller to give him all of her money and not to include any dye packs. The teller complied, handing over approximately $8,534. After Defendant was apprehended, law enforcement discovered that the object which appeared to be a bomb actually was inert. Based on these facts, the district court applied a four-level sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B8.1(b)(2)(D) for \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-4\">On appeal, Defendant contends that the district court erred in enhancing his offense level by four points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D). Specifically, Defendant argues that the Sentencing Guidelines do not permit a four-level enhancement for \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d an object which merely appeared to be a \u201cdangerous weapon.\u201d Instead, Defendant claims that he should only have received a three-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) for \u201cbrandishing, displaying, or possessing a dangerous weapon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Cook, </em>181 F.3d 1232, 1233 (11th Cir.1999). Because Defendant\u2019s challenge to his \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) enhancement was not raised in the district court, we review it only for plain error to avoid manifest injustice. <em>See United States v. Harness, </em>180 F.3d 1232, 1234 (11th Cir.1999). Having reviewed the plea and sentencing hearing transcripts, the presentence investigation report, all other relevant pleadings, and the briefs of the parties, we hold that the district court did not plainly err in finding that Miller \u201cotherwise used\u201d a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d during the commission of the offense, and therefore qualified for a four-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b1058-7\">Defendant\u2019s appeal raises an issue of first impression in our circuit; namely, whether a four-level sentence enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) may be applied for \u201cotherwise us[ing]\u201d an object which appeared to be a \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d during the commission of an attempted robbery. Under the Sentencing Guidelines, a defendant may receive a four-level enhancement \u201cif a dangerous weapon was otherwise used,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D), or a three-level enhancement \u201cif a dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or possessed,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). Application note 2 of the commentary to this Guideline explains that \u201c[w]hen an object that appeared to be a dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous weapon for the purposes of subsection (b)(2)(E).\u201d <em>Id. </em>In addition, application note 1(d) of Guideline 1B1.1, \u201cApplication Instructions,\u201d states, in the context of defining the term \u201cdangerous weapon,\u201d that \u201c[w]here an object that appeared to be a dangerous weapon was brandished, displayed, or possessed, treat the object as a dangerous weapon.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1058-8\">Based on the plain language of this commentary, we have recognized that objects which appear to be dangerous weapons should be treated for sentencing purposes as if they actually were dangerous weapons. <em>See United States v. Vincent, </em>121 F.3d 1451, 1455 (11th Cir.1997) (finding that defendant who pressed an unknown object into victim\u2019s side and intended that the object appear as a dangerous weapon is subject to an enhancement under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E)); <em>United States v. Shores, </em>966 F.2d 1383, 1387-88 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam) (holding that defendant who, during commission of an attempted robbery, possessed a toy gun, which looked like an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1053\">*1053</page-number>authentic nine millimeter firearm and therefore appeared to be a dangerous weapon, is subject to an enhancement under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E)); <em>see also United States v. Wooden, </em>169 F.3d 674, 676 n. 2 (11th Cir.1999) (per curiam) (interpreting <em>Vincent </em>to hold that \u201cfake weapons are treated as equivalent to real ones for purposes of this [\u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) ] offense level enhancement\u201d); <em>United States v. Koonce, </em>991 F.2d 693, 698 (11th Cir.1993) (noting in dicta that where \u201cBB gun looks like a real firearm and is perceived by the victim of a post office robbery\u201d as a firearm, it is proper to enhance sentence for use of \u201cdangerous weapon\u201d under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E)). This approach is consistent with the caselaw of our sister circuits. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, </em>20 F.3d 270, 277 (7th Cir.1994) (finding that defendant who possessed a toy gun which appeared to be a dangerous weapon is subject to a section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) sentence enhancement); <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>982 F.2d 116, 121-24 (3d Cir.1992) (holding that defendant who wrapped his hand in a towel to make it appear as a dangerous weapon is subject to a section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) sentence enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-4\">In light of the Guidelines\u2019 clear commentary and our prior precedent with respect to the treatment of objects which appear to be dangerous under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E), we see no reason why a defendant who \u201cotherwise use[s]\u201d an object which appears to be a dangerous weapon during an attempted robbery would not be subject to a four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D). Defendant argues that a defendant who otherwise uses an object which appears to be (but is not in fact) a dangerous weapon may receive only a three-level enhancement for brandishing, displaying, or possessing a dangerous weapon, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). This argument is illogical and would eviscerate the substantive difference between 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) and 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) in cases where objects, which appear to be (but are not in fact) dangerous weapons, are \u201cotherwise used.\u201d The difference between section 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) and section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E) is a difference based on the seriousness of the charged criminal conduct. In essence, the Guideline creates a \u201chierarchy of culpability for varying degrees of involvement\u201d during a criminal offense. <em>Wooden, </em>169 F.3d at 675. Merely brandishing, displaying, or possessing a dangerous weapon is subject to a three-level sentence enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). However, if a defendant commits more serious conduct and \u201cotherwise use[s]\u201d a dangerous weapon, she is subject to a four-level enhancement. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D). We recently have recognized this difference in <em>Wooden, </em>noting that the term \u201cotherwise used\u201d \u201c \u2018means that the conduct did not amount to the discharge of a firearm but was more than brandishing, displaying, or possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id., </em>169 F.3d at 676 (quoting U.S.S.G \u00a7 1B1.1 application note 1(g)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-6\">Defendant\u2019s reading would eliminate the substantive difference recognized by the Guidelines and our caselaw between \u201cotherwise using a dangerous weapon\u201d and merely \u201cbrandishing, displaying, or possessing a dangerous weapon.\u201d We believe the better interpretation of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2) is to treat uniformly objects appearing to be dangerous weapons as if they actually were dangerous weapons for sentence enhancement purposes, thereby maintaining the integrity of the substantive difference between section 2B3.1(b)(2)(D) and section 2B3.1(b)(2)(E). Under our reading, defendants who otherwise use an object which appears to be a dangerous weapon will be subject to a four-level enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D), and defendants who merely brandish, display, or possess an object which appears to be a dangerous weapon will be subject to a three-level enhancement, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b1059-8\">The only remaining question then is whether the district court plainly erred in concluding that Defendant otherwise <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1054\">*1054</page-number>used an object which appeared to be a dangerous weapon in the commission of his offense. Defendant admitted at his plea colloquy (and does not dispute on appeal) that he actually lit the fuse to the bomb-like object during his attempted bank robbery. As the fuse was lit, Defendant also threatened the bank teller, asking her if she knew what \u201cit\u201d [the bomb-like object] really was. On appeal, Defendant does not argue that this conduct is mere brand-ishment or display rather than otherwise use. In <em>Wooden, </em>we recently found that a defendant who pointed a handgun at a specific victim, holding the gun one-half inch from the victim\u2019s forehead, properly received an enhancement for otherwise using a dangerous weapon, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(D), because \u201chis conduct was more than brandishing; it was more than merely pointing or waving the weapon about in a threatening manner.\u201d <em>Wooden, </em>169 F.3d at 676. We arrived at this conclusion by emphasizing that the defendant\u2019s conduct \u201cinvolved an explicit threat,\u201d rendering the conduct more than simply brandishing or displaying a weapon. <em>Wooden, </em>169 F.3d at 676; <em>see also United States v. Johnson, </em>931 F.2d 238 (3d Cir.1991) (holding that pointing weapon at close distance constituted \u201cotherwise use\u201d); <em>United States v. Hamilton, </em>929 F.2d 1126 (6th Cir.1991) (finding that placing knife against a victim\u2019s throat amounted to \u201cotherwise use\u201d). Here, we believe the issue is even clearer. Defendant did not just display or brandish the fake bomb; he actually lit the fuse of the fake bomb while explicitly threatening the bank teller. Indeed, lighting the fuse is like the cocking of a handgun. Based on these facts, it was not plain error for the district court to conclude that Defendant\u2019s conduct constituted the \u201cotherwise use\u201d of a dangerous weapon, qualifying Defendant for a four-level enhancement under section 2B3.1(b)(2)(D). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
