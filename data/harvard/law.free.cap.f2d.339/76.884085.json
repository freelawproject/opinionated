No. 136 (1963), based upon a finding of violation of Section 8(a) (1), (3) and (5) of the National Labor Relations Act<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> be set aside. The Board seeks enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-22\">Petitioner, a manufacturer and distributor of structural steel products, had a collective bargaining agreement with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Local 455, International Association of Bridge, Structural and Ornamental Iron Workers, AFL-CIO, which terminated on January 31, 1963. Negotiations for a new agreement were carried on during November and January, but on January 31, an issue concerning the vacation clause remained unresolved. The Company proposed to revise the vacation clause to conform the vacation schedule to that in the Union\u2019s contract with the Allied Association of Structural Steel Manufacturers while the Union wanted to continue the clause contained in the agreement which had just expired. On Friday, February 1, there were further fruitless efforts at agreement and on Monday, February 4, the Employer excluded the members of the bargaining unit from their jobs.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">The first issue for our determination is presented by the conflicting interpretations of the Employer\u2019s action in excluding the employees. The Board has found that the Employer locked out -the employees, with the intent of forcing them to agree to the proposals of the Employer for a collective agreement. The Petitioner maintains that it merely laid off the men for lack of work.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The record reveals that when the employees applied for unemployment compensation, the Employer stated that their loss of employment was due, not to a layoff, in which case they would have received compensation, but to a \u201clabor \u25a0dispute.\u201d This prevented their getting unemployment benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">This admission by the Employer, the \u25a0evidence of the Employer\u2019s repeated assertions \u201cno contract, no work,\u201d and of an assurance by the Employer that the \u25a0employees would be put back on the job the day after the contract was signed, together with the failure of the Employer\u2019s evidence to establish any economic necessity for laying off the employees (the employees who were not in the bargaining unit were not laid off) support the Board\u2019s view of the Employer\u2019s action as constituting a lockout.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-13\">We hold that this evidence is sufficient when considered in the background of the record as a whole to support the finding that the employees were locked out by the Employer for the purpose of enhancing its bargaining position. See Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-14\">The Employer\u2019s alternative contention, that it locked out the employees because of the threat of a strike, finds no corroboration in the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-15\">The more difficult issue is whether the Board was correct in holding that the Employer violated the Act by resorting to a lockout to further its bargaining position. This is a case of first impression in this circuit. The circuits which have passed on the issue are in disagreement. The Third,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tenth,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and District of Columbia<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Circuits have upheld the Board\u2019s position; the Fifth Circuit<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> has rejected it.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-16\">In NLRB v. Truck Drivers Union, 353 U.S. 87, 77 S.Ct. 643, 1 L.Ed.2d 676 (1957), the Supreme Court upheld the Board in ruling that an employers\u2019 association could use a lockout defensively against a union\u2019s whipsawing tactics designed to destroy a multi-employer bargaining unit. In its opinion in the Truck Drivers case the Court stated that it was not \u201ccalled upon to define the limits of the legitimate use of the lock<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>out\u201d and that it was \u201cunnecessary to pass upon the question whether, as a general proposition, the employer lockout is the corollary of the employees\u2019 statutory right to strike.\u201d <footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Of the roles of the courts and the Board in respect to the issue of the legality of a lockout in any particular situation the Court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-4\">\u201cThe ultimate problem is the balancing of the conflicting legitimate interests. The function of striking that balance to effectuate national labor policy is often a difficult and delicate responsibility, which the Congress committed primarily to the National Labor Relations Board, subject to limited judicial review.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The Board argues that the lockout is not the corollary of the strike since the strike is a protected activity under Section 7 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and is given a preferred position under Section 13,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> while the lockout is clearly unlawful in some situations, as, for example, when it is used for the purpose of interfering with unionization. NLRB v. Somerset Classics, Inc., 193 F.2d 613 (2d Cir.), cert, denied sub nom. Modern Mfg. Co. v. NLRB, 344 U.S. 816, 73 S.Ct. 10, 97 L.Ed. 635 (1952).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-12\">The Board contends that the lockout engaged in to further the employer\u2019s bargaining position is a violation of Section 8(a) (l)<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and Section 8(a) (3)<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> because it interferes with the right to strike, \u201cblunts\u201d the strike weapon, discourages union activity, and unduly diminishes the union\u2019s bargaining power. It \u201ctips the scales in favor of the employer.\u201d The Board points out that, to counterbalance the strike weapon, the employer has the right to replace striking employees,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and after an impasse to institute unilaterally terms of employment, which the employees have rejected.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> To give the employer in addition the right to a bargaining lockout would be to defeat the Congressional purpose in increasing union bargaining power by statutory protection of the right to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">The Board has found that the Employer\u2019s conduct also violates Section 8(a) (5).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The finding as to Section 8(a) (5) is dependent on the finding as to Sections 8(a) (1) and 8(a) (3). The Board holds, in effect, that an employer who uses in collective negotiations a method which is unlawful because it interferes with and restrains employees and by discrimination discourages union <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>membership is refusing to bargain collectively as required by the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">We cannot say that the Board\u2019s interpretation of the statute is not correct or that the Board is in error in applying that statutory interpretation to the facts of the present case. In this area which the Supreme Court has told us is one of delicate balance between conflicting interests, we cannot say that the balance \u25a0struck by the Board is outside the scope of its competence.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Petition for review denied; enforcement granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-23\">. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a) (1), (3) and (5) (1958 &amp; Supp. Y, 1964).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\">.
