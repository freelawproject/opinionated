Because of illness he does not participate in the opinion or decree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"AHq\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b637-12\">The respondent employer was found by the National Labor Relations Board to have violated sections 8(a) (5) and (1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 158(a) (5) and (1). It resists this petition for enforcement on the sole ground that the evidence did not warrant the findings. Respondent, in the first place, has misconstrued the comprehensive report of the trial examiner confirmed by the Board. Its statement that the Board did not \u201ceven dignify [certain] * * * testimony by a statement that it was disbelieved\u201d is only narrowly correct. The testimony of respondent\u2019s president to which this referred went solely to the question of motivation. The Board expressly found' that respondent\u2019s motivation was improper. It was unnecessary for it to mention in detail all of respondent\u2019s contrary testimony. The duty to discuss evidence is a matter of degree. Cf. Haverhill Gazette Co. v. Union Leader Corp., 1 Cir., 1964, 833 F.2d 798, 805, cert. den. 379 U.S. -, 85 S.Ct. 329. There was other testimony, which was fully discussed, amply warranting the finding against respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-16\"> Furthermore, if the promotion of certain of respondent\u2019s carpenters to supervisors was in fact essentially a paper transaction not causing them to become true supervisors, the respondent\u2019s duties to bargain depended upon the actual circumstances, not upon its motivation or good faith. Cf. International Ladies\u2019 Garment Workers\u2019 Union, AFL-CIO v. NLRB, 1961, 366 U.S. 731, 81 S.Ct. 1603, 6 L.Ed.2d 762; NLRB v. Burnup &amp; Sims, 379 U.S. 21, 85 S.Ct. 171, 13 L.Ed.2d 1. The Board has considerable discretion in determining whether an employee is a supervisor. NLRB v. Swift &amp; Co., 1 Cir., 1961, 292 F.2d 561. We find no error in its exercise here.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-17\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
