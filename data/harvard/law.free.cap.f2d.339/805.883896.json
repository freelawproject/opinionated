The Master of the ship immediately called Kingston, Jamaica, the nearest port and the ship\u2019s destination, requesting medical advice. The answer, received some three hours later, advised him to administer certain drugs to minimize the chance of infection. The Master carried out this advice and proceeded directly to Kingston. Upon arrival, 18 hours after the fall, the seaman was immediately transferred to a hospital where he died five hours after admittance from a ruptured duodenal ulcer.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">The administrator of the seaman\u2019s estate brought a libel against the vessel and her owner alleging dual grounds of liability: failure on the part of the Master to remove the unseaworthy condition in the galley which caused the fall, and the Master\u2019s failure to avail himself of the nearest surgical aid \u2014 that available through the air-sea rescue service at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-12\">There is substantial evidence on the record to support the District Court\u2019s finding that the seaman\u2019s fall was not caused by an unseaworthy condition in the galley and we affirm this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">Libellant\u2019s second contention was that the Master\u2019s duty to secure immediate surgical assistance for a seaman falling ill at sea was breached by the failure of the Master to call for the air-sea rescue service available at Guantanamo, Cuba. It was contended that an air rescue at sea could have been effected with a saving of many precious hours, thus minimizing the danger to the seaman\u2019s life. This would certainly have been the most prudent course, but it was the Master\u2019s contention that he was not unreasonable in calling the nearest port for medical advice, following that advice, and sailing directly to that port. The medical officer at Kingston, in his reply to the Master, did not mention the necessity for air-sea rescue.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-14\">We note the implication in the opinion of the District Court that air-sea rescues are dangerous operations, to be undertaken in extraordinary situations only. The evidence does not support this; in fact, all of the testimony indicates that such rescues are commonplace occurrences in relatively mild seas. This makes the reasonableness of the Master\u2019s action a close issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-15\">However, there is substantial evidence to support District Judge Hoffman\u2019s finding that the Master did not <em>violate the duty owed to the injured </em>seaman, and we cannot say on this record that the finding is clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
