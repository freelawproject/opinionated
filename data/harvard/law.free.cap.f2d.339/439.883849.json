(Baker) appeals from a $12,548.02 summary judgment in favor of Pressure Services, Inc. (PSI) in PSI\u2019s action on a written contract, dated April 30, 1962, for the purchase by Baker of PSI\u2019s assets. The only question presented involves the value of appellee\u2019s net current assets on April 30, 1962 and the resulting adjustment of the basic purchase price as provided in the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-26\">The basic purchase price of $600,000 was computed on the basis of an unaudited financial statement by PSI\u2019s accountants, Connell &amp; Tompkins, showing the net current asset value, as of March <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>31, 1962, to be $160,725.25. The contract provided that an audited balance sheet would be prepared as of April 30, 1962 by Baker\u2019s certified public accountants, Haskins &amp; Sells, \u201csubject to approval by Connell &amp; Tompkins, Certified Public Accountants, for PSI, as to the fact that net current assets at April 30, 1962, have been computed in the same manner as computed at March 31, 1962.\u201d The basic purchase price was to be adjusted, depending on the value of the net current assets as of April 30, 1962, \u201ccomputed in the same manner as computed March 31, 1962.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">The basic purchase price of $600,000, as well as an undisputed additional $6,-268 adjustment, was paid by Baker.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">Baker\u2019s accountants, Haskins &amp; Sells, prepared an audited balance sheet which presented \u201cfairly the financial position of the Company at April 30, 1962, in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied\u201d and showed net current assets of the value of $179,541.27. The result was an $18,816.02 increase in the value of the net current assets. PSI\u2019s accountants, Connell <em>&amp; </em>Tompkins, reviewed this audited balance sheet and certified that PSI\u2019s net current assets as of April 30, 1962 were \u201ccomputed in the same manner as that of March 31, 1962, Pressure Services, Inc. unaudited balance sheet.\u201d The record, including the affidavits of the respective accountants and parties, discloses that the $18,816.02 increase of met current assets as of April 30, 1962 was correct and was determined as provided by the contract between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">Appellant\u2019s contention that net current assets were not computed in accordance with the contract, in that they were not \u201ccomputed in the same manner,\u201d has no real support in the record, is without substance and raises no genuine issue as to any material fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">The summary judgment was right. Rule 56, F.R.Civ.P.; Dressier v. MY Sandpiper (2 Cir., 1964), 331 F.2d 130. The judgment of the District Court is</p>\n<p id=\"b496-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
