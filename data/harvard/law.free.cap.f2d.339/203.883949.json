Its order directed respondent to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found and to offer employees Hutchinson and Warren reinstatement, to reimburse them for monetary losses suffered as a result of the discrimination against them, and to post appropriate notices.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">The Board seeks enforcement of its order.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">With respect to employees Lane and Warren, we are of the opinion that the findings of the Board are supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, including the reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom. N. L. R. B. v. Ford, 170 F. 2d 735, 738, 739, C.A. 6th; United Fireworks Mfg. Co. v. N. L. R. B., 252 F.2d 428, C.A. 6th. Although we may not be in complete agreement with them, they are nevertheless approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">The case of employee Hutchinson presents the question of a constructive discharge. Respondent contends that Hutchinson was not discharged, but voluntarily quit her employment. The evidence shows that following the representation election, which the Union lost by a close vote, and in which Hutchinson actively supported the Union, much to the surprise and shock of respondent management, Supervisor Cipriano became very critical of Hutchinson\u2019s work, reprimanded her on several occasions, and on one occasion took out \u201ca little black Book,\u201d said he was keeping a record of it, and that he was warning her twice but would not warn her a third time. Hutchinson\u2019s immediate supervisor, Stuart, who the Examiner found was a supervisor within the meaning of the Act, told Hutchinson \u201cto go ahead and quit,\u201d that Cipriano had discovered two errors made by her, and that if he found the third one she \u201cwas as good as gone.\u201d Stuart added that Cipriano had instructed him \u201cnot to even speak to\u201d Hutchinson, and to \u201cmake it as hard as possible\u201d on her so she would quit. The following day Cipriano reprimanded Hutchinson for faulty work, to which Hutchinson answered, \u201cWell, I\u2019ll just pull my card and quit.\u201d Cipriano responded, \u201cIf that\u2019s the way you feel, pull it.\u201d Hutchinson thereupon left the respondent\u2019s employ and did not return. The separation slip given Hutchinson indicates that she voluntarily quit and gives as the reason \u201cBecause dissatisfied with her job.\u201d Hutchinson applied to the Tennessee Department of Employment Security for unemployment benefits. That body ruled: \u201cEvidence indicates claimant quit because she was dissatisfied with her work.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b260-10\">On the issue here involved we consider this ruling of the Tennessee Department immaterial, in that we do not know how much of the relevant evidence was before the Department, and, in any event, a finding of fact by the Department is in no way controlling on this Court in our independent determination of the same factual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-11\">The Trial Examiner rejected respondent\u2019s defense that Hutchinson quit voluntarily, and found instead that the respondent deliberately made her working conditions intolerable and drove her into \u201can involuntary quit,\u201d which he found was a constructive discharge. The Board adopted this finding and conclusion of the Trial Examiner.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-12\">In our opinion, this finding and conclusion is supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole. It is a well recognized rule in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>labor relations law that \u201ca man is held to intend the foreseeable consequences of his conduct.\u201d Radio Officers\u2019 Union, etc. v.

Such a constructive discharge is a violation of Section 8(a) (3) of the Act, Section 158 (a) (3), Title 29 United States Code. N. L. R. B. v.
