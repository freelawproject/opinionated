Contrary to the contentions of the husband, the district court held that the decedent was mentally competent at the time she executed the designation of beneficiaries and that the designation was the legal act of the insured. The findings of fact were not clearly erroneous. The conclusions of law were correct. Bulger v. Ross, 1893, 98 Ala. 267, 12 So. 803; Wilson v. Payton, 1948, 251 Ala. 411, 37 So.2d 499.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-8\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
