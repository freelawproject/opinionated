Cole, from the rights of union membership. Cole was expelled for making derogatory remarks concerning the union officers in a resolution offered at a union meeting. He brought suit in the District Court for the Eastern District of New York, alleging violation of his right of free speech as secured by \u00a7 101 (a) (2) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (2). Jurisdiction was based on \u00a7 102 of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-24\">Cole sought an injunction <em>pendente lite </em>restoring him to membership in the union. Judge Dooling, after a hearing in which he considered affidavits and the documentary evidence purportedly supporting the union\u2019s action, found that defendants had infringed plaintiff\u2019s rights under \u00a7 101(a) (2) of the Act. He also found that they had violated \u00a7 101(a) (5), which requires a union to give adequate notice and a fair hearing to a member before disciplining him. Accordingly, he granted the requested injunction. We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-25\">The resolution offered by Cole at the regular meeting of the union on August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>6, 1962 consisted for the most part of a series of \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses which enumerated alleged instances of undemocratic actions and short-sighted policies on the part of the union officers. Cole\u2019s expulsion was based on two of these:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"acy-dedup-0\">\u201cWhereas, moral arguments fabricated to justify SIU\u2019s interference in interunion beefs are both contradictory and phony \u2014 a classic example being our current picketing of American Export ships because the Company proposes to man its Is-brandtsen vessels with licensed members of' the Brotherhood of Marine Officers \u2014 we have simply to jog our memories slightly to recall that Paul Hall stole those same engineers jobs from MEBA in 1951, when he set BME up as a dual organization ;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b938-4\">\u201cWhereas, raiding a duly certified bargaining agent\u2019s contractual jurisdiction was also the cause of Moormac\u2019s recent tie-ups, the pattern for such organizational hijacking was instituted on the Lakes more than a year ago when Paul Hall effectively argued that Lachlan Mae-leay\u2019s transfer to Gulf Canal Line justified SIU in undercutting NMU\u2019s daily wage rate from $28.46 to $17.50, and its manning scale from 11 men to 7 in order to gain representational power, and by his timely intervention in another NMU labor management relationship, where Mississippi Barge Line of St. Louis was replaced by a dummy corporation, Inland Towers of Davenport (La.), the change of unions in this raid was allowed to be excused on the grounds of a similar wage slash plus reduction of the crew of the Valley from 17 to 11 men.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b938-5\">These allegations were followed by several specific proposals for changes in hiring procedures for union members.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-6\">Cole was charged with violation of a union rule proscribing \u201cdeliberate and unauthorized interference or deliberate and malicious vilification with regard to the execution or the duties of any office or job.\u201d A hearing was held before a union trial committee, which found Cole guilty of such vilification with respect to charges made in the two \u201cWhereas\u201d clauses quoted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-8\">The dispositive question on this appeal is whether \u00a7 101(a) (2) allows a union to discipline a member for \u201cmalicious vilification\u201d of a union officer where the member has spoken with reference to a proposal submitted at a union meeting. Since we hold that it does not, we need not consider whether the union committee\u2019s finding that Cole was guilty of such vilification was so lacking in evidentiary support as to amount to a denial of the fair hearing guaranteed by \u00a7 101(a) (5). See Vars v. International Bhd. of Boilermakers, 320 F.2d 576 (2 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b938-9\">Section 101(a) (2) protects the right of a union member \u201cto express at meetings of the labor organization his views * * * upon any [matter] properly before the meeting.\u201d This right is \u201csubject to the organization\u2019s established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings\u201d and to the proviso that the union may \u201cenforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or contractual obligations.\u201d Defendants do not dispute that Cole\u2019s resolution was an expression of his views on a \u201cmatter properly before the meeting.\u201d Instead, they invoke the proviso and argue that he was expelled for violation of a reasonable rule \u201cas to the responsibility of every member toward the organization as an institution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b938-11\">We think that our decision in Salz-handler v. Caputo, 2 Cir., 316 F.2d 445, cert, denied, 375 U.S. 946, 84 S.Ct. 344, 11 L.Ed.2d 275 (1963) disposes of this contention. We there held that the proviso does not allow a union to discipline a member for calling an officer a \u201cpetty robber.\u201d We accepted <em>arguendo </em>the finding of the union trial board and the district court in that ease that the state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>ment had been false and libelous, but we held this to be irrelevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b939-5\">\u201cThe Trial Board * * * consisted of union officials, not judges. It was a group to which the delicate problems of truth or falsehood, privilege, and \u2018fair comment\u2019 were not familiar. Its procedure is peculiarly unsuited for drawing the fine line between criticism and defamation * * Id. at 450.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b939-7\">This ease would be on all fours with Salzhandler if the union trial committee had found only that Cole was guilty of vilification. We think that the Salz-handler rationale \u2014 that union tribunals are not competent to apply technical doctrines limiting free speech \u2014 is equally applicable to the trial committee\u2019s additional finding that Cole spoke with malice. We hold that such a finding, whether or not justified as a matter of fact, does not allow a union to discipline a member for statements otherwise protected by \u00a7 101(a) (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b939-8\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
