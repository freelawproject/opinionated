The answer to this question depends on whether the assignors of the allowables had a depletable \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in the oil in place with respect to the oil produced under these allowables. Taxpayer asserts it is the only one entitled to claim depletion. The government urges that the transferors of the allowables have the requisite \u201ceconomic interest\u201d to entitle them to share in the depletion deduction allowed by section 23 (m)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. It is not disputed that either the taxpayer or the transferors (but not both) is entitled to claim depletion with respect to the amounts paid to the 'transferors for these allowables.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">During the year 1952, Tidewater was the owner and operator of various oil and gas leases located in the East Texas Oil Field. That Field is under the control and supervision of the Texas Railroad Commission, which exercises authority over oil and gas drilling and production operations in 'the State of Texas. The Railroad Commission makes monthly determinations of the number of barrels of oil which can be produced from each well. Each well in the Field is assigned an allowable in barrels per producing day by the Railroad Commission. In addition to the proration of the number of allowable barrels to be produced per well, the Railroad Commission also establishes the number of days each month during which each well can produce. The amount so fixed is referred to as the \u201callowable\u201d for each well.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-11\">The record discloses that the East Texas Oil Field is about 42 miles long (north to south) and 4 to 8 miles wide (east to west).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Field has been described as. a large pool or reservoir of oil, having a natural water drive from west to east, produced by encroaching subterr\u00e1nea! water which bounds the field on the west.. Bottom-hole pressure, which forces oi! to the surface through the wells drilled in-the field, is created and maintained by this natural water movement. The extent and ease of production of oil are-determined in the main by the water-oil contact. As oil is withdrawn, water moves from the west to replace it and sweeps the oil along in the process.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-12\">As early as 1938, it was realized that withdrawal of salt water from the field must be curtailed both to prevent a drop&gt; in bottom-hole pressure (which would reduce total recoverable oil reserves and increase production costs) and to prevent pollution of fresh water supplies. Two methods of achieving this result were developed. The first was to encourage reinjection of salt water into the field; <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the second was to encourage owners and operators to close wells producing excessive amounts of salt water and transfer production to other wells in the field which were not producing salt water.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> These transferable rights to pro.-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>\u2022duee are referred to as \u201csalt-water shut-in allowables.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">It is the second method which gives rise to the problem involved in this case. (By order dated July 10, 1947, the Railroad Commission permitted the operator \u2022of any well in the field producing 100 or more barrels of water a day, to shut in that well and transfer its \u201callowable\u201d to another well or wells producing less than '25 percent water. The transferred allowable would be added to the transferee\u2019s existing allowable to increase production \u25a0from the transferee\u2019s well or wells to the \u25a0extent of the allowable transferred. Aft\u2022er the transferred allowable ceased, the \u2022transferor operator could reopen the shut-in well and resume production under the \u2022applicable Railroad Commission Order if it chose to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">Taxpayer acquired from other unrelated operators a number of such salt water shut-in allowables, and during the .year 1952 a portion of taxpayer\u2019s production of oil from its leases in the East Tex.as Oil Field was under these acquired allowables. Under the typical assignment \u2022of a shut-in allowable,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the assignor sold .all of its rights to its allowable on spe\u2022cific wells and agreed that all of the oil \u25a0produced by the assignee under the allowable should be property of said as-signee. The assignee (taxpayer) agreed to pay assignor a stated price per barrel, which varied with the posted sales price \u201cfor each and every barrel of such transferred allowable which assignee produces \u25a0\u2022\u00bb * <em>*\u00bb</em></p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In its tax return for 1952, taxpayer did not claim depletion on the amounts paid to assignors; this amount was excluded from gross income in determining the base for depletion. Taxpayer later filed a timely claim for refund, asserting it was entitled to claim depletion on this .amount. That claim was denied, and this suit followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">As stated earlier, the decision in the \u00abcase at bar turns on the question whether the transferors of the allowables have the requisite \u201ceconomic interest\u201d to entitle them to share in the depletion deduction allowed by section 23 (m) of the 1939 Code. The \u201ceconomic interest\u201d concept, which is used in defining the intended beneficiaries of percentage depletion, was originally formulated by the Supreme Court in Palmer v. Bender, 287 U.S. 551, 53 S.Ct. 225, 77 L.Ed. 489 (1933). The Court, aware of the necessity of creating a uniform law of taxation independent of the complexities of local law, freed the right to depletion allowance from \u201cany special form of legal interest in the oil well\u201d and reasoned that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b691-11\">\u201c[t]he language of the statute is broad enough to provide, at least, for every case in which the taxpayer has acquired, by investment, any interest in the oil in place, and secures, by any form of legal relationship, income derived from the extraction of the oil, to which he must look for a return of his capital.\u201d [287 U.S. at 557, 53 S.Ct. at 226]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">As pointed out recently in Commissioner v. Southwest Exploration Co., 350 U.S. 308, 76 S.Ct. 395, 100 L.Ed. 347 (1956), the two requisites of an economic interest established by Palmer v. Bender, supra, are (1) that the taxpayer must have acquired by investment an interest in the mineral in place, and (2) that he look to the extraction and sale of the mineral for the return of this investment. Since Palmer v. Bender, quite naturally the battles in this area of tax law have been fought over whether there was an interest in the oil in place of the proper sort and whether the source of the return of the taxpayer\u2019s capital was the extraction and sale of mineral.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">The major factor seriously in dispute between the parties, in the case at bar, involves the first criterion \u2014 an interest in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>the oil in place.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The government espouses two theories. \u2014 either one, it contends, provides the transferors of the allowables the requisite interest in the oil in place so as to entitle them to claim depletion on the amounts received from taxpayer for each barrel of oil produced pursuant to the transferred allowables. One view is based on the physical and geologic characteristics of the East Texas Oil Field. The government argues that since the Field is a common pool or reservoir of oil, when taxpayer was permitted to withdraw a greater quantity of oil made possible through the acquisition of the allowables, it in effect was withdrawing the oil under the transferors\u2019 closed wells. From this the government concludes that the economic interest in the oil in place under the closed wells which the transferors have, is sufficient to entitle them to depletion. In support of this argument the government points out that the Railroad Commission based the amount of the \u201csalt-water shut-in allowable\u201d which could be transferred according to a \u201cdecline curve\u201d which was designed to approximate the oil which could have been produced from the closed well, had it remained in operation. On the other hand, taxpayer points out that there is nothing in the record to suggest that the oil under the transferors\u2019 leases was depleted, but on the contrary the Railroad Commission\u2019s Order specifically provided for the resumption of production by the transferors, after the expiration of the \u201callowable.\u201d Taxpayer also points out that it is a common occurrence in the East Texas Oil Field, that within a short distance from an extremely productive well, no oil is found. Moreover, the shut-in wells were scattered over most of the Field and are not limited to one region, as would be required by the government\u2019s theory. All these factors, taxpayer argues, contradict the government\u2019s conception that the East Texas Oil Field is a single large underlying pool of oil being tapped with equal facility by all the wells in the Field.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">The general plan which the Railroad Commission attempted to carry out by the use of the \u201cdecline curve\u201d in determining the amount of the \u201callowable\u201d for each well, seems, at first blush, to support the government\u2019s position. However, for the \u201cdecline curve\u201d to carry out its intended result, i. e., that at the expiration of the \u201callowable\u201d the oil under the trans-feror\u2019s well would be depleted, the closed well must remain in operation. Assuming that the Railroad Commission was justified in making such a prediction, it. does not follow that the oil under a <em>closed </em>well would be depleted as a result of the transfer of its allowable.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, there is nothing in the record before us which shows that these closed wells-were <em>in fact </em>depleted. Nor can we conclude from the evidence before us, that the amount of oil beneath taxpayer\u2019s, wells was increased as a result of the alleged flow of oil fi'om the transferors\u2019\u2019 closed wells.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> All we know is that the oil which was being extracted came from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>taxpayer\u2019s wells, and since none was produced from the transferors\u2019 closed wells, there is a fair presumption that whatever oil was under their lease when the allowable was transferred would still be there when the allowable expired. Even if the transferors\u2019 wells did not have as much oil under their leases when the \u201callowable\u201d expired, there is no evidence in the record which shows that taxpayer\u2019s production pursuant to the transferred allowable was the cause of the decrease.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Therefore, under such circumstances, we cannot conclude that as a matter of physical and geologic reality the transferors had an interest in the oil in place under the taxpayer\u2019s wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-4\">We turn now to the government\u2019s second theory in support of its contention that the transferors have the requisite investment in the oil in place. It argues that the facts in this case come within the rationale of Southwest Exploration Co., supra, since the assignors of the al-lowables transferred a property interest which was essential to taxpayer\u2019s right to extract the oil in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b693-5\">In this area of tax law it is difficult to single out one recurring factor which the courts have found to be indicative of an interest in the minerals in place. The history of economic interest litigation is better described as the story of ascertaining which of several basic characteristics may be omitted without eliminating the possibility of such an interest. A leading authority on depletion,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> after an exhaustive analysis of the jurisprudence in this area, concluded 'that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b693-9\">\u201c[i]n determining the existence of an interest in the minerals in place three basic ideas are involved, viz., the legal form or nature of the instrument, the degree of substantial ownership of the deposit possessed by the interest holder, and the extent and nature of his contribution to development and operation of the property. A legal property interest in the minerals, lasting for the productive life of the property, entitling its holder to significant control of the mineral deposits and beneficial enjoyment of income therefrom, and acquired as the consequence of a contribution to its development or operation, is plainly an interest in the minerals in place. Drop one of these characteristics and the solution of the issue is less certain; drop two and serious doubts arise.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b693-10\">We view our function in this area of tax law as one of weighing these various, factors in each case and determining whether their presence or absence are indicative of or preclude the existence of an interest in the minerals in place. In so. doing, we must recognize that the purpose of discovery depletion should shape the result which we reach. In this respect we must emphasize the fact that Congress sought to encourage the discovery and development of minerals. We. recognize also that the Supreme Court, decisions reflect a growing liberality in the application of these criteria.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> How<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ever, we do not think it proper for us to take the lead and spearhead this apparent trend. In other words, we should not go beyond the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b694-4\">In this case the government equates the transferors of the \u201callowables\u201d with the upland owners in Southwest Exploration who had \u201cmade an indispensable contribution of the use of <em>real property\u201d </em>to the drilling for and the <em>extraction </em>of oil. (350 U.S. at 317, 76 S.Ct. at 400). At the outset it should be noted that aside from Southwest Exploration no Supreme Court decision has found a taxpayer possessing the requisite interest in the mineral in place who did not have either a fee or a leasehold interest in the oil-producing property itself. This apparent departure from prior doctrine can best be explained on the grounds that the granting of discovery depletion in that case served the purposes for which the allowance was created. That is, the upland owners in that case \u25a0contributed <em>real property </em>which was essential to the <em>discovery, drilling, </em>and <em>extraction </em>of the oil. Without their participation, there would have been no lease, no wells and no production. In exchange for this contribution, the upland owners acquired an interest which was measured by the producing life of the wells and they could look to the extraction and sale \u25a0of oil as a source of return for that interest. In other words, \u201c[t]heir income was dependent entirely on production, and the value of their interest decreased with each barrel of oil produced.\u201d (350 U.S. at 316, 76 S.Ct. at 400) Not only were they instrumental in the acquisition of the lease, but also they \u201cplayed a vital role at each successive stage of the proceedings.\u201d (Id. at 315, 76 S.Ct. at 399) The Court felt that although the upland owners did not have a legal property interest in the minerals nor did they have \u25a0control over the mineral deposits, their \u25a0contribution to development and operation was sufficiently significant to indicate an investment in the oil in place. However, the Court cautioned that they were not taking a drastic step from prior doctrine when they stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b694-7\">\u201cWe decide only that where, in the circumstances of this case, a party <em>essential </em>to the <em>drilling </em>for and <em>extraction </em>of oil has made an indispensable contribution of the use of <em>real property </em>adjacent to the oil deposits in return for a share in the net profits from the production of oil, that party has an economic interest which entitles him to depletion on the income thus received.\u201d [Emphasis added. 350 U.S. at 317, 76 S.Ct. at 400]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b694-9\">In the case at bar, the transferors like the upland owners did not have a legal property interest in the minerals, nor did they have control over the mineral deposits. Thus their entitlement to share in the depletion allowance must be based on their contribution to the development or operation of the mineral deposits. It seems fair to say that their contribution was not as significant a contribution as was made by the upland owners in Southwest Exploration Co. Their contribution was personal property rather than real property; it was at best indispensable for the extraction of only part of the oil; it was not instrumental in the acquisition of the lease, nor was it essential to the drilling operations. Unlike Southwest Exploration Co., the interest the transferors acquired was not measured by the productive life of the wells but was to be terminated at the expiration of the \u201callowables.\u201d Under these circumstances, to find in the case at bar, an interest in the minerals in place, would require us to go beyond the guidelines set forth by the Supreme Court in Southwest Exploration Co. Moreover, to do so, we think, would do violence to the clear congressional purpose in granting discovery depletion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Consequently, we hold that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>the transferors of the \u201callowables\u201d here in question do not have the requisite \u201ceconomic interest\u201d in the oil in place with respect to the oil produced under these allowables so as to entitle them to share in depletion allowance. Therefore, taxpayer is entitled to take the depletion allowance in question, since the amounts paid by it to these transferors do not constitute royalties and need not be ex-before computing its depletion allowance for 1952.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-4\">Accordingly, judgment is entered for taxpayer with the amount of recovery to be determined pursuant to Rule 47(c) (2) of the Rules of this court.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-5\">APPENDIX</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b695-6\">11.

Admittedly as a result of this conservation measure, which prevented the drop in bottom-hole pressure, taxpayer was. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>able to obtain a greater amount of recoverable oil under its leases. But this does not mean that there was an actual increase of oil under taxpayer\u2019s lease.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b693-7\">. The government argues that in the event we find that the record before us is insufficient to support the government\u2019s contentions, taxpayer nevertheless has failed to meet its burden of proof. We think that the facts before us are sufficient to make a <em>prima facie </em>case in favor of taxpayer. It has shown that all the oil which was produced came from its well and none came from the trans-ferors\u2019 wells. This raises the presumption that the oil beneath its leases was being depleted. The burden is on the government to prove the contrary- We think that the government has not met this burden.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b693-12\">.
