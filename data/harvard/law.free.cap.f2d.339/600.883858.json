After deliberating on the evidence received at the first hearing and applying the construction of the statute delineated in our opinion, the Board again concluded that there had been a violation of \u00a7 8(b) (7) (C) and that an order should issue against Local 3. It petitioned again for enforcement; and the respondent, Local 3, seeks to have this. Court dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-23\">Local 3 bases its attack first, on its claim that the Board misinterpreted and drew unwarranted inferences from the evidence. These objections are directed at the Board\u2019s fact finding function, but we believe its factual conclusions are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole. In the Union\u2019s second ground of attack, it as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>.-serts that any deviation from the kind of picketing which was permissive under the second proviso of \u00a7 8(b) (7) (C), was so slight and insubstantial that the Board was not justified in concluding that Local 3\u2019s picketing, as a whole, fell \u25a0outside the protection of the second proviso. It is true that the instances of non-permissive picketing were few, but we cannot say that they were too minor and inconsequential to support the Board\u2019s \u25a0conclusion that the picketing was for a purpose other than \u201ctruthfully advising the public\u201d that the employer was nonunion. The Board\u2019s order is only designed to prohibit non-privileged picketing and does not prevent the Union from \u2022carrying on activities of a permissive informational nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b657-5\">That \u00a7 8(b) (7) (C), in effect, proscribes certain picketing, under particular circumstances which come within .a valid and specifically defined policy \u2022enunciated by Congress, does not violate the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Local Joint Board, Hotel and Restaurant Employees, etc. v. Sperry, 323 F.2d 75, 79 (8th Cir. 2963).</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Enforcement of the order is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
