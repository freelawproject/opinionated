The car admittedly came into appellant\u2019s possession with the consent of the owner. Appellant\u2019s defense was that she intended to purchase the car, not to steal it, and, in any event, had done no more than exceed the scope of the permission given by the owner as to time and place of use of the vehicle, which was not in itself sufficient to establish an intent to steal.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-20\">Appellant\u2019s counsel submitted written requests for instructions reflecting this theory of defense. Counsel asked to be advised prior to closing arguments which of the submitted requests the court was going to accept. The court responded, \u201cI am going to give the general instructions. And you go ahead and argue the case any way you want to argue it. And I will instruct the jury as to the law involved in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b635-21\">Appellant\u2019s counsel proceeded to make his argument, basing it in part upon the theory of defense reflected in his requests. The court then charged the jury without giving the requested instructions, or any others dealing adequately with appellant\u2019s theory \u2014 for we do not think the general instruction to which the government points <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> can be said to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-22\">Appellant contends that the district court failed to comply with the mandate of Rule 30, Fed.R.Crim.P., that \u201cThe court shall inform counsel of its proposed action upon the requests prior to their arguments to the jury * * The government argues that the court complied with the Rule; and, if it did not, that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>The government reads the first sentence of the court\u2019s response as a statement that all of appellant\u2019s written requests were rejected, and that the court would give those of the \u201cgeneral instructions\u201d reported at 27 F.R.D. 39 as were appropriate to the case. Appellant\u2019s counsel states that he understood, and so indicated by the objection which he immediately interposed, that the court was refusing to advise him in advance which of the requested instructions would be given.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"> \u201cThe obvious object of the rule in point is to require the judge to inform the trial lawyers in a fair way what the charge is going to be, so that they may intelligently argue the case to the jury.\u201d1 Ross v. United States, 180 F.2d 160, 165 (6th Cir. 1950). See also Downie v. Powers, 193 F.2d 760, 766-767 (10th Cir. 1951). Measured against the purpose of Rule 30, we think the court\u2019s cryptic remarks were inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">Nor can we say that the error may be disregarded as not affecting appellant\u2019s substantial rights. Rule 52(a), Fed.R.Crim.P. Because the court failed to clearly inform counsel of its ruling on his requests, counsel\u2019s closing argument was based upon a theory of defense which the court rejected, or at least ignored, in its subsequent instructions. We cannot say that this did not impair the effectiveness of counsel\u2019s argument and hence of appellant\u2019s defense. Carbo v. United States, 314 F.2d 718, 745-746 (9th Cir. 1963), and Watada v. United States, 301 F.2d 869, 870 (9th Cir. 1962), are not to the contrary, for in neither case did it appear that the failure of the court to comply with Rule 30 affected the content of counsel\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">The government asserts that the requested instructions were faulty. But that, if true, is of course irrelevant. It was the court\u2019s failure to advise counsel of its ruling prior to closing argument, not the soundness of that ruling, which violated Rule 30 and prejudicially affected counsel\u2019s summation.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b635-14\"> \u201cThe word \u2018stolen\u2019 * * * means any wrongful act or dishonest taking whereby a person obtains property belonging to another without or beyond any permission given, <em>and </em>with the intent to deprive the owner of the right and benefit of ownership.\u201d (Emphasis added by the government.)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
