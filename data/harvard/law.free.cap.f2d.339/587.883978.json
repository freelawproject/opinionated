In this direct appeal from the 7-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>year sentence imposed by the trial court, appellant attacks the sufficiency of the indictment and the refusal of the court to grant his motion for a separate trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-4\">The offense proscribed by the statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a), is the knowing transportation in interstate commerce of a person kidnaped and \u201cheld for ransom or reward or otherwise\u201d and the severity of the punishment depends on whether such person is liberated unharmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The indictment charges the kidnaping and transportation of Gloria Jean Galvez and says that she was held \u201cfor the purpose of taking indecent liberties with her person and of making an assault upon her.\u201d Counsel for appellant argues that the quoted phrase does not satisfy the statute because it is too vague to indicate that such liberties caused harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">The use in the statute of the words \u201cor otherwise\u201d shows an intent of Congress to include within the offense any holding of a kidnaped person for a purpose desired by the captor and negatives the need for ransom or reward.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The generality of the phrase encompasses a holding for the purpose of taking indecent liberties.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statute does not require that the kidnaping and holding cause harm to the person kidnaped. The matter of harm\u2019relates only to punishment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In our opinion the indictment is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\"> Appellant was not prejudiced by the denial of his motion for a separate trial. No statement of one defendant implicating a co-defendant was received in evidence. The grant of a severance is within the discretion of the trial court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and that discretion was not abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-7\">. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201(a) roads thus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b644-8\">\u201cWhoever knowingly transports in interstate or foreign commerce, any person who has been unlawfully seized, confined, inveigled, decoyed, kidnaped, abducted, or carried away and held for ransom or reward or otherwise, except, in the case of a minor, by a parent thereof, shall be punished (1) by death if the kidnaped person has not been liberated unharmed, and if the verdict of the jury shall so recommend, or (2) by imprisonment for any term of years or for life, if the death penalty is not imposed.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b644-9\">.
