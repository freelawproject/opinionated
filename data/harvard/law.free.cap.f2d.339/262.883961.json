The issues raised on review are purely factual, the petitioners urging us to set aside the crucial findings of the Tax <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>Court as clearly erroneous. Our examination of the record satisfies us, however, that there is substantial evidence to support the findings. We see no reason to add to the discussion of the evidence contained in Judge Mulroney\u2019s opinion with which we are in full agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
