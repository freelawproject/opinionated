Appellants are individual boat owners and various insurance companies who had paid for damage to, and \u201cclean-up\u201d of, various private pleasure yachts, which had been anchox'ed in Los Angeles Harbor, primarily in and about the Yacht Centre, Inc. This corporation occupied harbor space pui\u2019suant to a lease granted by the Board of Hai\u2019bor Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles (hereinafter the \u201cCity\u201d). The damage occurx-ed as a result of an \u201coil spill\u201d which itself occurred in the following manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-15\">On July 11, 1957, oil (pumped by Standard Oil Company of California to Matson Terminals through a 9,600 foot pipeline built by Gerwick, Inc., a corporation, for the City of Los Angeles, and accepted and operated by the City) spilled into the Los Angeles Harbor\u2014 some 1,400 barrels of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-17\">We will not go into a detailed discussion of the factual situation surrounding the building of the line, but mention only the necessity for some type of expansion joint at a certain spot therein to allow for expansion and contraction of the pipeline; the insufficient space (3%'0 between two required pipe straps (Ex. F) to permit the installation of an expansion joint; the substitution of a coupling device, known as a \u201cDresser Style 38 coupling\u201d; the dispute as to whether this substitution was authorized, and if it was, whether or not it was authox\u2019ized in writing and by whom; the failure of the substitute for the expansion joint to stand two hundred pounds px'essux-e on two occasions; the addition of 4 x 4 inch timbers to hold the coupling by wedging such timbers against the line; the trial run of 400 pounds pressure ; the Harbor Engineer\u2019s instructions to remove the timbers; the written advice to the Harbor Engineer that these timbers had been removed; that some permanent blocking had to be inserted before the line could be safely put into use; and the subsequent acceptance of Gerwick\u2019s work as \u201cfully and satisfactorily completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b206-18\">Jurisdiction below existed by reason of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333, and Article III, \u00a7 2 of the United States Constitution. Jurisdiction here exists by reason of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-19\">In No. 18404, some twelve insurance companies sued, as subrogees of small boat owners, the City. The Standard Oil Company of California, a corporation, which pumped the oil in; Ben C. Ger-wick, Inc., a corporation, which constructed for the City the pier extension and pipeline involved; Dresser Industries, Inc., a corporation, which manufactured the coupling used by the contractor; Matson Navigation Co., a corporation, to which the oil was to be delivered for the \u201cS.S. Lurline\u201d; and C. E. Keiser, Sales Engineer for Dresser Industries.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>In No. 18405, one insurance company, as subrogee of a small boat owner, sued the same defendants above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">In No. 18406, the Yacht Centre, Inc., a corporation, the yacht mooring facility, sued the same defendants above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">In No. 18407, eight small boat owners sued the same defendants above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">In No. 18408, one insurance company, as subrogee of small boat owners, sued the same defendants above named.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-14\">In each action, the City filed claim against Gerwick for clean-up expenses, indemnity and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\">The trial court found against the City in favor of all plaintiffs, and against the City on its claim for indemnity and contribution.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">In that connection, we quote in the margin Findings (24), (25), (26) and (27) in case No. 18408.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Similar find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>ings were made in each of the other actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">The amount of damage of the respective plaintiffs was agreed upon by stipulation.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b208-13\">The district court concluded the City of Los Angeles was liable for its negligence in building and operating the oil line, and denied recovery to the City, both for (a) indemnity or contribution, and. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>&lt;b) damages for clean-up expense sought by it from Ben C. Gerwick, Inc. A minor point is raised in this appeal by the City involving deposition costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">We find no merit in the City\u2019s appeal \u25a0on any point.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\"><em>I </em>\u2014 The <em>Appellees\u2019 Status.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The sole ground of the City for claiming nonliability is that the City owned the harbor and its waters and hence had \u25a0only a duty to refrain from active negligence, and to warn of defective conditions, and that plaintiffs failed to show any status that created a duty of care to them which the City had violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-7\">We reject such contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">The City had no right to exclude -citizens of California from using navigable waters. (R.T. 1417-3). It holds title to land covered by navigable waters in trust, by grant from the State \u25a0of California, upon the express condition that \u201cany harbor constructed thereon shall always remain a public harbor for all purposes of commerce and navigation\u201d and with an express reservation that the people of the State of California have \u201cthe absolute right to fish * * * with the right of convenient access * * * over said [submerged] lands.\u201d And cf. Art. XV, \u00a7 2 of the Constitution \u25a0of the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-9\">Several of the boat owners were business invitees of the Yacht Centre, Inc., and by reason of its lease with the Board of Harbor Commissioners, were, with it, business guests or invitees of the City \u2014 not licensees or trespassers as the City apparently urges. The cases cited by the City do not support their position, on the facts here present. In Chinea v. United States, 190 F.Supp. 643 (N.D. Cal.1961) for example, plaintiff was in the class of one \u201cwho comes upon another\u2019s land\u201d for a \u201cnon-business purpose of benefit only to himself\u201d and was hence a licensee. We cannot assume that either the boat owners or the Yacht Centre were invited by the City to use their anchorage or slip space without cost to the shipowners. There existed a resulting advantage to the City in the way of income. We cannot believe the boat owners using the anchorage were the \u201cunforeseen vessels\u201d mentioned in The Chancellor, 30 F.2d 227 (2 Cir. 1929); and hence trespassers. The City here had erected small slips, regularly leased to various tenants (R.T. 1425, 1437) and permittees (R.T. 1432). Thus, contrary to the City\u2019s position, there was evidence of the status of the plaintiffs. Additionally, there was a finding (No. 18) that there was no evidence that the damaged vessels were not rightfully in the harbor at the time they were so damaged.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b209-14\">Thus the lack of factual basis for the City\u2019s legal position eliminates any reliance on its first point on appeal. This is the sole point on this appeal raised against the appellee insurance companies and/or boat owners.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-15\"><em>II </em>\u2014 The <em>Executed Oral Agreement.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AgS\">The City next claims that Ben C. Ger-wick, Inc., is liable to the City for damages resulting from the separation of the defective pipeline, and for indemnity paid by the City, if liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-16\">This position is based on the theory that the written contract, plans and specifications for the construction of the pipeline could not be lawfully altered by an oral executed agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-17\">That there was an alteration in the original plans to insert <em>some form </em>of \u201cjoint\u201d is not disputed. The court found that Gerwick had constructed the wharf in all respects in accordance with the contract, plans and specifications, and \u201cduly authorized oral executed alterations, modifications, deviations and changes.\u201d (Finding 21.) But, the City urges, the court (1) made no finding as to the identity of the person who was authorized to enter into an oral agree<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>ment on behalf of the City; (2) the contract itself provided (Ex. CA, p. 15, Art. 31) that the Harbor Engineer\u2019s authority was limited to \u201cminor changes\u201d; (3) those were required to be in writing (Art. 31); and (4) only changes \u201cnecessary or expedient to carry out and complete more fully and more perfectly the work agreed to be done\u201d could be made.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">It is conceded by the City that Tingley, Gerwick\u2019s project engineer, testified he had a telephone conversation with one Squires, chief of the design section of the Harbor Engineer\u2019s office, wherein Squires authorized a Dresser Style 38 coupling (Finding 25(b)). Subsequently, Jackson (the City\u2019s Inspector) allegedly laid on Tingley\u2019s desk a note which read: \u201cUse Style 38 coupling.\u201d This is <em>not </em>an expansion joint, but is what was installed between bents Nos. 221 and 222.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-14\">We here refer to and adopt partially the statement of facts set forth in the margin<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> made by appellees and certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>cross-appellants. Each is supported by a finding or reference to testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">To the foregoing recital of facts in note 4, we add the fact conceded by the City in its brief that on November 1, 1956, E. V. Dockweiler, the Harbor Engineer, wrote a letter to Bernard J. Caughlin, general manager of the Harbor Department, stating that Gerwiek had fully and satisfactorily completed the work under the contract, except for certain paving, and had complied with the terms of the contract. This report was approved by the general manager (of the Harbor Department) and by the Board of Harbor Commissioners. (Ex. EC.)</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">Despite the findings of the district court that Gerwiek had performed the work in accordance with the orally executed changes; despite the admitted ambiguity in the drawings prepared by the City (Appellant\u2019s Op.Br. p. 6, Ex. F, R.T. 324, 328) that called for building something that could not be built; despite the discrepancies between various plans the City prepared (Ex. E and F); and even despite the provisions of the contract (which, recognizing that discrepancies might exist, required the contractor to submit the matter to the engineer \u2014 -\u201cwithout whose decision said discrepancy shall not be adjusted\u201d \u2014 (Ex. CA, p. 16, Art. 38)), the City now urges that we disregard Tingley\u2019s testimony that he followed the required procedure; disregard the trial court\u2019s findings based on conflicting testimony, and conclude that Gerwiek, not the City, \u201cfailed to perform the contract, plans and specifications in a workmanlike manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">That the contract was required to be modified was obvious. That it may be likewise seems good law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-7\">\u201c \u2018Any contract, however made or evidenced, can be discharged or modified by <em>subsequent agreement </em>of the parties.

Miller, 51 Cal.2d 541, 546, 334 P.2d 849, 851 (1959) (quoting 3 Corbin on Contracts, \u00a7 574, pp. 222-23). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-9\">California Civil Code \u00a7 1698 provides that a contract in writing may be modified \u201cby a contract in writing, or <em>by an executed oral agreement.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-10\">\u201cThe parties [to a construction contract], may, by their conduct, waive such a provision [requirement of written change order]. * * * \u201d Frank T. Hickey, Inc. v. Los Angeles Jewish Community Council, 128 Cal. App.2d 676, 682-83, 276 P.2d 52, 57 (1954). (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-13\">As to the applicability of \u00a7 1698, Civil Code of California, in this connection, see 1st Olympic Corp. v. Hawryluk, 185 Cal. App.2d 832, 8 Cal.Rptr. 728 (1960) and Miller v. Brown, 136 Cal.App.2d 763, 289 P.2d 572 (1955).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-14\">The City, say appellees, stands in no more favored position than any other suitor. Brown v. Sebastopol, 153 Cal. 704, 96 P. 363, 19 L.R.A.,N.S., 178 (1908) ; Corporation of America v. Durham Mut. Water Co., 50 Cal.App.2d 337, 123 P.2d 81 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-15\">With respect to the oral executed agreement, appellant City urges in its reply brief the proposition (a) that the Charter of the City of Los Angeles provides in \u00a7 385 that \u201cContracts of the City of Los Angeles are required to be in writing,\u201d and (b) that contracts required by statute to be in writing cannot be modified by oral executed agreements, citing Lisher v. Fairbanks, 70 Cal.App. 326, 233 P. 74 (1924); Contra Costa Const. Works v. Daly City, 48 Cal.App. 622, 192 P. 178 (1920); Rice Lands &amp; Products Co. v. Blevins, 61 Cal.App. 536, 215 P. 402 (1923); J. M. Griffith Co. v. Los Angeles, 6 Cal.Unrep. 119, 54 P. 383 (1898).</p>\n<p id=\"b211-16\">Gerwiek replies (a) that California Civil Code \u00a7 1698 and various cases cited at pages 18-19 of the appellees\u2019 brief, support the validity of oral executed agreements, (b) that Charter \u00a7 385 was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>never introduced into evidence or relied on in the court below; (e) the four cases the City cites, supra, are not controlling.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">At oral argument the City was granted permission to file authorities supporting its position that a court can and will take judicial notice of the charter of a municipal corporation, namely: Par. (g), Sec. 8, Art. XI of the California Constitution; Teachout v. Bogy, 175 Cal. 481, 485, 166 P. 319 (1917); Taylor v. Los Angeles, 180 Cal.App.2d 255, 4 Cal. Rptr. 209 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">After adoption of a city charter in California and after proper recordation as required by Art. XI, \u00a7 8, Par. (g): \u201cthe courts shall take judicial notice of the provisions of such charter.\u201d We are not advised that there was proof of such proper recordation in the trial court. Neither are we convinced \u201cthe courts\u201d required to take notice include those of the federal system.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But we need not decide that matter, because we find the issue controlled by case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-7\">The Lisher Rice Lands, Contra Costa Construction and Griffith Co. cases, all cited, supra, do not go as far as counsel for the City would have us believe, in defeating the language of \u00a7 1698 of the California Civil Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">Thus, in Contra Costa, the court does not say that contracts required by statute to be in writing <em>cannot </em>be altered by an oral executed agreement. \u201cAn implied contract,\u201d the opinion states (70 Cal.App. at 625, 192 P. at 180), \u201cin this case could not arise <em>at least without knowledge or action on the part of the board of trustees before the extra work was done,\u201d </em>citing the Griffith case. In the instant case, both knowledge and action on the part of the Board of Harbor Commissioners existed. These did not exist in Contra Costa, where the judgment was simply \u201cnot supported by the evidence.\u201d (p. 625, 192 P. 178)</p>\n<p id=\"b212-11\">In Griffith, supra, the City was held not liable as upon a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work authorized by the engineer alone, <em>unknown to the city counsel, </em>for steel bands claimed against the City after the sewer was unbedded below the surface of the earth.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-12\">We have already commented on the material facts here present, which distinguish this case. We agree with appellees; that the four cases relied on by the City are not controlling. Cf.: Miller v. Brown, 136 Cal.App.2d 763, 289 P.2d 572 (1955); 1st Olympic Corp. v. Haw-ryluk, supra; and re estoppel, see Maurice L. Bein, Inc. v. Housing Authority, 157 Cal.App.2d 670, 321 P.2d 753 (1958); Corporation of America v. Durham Mutual Water Co., 50 Cal.App.2d 337, 123 P.2d 81 (1942).</p>\n<p id=\"b212-14\">Because the City here does not raise any question with respect to its own negligence (save as to the status of the small vessel owners to sue), we accept the findings of the trial court that the defects in the pipeline, its failure, the oil spill, the damage to libellants, and the damage, if any, to the City, caused by such spill, were proximately caused by negligence on the part of the City, and by its negligence alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-15\">Because we have upheld the trial court\u2019s conclusion and finding that there was an oral executed agreement altering the original contract, and that Gerwick faithfully performed the work required by the contract as so modified, we find there were no improper methods used by, nor any negligence proved on the part of, the contractor. Hence there is no liability on Gerwick to the City on any agreement of indemnity. Vinnell Co. v. Pacific Elec. Ry., 52 Cal.2d 411, 340 P.2d 604 (1959). To put it succinctly, we can find neither an express nor an implied indemnity under the facts here present rendering Gerwick liable for what occurred.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Gerwick had no control over <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>the pipeline once it was delivered to the City. The City knocked out adequate trussing (found so by actual test) and installed its own inadequate trussing. This failed nine months later \u2014 and the City\u2019s continuing negligent nonaction constituted subsequent intervening causation, even had Gerwick been negligent.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><em>Ill </em>\u2014 Costs <em>of Depositions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">Lastly, the City urges error in one of the actions (No. 18404) in the allowance of five proctors\u2019 fees for depositions not introduced in evidence; the witnesses being present and having testified in court; and the depositions having been used either to refresh recollections, or in connection with cross-examinations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">The City relies on Prashker v. Beech Aircraft Corp., 24 F.R.D. 305 (D.Del. 1959). In that case, the trial judge pointed out that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923 provides that docket fees of $2.50 are allowable \u201cfor each deposition admitted in evidence.\u201d It ruled seven of the ten deposition docket fees sought were for depositions not introduced into evidence, and there was \u201cno sufficient support\u201d to establish they were used as evidence either in cross-examination or otherwise. The court disallowed the cost of the seven ($17.50), stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-7\">\u201cIt is obvious I am not passing on depositions where portions were expressly utilized in evidence as held in Perlman v. Feldmann, D.C., 116 F.Supp. 102 or Lindeman v. Textron, Inc., D.C., 136 F.Supp. 157.\u201d Id. 24 F.R.D. at 307.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">In the oft referred to case of Perlman, supra, the court allowed as taxable the cost of one copy of five pre-trial depositions \u2014 which he found were \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case.\u201d This was his ruling, \u201c[hjaving in mind the objective of the pre-trial discovery provision of the Federal Rules,\u201d and the provisions of Rule 26(a). He held \u201cthe cost to a prevailing party of the copy of a deposition transcript is implicit in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2)\u201d (116 F.Supp. pp. 109, 110). None of the depositions were filed (116 F.Supp. at 111). The court concluded that filing had been waived, and the costs allowable.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-13\">The Perlman ease, supra, does not meet the question of the effect on tax-ability of costs of deposition where the depositions are or are not used at the trial; nor on taxability as docket fee costs under \u00a7 1923, as distinguished from ordinary costs. The Lindeman case, supra, does, and holds that at least some excerpt from any deposition for which a docket fee is claimed must have been introduced into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-14\">Turning to the factual procedural situation in this case, we find that appellant City concedes \u201c[TJhese depositions were used for the purpose of refreshing the witnesses\u2019 recollections and were used in connection with their cross-examination.\u201d (Op.Br. p. 35.) This brief refers us to the Clerk\u2019s Transcript in No. 18404, pp. 262-63, and 264-65. The first reference is to a stipulation between the parties, showing that of the twenty depositions originally \u201cdocket fee taxed,\u201d <em>portions </em>of depositions of <em>five </em>witnesses not present were read into evidence; <em>portions </em>of <em>five </em>depositions of (other and additional witnesses) were used to refresh recollection and to cross-examine, and <em>none </em>of <em>ten </em>(other and additional depositions of witnesses) <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> were read or admitted into evidence, nor were they used to either refresh recollection or cross-examine a witness who testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Appellee libellant insurance companies filed a cost bill in the sum of $3,835.45. This was taxed by the court clerk at $216.86, and subsequently on hearing by the trial court, retaxed at $191.86 ($45.00 instead of $70.00 for docket fees under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923, a deduction of $25.00 or ten \u201cdeposition docket fees\u201d of $2.50 each).</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">As did Chief Judge Hincks in Perlman v. Feldmann, supra, we agree that the logic of the case of Stallo v. Wagner, 245 F. 636, 639 (1917), decided by the second circuit in interpreting the old Fee Bill of 1853 (Rev.Stat. \u00a7 983; 28 U.S.C. (ed. 1940), \u00a7 830) was superseded by \u00a7 1920 (2) of 28 U.S.C., which the revisers, \u201cwith congressional approval,\u201d doubtless intended to make broad enough to incorporate the substance of subdivision (e) of the Court Reporter\u2019s Act of 1944, 28 U.S.C. (ed. 1940) \u00a7 9a; that this was carried over into the Code of 1948, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1920(2), and hence falls within the \u201cnecessarily obtained for use in the case\u201d rule. If not taxable as proctor\u2019s docket fees, it was taxable as necessary costs, and we will not disturb for form where substance does not require it.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\"><em>IV </em>\u2014 The <em>Cross-Appeal.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">A. Libellant insurance companies appeal the refusal to allow them interest from July 11, 1957, the date of the oil spill (or in the alternative, from October 10, 1957, the stipulated date of payment of the subrogated insurance) until May 2, 1962, the date of the final decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-7\">This, cross-appellants urge, was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion for a loss in admiralty, citing The President Madison, 91 F.2d 835, 845-46 (9th Cir. 1937) ; The Manhattan, 85 F.2d 427, 429 (3d Cir. 1936). Cross-appellee City cites the same cases to prove that such interest is not a matter of l'ight, but within the legal discretion of the trial court. We note that the trial court found:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-8\">\u201cThat there has been no unnecessary or unreasonable delay by any libellant herein in filing this action or in prosecuting it thi-ough trial.\u201d (Finding 38.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-9\">In his conclusions of law, the trial judge sti'uck out the typewritten reference to an award of interest at seven per cent from July 11, 1957 to date of payment, and awarded interest \u201cfrom the date of entry of the decree to date of payment,\u201d with costs. (Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 240, No. 18404.)</p>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">In The President Madison, supra, Judge Denman for this court (91 F.2d at 845) pointed out that where there had been a total loss of a vessel, it \u201ccannot be fully compensated by payment years after of no more than her value at her sinking or destruction, [for t]he owner has neither use of the vessel nor her money equivalent during this period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-11\">We note that most of, if not all, the cases cited by Judge Denman are \u201ctotal loss\u201d cases; <em>\u201cRestitutio in integrum\u201d </em>is to be paid, unless refused under the \u201cpeculiar facts\u201d of the case. Some examples (usually of counsel\u2019s delay) are given. But, says the opinion, if there are \u201cpeculiar facts\u201d causing denial of interest from the date of the collision, there should be findings made to that effect. Here there were no such findings; in fact, the findings of fact made (Finding 38) indicated that no such \u201cpeculiar facts\u201d here existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-12\">In The Manhattan, supra, again the loss was total, at least \u201cin the money value sense.\u201d The court there said the trier of fact was required to assess damages \u201cprecisely as a jury would render a verdict in a personal injury case.\u201d (85 F.2d at 428) The court then considered the date from which \u201cinterest allowance\u201d is calculated.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-13\">\u201cUntil an award is made of the damages, interest qua interest is not allowed, but delay in making compensation is an element in determining the damages. * * * [Djelay thus enters into the late award as an element of loss, and the damage awarded is for a sum which is the equivalent of what would have been a smaller sum if earlier awarded. The difference between loss and interest thus becomes little more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>than a difference in words, but it none the less exists in theory.\u201d (Id. at 429.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Suggesting that any rule must be subject to the check of common sense (85 F.2d at 428), and in an attempt to turn the light of common sense on the facts of this case, we find (1) that apparently none of the respective losses were total; (2) that the parties stipulated to the damages the libellants had suffered, in a somewhat inexplicit manner;<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (the so-called \u201cactual damages\u201d were themselves arbitrary figures, being sixty-two per cent of damages <em>claimed </em>by libellants (Clk\u2019s Tr., p. 146, No. 18404)) (3) that there was no proof in the record of when repairs were made or cleaning was done, or that repairs had actually been made, or that libellants had suffered any loss of use of their vessels. Neither was there any proof in the record of the respective condition of the vessels prior to July 11, 1957.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The trial court, having these factors in mind, including the stipulation as to damages, awarded what it concluded was fair compensation.\u201d So that there could be no misunderstanding or charge that delay on the libellants\u2019 part had entered into or influenced his conclusions, he made Finding 38.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">We think the stipulation as to \u201cactual damages\u201d made herein, plus the record (or lack of it) found herein, justified the discretion exercised by the trial court in awarding interest only from the date of entry of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">That this is not a \u201ctotal loss\u201d case is not conclusive; neither is the fact that it was not a \u201ccollision loss.\u201d We think that the reasoning with respect to interest in The Tanker Hygrade No. 24, Inc. v. The Tug Dynamic, 233 F.2d 444, at 447-48 (2d Cir. 1956), supports our conclusion, <em>in the absence of any proof in the record of deprivation of use.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b215-10\">Under the peculiar facts of this case we decline to follow the procedure followed by this court in The President Madison, supra, 91 F.2d at 847-48, and we confirm the exercise of the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-11\">B. We next reach certain items of costs, involved in the cross-appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-12\">(1) The court allowed and taxed as costs in case No. 18404 but <em>one </em>proctor\u2019s docket fee of $20.00 on the trial, and a fee of $2.50 for each of the ten depositions admitted in evidence. This allowance followed the exact language of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-13\">Cross-appellants rely on the last paragraph of Title Guaranty &amp; Trust Co. v. Crane Co., 219 U.S. 24, 35, 31 S.Ct. 140, 142, 55 L.Ed. 72 (1910), where Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>Justice Holmes, without discussion or reason, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b216-4\">\u201cThe allowance of a docket fee of $10 to each claimant appears to us to be correct. Rev.Stat. \u00a7 824 * * *. The claims are several and represent distinct causes of action in different parties, although consolidated in a single suit.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">This, say cross-appellants, is the only case in point decided by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">This circuit \u201cruled to the contrary\u201d (said the second circuit \u2014 Petition of Skibs A/S Jolund, 302 F.2d 114 (1962)), in Boston Marine Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Redwood Lumber Co., 197 F. 703 (9th Cir. 1912). Should the accident of forum determine what docket fees are to be awarded? supra, ask cross-appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-7\">Cross-appellee relies on the Boston case, <em>supra, </em>and the cases this court therein relied upon: The Oregon, 133 F. 609 (9th Cir. 1904); Title Guaranty &amp; Trust Co. v. Puget Sound Engine Works, 163 F. 168 (9th Cir. 1908); and The State of Missouri, 76 F. 376 (7th Cir. 1896).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-8\">We note that the Title Guaranty action was one to enforce claims of materialmen against a surety on a contractor\u2019s bond. There is doubt \u201cwhether several parties were there represented by the same proctor\u201d (Cross-Appellants\u2019 Reply Brief, p. 5).</p>\n<p id=\"b216-9\">Here they were. More important, we do not know whether all claimants joined in one libel in Title Guaranty, or filed separate libels. Cf.: The A. Moulton, 291 F. 95 (S.D.Fla.1923); The Mississippi, 20 F.2d 1015 (N.D.Cal.1927). Here we do know the various libellants did join in one libel. (Others were joined by stipulation.)</p>\n<p id=\"b216-10\">We are struck by the continued reference in the cases cited on this subject to the general rule that: \u201cCosts in admiralty are wholly within the control of the court, and are allowed upon equitable considerations.\u201d The Oregon, supra; The State of Missouri, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">In admiralty proceedings, costs are allowed according to rules promulgated by the Supreme Court if Congress has not acted. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1925.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-12\">Revised Statute \u00a7 824, mentioned in the Title Guaranty case, supra, has become, with other sections 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. \u201cThis simplified restatement provides for a single docket fee in each case which reaches final hearing or trial.\u201d Revisor\u2019s Note, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1923.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-13\">We think there is a reasonable distinction to be made between several libellants joined in one action and one libel, resulting in one judgment, and libels filed separately, and joined together for convenience of court or counsel at trial. We think one docket fee is prescribed and proper in the first instance, while separate docket fees might well be equitable and proper in the second instance. Steffens v. Steiner, 232 F. 862 (2d Cir. 1916); The John McDermott, 109 F. 90 (D.Conn.1901); Boston Marine Ins. Co. v. Metropolitan Redwood Lumber Co., 197 F. 703 (9th Cir. 1912); United States to Use of Hudson River Stone Supply Co. v. Venable Const. Co., 158 F. 833 (C.C.N.D.Ga.1904). And see case cited, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1923, p. 713, n. 9, paras. 2, 5 et seq.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-14\">In view of the language of the cases and of \u00a7 1923, we decline to interfere with the discretion exercised by the trial judge under the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-15\">B.(2) Cross-appellants also ask to recover $745.12 as costs of deposition <em>copies. </em>The clerk disallowed this item <em>in toto, </em>as being for copies (Clk\u2019s Tr. p. 247). The disallowance was sustained by the district court (Clk\u2019s Tr. pp. 264-65). This was because of local rule 15(B) (2) (b) that \u201cCounsel\u2019s copies [of depositions] are not taxable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-16\">Cross-appellants assert this is inequitable. They rely on Perlman v. Feldmann, 116 F.Supp. 102, 109-11 (D.Conn.1953). We approve generally of that case, but it is not an admiralty case (nor was Independent Iron Works, Inc. v. United States Steel Corp., 322 F.2d 656, 678 (9th Cir. 1963) cited by counsel, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>where we followed Perlman). Ordinary rules of Civil Procedure do not yet apply to proceedings in admiralty (Rule 81(a) (1), Fed.R.Civ.P.). And neither 28 U. S.C. \u00a7 1925, nor 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923, nor General Admiralty Rule 44 require an answer different from that made by the trial court. We refuse to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">The judgment is affirmed in all respects.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b207-7\">. \u201c(24) That at all times subsequent to September 17, 1956, the City was in possession of and operating said pipeline to the extent necessary to keep and maintain said wharf facilities including Berths 195 to 198, in a good and safe condition of repair, and was obligated as owner of said wharf facilities to supervise, inspect and observe in the uses to which said pipeline was being put and in the bunkering operations which were being undertaken at the time of the oil spill to the extent necessary to keep said wharf facilities in a good and safe condition of repair at all times and to do likewise with said pipeline.

After installing the Style 38 Dresser coupling in the line at this point, the line was hydi'ostatically pressure tested (i. e., by pressure testing it with water) in accordance with the requirements of the contract, which required the line to sustain a test pressure of 400 pounds per square inch. [Finding (11).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-7\">\u201c7. The pipeline failed the first test on September 11, 1956, by separating at the coupling at a pressure of 200 pounds per square inch.

The pipeline was again reassembled at the coupling, and this time threaded bolts were placed through coupling and attached to anchor clips welded on each side of the pipe both north and south of the coupling, to hold the pipe securely in the coupling. Additionally, timber thrust blocking was placed at the first right angle turn in the pipeline just north of the coupling, to prevent the pipe \u2018kicking out\u2019 of the coupling when pressure was applied. Again a hydrostatic test was run, and this time the pipeline held a pressure in excess of 400 pounds.

Gerwiek then inquired of City what it wanted done respecting the above-mentioned devices used to enable the pipeline to pass the pressure test. [App.Op.Br. p. 9.] At the City\u2019s instructions, the thrust blocking, anchor clips and bolts were all removed.

Thereafter by letter dated October 11, 1957 (Exhibit 16, perhaps the most significant exhibit in a rather extensive series of exhibits), Gerwick\u2019s superintendent and project engineer specifically advised the City\u2019s Harbor Engineer that the blocking necessary successfully to pressure test the ten-inch oil pipeline had been removed, even though the Ger-wick supervisor considered such blocking to be imperative to the safety of the line, because without it the line would separate at the coupling under conditions of normal use. [Finding (14).] In fact, the City\u2019s own inspector told this to his superior [B..T. 560].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-16\">\u201c12. The City received such letter, the Chief Harbor Engineer and his assistant discussed it, and thereafter the City did nothing until May of 1957. [App.Op. Br. p. 10.] At that time, the City installed sway bracing at Bent No. 225 on the ten-inch oil pipeline which was markedly different in characteristics and effect from the thrust blocking Gerwiek had previously installed when the pipeline passed the pressure test, and which had thereafter been removed at the City\u2019s request. [Findings (15) and (26) (p) and (q).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-18\">\u201c13.

[Finding (26) (s).]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-19\">\u201c14. After being put in operation, the pipeline was used precisely four times for bunkering ships with oil north of Bent No. 213, commencing on July 3, 1957.
