The taxpayer\u2019s average sales price of the sales actually made in bulk form, which constituted a substantial portion of the taxpayer\u2019s total sales, may be treated as the representative market price of salt of like kind and grade to the taxpayer\u2019s salt. 40 T.C. 359 (1963). We have nothing <em>to </em>add to Judge Mulroney\u2019s opinion. The decision is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
