Chem.Soc. (London), Yol. of 1946, pp. 1126-1131.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">That article relates to preparation of alkyl- and aryl- substituted fluorides of sulfur, selenium and tellurium, with the following portions'particularly pertinent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AyZ\">\u201cThe fluorides of sulfur, selenium, and tellurium show decided differences from the other halides of these elements. For instance, in all three cases the maximum covalency of 6 is reached in combination with fluorine, but not with the other halogens, even at low temperatures. The hexafluorides are exceptionally stable, whereas the other halides, including the fluorides, easily hydrolyse and dissociate when heated. Indeed, some doubt exists as to the formation of lower fluorides of selenium and tellurium. Considerable interest, therefore, attaches to the preparation and properties of the alkyl- and aryl- substituted fluorides of these elements. Experiments are described below which seem to show that substituted hexafluorides such as RSF5 are not stable * * *. ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-8\">\u201cExperimental.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-9\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-10\"><em>\u201cFluorination of the Substituted Dihalides. </em>\u2014 No fluorine derivatives in this series were isolated. Attempts were made to replace chlorine by fluorine in PhSCl, o-N02.CgH4.-SC1, o-N02.C6H4. SBr, and p-N02.-CgH4.SC1, with silver, mercurous, mercuric, and hydrogen fluoride. All these substances reacted with the metallic fluorides, but the product always consisted mostly of the corresponding disulphide, mixed with tarry matter containing some fluorine * * *.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-12\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-13\"><em>\u201cHigher-substituted </em>Fluorides.\u2014 No analogues of the compounds SRF3, SRF5 and SeRFs exist for the other halogens. It was therefore necessary to choose methods of preparation other than by way of the usual metal fluorides or hydrogen fluoride. Experiments were made on the following lines: (1) The action of Grignard reagents upon sul-phur tetra- and hexa-fluoride. (2) The action of fluorine, or phenyli-odonium fluoride, upon the organic disulphides and diselenides.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b295-14\">\u201c(1) Gaseous sulphur hexafluoride bubbled through an ethereal solution of phenylmagnesium bromide did not react below the b.p. of ether.

Stability increases from fluorine to iodine. (2) Stability increases in all the halides with the number of organic radicals in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>molecule, and most noticeably in the fluorides. (3) Stability increases from sulphur to tellurium.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-4\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-5\">\u201c* * -x- The results of the attempts to fluorinate the phenyl sul-phur halides can be explained as follows: The phenyl sulphur fluoride first formed disproportionated to a mixture of the disulphide and a higher fluoride [e. g., p-NO2.CeH4.SF to (P-NO2. C6H4. S) 2 and p-N02. C6H4. SF3 or p-NO2.CeH4.SF5]; the latter then decomposed by intermolecular condensations to hydrogen fluoride and tarry products. * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">The examiner rejected claims 2 and 3 over Emeleus, stating that the claimed compounds differ from the reference compound, p-NO2.CeH4.SF5, in that they contain either no substituent on the phenyl group (as in phenylsulfur pentafluoride), or some substitutent other than a nitro group (as in the Markush grouping set forth in claim 2). He regarded the claimed compounds as \u201cunpatentable analogs\u201d of the nitro compound of Em-eleus, since the \u201cnitro group is as close to some of the members of the Markush group as they are to each other.\u201d Presumably the statutory basis for the examiner\u2019s rejection is 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">After observing that halogen is a member of the Markush group set forth by appellant, the board affirmed the examiner\u2019s rejection of claim 2 <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> on Emeleus. It noted \u201cthe analogy between a nitro group and a chloro group as a substituent has long been recognized,\u201d citing In re Taub, 125 F.2d 719, 29 CCPA 893. In response to appellant\u2019s argument that his compounds are stable, whereas the reference compounds are described as being unstable, the board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-9\">\u201c * * * in view of the great variety of compounds that are described by appellant as being very stable it seems highly unlikely that only the nitro variant would be unstable even if it were pure. If in fact there is a difference in stability it can with reason only be attributed to differences in the mode of preparation resulting either in differing kinds and/or degrees of impurity * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b296-12\">On the basis of its own study of Em-eleus, the board also regarded the reference to anticipate claim 3, hence claim 2, under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a), reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-13\">\u201c * * * the p-nitro phenylsulfur pentafluoride compound mentioned * * * is merely exemplary of results obtained by the experiments described * * * in the paragraph entitled, \u2018Fluorination of the Substituted Dihalides.\u2019 * * * [That paragraph] does not mention any sulfur pentafiuorides but states that attempted fluorination of phenyl-sulfur chloride and p-nitrophenyl sulfur chloride with metallic fluorides yielded corresponding disulfides and a tarry matter and hydrogen fluoride. * * * [The \u201cDiscussion\u201d portion of Emeleus] has a more detailed explanation in some respects and states that it is a \u2018higher fluoride\u2019 which decomposes to yield the hydrogen fluoride and tarry products and that this higher fluoride could be a phenyl sulfur pentafluoride. Appellant has not denied that such a pentafluoride is obtained, and, this being the case, we must assume that the experiments yielded phenyl sulfur pentafluoride as well as the p-nitro compound. The reference clearly teaches one skilled in the art the possible existence of phenyl sulfur pentafluoride just as well as it teaches that of the nitro compound.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-15\">* * -x- * * -x-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b296-16\">\u201c * * * We have made it clear that the compound of claim 3 is explicitly taught by Emeleus et al. and we, accordingly, hold that claims 2 and 3 are unpatentable over the reference for this reason also. Their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>allowance would be contrary to 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) * *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">With that background information, we must determine the correctness of the rejections of claims 2 and 3 under 102(a) and claim 2 under 103. From our evaluation of the record we are inclined to conclude that the board erred in both instances.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">We begin by agreeing with the board that Emeleus \u201cteaches one skilled in the art the possible existence of phenyl sulfur pentafluoride just as well as it teaches that of the nitro compound.\u201d Emeleus says \u201call these substances,\u201d referring to PhSCl and p-NO2.C0H4.SCl, reacted with the designated fluorinating agents. It seems to us that a person of ordinary skill in the art could fairly expect those compounds to follow a similar hypothetical reaction path. Thus, under \u201cDiscussion\u201d Emeleus states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-9\">\u201c* * * The results of the attempts to fluorinate the phenyl sulfur halides can be explained as follows : The phenyl sulfur fluoride first formed disproportionated to a mixture of the disulphide and a higher fluoride [e. g., p-NO2.C0H4.SF to (p-N02.C6H4.S)2 and p-N02.C6H4.-SF3 <em>or </em>p-NO2.C0H4.SF5]; <em>the latter then decomposed </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">If we regard Emeleus as suggesting that the corresponding unsubstituted compound, CoHoSCl (PhSCl), undergoes a similar reaction, the disclosure in effect says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-13\">\u201c* * * [CeH5.SF to (CoH5.S)2 and CoHs.SFs <em>or </em>C6HB.SF5]; <em>the latter then decomposed </em>* * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-14\">(All emphasis supplied)</p>\n<p id=\"b297-15\">However, we reach an opposite conclusion than the board that phenyl sulfur pentafluoride disclosed in that manner is <em>an enabling disclosure </em>of the claimed invention within our understanding of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a). We agree with appellant that the board erred in concluding that either p-NO2.C0H4.SF5 or CoHs. SF5 is \u201cexplicitly taught\u201d by Emeleus. We find that teaching to be less than unequivocal, noting that he states that p-NO2.C0H4.SF3 <em>or </em>p-NO2.C0H4.SF5 is believed to be formed. Indeed, the board\u2019s language in its initial opinion indicates its uncertainty on that point as well as on the part of Emeleus. The board stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-18\">\u201c * * * [Emeleus] states that it is a \u2018higher fluoride\u2019 which decomposes * * * and that this higher fluoride <em>could be </em>a phenyl sulfur pentafluoride. * * * The reference clearly teaches one skilled in the art the <em>possible </em>existence of phenyl sulfur pentafluoride * * (Emphasis supplied)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-21\">In its decision on reconsideration, the board said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b297-22\">\u201cSuch words as \u2018could\u2019 and \u2018possible\u2019 were used by us merely because the authors of the reference were not certain that the named compounds were actually obtained * * *. We are not aware of any decision which requires that the author of a reference must be certain that a compound is obtained for that reference to be a valid one.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b297-23\">The uncertainty which pervades the teaching of the reference leads \u00abus to conclude that Emeleus cannot properly be held an enabling disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-24\">A further reason why the board erred in concluding CoHs.SFs is \u201cexplicitly taught,\u201d is that the Emeleus disclosure is not sufficient to place the public in possession of the invention. Emeleus has expressly stated that at least p-N02.C6H4. SF3 or p-NO2.C0H4.SF5, both postulated transient intermediates, decompose to form tarry products. In the \u201cExperimental\u201d portion of the reference, Emeleus asserts an inability to isolate any fluorine derivatives which might have resulted from the reaction of the substituted dihalides with the designated fluorinating agents. Further on, under \u201cHigher-substituted Fluorides,\u201d Emeleus indicates a complete lack of success in preparation of pentafluorides by (1) the reaction of Grignard reagents upon sulfur hexafluo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>ride (2) the action of fluorine upon organic disulphides.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It is clear to us from our study of Emeleus that it was beyond the author\u2019s skill as a chemist to alter the reaction conditions or reactants in order to make a stable pentafluoride. No other evidence appears in the record before us which shows that a person of ordinary skill in the art, upon reading Emeleus, would be able to combine the teachings of that article with his own knowledge of this art to obtain possession of appellant\u2019s <em>stable </em>arylsulfur pentafluorides.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">Most of the cases cited by the solicitor in support of the Patent Office position that Emeleus discloses the claimed invention within the meaning of 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(a) were considered by us in In re LeGrice, 301 F.2d 929, 942-943, 49 CCPA 1124, 1142-1144. As noted there, explicit or implicit in all those cases is the concept of a certain degree of knowledge possessed by one skilled in the arts involved, to the end that such knowledge, taken with the disclosure of the printed publications, was sufficient to place the disclosed invention in the possession of the public. We think In re Doyle, 327 F.2d 513, 51 CCPA 993, and In re Fried, 329 F.2d 323, 51 CCPA 1118, cited by the solicitor in addition to those considered in LeGrice, are of the same nature and are not controlling. Cf. In re Brown, 329 F.2d 1006, 51 CCPA 1254; E. I. DuPont deNemours &amp; Co. v. Ladd, 117 U.S.App.D.C. 246, 328 F.2d 547. We have no such explicit or implicit knowledge shown in the record here. The Emeleus article is not so particular and definite that, without undue experimentation, one versed in the art to which it pertains could gain possession of the claimed subject matter. Under the circumstances we feel obliged to reverse the rejection of claims 2 and 3 under 35 U.S. C. \u00a7 102(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">REJECTION UNDER 35 U.S.C.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">\u00a7 103</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">In finding the compounds of claim 2, particularly the chloro derivative, un-patentable over the p-nitro phenyl sulfur pentafluoride \u201cdisclosed\u201d by Emeleus, the board relied on, erroneously, we think, In re Taub as authority for reaching the conclusion that the two substituents are analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-11\">In Taub, this court sustained the conclusion of the examiner that nitro and chloro substituents \u201care considered to be equivalents in a molecule of the size claimed, <em>in the absence of a showing or unexpected properties in the chloro product.\u201d </em>(Emphasis supplied) The compounds in Taub were quaternary ammonium salts in which four hydrocarbon groups, one a chloro-benzyl radical, were attached to the nitrogen atom. The prior art disclosed the same compound except a nitro-benzyl group was attached to the nitrogen atom. Both compounds were useful as fungicides, and it was not shown the compounds differed in effectiveness.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-12\">Here, however, Emeleus states that the postulated nitro derivative is unstable and decomposes. Appellant, on the other hand, discloses that arylsulfur pentafluorides having specific substituents are stable chemically and thermally. The prior art neither suggested that arylsul-fur pentafluorides would be stable, nor was it aware of that desirable property. Indeed, Emeleus would lead one skilled in the art to the opposite conclusion when it states \u201cExperiments * * * seem to show that substituted hexafluorides such as RSF5 are not stable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-13\">The board speculated that the instability of Emeleus\u2019 compounds can only be due to impurities. As appellant points out, Emeleus does not give that reason as the source of instability. The whole tenor of Emeleus leads one of ordinary skill in the art to believe instability is due to the nature of the compounds rather than outside factors. It appears to us that only by hindsight could the board conclude \u201cit seems highly unlikely that only the nitro variant would be unstable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b298-14\">Based on our evaluation of the record and understanding of the chemistry in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>volved, we are inclined to agree with appellant that the board erred in its interpretation of, and rejection on, the Em-eleus reference. Should there be doubt on that score we feel obliged to resolve it in favor of appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">The decision is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b294-26\">.
