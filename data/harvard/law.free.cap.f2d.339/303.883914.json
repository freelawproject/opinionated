Mueller and his wife Lucille Mueller, residents of Illinois, brought suit against defendant Cities Service Oil Company, a Delaware corporation, to recover damages arising out of a collision between an automobile driven by Le Roy Mueller and a truck driven by Porter C. Arneson.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-14\">A jury trial resulted in a verdict and judgment for defendant. Plaintiffs appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">The accident occurred on December 8, 1960 at a rural intersection of two gravel roads in Kendall County, Illinois. Arne-son was killed as a result of the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">Plaintiffs alleged in their complaint, <em>inter alia, </em>that Arneson was the agent and servant of defendant, Arneson was negligent and such negligence was the proximate cause of the accident and resulting injuries to Le Roy Mueller. Le Roy Mueller sought $75,000 for his injuries and Lucille Mueller $25,000 for loss of services and consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-17\">Defendant defended on the grounds that Arneson was an independent contractor and not an agent or servant of defendant, Arneson was not negligent and Le Roy Mueller was guilty of contributory negligence which proximately caused the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-18\">The trial court submitted the issues of agency, negligence and contributory negligence to the jury. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of defendant. No interrogatories were submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-19\">On appeal, plaintiffs contend the trial court erred in submitting the question of agency to the jury, in rulings on the admissibility of evidence and in instructing the jury. Plaintiffs further contend they were denied a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-20\">The Illinois Supreme Court in Darner v. Colby, 375 Ill. 558, 31 N.E.2d 950 (1941) set out the Illinois law applicable in determining whether a person is an independent contractor or an agent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-21\">\u201c* -* * [The status] depends upon the contract between the parties and their relationship as shown by the evidence. Each case must depend upon its own facts. Generally no one feature of the relation is determinative but all must be construed together. * * * -x- * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-24\">\u201cAn independent contractor is one who renders service in accordance with the will of the person for whom the work is done, only as to the result of the work and not as to the means by which it is accomplished. * * * Where one undertakes to produce a given result without being in any way controlled as to the method by which he attains <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>it, he is considered an independent contractor rather than an employee. * * -x- where the one employed to do the work, in the course of which the injury occurs, is free to exercise his own judgment and discretion as to the means and appliances which he may see proper to employ in so doing, entirely exclusive of the control and direction of the party for whom the work is being done, he is deemed in law an independent contractor. * * * The right to control the manner of doing the work is of principal importance in the consideration of the question whether the worker is an employee or an independent contractor. * * * The test is in the right to control and not the fact of whether actual interference with the method of doing the work is shown by the evidence. If the person for whom the work is being done retains the right to control the manner in which the work is to be done, the relation of employer and employee exists. * * * \u201d (Citations omitted.) Id. at 560-561, 31 N.E.2d at 951-952.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">The contract in the instant case stated that defendant was \u201cengaged in the refining and marketing of gasolenes, oils, greases and other petroleum products, and the marketing of automotive accessories.\u201d Arneson, designated throughout the contract as \u201cconsignee,\u201d was \u201cin possession of a bulk station * * * suitable for the receipt, storage and distribution of such products to customers for resale or consumption.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b361-11\">Defendant agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-12\">\u201c1.

CONSIGNEE agrees that he will comply with all laws, regulations, and orders of duly constituted state and federal authorities in respect to employment.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A4y\">The evidence at the trial indicated the terms of the contract were complied with by both parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-13\">The evidence further showed defendant paid expenses incurred in maintaining the bulk plant and paid the costs of delivery of its products to the bulk plant. Defendant did not withhold income tax or contribute social security on any payments to Arneson. Arneson and his wife filed joint income tax returns for the oil business. Arneson paid the entire social security tax. Arneson worked only when he wanted to and went hunting and fishing whenever he chose. Arneson owned the truck involved in the accident and paid the expenses of operating it. Ame-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>son bought tires, batteries and accessories from defendant and resold them to his customers at prices determined by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">Plaintiffs rely on Darner v. Colby, supra, and contend that Arneson was an agent or employee of defendant as a matter of law. However, the facts in Darner are materially different from the instant ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">In Darner, the contract was designated \u201cConditions of Employment,\u201d and the word \u201cemployment\u201d was used in the contract rather than the word \u201cconsignee\u201d as in the present case. Id. at 561-562, 31 N.E.2d at 952. In Darner, the tank-truck owner was \u201crequired to devote his entire time and attention to his employment and to operate at least one truck every day except Sunday, or to hire a substitute.\u201d Id. at 563, 31 N.E.2d at 952. There, the tank-truck owner was under the supervision of a divisional manager for the company and \u201cwhenever a violation of the regulations of the company as to the manner of conducting the business occurred, it was his [divisional manager] business to call the matter to * * * [the tank-truck owner\u2019s] attention.\u201d Id. at 563, 31 N.E.2d at 953.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">While the designation in the contract of tank-truck owners as, <em>e. g., </em>\u201cconsignee,\u201d or \u201cemployee\u201d is not binding on the court, it is a factor to be considered. See Hartley v. Red Ball Transit Co., 344 Ill. 534, 540-541, 176 N.E. 751 (1931). The fact that defendant in this case did not withhold or pay income or social security taxes on Arneson is also a fact to be considered. Westlund v. Kewanee Public Service Company, 11 Ill.App.2d 10, 24, 136 N.E.2d 263, 270 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">Upon careful examination of the facts in the instant case, we are convinced there was sufficient evidence indicating that Arneson was an independent contractor to justify the district court\u2019s refusal of plaintiffs\u2019 request to instruct the jury as a matter of law that Arneson was an agent of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">Plaintiffs contend they were denied a fair trial because of the presence of Mrs. Arneson in the courtroom throughout the trial. We disagree. Mrs. Arneson worked with her husband in connection with his agreement with defendant and took over his business after he was killed. She had knowledge of the relationship between Arneson and defendant and was properly designated by defendant to be its representative in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-10\">Plaintiffs assert the jury was prejudiced when defendant asked Mrs. Arneson, while she was testifying as a defense witness, \u201cDo you have litigation pending in the State court in which you are plaintiff suing Mr. Mueller on behalf of the estate of your deceased husband ?\u201d Plaintiffs objected before Mrs. Arneson could answer. The objection was sustained and the jury instructed to disregard the question. In this context, we hold the question asked did not prejudice the jury against plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-11\">Plaintiffs argue the district court erred in denying a mistrial on the ground that they were prejudiced because Mrs. Arneson became emotional in the presence of the jury. The district court, out of the presence of the jury, stated, \u201cI would not characterize what happened on the witness stand as a breaking down. She uttered no sound. She answered all questions put to her. I don\u2019t think she broke down.\u201d The district court observed the witness and we accept its finding on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-12\"> We find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 assertions of prejudicial error by the district court\u2019s refusal to instruct the jury that one of plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys had to withdraw from the case due to circumstances beyond his control and its failure to exclude defense witnesses from the courtroom. It appears from the record that plaintiffs made no motion to exclude witnesses until after all plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses had testified. We find no abuse of discretion by the district court in denying this motion and refusing to give such an instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>Plaintiffs also urge the district court \u2022committed prejudicial and reversible error in rulings on evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">Plaintiffs argue an expert witness of defendant invaded the province of the jury by being permitted to answer hypothetical questions concerning stopping \u2022distance and comparative speed of two \u2022colliding vehicles of different weights based upon their angle of deflection.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">Defendant\u2019s expert witness was asked, \u201cOn a dry day, what would the distance required be for a 1958 Cadillac with power brakes traveling at a speed of 20 miles an hour \u2014 in other words, how many feet would it take to stop that car at that speed from the time the brakes were applied until the car came to a stop?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Plaintiffs objected that the hypothetical question made \u201cno showing of the type of gravel, the size of the gravel, the looseness of the gravel, the compactness of the gravel, the climatic conditions, [and] weather conditions.\u201d We find no error in the overruling of this objection. Prior to being asked this question, the expert witness was shown a photograph of the road at the scene of the accident. The witness testified the road was what \u201cis generally spoken of as a graded and compacted gravel surfaced road.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">Plaintiffs argue that the witness\u2019s answer (\u201cAfter the brakes have locked the wheels, it would require about 27 feet to bring the vehicle to a stop.\u201d) to this question decided the issue of negligence for the jury since plaintiff testified he was fifty to sixty feet from the intersection when he first saw defendant\u2019s truck. We disagree. It does not invade the province of the jury to apprise it of facts or opinions, not within the knowledge of men of ordinary experience, which, if believed, will be the basis for the jury\u2019s decision on an issue. See Clifford-Jacobs Forging Co. v. Industrial Com\u2019n, 19 Ill.2d 236, 242-244, 166 N.E. 2d 582, 586-587 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">This expert witness was further asked, \u201c[A]ssume in the last setup that you had there that the vehicle that is in the horizontal weighed about 13,500 pounds and the vehicle in the verticle weighed about 4,700 pounds, and they deflected in a 45 degree angle after impact; what would that mean as to the speed of this vehicle ?\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b364-12\">Objection was made and overruled and the witness answered, \u201c * * * The speeds of the two vehicles would, as we say, be inversely proportionate to the weights. In other words, the weight of the truck was about 2}4 times roughly the weight of the car. Then to deflect each other equally, the car would have to have about two and a half times the speed of the truck.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b364-13\">Plaintiffs urge that the undisputed evidence in the record shows the truck was going forty-five to fifty miles per hour and plaintiffs\u2019 vehicle twenty-five to thirty miles per hour and the hypothetical question must be based on these facts. We hold that where plaintiff is the only eyewitness to the accident, expert testimony of this nature is proper. See Lofton v. Agee, 8 Cir., 303 F.2d 287 (1962) and Campbell v. Clark, 10 Cir., 283 F.2d 766 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-14\">We find no merit in plaintiffs\u2019 contentions that the district court committed reversible error in its rulings on cross-examination and redirect examination of plaintiffs\u2019 witness Sheriff Willman.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-15\">Finally, plaintiffs assert the district court erred in instructing the jury concerning the definition of independent contractor. We have examined the instruction and find it to be a proper definition of the term as it is defined by the Illinois courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-16\">We have considered all contentions of plaintiffs and hold none constitutes re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>versible error and that plaintiffs were given a fair trial of their case.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-4\">The judgment appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. As best we can determine from the record, in using the words \u201chorizontal\u201d and \u201cvertical\u201d in this question, reference was being made either to a diagram exhibited to the witness or to some portion of prior testimony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
