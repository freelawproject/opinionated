The chattel mortgage on the bankrupt\u2019s property was executed and delivered on April 27, 1959 but was not filed until July 6, 1961; and the trustee sought to succeed to the allegedly superior claims of creditors that arose in the two year period between the date of execution and delivery and the date of filing, none of these creditors having any notice of the chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">Prior to the 1960 amendment of section 230 of the New York Lien Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol.Laws, c. 33, this chattel mortgage would be void against the mortgagor\u2019s creditors arising before the date of late filing, Karst v. Gane, 136 N.Y. 316, 32 N.E. 1073 (1893), and under this law the trustee could have unquestionably voided it. The question then is whether the 1960 amendment of section 230 either had the purpose or effect of changing this law in favor of appellant, the holder of the chattel mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-18\">The text of the 1960 amendment, which is set out in the margin,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is indeed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>ambiguous. Appellant\u2019s strongest argument lies in the language \u201cthe mortgage shall be deemed to be created by the mortgagor as of the time of such [late] filing.\u201d If the chattel mortgage were actually created, i. e., executed and delivered and also filed on July 6, 1961, it would be superior to the claims of the simple creditors being asserted by the trustee; and appellant urges that words \u201cdeemed to be created\u201d achieves this result for that is the date of late filing. Appellant also insists that the words \u201cas against all persons not having notice of such mortgage\u201d could only refer to creditors arising prior to the late filing, since subsequent to and by virtue of the filing all creditors would be deemed by law to have notice. However, appellant\u2019s interpretation does not give the language of section 230 that makes mortgages \u201cabsolutely void * * * unless * * * filed * * * within ten days\u201d its full accord. Nor does it take full account of the words \u201cwithout relation back,\u201d for although these words could mean that the date of \u201cdeemed-creation\u201d should be the date of late filing, as opposed to any earlier date, such as the date of execution and delivery, the usual date of creation if it is filed within the grace period, these words could also mean that the late-filed mortgage should not be deemed to have the effect of nullifying the claims of simple creditors that intervened prior to the date of late filing. Furthermore, the last sentence of the amendment could be given meaning without yielding to appellant\u2019s interpretation. For example, the sentence could apply to the situation where a bona fide subsequent mortgagee files within his ten-day grace period but after the prior mortgagee, whose ten-day grace period already expired, had filed; if the word \u201cnotice\u201d in the last line of the amendment refers to \u201cactual\u201d rather than \u201cconstructive\u201d notice, the subsequent mortgagee would be superior, for since he filed within his grace period he is given the same protection as though he filed on the date of execution and delivery, and the prior mortgagee\u2019s date of creation will be deemed the date of his late filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This textual ambiguity can only be resolved by making some assessment of the purpose of the New York Legislature in enacting this amendment. If the appellant\u2019s interpretation of the amendment were correct, then an oft criticized distinction, deeply imbedded in New York law, between conditional sales agreements and chattel mortgages would be dissolved; according to this distinction a late-filed conditional sales agreement is void only as to bona fide creditors who acquired a lien by levy or attachment before the late filing, N.Y. Personal Property Law, McKinney\u2019s Consol. Laws, c. 41, \u00a7 65, while a late-filed chattel mortgage is vulnerable to all bona fide creditors. However, as Judge Weinfeld maintained, 226 F.Supp. at 778-779, there is no indication that the 1960 amendment sought to remove this notorious distinction in New York commercial law. The purpose of the legislature was more limited \u2014 to change the grace period for filing from a \u201creasonable time\u201d to ten days, not to give a delinquent mortgagee, who even failed to take advantage of the grace period, the option of filing the instrument whenever he pleased without the risk of being subordinate to intervening creditors.
