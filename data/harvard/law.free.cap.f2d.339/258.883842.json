This case has been before us previously. Por<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ter v. United States (5 Cir.1959), 272 F. 2d 695; (5 Cir.1962) 298 F.2d 461.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">The trial court conducted a full, complete and extended hearing at which the appellant was present and was represented by competent counsel. The court examined the transcript of the proceedings, heard the testimony of the attorney who represented the appellant when he was tried and convicted, the testimony of an assistant United States attorney, a United States District Judge, and other witnesses. Following the hearing, the trial court made findings of fact and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">In our opinion, the appellant has not been denied any of his rights, but on the other hand, his case has received full, complete, careful and cautious attention. This litigation should come to an end. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
