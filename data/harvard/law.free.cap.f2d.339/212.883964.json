The plaintiff filed suit in a Texas state court, .alleging that he spent sums in excess of the defendant\u2019s expenditures and asking for reimbursement of half of his expenses. The defendant removed the suit to the Eastern District of Texas and counterclaimed for an accounting and conveyance of one-half of certain allegedly undisclosed leaseholds and for one-half of the amount the defendant alleged that he had spent in excess of the plaintiff\u2019s \u25a0expenditures. The claims of both parties to reimbursement for personal expenses were heard by a master who found that the defendant owed the plaintiff $4,000. The court confirmed this finding, which is not subject to dispute here. The court, however, did not rule on the plaintiff\u2019s original claim for reimbursement or business expenses and, under the impression that the amount had been stipulated in the pre-trial order, entered judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant objected that he had not been given an opportunity to present evidence to contradict the plaintiff. Accordingly, the trial court \u2022ordered the plaintiff to submit an accounting to the defendant who was given a time within which to file specific written \u25a0objections. The defendant filed objections to some sixty items. At the hearing, the trial court declined to entertain the defendant\u2019s evidence on the ground that he had not stated his objections with sufficient specificity.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-10\">Although the defendant\u2019s objections could have been made more specifically, we conclude that the judgment should be reversed for the limited purpose of allow-\u2122g the defendant to submit evidence on the contested items in the account. Accordingly, the judgment below is reversed and remanded with directions that the district court reopen the case to receive evidence from either party bearing on the contested accounting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
