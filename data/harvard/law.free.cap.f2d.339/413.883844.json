One McKinney, a salesman of Virginia-Carolina, owned and operated with its consent a business known ac Planters Supply Company. It had a dealership agreement with Virginia-Carolina for the sale of the latter\u2019s fertilizer. McKinney had the duty as salesman to procure and submit to his employer financial information concerning its dealers. Obviously, the purpose was to permit Virginia-Carolina to fix the credit it would extend each of them</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">In 1962 McKinney reported false and fraudulent data to Virginia-Carolina upon the financial condition of Planters. In this manner he obtained large shipments of fertilizer to Planters on credit. The amounts due or owing therefor were evidenced by notes and open accounts. These proved uncollectible and the net loss of Virginia-Carolina was $96,909.97.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">We agree with the District Court that the loss was protected by the policy. It was not merely an unpaid account receivable ; it was more; it was a loss through the \u201cdishonest act\u201d of an employee. The Court held that the loss consisted of the notes and accounts, properly calling them choses in action. The insurer insisted that \u201cother property\u201d must be construed, under the rule of eiusdem generis, as embracing only \u201ctangible personal property or property otherwise corporeal in nature capable of possession and dominion to the same extent as \u2018Money\u2019 or \u2018Securities\u2019 \u201d. It argued that choses in action were not of this character and not so embraced in the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">We disagree that the loss was comprised of choses in action; we think the actual loss was the fertilizer shipped on the falsely established credit. This difference is immaterial, however, for \u201cother property\u201d included fertilizer. The sums charged therefor and evidenced by the notes and accounts represented the amount of the loss. Nothing in the policy forecloses this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">For the other reasons given by the District Judge in his oral opinion from the bench, we affirm the judgment now on review.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
