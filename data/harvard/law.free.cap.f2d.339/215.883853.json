In his charge to the jury the trial judge reviewed the evidence and the applicable principles of Pennsylvania law and reached the conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to support a finding of negligence on the part of the defendant. He accordingly directed the verdict on which the judgment appealed from was entered. Our review of the evidence and the law satisfies us that the action of the trial judge was right for the reasons given in his charge, to which we need add nothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-20\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
