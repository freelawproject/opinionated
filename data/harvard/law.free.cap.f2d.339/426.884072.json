Libelant California Tanker Company entered into a written contract with respondent Todd Shipyards Corporation for certain repairs on the vessel \u201cClarke\u2019s Wharf\u201d. During the performance of the contract Thomas Guinto, an employee of Todd, was injured. In the civil action brought by Guinto against the shipowner Todd was impleaded as a third-party defendant. After a trial on the merits the trial judge found no negligence and no unseaworthiness of the vessel and both the complaint and the cross-complaint were dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-18\">This proceeding in admiralty is for recovery of counsel fees and expenses in the defense of the action brought by Guinto, Todd having refused to undertake the defense of the charges against the shipowner.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-19\">The principal issue litigated was whether or not Todd had undertaken to indemnify the shipowner. The Invitation to Bid, issued by the shipowner contained \u201cGeneral Terms and Conditions,\u201d with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-20\">\u201cThese General Terms and Conditions shall control in the event of any conflicting provisions contained in the Invitation to Bid, the Bid, Letter of Acceptance and Specifications.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-21\">* * * -* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b483-22\">\u201c9. The Contractor shall indemnify and save the Owner harmless from all claims, suits, damages, costs or demands of any kind, by third parties for death, personal injury and property damage to which Owner or the vessel may be subjected arising or growing out of performance of the work by the Contractor, its servants, agents or subcontractors.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b483-23\">A separate document labeled \u201cSpecifications\u201d set forth the work to be done. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Todd accepted the bid \u201cSubject to the conditions printed herein.\u201d On the right and toward the top of the letter of acceptance is the following, printed in red ink and in such small type as to require a magnifying glass to read it:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">\u201cIn connection with the accident and/or indemnity and/or insurance clauses, if any, contained in your specifications, relating to liability for personal injuries, please note that we do not agree to same, in so far as they undertake to impose any liability or any obligations to take out or maintain insurance beyond the liabilities or the obligations to insure imposed upon us by law.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">This is part of what is called, in Appellant\u2019s Brief, Todd\u2019s \u201cstandard red-letter clause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">It is clear that the indemnity clause in the General Terms and Conditions of the Invitation to Bid was not abrogated. The legal standard of interpretation of the document is one of strictness against the party who not only prepared the wording of the clause in question but contrived the reproduction of it in such fine print as to be readable only by the use of a magnifying glass. See, e. g., North American Graphite Corp. v. Allan, 1950, 87 U.S. App.D.C. 154, 184 F.2d 387, 390; United States v. Braunstein, S.D.N.Y., 1947, 75 F.Supp. 137, 140; Henningsen v. Bloomfield Motors, Inc., N. J., 1960, 32 N.J. 358, 161 A.2d 69, 73-74, 92-94, 75 A.L.R.2d 1; Siegelman v. Cunard White Star, Ltd., 2 Cir., 1955, 221 F.2d 189, 202-203 (Frank, J. dissenting) ; 3 Corbin, Contracts \u00a7 559; Restatement, Contracts \u00a7 236(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-9\">Applying this rule of strict construction Judge Dawson held (S.D.N.Y., 1962, 206 F.Supp. 872, 874) that \u201cthe fine print does not show that it modified the indemnity clause\u201d but merely indicates that Todd does not accept any obligation \u201cto take out or maintain insurance beyond the liabilities or the obligations to insure imposed on us by law.\u201d In any event, the \u201cred-letter clause\u201d referred only to indemnity \u201cclauses,\u201d \u201cif any,\u201d in the Specifications and there is no such clause in the Specifications. This disposes of Todd\u2019s principal argument for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-11\">Nor is there any merit in Todd\u2019s contentions that the accident in which Guinto was injured was not one \u201carising or growing out of the performance of\u201d the contract, that the legal charges and disbursements were excessive, and that it was an abuse of judicial discretion to allow 6% interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-12\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
