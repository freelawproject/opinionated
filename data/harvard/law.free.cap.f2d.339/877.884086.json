The district court dismissed the complaint for refund of the penalty except to the extent of $90.00 which was conceded to have been erroneously collected. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\"> The Government presented sufficient evidence from which the trial eourt could reasonably find that the plaintiff had knowledge that the withheld tax monies were owed and unpaid and that he preferred other creditors over the Government. The Government also proved, by evidence of plaintiff\u2019s conceded day-to-day control, that he was the person responsible for supervising the payment of tax liabilities and that the penalty was correctly assessed against him. See Flan v. United States, 326 F.2d 356 (7th Cir. 1964). The plaintiff who had the burden of proof as to the amount of the assessment failed to show that the amount assessed by the Commissioner was unreasonable. See Bull v. United States, 295 U.S. 247, 260, 55 S.Ct. 695, 79 L.Ed. 1421 (1935); Yeino v. Fahs, 257 F.2d 364, 367 (5th Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The plaintiff\u2019s alternative argument \u2014 that $551.67 paid to the Government in a Chapter XI proceeding as a dividend toward the Government\u2019s claim of $34,330.81 should be credited against the deficiencies for the particular tax periods here in question \u2014 is likewise without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b933-15\">. \u201cAny person who willfully fails to pay, collect, or truthfully account for and pay over the tax imposed by section 2700(a), or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall, in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty of the amount of the tax evaded, or not paid, collected, or accounted for and paid over, to be assessed and collected in the same manner as taxes are as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>sessed and collected. No penalty shall be assessed under this subsection for any offense for which a penalty may be assessed under authority of section 3612.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b934-7\">FRIENDLY, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AdX\">(concurring) :</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">I concur. I do not understand the opinion to disapprove Judge Levet\u2019s conclusion that the taxpayer had the burden with respect to all elements of the case. See, <em>accord, </em>Chief Judge Hincks\u2019 opinion in Kellems v. United States, 97 F.Supp. 681, 686 (D.Conn.1951).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
