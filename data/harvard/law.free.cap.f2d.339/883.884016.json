Whether the Kansas statutes have such cumulative effect is a matter of state law and raises no federal issue cognizable under habeas corpus. Petitioner makes no claim that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>dual good time has been granted to others as a matter of right and denied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The trial court did not err in dismissing the application and the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
