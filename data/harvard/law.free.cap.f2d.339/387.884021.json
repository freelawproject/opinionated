We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\">1. 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1424(a) grants jurisdiction to the District Court of Guam over \u201ccauses in Guam, jurisdiction over which has not been transferred by the legislature to other court or courts established by it.\u201d With specific regard to tax litigation, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421i(h) provides in subsection (1) that \u201cthe District Court of Guam shall have exclusive original jurisdiction over all judicial proceedings in Guam * * * with respect to the Guam Territorial income tax.\u201d Both of these jurisdictional grants appear to include suits to redetermine Territorial income tax deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Despite these provisions, the District Court of Guam concluded that it lacked jurisdiction because subsection (2) of section 1421i(h) expressly authorizes suits against the government of Guam for the recovery of income tax already paid, but is silent as to pre-assessment suits; and because certain letters which passed between the Departments of the Treasury and the Interior indicated that a consent to suits of the latter type was omitted from the draft of section 1421i (h) submitted to Congress because the Department of the Treasury opposed it. Forbes v. Maddox, 212 F.Supp. 662 (D.C. Guam 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">So far as the language of section 1421i (h) is concerned, subsection (2) does not purport to limit the general jurisdictional grant of subsection (1) in any way, but rather is simply a waiver of the government of Guam\u2019s immunity from suit which the Congress thought was made necessary by this court\u2019s decision in Crain v. Government of Guam, 195 F.2d 414 (9th Cir. 1952). See S.Rep. No. 2176, U.S.Code &amp; Admin.News (85th Cong.2d Sess. (1958)) 3647, 3653. In any event, no limiting implication can be drawn from the omission from subsection (2) of section 1421i(h) of an authorization of pre-assessment redetermination suits against the Guam government, since suits of this kind were already authorized by section 19700 of the Government Code of Guam, adopted by the Guam legislature five months prior to the passage of 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421i(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">No inference as to the intent of Congress can be drawn from the exchange between the Departments of the Treasury and the Interior. We are told (and it is not disputed) that the correspondence \u201cremained entirely within the Executive Branch,\u201d and nothing in the legislative history indicates that Congress was aware of it. This material aside, there is nothing to suggest that Congress intended to exclude preassessment suits from the jurisdiction of the District Court of Guam. The likelihood is to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-9\">On earlier occasions Congress indicated its awareness of the vital practical importance to taxpayers of the availability of review prior to payment. Flora v. United States, 362 U.S. 145, 158-159, 80 S.Ct. 630, 4 L.Ed.2d 623 (1960). See also Bromberg v. Ingling, 300 F.2d 859, 860 (9th Cir. 1962). And by expressly providing that subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 is part of Guam\u2019s tax law (48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421(d) (1)), the Congress which enacted section 1421i(h) disclosed its intention that such review was to be available to those subject to the Guam tax. The Tax Court of the United States has no jurisdiction in such cases (Dudley v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 182 (3d Cir. 1958)), and vesting jurisdiction in the District Court of Guam was the most obvious alternative.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-10\">Finally, following the enactment of 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421i(h), section 19700 of the Guam Government Code was formally submitted to Congress pursuant to 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1423i, and was not annulled within a year. It is therefore \u201cdeemed to have been approved\u201d by Congress. Since this section not only specifically authorizes the filing of petitions for re-determination in the District Court of Guam (as we have noted), but also expressly provides that the District Court of Guam shall have the same jurisdiction with respect to the Guam income tax as the Tax Court of the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>has with respect to the United States income tax, its \u201capproval\u201d by Congress affords at least some support for the conclusion that 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1421(h) (2) was not intended to establish the contrary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-4\">2. Moreover, we think section 19700 in itself provides an adequate basis for jurisdiction of pre-assessment suits.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">As we have said, section 19700 in so many words authorizes the District Court of Guam to entertain such suits, and we believe it to be a lawful exercise of the power vested by Congress in the Guam legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Congress has given the legislature of Guam power to act with respect to \u201call subjects of legislation of local application not inconsistent with the provisions 0f * * * the laws of the United States applicable to Guam.\u201d 48 U.S.C.A. '\u00a7 1423a.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">Legislation authorizing suits challenging deficiency determinations under the Territorial income tax would seem preeminently \u201cof local application.\u201d The tax itself is a local Territorial tax (Wilson v. Kennedy, 232 F.2d 153, 154 (9th Cir. 1956) ; Laguana v. Ansell, 212 F.2d 207 (9th Cir. 1954), affirming 102 F. Supp. 919, 922 (D.C.Guam 1952) ; Jennings v. United States, 168 F.Supp. 781, 784, 144 Ct.Cl. 28 (1958); see also Dudley v. Commissioner, 258 F.2d 182, 185, 186 (3d Cir. 1958)), and an enactment granting the District Court of Guam jurisdiction to review deficiencies asserted under that tax comes clearly within the category of \u201claws growing out of the needs of the Islands and governing relations within them.\u201d Granville-Smith v. Granville-Smith, 349 U.S. 1, 10, 75 S.Ct. 553, 558, 99 L.Ed. 773 (1955). That Congress intended to authorize the Guam legislature to act in this respect is indicated by references to the exercise of such power in 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1421i(h) (5) and 1424.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-9\">We note that in Dudley v. Commissioner, supra, 258 F.2d at 188, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit assumed the legality of a statute (5 Virgin Islands Code \u00a7\u00a7 943-4) similar to section 19700, which was enacted by the Virgin Islands legislature in the exercise of legislative power identical to that conferred upon the Guam legislature by section 1423a. See 48 U.S.C. \u00a7 1574(a) (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">The second requirement imposed by 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1423a for a valid enactment by the legislature of Guam \u2014 that it be \u201cnot inconsistent with\u201d other laws of the United States applicable to Guam\u2014 is likewise satisfied by section 19700. We have found no other federal statute inconsistent with section 19700, and indeed, as we have said, 48 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 1421i(h) (1) and 1424(a) are themselves affirmative, independent grants of the same jurisdiction as that conferred by section 19700.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">Reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
