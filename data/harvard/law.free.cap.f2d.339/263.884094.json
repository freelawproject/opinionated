The Other issue before us concerns remarks by counsel for the plaintiff during his summation. From our own study of the transcript, we are satisfied that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
