He was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months on each of the three counts, the sentences to run concurrently. The trial court sus<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>pended nine months of the sentence on Count 1 and the entire sentence on Counts 2 and 3, but the appellant was ordered to serve three months of the sentence on Count 1. A fine of $1,500.00 was also imposed. On appeal he specifies a number of errors, primarily relating to the unfairness which he alleges resulted from excessive participation by the trial judge in the questioning of witnesses and from his inaccurate characterization of the evidence. Defendant also asserts that the trial court erred in unduly restricting cross-examination of the Government agent by his counsel and in denying his counsel access to certain documents in the possession of the Government. After a careful review of the record, we conclude that the defendant\u2019s contentions are without merit, and we affirm the conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">We do not find anything in the record, considered as a whole, which clearly indicates that the trial judge, in his questioning of the defendant, conveyed an impression to the jury that he was prejudiced against the defendant, disliked him, or believed that he was guilty. While the trial judge in a criminal case must be abundantly careful to refrain from becoming an advocate for the Government or from indicating a dislike or disbelief of any witness, particularly the defendant, he also has the prerogative \u2014 and often the duty \u2014 to insure that the facts are accurately brought out.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>In the instant ease the trial judge vigorously questioned the defendant while he was on the witness stand, but there is not a clear showing that prejudice resulted from the judge\u2019s interrogations. For example, the Government\u2019s evidence had strongly indicated that no income tax return had been filed in the defendant\u2019s name for the years in question. Shortly before the defendant testified, his brother, who had been associated in business with the defendant, emphatically denied that he had ever filed, agreed to file, or assumed any responsibility whatever with respect to the income tax returns or taxes of the defendant. When defendant took the stand, he testified that he knew his brother had filed returns and paid defendant\u2019s income taxes in each of those years. The trial judge vigorously examined defendant about this statement and warned him of the penalties for perjury.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Defendant now asserts that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>cross-examination by the court conveyed to the jury the impression that the court felt that defendant was unworthy of belief. While the court\u2019s incisive interrogation of defendant on this point may well have been overzealous, if the dialogue between court and defendant is read in the context of the whole trial, we do not feel that it demonstrates the clear showing of prejudice which is necessary to establish an abuse of the trial judge\u2019s discretion in examining the defendant. See, e. g., Kowalsky v. United States (5 Cir. 1961) 290 F.2d 161. The witness had been somewhat recalcitrant and his answers evasive, and the record indicates that the trial judge was generally considerate of the defendant and his counsel, and maintained an attitude of fairness and impartiality. Furthermore, the court carefully instructed the jury that the accused is presumed innocent and that it is the jury\u2019s exclusive prerogative to resolve factual disputes and determine the credibility of witnesses.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition, we think the evidence was more than ample to sustain a conviction, even though proof of wilfulness could only be established by circumstantial evidence in the instant case. See United States v. Earnhardt (7 Cir. 1946) 153 F.2d 472. We also observe that the appellant\u2019s counsel interposed no objection to this colloquy between appellant and the trial court, and that he requested no special instructions relating to the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-23\"> The appellant also charges that the trial court committed error in its biased and inaccurate characterization of the evidence. We have carefully examined the record and find no error in this regard.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant also asserts er<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ror in the restrictions placed on his cross-examination of the Government agent who had made the computation of appellant\u2019s individual income tax. This computation had been accomplished by reclassifying certain personal expenditures which were recorded on the books of Heilman Funeral Chapels, Inc. The Government introduced all the books of the corporation into evidence. The revenue agent then introduced his calculations and explained how he had reclassified various categories of expenses shown on the corporate books. On cross-examination, the appellant\u2019s attorney attempted to question the agent about the handling of individual items of expense. In connection with this line of questioning, the attorney for the appellant requested the agent to point out in the books of the corporation each item of expense and explain the reason for its reclassification. The court refused to permit this extended cross-examination, and we think he acted within his discretion in so doing. The jury had all the corporate books before them, and had access to the internal revenue agent\u2019s calculations. The agent testified as to his reasons for making the reclassifica-tions, and it would have unnecessarily prolonged the trial to require that the witness point to each separate item in the books of the corporation and explain his reason for charging that particular item as personal income to the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-21\">The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to require the production of certain work sheets in the possession of the Government upon appellant\u2019s motion pursuant to Rule 16, Fed.R.Crim.P. The motion, which was not made until the trial was nearly completed, was untimely, and no showing of materiality was made which would justify a probable delay to afford time for their inspection at that late stage.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-22\">As indicated, we have carefully considered all that transpired during the trial of this case as reflected by the record. The testimony of the defendant indicates that he was a difficult witness at times.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>We are impressed by the fact that the trial court permitted the defendant great latitude in testifying. He described his personal illnesses and the suffering and apprehension he had experienced as the result of a heart condition. He mentioned his trips to the hospital and testified as to personal family problems and difficulties, including his obligation to his widowed sister and her two children, the illness and death of both his mother and father, and the shortcomings of his brother. During the course of the trial, the court allowed ample time for the defendant to examine and re-examine the books of account. Several recesses were given when the defendant indicated that he was feeling ill and nervous. At the request of the defendant the trial was recessed for several days. At one point Government counsel petitioned the court for a mistrial because it was felt that undue sympathy had been generated on behalf of the defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">The charge of the court fully informed the jury that they were the sole judges of the facts, and the charge made it clear that the burden of proof rested squarely on the Government to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and to a moral certainty, and the presumption of innocence was properly emphasized. Apparently, the court had discussed its jury instructions with counsel for the Government and the defendant and at the conclusion of the charge inquired of counsel whether any instructions which had been discussed had been omitted. Counsel for the Government and the defendant stated that there were no omissions. The court further inquired whether counsel for the Government or the defendant desired a further conference concerning instructions. Counsel for both parties answered in the negative. No special charges were requested and no objections were made to the charge that was given by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-12\">We have carefully considered the remaining allegations of error, and we conclude that they are without merit. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b93-6\">. See United States v. Rosenberg (2 Cir. 1952) 195 F.2d 583, 594; United States v.

The case is therefore distinguishable from Gomila v. United States, 146 F.2d 372 (5 Cir. 1944), where the court asked similar questions under less provocative circumstances and then instructed the jury that the presumption of innocence was not intended to aid one who was in fact guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b94-32\">. For example, appellant\u2019s brief states that the trial court characterized certain payments made by Heilman Funeral Chapels, Inc., to various doctors as \u201cbribes.\u201d We feel that the appellant\u2019s brief is misleading on this point. The books of the corporation showed that certain payments had been made to doctors in the Miami area. The Internal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Revenue agent testified that he had charged these items as income to the appellant because payments from funeral homes to doctors are considered unethical. The following discussion of this testimony ensued between appellant\u2019s counsel and the Government agent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-6\">\u201cQ. Do you know whether this was a gift to Dr. Unger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-7\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-8\">\u201cQ. Do you know whether it was entertainment for Dr. Unger?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-9\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-10\">\u201cQ. Do you know whether it was a deductible expense to Dr. Unger as a corporation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-11\">\u201cA. I think it is a violation of the code of ethics of funeral parlors to pay doctors money.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-12\">\u201cQ, So you charged it to Mr. Hellman as income to him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-13\">\u201cTHE COURT: He has already charged it. Of course, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-15\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I charged it</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A2s\">\u201cBY MR. ROSEN:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-16\">\u201cQ. As though he received the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-17\">\u201cTHE COURT: No; he said Dr. Un-ger received it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-18\">\u201cMR. ROSEN: But he has charged it to Mr. nellman.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-23\">\u201cTHE COURT: As a personal expense \u2014 I am pretty sure he doesn\u2019t know what all these items went for. He said <em>if it was for a bribe, </em>it was against the ethics and he didn\u2019t think that would be true.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b95-25\">. At one point when the defendant was being questioned about a loan, he made the following response to Government counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-26\">\u201cA.

Why were the payments made back to the bank not from you personally?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b95-32\">\u201cA. Because that was interest payments made to the bank, and the corporation had to pay the money back. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>As it is, it hasn\u2019t paid anything else except those two payments and I am still responsible to make those moneys good.
