The plaintiffs-appellants are members of Local No. 802, American Federation of Musicians. The defendants-appellees in the Gurton case are Secretary and President of Local 802. The defendants-appel-lees in the Guamaecia case are President, Secretary and Treasurer of the American Federation of Musicians.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-17\">In the district court the plaintiffs sought a temporary injunction preventing the defendants \u201cfrom effectuating or attempting to effectuate\u201d a certain ruling of the International Executive Board of the Federation. The district court denied the applications for a temporary injunction and dismissed the complaints in both actions. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-18\">There is little or no dispute about the operative facts which led up to the present controversy. In February 1964 Local 802 took a mail vote on the question of whether in the future the election of the officers of the local should be by secret ballot mail vote conducted by the Honest Ballot Association. Local 802 has 28,000 members. The vote on the proposal was 12,654 for and 2,206 against. Thereupon plaintiffs Rothstein and Gurton proposed amendments to the by-laws for consideration at a membership meeting to be held in May. The effect of the Rothstein resolution was to rescind the result of the February referendum and to return the method of elec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tion of officers to that of voting in person. The Gurton resolution required that in order to be eligible to vote in a mail vote for election of officers, a member of the local would have to register in person at the office of the Secretary of the local \u25a0during business hours in the month of .September.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">It appears that the great majority of members of Local 802 are not employed full time as musicians. On the contrary many are employed in other lines of work. When voting in person is re\u25a0quired, only a small proportion of the members appear to vote. The requirement of registration in person, particularly registration during regular business hours, would make voting impossible for a large number of members. It is the purpose and design of the plaintiffs \u2022and others who are \u201cworking members\u201d of the local, i. e., members who are employed full time as musicians, to get and hold control of the local by effectively \u25a0disenfranchising the other members. The Rothstein and Gurton resolutions were devised to further this end.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">The Local 802 Executive Board refused to put the Rothstein and Gurton resolutions on the agenda for the May \u2022meeting. Rothstein and Gurton thereupon brought an action to compel the officers of Local 802 to put the resolutions on the agenda. Judge Levet ordered the officers to put the resolutions on the agenda. Gurton v. Manuti, 235 F.Supp. 50 (S.D.N.Y.1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">About 1500 members of the local attended the May meeting. The Rothstein .and Gurton resolutions were adopted by a majority vote.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">The officers of Local 802 appealed the .action of the meeting to the International Executive Board of the Federation.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">The International Executive Board, .acting under Article 8, Section 12, of the By-Laws of the American Federation of Musicians which authorizes an appeal when a meeting has taken a stand \u201cin violation of the principles of the Federation,\u201d declared the two resolutions to be null and void. The Board held that the resolutions violated Article 12, Section 6, of the By-Laws of the International. This Section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-11\">\u201cA Local failing to enforce its own laws, or submitting to unjust, unfair or improper conditions forced upon it by the arbitrary ruling of packed meetings, or through the influence of members who control the situation, must, after a proper investigation, submit to such decision arrived at by the officers of the Federation as, in their opinion, may correct the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b429-12\">The Board\u2019s decision said that the \u201cpurpose of that Section [i. e. Section 6] is to prevent a minority from seizing control of a local by abuse of temporary power and effectuating changes adversely affecting the rights of the majority.\u201d \u201cThese same considerations,\u201d the decision continues, \u201cin our opinion, make it unlawful for the members at a meeting to disenfranchise the vast bulk of Local 802 members. For example, the Gurton resolution would make ineligible not only those members who live out of town but also those who work out of town during September and even those members who, though in town, must (unfortunately) find full-time employment in other industries and therefore cannot come to the Local\u2019s offices when they are open.. Where the membership of the local has voted to maximize the opportunities for voting, a minority cannot be permitted to nullify their decision. We hold that the Federation By-Laws do not permit a minority thus to disenfranchise the majority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The complaint in the Gurton action asks that the Local\u2019s officials be ordered to act in accordance with the Rothstein and Gurton resolutions. Jurisdiction is alleged to be based upon Section 501 of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The complaint in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>Guarnaccia action asks that the ruling of the International Executive Board be declared invalid, that the officials be prevented from \u201ceffectuating\u201d that ruling, and that the Rothstein and Gurton resolutions be declared to be valid amendments to the by-laws of Local 802. Jurisdiction is based upon Section 101 of the L.M.R. D.A.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Both sets of .plaintiffs moved for temporary injunctions ordering the Union\u2019s officials to put the disputed resolutions into effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">We hold that the applications for temporary injunctions were properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The facts set forth in the complaints do not constitute violations of Sections 101 and 501 of the L.M.R.D.A.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">The only violation of Section 101 claimed by the plaintiffs is a denial of the equal right to vote in elections or referendums. The plaintiffs argue that if they are not allowed to vote in accordance with the limitations on voting contained in the Rothstein and Gurton resolutions, they will be denied their <em>right </em>to vote. But the guaranty of the equal right to vote is surely not a general commission for the federal courts to review the constitution and by-laws of the union. As long as no claim is made that provisions of the constitution and by-laws are being applied in such a way as to deny equality in voting, there is nothing in Section 101 which authorizes consideration of those documents. Section 101 grants no power to the courts to examine into whether by-laws were lawfully adopted or repealed. See Cal-hoon v. Harvey, 85 S.Ct. 292 (U.S. Dec. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>7, 1964); Robins v. Rarback, 325 F.2d 929 (2d Cir.1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It is equally clear that Section 501 of the L.M.R.D.A. has no application to the present controversy. A simple reading of that section shows that it applies to fiduciary responsibility with respect to the money and property of the union and that it is not a catch-all provision under which union officials can be sued on any ground of misconduct with which the plaintiffs choose to charge them.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> If further corroboration for this position be needed it will be found in the legislative history and in the law review articles cited by Judge Tenney in his opinion in the district court. 234 F.Supp. at 442-443.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The provisions of the L.M.R.D.A. were not intended by Congress to constitute an invitation to the courts to intervene at will in the internal affairs of unions. Courts have no special expertise in the operation of unions which would justify a broad power to interfere. The internal operations of unions are to be left to the officials chosen by the members to manage those operations except in the very limited instances expressly provided by the Act. The conviction of some judges that they are better able to administer a union\u2019s affairs than the elected officials is wholly without foundation. Most unions are honestly and efficiently administered and are much more likely to continue to be so if they are free from officious intermeddling by the courts. General supervision of unions by the courts would not contribute to the betterment of the unions or their members or to the cause of labor-management relations.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-11\">In the present case, the controversy was handled within the union without any irregularity but with due regard for the procedures provided by the bylaws. The action taken by a meeting of members of the local was appealed in the regular course to the International Executive Board, which exercises the power of the international organization between conventions. The Executive Board, having considered material submitted by both sides, came to the conclusion that the action of the meeting was \u201cin violation of the principles of the Federation\u201d within the meaning of Article 8, Section 12, of the by-laws of the Federation. The Board went on to find a violation of Article 12, Section 6, of the by-laws and to declare the action of the meeting null and void. We can find nothing in this procedure to which any exception can be taken. The provisions of the by-laws under which the International Board acted do not appear to us to be arbitrary or unreasonable and they are binding upon the plaintiffs as members of the union. The action which the Board condemned was the adoption, by a group constituting about five percent of the membership, of resolutions which were designed to disenfranchise a large majority of the union\u2019s members and which would have had that effect. There seems to us to be nothing arbitrary or reprehensible in the union\u2019s supreme governing body, acting under the authority of the union\u2019s by-laws nullifying that action.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-9\">The basic issue, whether the union is to be run by its \u201cworking members\u201d or by the members who are not employed full-time as musicians and who constitute a great majority of the membership is surely an issue for the union to decide for itself and not an issue on which the power of the courts should be enlisted on one side or the other. So long as the union in reaching its decision violates no provision of law, we judges should resolutely keep our hands off.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b429-14\">. 73 Stat. 535 (1959), 29 U.S.O. \u00a7 501 (Supp. V, 1964), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"asi-dedup-0\">\u201cFiduciary Responsibility of Officers of Labor Organizations</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ago\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>\u201cSec. 501.

I agree with the majority\u2019s general definition of our role in this case \u2014 that we should not dictate Local 802\u2019s choice between election by referendum and election at a membership meeting but should only insure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>the choice i\u00a1? made in a manner which does not violate the rights of individual members under \u00a7 101(a) (1) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 411(a) (1). I also share with the majority their conclusion that the plaintiffs have failed to show a violation of their \u00a7 101(a) (1) rights in this ease. In proceeding summarily from premise to conclusion, however, I think that my colleagues pass over the difficult question involved in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">First, while the majority seems to me unjustly to cast the plaintiffs as villains in a struggle to vindicate democratic principles, I do not read their opinion as suggesting that the Gurton and Roth-stein proposals could not lawfully be adopted; indeed, any such suggestion would go beyond the limits which they have set on our role. It seems to me equally clear that adoption of the proposals was proper under the Local 802 bylaws. The bylaws provide for their own amendment by referendum or by vote at one of several bylaw meetings throughout the year. Since the two methods of amendment are independent of one another, a bylaw adopted by one may be repealed by the other, and this is just what the plaintiffs proposed. Of course, a vote at a membership meeting is likely to be smaller than a referendum vote. I assume, however, that the majority would agree that it is not for this court to say that it is improper for a union thus to conduct its affairs. Many responsible organizations, including the Association of the Bar of the City of New York, require their members to come to the meeting place in order to vote on any proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Second, it is doubtful that the adoption of the proposals was improper under the Federation\u2019s bylaws; at the very least, this was a disputed issue of fact which, if material, could not properly be resolved in the summary proceedings held before Judge Tenney. Article 12, Section-6 \u2014 quoted by the majority \u2014 by its terms-requires something in the nature of a. \u201cpacked\u201d or \u201ccontrolled\u201d meeting; certainly it contains no suggestion that a vote is improper simply because it was-conducted at a meeting and a different result would have been likely if all absent members had been polled. A union tribunal should be given considerable latitude in interpreting union rules. But <em>if </em>there would be an infringement of a statutory right absent a justifying union rule, we must require that the interpretation of the rule at least be plausible and that its application be supported by some evidence where it depends, as in this case, on a factual premise. No evidence that the May meeting was packed,, controlled or otherwise improperly constituted appears in the district court record.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The other bylaw provision cited by the-International Executive Board was Article 8, Section 12:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-10\">\u201cA Local officer or officers may appeal to the International Executive Board from a decision of a Local in any case whatsoever, if in the opinion of such officers, a meeting, for any reason or conditions whatsoever, took a stand in violation of the principles of the Federation. If the-Board sustains the appeal, then it shall correct the situation, and its decision shall be binding upon the-Local.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-11\">In holding the May vote invalid under this section, the Board rested most specifically on the fact that the February referendum provided that it could be amended only by another referendum vote. What the Board appears to have overlooked, however, is that the bylaw approved in the February referendum was not yet effective at the time of the May meeting.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The meeting thus was conducted under the pre-referendum bylaws, which allow amendment of any bylaw by vote at a bylaw meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The Board\u2019s decision, so far as it rests on Article 8, Section 12, thus ultimately must depend on the general proposition that it \u201cviolates the principles of the Federation\u201d for a vote at a membership meeting to supersede a larger referendum vote. I do not suggest that a union may not cherish such a principle or that it may not preserve it by application of a general bylaw such as Article 8, Section 12. But, again assuming that the plaintiffs would be entitled to relief if the defendants\u2019 acts were not justified by a union bylaw, we surely must require the Union to offer some evidence that the principle antedates the current controversy or, at least, allow the plaintiffs to show that it does not do so.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">The foregoing excursion through the bylaws of the American Federation of Musicians and its Local 802 was made in an attempt to demonstrate that affirmance, though proper, cannot rest on the simple ground that the defendants acted properly under union rules. The more difficult question presented is whether the equal right to vote guaranteed by \u00a7 101(a) (1) is infringed if union officers, acting without justification from the union bylaws, void the result of a properly-conducted vote. This question cannot be answered by reference to the statutory bar on private post-election remedies found in \u00a7 403 of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 483, for that section does not apply where the vote is not part of a union election. For the same reason, the recent decision of the Supreme Court in Calhoon v. Harvey, 375 U.S. 991, 84 S.Ct. 633, 11 L.Ed.2d 478 (1964), reversing 324 F.2d 486 (2 Cir. 1963), at least does not directly control; the apparent rationale of that decision is that the specific guarantees of \u00a7 401, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 481, with respect to union elections preclude the inference of similar rights in \u00a7 101 (a) (1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">It would be disingenuous, however, not to find in Calhoon v. Harvey, the more general principle that \u00a7 101(a) (1) protects the right to vote only against relatively direct attack. I reluctantly conclude, therefore, that the more indirect attack involved in this case \u2014 arbitrarily voiding the result of a vote after it is taken \u2014 does not infringe the rights of the plaintiffs under \u00a7 101(a) (1).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b432-6\">. Under the Local bylaws, an amendment approved in a referendum does not become effective until after the following bylaw meeting. The next bylaw meeting following the February referendum was the May meeting.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b433-18\">. Cf. N. A. A. C. P. v. Alabama, 357 U. S. 449, 454 \u2014 458, 78 S.Ct. 1163, 2 L.Ed.2d 148S (1958), in which a purported independent and adequate state ground was found not to have appeared in earlier Alabama decisions. Here, as in that case, there is involved a potential conflict between federally-created rights and local automony.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
