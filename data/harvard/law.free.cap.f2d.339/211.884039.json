The Tax Court found that the distributions in question were essentially equivalent to dividends within the meaning of the statute and upheld the tax imposed upon the taxpayer with respect to them. This finding was one of fact. Ferro v. Commissioner, 3 Cir. 1957, 242 F.2d 838. Our examination of the record satisfies us that there was substantial evidence to support the finding of the Tax Court and that the Court applied the right criteria in making it. We are in accord in this regard with Judge Mulroney\u2019s discussion of the subject in the opinion of the Tax Court, and need add nothing to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-13\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
