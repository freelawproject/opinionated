Mexia Textile Mills, 339 U.S. 563, 70 S.Ct. 833, 94 L.Ed. 1067 (1950). There the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-10\">\u201c * * * the employer\u2019s compliance with an order of the Board does not render the cause moot, depriving the Board of its opportunity to secure enforcement from an appropriate court. * * * A Board order imposes a continuing obligation; and the Board is entitled to have the resumption of the unfair practice barred by an enforcement decree. As the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit remarked, \u2018no more is involved than whether what the law already condemned, the court shall forbid; and the fact that its judgment adds to existing sanctions that of punishment for contempt, is not a circumstance to which a court will ordinarily lend a friendly ear.\u2019 * * The Act does not require the Board</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-11\">to play hide-and-seek with those guilty of unfair labor practices.\u201d (pp. 567-568, 70 S.Ct. p. 828-829.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALY\">Decree will be entered enforcing the: Board\u2019s order as prayed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
