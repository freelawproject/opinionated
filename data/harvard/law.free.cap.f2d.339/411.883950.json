Morrow, under a \u201cgroup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>life insurance contract\u201d issued by Appellant to American Motor Sales Corporation and providing life insurance coverage for \u201cowners\u201d of \u201cqualified\u201d franchise dealerships. Appellee\u2019s husband was afflicted with terminal cancer on August 15, 1961, the date his dealership became \u201cqualified\u201d, and died therefrom on October 5, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">As a condition precedent to eligibility for coverage,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> **the policy provided that the \u201cowner\u201d be \u201cactively engaged in the operation\u201d of the dealership on the date it became \u201cqualified\u201d. If Mr. Morrow was an eligible \u201cowner\u201d but \u2018\u2018absent from work due to illness\u201d on August 15, 1961, then coverage under the policy as to him would commence as of the date of his \u201creturn to work\u201d. However, if he was not an eligible \u201cowner\u201d on August 15, 1961, then under the policy he could not possibly have become covered before his death, which was prior to the next \u201cplan quarter\u201d commencing November 1, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The issues of fact essential to recovery under the policy and raised by the evidence <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> were correctly stated in the Pretrial Order, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">\u201c(1) Whether or not on August 15, 1961 Frederick O. Morrow was actively engaged in the operation of the dealership, within the meaning and contemplation of the group policy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">\u201c(2) Whether or not Frederick 0. Morrow was absent from work due to illness, within the meaning and contemplation of the group policy, on August 15, 1961.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">\u201c(3) Whether or not Frederick 0. Morrow returned to work, within the meaning and contemplation of the group policy, at any time from August 15, 1961, until his death on October 5, 1961.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">Special issues in substantially identical language were requested in writing by appellant; and appellant duly preserved its objection to the court\u2019s charge for failure to submit such issues for jury determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-14\">The interrogatories submitted to the jury by the trial court, and the jury\u2019s answei's thereto, were as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Abx\">\u201cINTERROGATORY NO. 1:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-15\">\u201cDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Frederick O. Morrow was actively engaged and at work in the operation of the French and Morrow Rambler sales dealership on August 15, 1961?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-16\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-17\">\u201cANSWER: He was not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-18\">* * * * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-19\">\u201cINTERROGATORY NO. 2:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-20\">\u201cDo you find from a preponderance of the evidence that Frederick O. Mox-row returned to work as one of the owners in the French and Morrow Rambler sales dealership after August 15, 1961? ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-21\">\u201cANSWER: He did.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b468-22\">Each pax'ty contends for a different in-tex'pretation of the jury\u2019s single answer \u2014 \u201cHe was not\u201d \u2014 to Interx'ogatory No. 1, askiixg whether Mr. Morrow \u201cwas actively engaged <em>and </em>at work\u201d in the operation of the dealership. At best, this intexmogatory was duplicitous and confusing. The jury\u2019s answer is neither a clear finding that Mr. Morrow \u201cwas not actively engaged * * * \u201d nor that he \u201cwas not at work * * * \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-23\">Since it was essential to plaintiff\u2019s re-covex-y to obtain a clear and unequivocal jury finding on the disputed issues: (1) whether Fx'ederick 0. Morrow was actively engaged in the operation of the dealership on August 15, 1961, (2) whether Fx'ederick 0. Morrow was absent from woi'k due to illness on August 15, 1961, (3) whether Frederick O. Morrow returned to wox'k at any time from August 15, 1961 and prior to his death on October 5, 1961; and since issues (1) axxd (2) were not propex'ly submitted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the court erred in refusing to submit such matters and in rendering judgment for appellee on the jury verdict returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">The judgment is reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b468-10\">.
