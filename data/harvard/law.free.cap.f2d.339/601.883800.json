(appellee) alleging that he was injured when he slipped and fell in the appellee\u2019s store. Appellant claims that the appellee was guilty of negligence in allowing foreign matter to remain on the floor of the store, or that such foreign matter had been placed there by an employee of the appellee. At the conclusion of the appellant\u2019s case the court granted the motion of the appellee for an instructed verdict and judgment was entered against appellant. Our review of the record fails to convince us that the trial court committed error. See F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Bell (5 Cir. 1961) 291 F.2d 912. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
