The district court found that the appellee had breached no duty owed to Mrs. Johnson and that her injuries were in no way proximately caused by the fault, carelessness, recklessness or negligence of the appellee. The appellants challenge these findings and urge that liability should have been found under the principles stated in Kermaree v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique, 358 U.S. 625, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>79 S.Ct. 406, 3 L.Ed.2d 550. Factual differences distinguish the Kermarec case from the ease before us. The rule there stated is not applicable here. The judgment of the district court was fully justified by the evidence and is Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
