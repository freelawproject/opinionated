The patent is No. 2,742,327 which was applied for by Theodore Marks on April 20, 1951 and was issued to him April 17, 1956. We shall refer to it as the Marks patent, although by mesne assignments it is now owned by American Technical Machinery Corporation. The claims relied upon are 2, 16 and 17. They are printed in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Judge Mishler<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> held the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>claims valid but not infringed, plaintiff has appealed from the holding of non-infringement. The defendant counter-claimed for a declaration of invalidity of the patent, and has appealed from the dismissal of his counterclaim. The</p>\n<p id=\"b615-2\">Plaintiff and defendant are competitors in making and selling brushes, and plaintiff also manufactures brush-making machinery.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\">The Marks patent is a combination patent for a fully automatic machine for making brushes of the type commonly used in the household and in women\u2019s hair curlers. Judge Mishler\u2019s opinion clearly describes the Marks\u2019 machine as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b615-4\">\u201c * * * the machine is designed to produce wire-twisted brushes of varying lengths not exceeding approximately 3\u201d. An upper and lower wire are continuously fed into the machine from two spools, the upper and lower wires engage pre-cut fibers or bristles fed from a hopper ; the two wires holding the fibers or bristles in a more or less firm position, are then drawn into a predetermined length; the wires holding the bristles are then twisted by a rotating chuck; the twisted-wire brush is then cut. The brush is then complete and ready for packaging, except that in some varieties handles are added.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">The court found that the Marks machine was an advance over the prior art; that it produced brushes faster than any previous brush-making machine, did not require the degree of skill in its operation that machines then known demanded, substantially reduced the cost of making twisted-wire brushes, was commercially successful, and the need for a low-priced brush was heightened by the widespread use of twisted brushes in hair curlers. Such considerations are consistent with the standard of patentability in this circuit. See Reiner v. I. Leon Co., 2 Cir., 285 F.2d 501, 504, cert. den. 366 U.S. 929, 81 S. Ct. 1649, 6 L.Ed.2d 388; Lyon v. Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., 2 Cir., 224 F.2d 530, 535-537, cert. den. 350 U.S. 911, 76 S.Ct. 193, 100 L.Ed 799; The Standard of Patentability \u2014 Judicial Interpretation of Section 103 of the Patent Act, 63 Columbia L.Rev. 306, 313-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">These findings of fact are not clearly erroneous, and we must accept them. We also accept the finding that \u201cThe means disclosed is not found in the teaching of any of the patents nor were the means obvious to one skilled in the art of brush-machine making.\u201d Accordingly, we agree with Judge Mishler\u2019s decision as to the validity of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">We do not agree with his holding of no infringement. The proper test of infringement is whether the claims involved read directly on the accused machine, for \u201cthe claims measure the invention.\u201d Continental Paper Bag Co. v. Eastern Paper Bag Co., 210 U.S. 405, 419, 28 S.Ct. 748, 52 L.Ed. 1122; see Smith v. Snow, 294 U.S. 1, 11, 55 S.Ct. 279, 79 L.Ed. 721; 3 Walker, Patents \u00a7 450, at 1681 (Diller ed.). In the case at bar the accused' machine was the Briglia.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Judge Mishler compared plaintiff\u2019s machine with defendant\u2019s or, which is really the same thing, compared plaintiff\u2019s claims with defendant\u2019s machine but limited the claims to a range of equivalency substantially defined by plaintiff\u2019s \u201cbest mode.\u201d Both tests are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>erroneous; the former because it begins with plaintiff\u2019s machine and not plaintiff\u2019s claims; the latter because it too narrowly construes the protected range of equivalency.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">It is true that narrow patents in a crowded field are not accorded as broad a range of equivalence as are pioneer patents, 3 Walker, Patents \u00a7 475. But here both defendant and his expert testified that all of Marks' claims in suit could be read on the Briglia machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Nor could Briglia\u2019s simultaneous pulling and twisting the wires be conclusive evidence of non-infringement. Marks\u2019 claims did not limit these operations to separate steps, and there was testimony that the Marks machine could also so operate. The simultaneous operation was regarded as equivalent by defendant\u2019s expert, and the twisting operation was not only known to the prior art but was thought by the trial court to be \u201cof no consequence * *</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">Defendant is not saved by the difference in feeding wheels. Not only was defendant\u2019s mechanism thought equivalent to plaintiff\u2019s, but also both had been taught by the prior art. Besides, the mechanism was not the gist of Marks\u2019 novel combination as defined by the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The court placed no weight on any \u201cpresumption of non-infringement\u201d attaching to Briglia\u2019s patent. Defendant would treat that patent as establishing \u201cmore than a presumption\u201d that the accused machine does not infringe. But the statutory presumption of validity of a patent is limited only to the existence of a patentable improvement. Cantrell v. Wallick, 117 U.S. 689, 694, 6 S.Ct. 970, 29 L.Ed. 1017. It need not be controlling once sufficient evidence of infringement of the basic patent has been introduced, as was done in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-12\">While we must accept findings of fact which are not clearly erroneous, we are not so limited as to erroneous views of the proper legal tests of infringement. See Up-Right, Inc. v. Safeway Products, Inc., 5 Cir., 315 F.2d 23; Hansen v. Colliver, 9 Cir., 282 F.2d 66. Here the finding of non-infringement was based on an unduly narrow definition of the patent\u2019s protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-13\">The decision as to validity of the patent and dismissal of the counterclaim is affirmed. The decision of non-infringement is reversed and the cause remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b614-15\">. 2.
