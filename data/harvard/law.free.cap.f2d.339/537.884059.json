The Commissioner concedes that this is correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-24\">Accordingly it is held that of the sums received by petitioners from Kearney Park Trust No. 473 the sum of $7,615.50 is attributable to the reimbursement of advances and is not income; of the sums received by petitioners from Trust No. 482 the sum of $5,615 is likewise attributable to the reimbursement of advances and is not income.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-25\">Upon the other grounds asserted by petitioners for rehearing, rehearing is denied. Mandate shall issue forthwith.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
