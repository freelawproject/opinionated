Perkins was awarded damages by a jury in the District Court. On motion \u25a0of the defendant, Henry J. Kaiser Construction Company, the verdict was set \u2022aside and judgment rendered non ob-\u2022stante for Construction. It had not failed in any duty to Perkins, the Court \u25a0concluded, because the defective wooden guard rail of the defendant responsible for his misfortune was used by him at the time in an unforeseeable and plainly unintended manner. Perkins appeals; ye affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-12\">The evidence comprised an explanation \u2022of the respective relationships, inter se, \u2022of the parties and the contractors engaged in the building project, a description of the faulty timber and a retracing of the injured employee\u2019s movements resulting in the accident. A close and graphic narrative of the facts was included by the District Judge in his letter-opinion, which we adopt for its clarity. However, we think the motion n. o. v. is to be upheld upon the contributory negligence of the plaintiff, necessarily applied with the strictness of the West Virginia doctrine, rather than upon a want of a duty resting on the defendant. Both grounds were asserted in the motion. While they are almost inextricably interwoven, the contributory negligence is the plainer premise, for the employee\u2019s participation in his own injury is manifest from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b760-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
