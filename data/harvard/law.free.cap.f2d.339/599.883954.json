V. Allegheny, has appealed from two judgments of the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania. The appeal in No. 14893 is from the judgment entered on a verdict for the defendant in the plaintiff\u2019s civil action for damages for personal injuries incurred in the service of the defendant\u2019s vessel. The action was grounded on negligence, under the Jones Act, and unseaworthiness. The appeal in No. 14894 is from the judgment entered on a verdict for $1,000 for the plaintiff in his admiralty suit for maintenance and cure and damages for failure to pay such maintenance and cure. The award of $1,000 by the jury was stated by it to be \u201cfor suffering, pain and inconvenience only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b655-25\">The testimony was sharply conflicting as to the nature and cause of the plaintiff\u2019s accident. Under a full, eminently fair and adequate charge by the trial judge the conflict was resolved by the jury in the defendant\u2019s favor. Although the plaintiff is understandably unhappy with that result there is no basis for reviewing it here. The plaintiff accordingly limits himself to asserting error in certain rulings on evidence, to certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>instructions given and refused and to the failure of the trial judge to rule on the plaintiff\u2019s requests for instructions prior to the arguments of counsel, although not requested to do so. We have carefully considered all of these matters but find them so lacking in merit as to require no discussion here.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-4\">The judgments of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
