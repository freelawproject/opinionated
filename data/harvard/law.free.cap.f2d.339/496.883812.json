A third ground of attack is made by the Secretary by-reason of the fact that the trial court,, in not giving reasons or a specific discussion of the basis for its overruling of' the Secretary\u2019s determination, makes difficult the Secretary\u2019s appeal to this Court without having to discuss many factors, that may not have given rise to the trial, court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-25\">It is difficult to understand how the trial court could determine, as it did here, \u201cthere is not substantial evidence-in the record to support the Secretary\u2019s, decision denying the plaintiff benefits under the Social Security Act.\u201d It is perfectly apparent from the most casual reading of the record that there is substantial evidence supporting the Secretary\u2019s decision. This evidence is far-from de minimis. It is evidence of a. competent, experienced specialist in the field of the medical science within which, the applicant\u2019s asserted disability falls.. Moreover, it is plain that the Secretary, acting through his examiner, cast serious, doubt upon the credibility of contrary-testimony. Such credibility findings are, of course, for the Secretary and not for-the trial court. Not only does the statute-make it plain, but this Court has repeatedly stated, that where there is substantial evidence to support the Secretary\u2019s, determination, the trial court has no pow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>\u2022er to overrule that determination. Having found, as we do, that there was such .substantial evidence in this case, it follows that the judgment of the trial court must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">It may be, as is contended by the Secretary, that the trial court applied an \u2022incorrect standard in ascertaining the -existence of a disability. The trial court .stated, \u201cPlaintiff was and is suffering from a medically determinable physical \u2022or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or be of long \u2022continued and indefinite duration, and is <em>therefore </em>incapable of obtaining substantial gainful employment commensurate with his age, educational attainments, training and experience.\u201d (Emphasis added). If, by this language, the trial court meant that whenever there is a \u201cmedically determinable physical or mental impairment\u201d of the nature described, it follows <em>therefore </em>that he is '\u201cincapable of obtaining substantial gainful employment, etc.\u201d this would, of \u2022course, be the wrong standard. This is true because many persons suffer from .a medically determinable physical impairment which does not make them incapable of obtaining substantial gainful \u2022employment. If, on the other hand, the \u25a0trial court was merely determining that this particular applicant had become incapable of obtaining substantial gainful \u2022 employment by reason of <em>his particular </em>physical or mental impairment, the language, of course, would not be inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">With respect to the last point made by the Secretary, we note that, in the rare case in which it is appropriate for the trial court to reverse the Secretary\u2019s findings because there is no substantial evidence to support them it would make it much easier for this Court, on appeal, to have the benefit of the trial \u25a0court\u2019s analysis of the evidence, and the reasoning by which it arrives at its determination that it is unable to find support in the record for the Secretary\u2019s :findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
