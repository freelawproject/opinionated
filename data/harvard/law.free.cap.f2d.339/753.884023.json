The District Court dismissed the action on a finding that appellee\u2019s rejection of appellants\u2019 bid was within his statutory authority and that, therefore, the action is in reality one against the United States which is barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-9\">In view of the Supreme Court holdings in Larson v. Domestic &amp; Foreign Corp., 337 U.S. 682, 69 S.Ct. 1457, 93 L.Ed. 1628 (1949), and, more recently, Malone v. Bowdoin, 369 U.S. 643, 82 S.Ct. 980, 8 L.Ed.2d 168 (1962), we feel constrained to affirm the position adopted by the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
