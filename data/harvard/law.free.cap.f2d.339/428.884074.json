While the charge was kidnapping, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1201 which permits punishment by death, the appellants were granted only the challenges prescribed for a non-capital felony prosecution<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the indictment stated that the victim was \u201cunharmed at the time of his liberation\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">Greater precision could have been achieved by the criminal pleader by use of the statutory language, \u201cliberated unharmed\u201d, to avoid limiting the existence of injury to the date of liberation. Cf. Robinson v. United States, 324 U.S. 282, 65 S.Ct. 666, 89 L.Ed. 944 (1945); Smith v. United States, 360 U.S. 1, 79 S.Ct. 991, 3 L.Ed.2d 1041 (1959), including the separate opinion of Justice Clark at p. 13, 79 S.Ct. at p. 998. But we find the present allegation sufficed to guarantee the defendants immunity from the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-15\">In addition, the Government\u2019s bill of particulars and the oral explanation of the Court on voir dire examination unequivocally and irrevocably informed the jurors that capital punishment was neither sought nor possible in their verdict. The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-16\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b485-26\">.
