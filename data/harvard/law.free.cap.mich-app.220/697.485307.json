The wcac decision affirms the decision of the magistrate, which, while awarding plaintiff worker\u2019s compensation disability benefits, allows defendant Livonia Public Schools to coordinate those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"699\">*699</page-number>benefits with plaintiffs disability pension provided pursuant to MCL 38.1386; MSA 15.893(196). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">The pertinent facts are not in dispute. After many years of employment in the public school system as a general laborer, plaintiff suffered work-related back injuries that have disabled him from further employment. His last day of work was November 9, 1989. Plaintiff is receiving a disability pension pursuant to the Public School Employees Retirement Act, MCL 38.1386; MSA 15.893(196). The sole question presented is whether those disability pension benefits can be coordinated against defendant\u2019s worker\u2019s compensation liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">Plaintiff presents two issues for review:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-7\">I. Did the wcac err as a matter of law in concluding that plaintiff\u2019s disability pension may BE utilized for coordination</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-8\">PURPOSES UNDER \u00a7 354 OF THE WDCA TO FUND A PORTION OF DEFENDANT\u2019S WORKER\u2019S COMPENSATION LIABILITY TO PLAINTIFF?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-9\">II.

Accordingly, we review such legal issues de novo, according only minimal deference to the administrative construction of the statute, and set aside an agency\u2019s ruling regarding a question of law only where a party\u2019s substantial rights were prejudiced because of a substantial and material error of law. <em>Schuhknecht v State Plumbing Bd, </em>277 Mich 183, 186-187; 269 NW 136 (1936); <em>Ron</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"700\">*700</page-number><em>ney v Dep\u2019t of Social Services, </em>210 Mich App 312, 315; 532 NW2d 910 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">The pertinent portions of \u00a7 354 of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (wdca), MCL 418.354(1)(d) and (14); MSA 17.237(354)(1)(d) and (14), are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-7\">(1) This section is applicable when either weekly or lump sum payments are made to an employee as a result of liability pursuant to section 351, 361, or 835 with respect to the same time period for which . . . payments under ... a disability insurance policy provided by the employer; or pension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the employer, are also received or being received by the employee. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the employer\u2019s obligation to pay or cause to be paid weekly benefits other than specific loss benefits under section 361(2) and (3) shall be reduced by these amounts:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-8\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-9\">(d) The after-tax amount of the pension or retirement payments received or being received pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the same employer from whom benefits under section 351, 361, or 835 are received, if the employee did not contribute directly to the pension or retirement plan or program. Subsequent increases in a pension or retirement program shall not affect the coordination of these benefits.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-11\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b714-12\">(14) This section does not apply to any payments received or to be received under a disability pension plan provided by the same employer which plan is in existence on March 31, 1982. Any disability pension plan entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982 may provide that the payments under that disability pension plan provided by the employer shall not be coordinated pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b715-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>The WCAC unanimously viewed subparagraph 14 as addressing disability pension arrangements resulting from collective bargaining, and this assessment is correct. What the parties and the wcac seem to have overlooked, however, is the delicate phraseological distinctions the Legislature made between subparagraphs 1 and 14. In subparagraph 1, the Legislature authorized coordination for, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cpension or retirement payments pursuant to a plan or program established or maintained by the employer.\u201d By comparison, in subparagraph 14, an exception was made for payments received or to be received under a \u201cdisability pension plan provided by the same employer which plan is in existence on March 31, 1982.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Section 354 was initially added to the WDCA by 1981 PA 203, effective March 31, 1982. The Legislature linked the effective date of the statute with its disavowal of intent to affect preexisting disability pension plans for a reason that becomes obvious when the distinction between \u201cplans\u201d and \u201cprograms\u201d is understood. Section 354(1), which deals collectively with plans <em>and </em>programs, is distinguished from subparagraph 14, which deals only with \u201cplans,\u201d because a \u201cplan\u201d is a reflection of a contractual relationship between an employer and an employee, subject to regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (erisa), 29 USC 1001 <em>el seq.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">By the same token, the erisa provides a blanket exemption from its regulatory ambit for \u201cgovernment plans\u201d established or maintained by the government of any state or political subdivision for its employees. 29 USC 1002(2)(a)(32) and 1321(b)(2). Although the Legislature did not provide a glossary in 1981 PA 203 (which became, <em>inter alia, </em>\u00a7 354 of the wdca), we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>must construe the statute in a manner that recognizes that phraseological distinctions in the subparagraphs of a statutory section presumably reflect a legislative intent to treat some things differently. <em>Stowers v Wolodzko, </em>386 Mich 119, 133-134; 191 NW2d 355 (1971); <em>In re Brzezinski, </em>214 Mich App 652, 663-664; 542 NW2d 871 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">We think the distinction between a \u201cprogram\u201d and a \u201cplan\u201d as used in \u00a7 354 is based on a \u201cprogram\u201d as being a reference to a govemmentally created system of reimbursement, protection, or remuneration. The disability pension benefits called for by the Public School Employees Retirement Act constitute a \u201cprogram\u201d that, albeit \u201cestablished\u201d by the Legislature, is \u201cmaintained\u201d by the individual school district employer funding the program. For this purpose, funding is equivalent to \u201cmaintaining\u201d such a program. <em>Dezwaan v Holland Motor Express, </em>189 Mich App 575, 578; 473 NW2d 788 (1991). Plaintiff thus errs in contending that, if the disability pension benefits he receives are not immune from coordination because they are not a \u201cplan\u201d for purposes of subparagraph 14, they are likewise not a \u201cplan\u201d for purposes of coordination under subparagraph 1. This argument overlooks the crucial fact that subparagraph 1 applies to \u201cprograms\u201d <em>as well as </em>\u201cplans.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b716-6\">In recognizing that the reference in subparagraph 14 to \u201cplans\u201d refers only to contractual obligations, the Legislature reveals that it properly concerned itself with constitutional limitations on its authority. But for its inclusion of such a provision, the entire section might be declared unconstitutional as an impairment of the obligation of contracts, in violation of Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 and US Const, art I, \u00a7 10. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"703\">*703</page-number>See <em>Monroe Beverage Co, Inc v Stroh Brewery Co, </em>211 Mich App 286, 297; 535 NW2d 253 (1995); <em>Washtenaw Community College Ed Ass\u2019n v Washtenaw Community College Bd of Trustees, </em>50 Mich App 467, 471-473; 213 NW2d 567 (1973). The Legislature thus applied coordination to contractual plans only if such plans are renewed or created after March 31, 1982, because the constitutional impediment does not apply to contracts made <em>after </em>the effective date of a statute. See, e.g., <em>Seitz v Probate Judges Retirement System, </em>189 Mich App 445, 451-452, 455; 474 NW2d 125 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">In contrast, government benefits payable pursuant to statute are not contractual in nature. See <em>Powers v Peoples Community Hosp Authority, </em>183 Mich App 550, 554; 455 NW2d 371 (1990); <em>Guilbault v Dep\u2019t of Mental Health, </em>160 Mich App 781, 784-785; 408 NW2d 558 (1987). Hence, the Legislature is not constrained by the Impairment of Contracts Clauses of the state and federal constitutions in modifying or amending statutory pension programs before the time that rights thereunder become fixed.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">Plaintiff attempts to turn this prophylaxis on its head by arguing that the effect of coordinating his disability pension is to impair a contractual obligation. Plaintiff argues that, while under the Constitution of 1908, pensions granted by public authorities were not deemed to be contractual obligations but rather gratuitous allowances that could be revoked at will, Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 declares that the <em>accrued </em>financial benefits of each pension plan and retirement system of the state and its political subdivisions \u201cshall be a contractual obligation thereof which shall not be diminished or impaired.\u201d Thus, the Constitution of 1963 treats pension benefits as contractual obliga<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"704\">*704</page-number>tions that may not be impaired by legislative enactment. <em>Advisory Opinion re Constitutionality of 1972 PA 258, </em>389 Mich 659, 662-663; 209 NW2d 200 (1973); <em>Campbell v Judges\u2019 Retirement Bd, </em>378 Mich 169, 180-182; 143 NW2d 755 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">Accepting that principle, we find that it simply does not apply to disability pensions, except for persons who are already disabled and therefore whose right to such pension has vested (\u201caccrued\u201d). See, e.g., <em>Campbell, supra </em>at 180-181. In <em>Advisory Opinion, supra, </em>our Supreme Court quoted from the constitutional convention debates where proponents of what became art 9, \u00a7 24 aptly described nondisability pension benefits as simply deferred compensation for work performed. The same cannot be said of a disability pension for a person not yet disabled. Because plaintiff was not disabled on March 31, 1982, and had no right to a disability pension at that time, the subsequent adoption of coordination of such disability pensions with worker\u2019s compensation benefits neither deprived him of any vested right nor impaired the obligation of any contract. Yet, had plaintiff been potentially entitled to a disability pension under a collective bargaining agreement or other contractual form of obligation that was not entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982, subparagraph 14 of \u00a7 354 would be necessary to prevent an impairment of the obligation of such a contract. See <em>Kosa v State Treasurer, </em>408 Mich 356, 371-372; 292 NW2d 452 (1980); <em>Washtenaw Community College Ed Ass\u2019n, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">In failing to recognize the distinction between \u201cplans\u201d and \u201cprograms,\u201d the wcac lost itself in a thicket of reasoning from which it could not logically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"705\">*705</page-number>extricate itself. The wcac majority argued that, although the Public School Employees Retirement Act was not in relevant part amended after 1979, technical amendments after March 31, 1982, constituted a \u201crenewal\u201d or \u201centering into\u201d of a disability pension plan. The original statute had no expiration date or sunset clause, however, and thus the Legislature simply \u201ccontinued\u201d the program rather than \u201crenewed\u201d it. Likewise, the Legislature, if it did anything, \u201ccreated\u201d a pension program rather than \u201centered into\u201d one, the latter term usually applying to contractual obligations, not statutory enactments.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-3\">For like reason, it is irrelevant to this case, as the WCAC majority concluded, whether plaintiff or defendant had the burden of proof with respect to the application of subparagraph 14. Because that subparagraph does not apply by its terms, being limited to \u201cplans\u201d and having no application to \u201cprograms,\u201d evidentiary technicalities need not be considered. It may be that the employee should have the burden of proof, but the employer, who knows the details and dates of \u201centering into\u201d and \u201crenewing\u201d such plans, may have the burden of coming forward with evidence\u2014 an issue to be addressed in some proper case and on which at this time we express no opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b719-5\">R J. Sullivan, J., concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b719-6\">Smolensk, P.J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGi4\">(dissenting). I respectfully dissent. I disagree that the plaintiffs disability pension under the Public School Employees Retirement Act (psera), MCL 38.1301 <em>et seq.-, </em>MSA 15.893(111) <em>et seq., </em>is received under a \u201cprogram\u201d but not a \u201cplan\u201d and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>therefore, subject to coordination by virtue of \u00a7 354(1) (d) of the Worker\u2019s Disability Compensation Act (WDCA), MCL 418.354(l)(d); MSA 17.237(354)(l)(d). Rather, for the reasons that follow, I would hold that plaintiff\u2019s disability pension is excepted from coordination by virtue of \u00a7 354(14) of the wdca. I would reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">As stated in the majority opinion, the Worker\u2019s Compensation Appellate Commission concluded that \u00a7 354(14) was simply inapplicable to the legislatively mandated disability pension at issue in this case because that subsection was intended to apply to private-sector pension plans negotiated through the collective bargaining process. I acknowledge that a legislative analysis of \u00a7 354 somewhat supports this construction, particularly with respect to the second sentence of \u00a7 354(14). See Senate Analysis Section, SB 573 et al, January 7, 1982, noting that under Senate Bill 595, which was subsequently enacted as 1981 PA 203, \u00a7 354 of the WDCA, worker\u2019s compensation benefits would be coordinated with \u201cpension and retirement benefits,\u201d although \u201c[disability pensions [sic] plans could be exempted from coordination under a collective bargaining agreement under certain conditions.\u201d However, this same analysis also provides in relevant part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b720-5\">[Senate bills 595 and 591] would apply to any of the specified benefits paid or payable after the effective date of the bills except for benefits received or to be received under a disability pension plan provided by the same employer liable for payments under the act and existing on the effective date of the bill. Any disability pension plan entered into or renewed after that date could provide that benefits paid under that disability pension plan would not be coordinated with benefits paid under the act. <em>(NOTE: </em>The bill would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>also allow a disability pension plan to be exempted from coordination of benefits. The apparent intent of the bill is to draw a distinction between a \u201cdisability insurance policy\u201d or \u201cwage continuation plan\u201d and a \u201cdisability pension plan.\u201d The current language of the bill would require coordination of the first two while allowing the third to be exempted from coordination. <em>However, the bill does not define these three terms and some additional language or technical amendments may be necessary to clarify the legislative </em>intent.) [Senate Analysis Section, SB 573 et al, January 7, 1982 (discussing Senate Bill 595, which was subsequently enacted as 1981 PA 203, \u00a7 354 of the wdca).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Thus, I conclude that the above legislative analysis is not dispositive with regard to the issue whether \u00a7 354(14) was intended by the Legislature to apply only to private-sector pension plans negotiated through the collective bargaining process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Moreover, this Court\u2019s inquiry into the Legislature\u2019s intent when it passes a statute does not begin with legislative analysis. <em>House Speaker v State Administrative Bd, </em>441 Mich 547, 567; 495 NW2d 539 (1993). Rather, the starting point in every case involving statutory construction is the language of the statute itself. <em>Id. </em>I agree with the majority that in construing a statute, effect must be given to every word, sentence, and section if possible, and a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory must be avoided. <em>In re Brzezinski, </em>214 Mich App 652, 663; 542 NW2d 871 (1995). However, another rule of statutory construction provides that a particular format may be chosen by the drafters for clarity of form rather than to create a substantive meaning. <em>In re Marin, </em>198 Mich App 560, 563; 499 NW2d 400 (1993). Moreover, in construing a statute, every word or phrase of the statute should be accorded its plain and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>ordinary meaning, taking into account the context in which the words are used. MCL 8.3a; MSA 2.212(1); <em>In re PSC\u2019s Determination Regarding Coin-Operated Telephones, No 2, </em>204 Mich App 350, 353; 514 NW2d 775 (1994). Where, as here, terms are not defined, resort to a dictionary definition is appropriate. <em>People v Lee, </em>447 Mich 552, 558; 526 NW2d 882 (1994). \u201cPlan\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201ca <em>program </em>for specified benefits, needs, etc.: <em>a pension plan.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1992) (emphasis supplied, in part). \u201cProgram\u201d is defined, in relevant part, as \u201c1. a <em>plan </em>of action to accomplish a specified end. 2. a schedule of activities, procedures, etc., to be followed. ... 6. a <em>planned, </em>coordinated group of activities, procedures, etc., often for a specific purpose: <em>a drug rehabilitation program.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1992) (emphasis supplied, in part). Thus, if plaintiff\u2019s disability pension is a program and, more specifically, a program of benefits, then it is also a plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Statutory language should be construed reasonably, keeping in mind the purpose of the act. <em>Barr v Mount Brighton Inc, </em>215 Mich App 512, 516; 546 NW2d 273 (1996). The wdca is remedial and should be interpreted in a liberal and humanitarian manner in favor of the employee. <em>Matney v Southfield Bowl, </em>218 Mich App 475, 486; 554 NW2d 356 (1996). Thus, I find that it is not possible to conclude that, as used in \u00a7 354(1) (d), the term \u201cprogram\u201d refers only to a govemmentally created system of reimbursement, and that, as used in \u00a7 354(1) and (14), the term \u201cplan\u201d is limited only to private-sector, collectively bargained disability pensions. Rather, I would construe the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"709\">*709</page-number>\u201cplan,\u201d as used in \u00a7 354(14), as encompassing the disability pension received by plaintiff under the psera.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">I would further hold that plaintiffs disability pension comes within the remaining terms of \u00a7 354(14). The first sentence of \u00a7 354(14) provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-6\">This section does not apply to any payments received or to be received under a disability pension plan provided by the same employer which plan is in existence on March 31, 1982.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b723-7\">As discussed above, the monthly payments received by plaintiff were received under a disability pension \u201cplan.\u201d Nor is there any question, as acknowledged by the WCAC, that plaintiffs disability pension plan was in existence on March 31, 1982. See 1980 PA 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-8\">The question remains whether the payments were \u201creceived . . . under a disability pension plan <em>provided by the same employer </em>. . . .\u201d \u201cProvided\u201d is defined as \u201cto make available; furnish: <em>to provide employees with benefits.\u201d Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1992). The Legislature enacted the psera. However, defendant was required to contribute to the plan and was considered the employer for purposes of the plan. See, generally, the psera, MCL 38.1301 <em>et seq.) </em>MSA 15.893(111) <em>et seq. </em>Accordingly, defendant made available or furnished and, therefore, \u201cprovided\u201d the plan at issue in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-9\">The second sentence of \u00a7 354(14) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b723-10\">Any disability pension plan entered into or renewed after March 31, 1982 may provide that the payments under that disability pension plan provided by the employer shall not be coordinated pursuant to this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>Plaintiff argues that the wcac erred in determining that his disability pension plan was not excepted from coordination because it had been \u201crenewed\u201d after March 31, 1982. Specifically, plaintiff contends that the process of signing a new collective bargaining agreement did not constitute a renewal of the plan. Plaintiff also contends that amendments of the psera did not constitute a renewal of the plan. I agree. \u201cRenewed\u201d is defined as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-5\">1. to begin or take up again; resume .... 2. to make effective for an additional period. 3. to restore or replenish.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b724-6\">4. to make, say or do again. 5. to revive; reestablish. ... 7. to restore to a former state. 8. to begin again; recommence. <em>[Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(1992).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In this case, the plan was entirely statutory. Thus, the parties could not, through collective bargaining, alter the plan in any manner. A review of the July 1988 collective bargaining agreement involved in this case, which does not refer to the retirement system established by the psera in any substantive fashion, reflects this fact.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> conclude that the July 1988 collective bargaining agreement did not \u201creestablish\u201d or \u201cmake [the statutory disability pension plan] effective for an additional period\u201d and, therefore, renew, the disability pension plan at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">As noted by both the wcac and defendant, various sections of the psera have been amended since March 31, 1982. However, neither the \u201cdisability allowance\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>provision contained in \u00a7 86 of the psera, MCL 38.1386; MSA 15.893(196), which both parties contend is the dispositive provision in this case, nor the \u201cduty disability retirement allowance\u201d provision of \u00a7 87 of the PSERA, MCL 38.1387; MSA 15.893(197), has been amended since 1980. Rather, these sections of the psera have continued in full force and effect without change since 1980. I fail to see how amendments of other sections of the PSERA would \u201creestablish\u201d or \u201cmake [the disability provisions] effective for an additional period.\u201d See also MCL 8.3u; MSA 2.212(21) (\u201cThe provisions of any law or statute which is reenacted, amended or revised, so far as they are the same as those of prior laws, shall be construed as a continuation of such laws and not as new amendments.\u201d). Accordingly, I agree with plaintiff that any amendments of the psera after March 31, 1982, did not \u201crenew\u201d \u00a7\u00a786 and 87 of the psera.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">In summary, then, payments from plaintiffs disability pension are potentially subject to coordination where the disability pension is maintained by defendant under \u00a7 354(1). However, I would hold that plaintiffs disability pension is excepted from coordination by \u00a7 354(14) because it is a disability pension plan provided by the same employer that was in existence on March 31, 1982, and not thereafter renewed. I would reverse in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">In light of this holding, I would decline to consider plaintiffs argument that a coordination of benefits in this case would violate Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 10 (prohibiting the impairment of contracts) or Const 1963, art 9, \u00a7 24 (prohibiting the impairment of the accrued financial benefits of state-provided pension plans and retirement systems).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b724-9\"> The only reference to the psera in the July 1, 1988, collective bargaining agreement is in Article XIX, section 3 of the agreement, which provides that an employee must be eligible for \u201cimmediate cash payments under the Michigan Public School Employees Retirement System by reason of death, disability, or meeting age requirements\u201d in order for the employee to be eligible for $100 a year retirement pay from defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
