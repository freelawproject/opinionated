Malcolm, </em>attorney, and <em>John E. Burrill, </em>of counsel for appellant, urged;</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A2\">I. The evidence clearly established that the defendant James F. Keyes received no consideration for the notes. If it be claimed that there was any doubt on that point, the defendant was entitled to have the cause submitted to the jury (Stone <em>v. </em>Flower, 47 <em>N. </em>Y. <em>R. </em>566; Buckman <em>v. </em>Jenks, 55 <em>Barb. </em>468, 473).</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b31-16\">II. The claim of the plaintiffs that they had paid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>value for the note by receiving it in payment of the debt due by Christopher Keyes to them was disputed by defendant, and there was a direct conflict on this point which entitled the defendant to have the case submitted to the jury. Same cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b32-5\">III. If it be claimed that for any other reason the plaintiffs could recover against the defendant, James F. Keyes, although Christopher Keyes could not, then we submit there was evidence sufficient to go to the jury on the question whether the note was made by James F. Keyes at the request and for the accommodation of the plaintiffs, and also on the question whether-it was not made and delivered on the faith of the representations of the plaintiff that it was a mere matter of form. Same cases.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b32-6\"><em>Nelson Smith, </em>attorney, and of counsel for respondent, urged;</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Am-\">I. The defendant\u2019s exception to the direction, by the court, for the jury to find a verdict for plaintiff, is not well taken. The defendant, James F. Keyes, was, <em>prima facie, </em>liable on the notes as maker,, and he had shown nothing which released him from his-liability (Schepp <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>602, and cases there cited). The question here presented is a simple, although an important one. Simple, as involving but one principle of law. Important, because a decision adverse to thp plaintiffs will unsettle great numbers of transactions in commercial paper. It is an every-day occurrence, in business, for a creditor to take his debtor\u2019s paper with a \u201cgood indorser,\u201d to such an extent, that almost the first question which a creditor asks of a debtor who is desirous of not being pressed for a cash payment of his debt, is about: the security. \u201c Can you give me a good indorser? \u201d It was so in this-case where James F. Keyes himself says : \u201c My father said \u2018 (Nesbit) said he wanted your notes so that he could raise money on them,\u2019 because he could not raise-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>money on my father's notes.\u2019. The debtor, therefore, does as the creditor desires. A third party indorses\u2014 or makes\u2014the notes for the accommodation of the debtor. It is understood between all parties that they are bound, else why go through such a useless formality <em>% </em>Does the law then step in and say no ? Does it release the party, when he, himself, expected and intended to be bound? We submit not. This case is, however, a much stronger one than the illustration, or than the case of Schepp v. Carpenter <em>[supra). </em>For here it was not so much \u201caccommodation\u201d to Christopher Keyes, as it was payment of his debt. The plaintiffs took these notes for their debt, where plaintiff, FTesbit, says \u201c Mr. James F. Keyes drew three notes. Mr. Christopher Keyes gave me the three notes, and I indorsed and gave him a receipt on his bill for each and every note; squared the bill up.\u201d It would not be pretended that James F. Keyes might not, if he chose, have paid his father\u2019s debt to the plaintiff in cash. But where is the difference between giving the cash and giving the note ? His father\u2019s debt to the plaintiffs, if he so chose to consider it, as he did in this case, was as much a consideration in the one case as in the other. Certainly, if he had paid the cash, he could not have recovered it back on the ground of failure of consideration, or that there was no consideration. How then can he defeat a recovery on his note upon the same state of facts ? He showed, therefore, no ground, lefeating his <em>prima facie </em>liability on the note, and the court, in directing a verdict for the plaintiffs, committed no error. (2.) The notice of mechanics\u2019 lien made-no element in the case, (a.) The rights of the parties in this case became fixed December 20, 1873, at the time when the note was made, signed, indorsed and delivered, and they could not be affected by filing of a lien long subsequently. (5.) There is nothing in the notice at all conflicting with any testimony in this case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>or showing anything to defeat plaintiffs\u2019 <em>prima facie </em>right of recovery. It shows nothing, except that plaintiffs simply wished to do all they could to get their money.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b34-5\">By the Court.\u2014Freedman, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ad\">If the evidence given on the part of the defense had simply showed that the appellant made the note in question for the accommodation and general benefit of his father, Christopher Keyes, that it was delivered to the latter without restrictions as to the manner of its use, and that thereupon the latter indorsed and delivered it to the plaintiffs, the appellant was clearly liable on it, though he had. received no consideration for making it (Schepp <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 51 <em>N. Y. </em>602, affirming S. C., 49 <em>Barb. </em>542; Cole <em>v. </em>Saulpaugh, 48 <em>Barb. </em>104). But the evidence went beyond this, it tended to show, and if credited by the jury, would have authorized the jury to find that the note was made at the request of, and for the accommodation of the plaintiffs, and without any consideration whatsoever as between them and the appellant. This the appellant had a right to prove, for the consideration of a negotiable paper is examinable as between the original parties to that paper, and hence it may always be shown, as between such parties, that there was no original consideration, or that the original consideration has wholly failed.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">The appellant was, therefore, entitled to have the case submitted to the jury, and the direction of a verdict against him constituted error.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The judgment and order appealed from should be severally reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">Curtis and Speir, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
