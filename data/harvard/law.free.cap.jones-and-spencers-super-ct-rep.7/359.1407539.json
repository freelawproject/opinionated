A different practice would lead to abuses difficult to check.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b367-7\">Before Sedgwick and Speir, JJ.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"b367-8\"><em>Decided May </em>3, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b367-9\">Appeal from order, directing a re-taxation of costs. The plaintiff took out an order to examine himself and other persons as \"witnesses, under a commission issued to London. The plaintiff who lived in London, was, in fact, the only witness examined. The plaintiff recovering judgment, the clerk in taxing his costs allowed, as a disbursement, the amount paid to the commissioner as fees. The court below ordered a re-taxation, disallowing the commissioner\u2019s fees. The appeal is from this order.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-10\"><em>George De Forest </em>Lord, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b367-11\"><em>Benj.
