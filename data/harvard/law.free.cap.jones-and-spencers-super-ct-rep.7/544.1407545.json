REJECTION OF EVIDENCE.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b552-13\">1. <em>Of evidence offered to disprove a fact sought to be proved by plaintiff to maintain his </em>case, <em>when not cause for reversal.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>a. </em>When the/ac# <em>itself is unimportant </em>by reason of the plaintiff's case being otherwise sufficiently maintained upon the undisputed evidence.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b553-5\">2. <em>Of evidence offered to prove damages\u2014when not cause for reversal, a. </em>When it appears that <em>no right to damages exists.</em></headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b553-6\">Before Monell, Ch. J., and Sedgwick, J.</p>\n<otherdate data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"otherdate\" id=\"b553-7\"><em>Heard March, </em>1875;</otherdate>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AmF\"><em>Decided May </em>3, 1875.</decisiondate>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-8\"><em>Thomas </em>Darlington, for the appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b553-9\"><em>John E. Parsons, </em>for the respondent.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-10\">The action was brought to recover for goods sold and delivered, to wit, divers lots of paper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-11\">The answer among other things set up as a counterclaim, that plaintiffs and defendants entered into an agreement, whereby plaintiffs agreed to make and furnish to defendants by a certain time a certain quantity of paper, for which defendants agreed to pay a reasonble or the market price thereof; that plaintiffs had failed to perform the agreement, and that defendants had sustained damage to the amount of three thousand dollars ; but the answer did not aver any demand for performance made by defendants, or any performance, or any offer or readiness to perform on the part of the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-12\">On the trial the complaint was sustained by proof of the deliveries of paper generally, of the sending to defendants of a bill of goods, with the charges and prices particularly stated, and of a promise by defendant to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b553-13\">The defendant\u2019s testimony denied that they had made any promise to pay the bill as rendered, but in the course of their testimony it was shown that the bill had been received by them, and that with the exception of an item of paper alleged to have been delivered in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"546\">*546</page-number>October, there was no denial that the lots of paper as specified in the bill had been delivered ; the only complaint was that the various lots did not contain the number of pounds stated in the. bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-5\">Although the defendants proved that they had weighed the different lots, yet they gave no proof as to the extent of the deficiency. The proof as to this was not definite enough to allow the defendants to ask a reduction of any specific amount. Indeed they made no such claim before the jury. None of the lots of goods were returned or attempted to be returned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-6\">After one of defendants had on his direct examination given evidence as to the alleged promise to pay, he was cross-examined on that subject and the cross-examination was of such a character as justified on the redirect an inquiry as to all that the witness remembered on that subject, yet such inquiry on the re-direct was under plaintiff\u2019s objection excluded, and defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-7\">Held, under the first proposition, and the first subdivision of the second proposition of the head-notes, that the error in this ruling did not call for a reversal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-8\">On the trial defendant put numerous questions with a view of proving the damages alleged in the counteraction, all of which were objected to, and the objections sustained, to which defendants excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-9\">There was no proof that defendants ever demanded the paper referred to in the counter-claim or that they ever offered to pay cash therefor, or that they were ever ready or able to pay therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-10\">Held, that the defendants had not shown sufficient performance, or tender of performance on his part to entitled him to damages ; and, therefore,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b554-11\">Held, that under the second subdivision of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>second proposition of the head-notes, the exclusion of \u25a0the evidence constituted real cause for reversal.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b555-5\">Sedgwick, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AbM\">wrote for affirmance of the judgment which had been rendered for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Monell, Ch.
