Wallace Perkins and requested him to indorse the same, but said Perkins refused to do so, and, although frequently requested, has ever since neglected and refused to indorse the same, whereof defendant had notice; by means whereof defendant became liable to pay to plaintiffs the sum of money therein mentioned on the 16th day of June, 1870, when the same became due and payable, but defendant refused, and although often requested, has ever since neglected and refused to pay the same or any part thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-11\">\u201cWherefore plaintiffs demand judgment,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b21-12\">The answer admitted the making of the note and its delivery to William Wallace Perkins, but denied that said Perkins indorsed and delivered said note for value, before maturity, to plaintiffs; and averred that said note was an accommodation note, made solely for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>the accommodation of said Perkins, and without any consideration passing to the defendant, of which fact plaintiffs had full knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-5\">Defendant also alleged that at or about the time the said promissory note fell due, to wit, April 14, 1870, he was informed by said Perkins, that he, Perkins, had arranged witli the plaintiffs, that five hundred dollars should be paid on account of said note and a renewal note given for sixty days for the balance, and that, in pursuance of said arrangement, he paid plaintiffs five hundred dollars, and made and delivered to plaintiffs the promissory note set forth in the complaint. But he denied that such payment was made and renewal note given in pursuance of any agreement made by him with the plaintiffs; and he also denied that he at any time agreed with plaintiffs, that said William Wallace Perkins should indorse the note last mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-6\">At the trial defendant moved for a dismissal of the complaint, on the ground that the plaintiffs had failed to prove title to the note ; that the request to Perkins and his refusal <em>to </em>indorse did not operate as a transfer of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b22-7\">The motion was denied, and defendant excepted.

Stat. </em>5th ed. 67, \u00a7 1).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">\u201cThe payees and indorsees of every such note payable to them or their order, and the holders of every such note payable to bearer, may maintain actions for the sums of money therein mentioned against the makers and indorsers of the same respectively, in like manner as in cases of inland bills of exchange, and not otherwise\u201d <em>(lb. </em>\u00a74).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">According to the custom of merchants, when a not\u00e9is made payable to the order of the maker, or of a third person as payee therein named, the name of such maker or payee must appear as the first indorsement.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">But in some instances title to a note may be-acquired without such indorsement. The delivery of a promissory note by the payee for a valuable consideration, without indorsement, is an assignment of the note, and conveys all his property therein. In such case the holder stands in the relation of assignee of a chose in action, and not in the relation of an indorsee, and, therefore, holds the note subject to the equities-existing between the original parties (Franklin Bank <em>v. </em>Raymond, 3 <em>Wend. </em>69). Formerly he could not maintain an action upon it in his own name. But since the Code, the action must be brought in his name, he being the real party in interest <em>(Code </em>\u00a7 111; Savage <em>v. </em>Bevier, 12 <em>How. Pr. R. </em>166; Marine Bank v. Vail, 6 <em>Bosw. </em>421).</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">Defendant\u2019s motion for a dismissal of the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>was made on the sole ground, that the plaintiffs had failed to prove title to the note, or a valid transfer of the same by Perkins to them. This ground being untenable, and there being no other ground incapable of being obviated, the motion was properly denied, and as no other motion or request was made on the ground of the supposed existence of the equities hereinafter referred to, nor any evidence given on the part of the defense, the court could not do otherwise than direct a verdict for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">I have thus far considered the question presented by defendant\u2019s exception to the refusal to nonsuit, from, the standpoint most favorable to the defendant, namely, upon the assumption that the action was brought solely upon the second note of fifteen hundred and eighteen dollars. But such is not the fact. The complaint set out, and plaintiffs\u2019 proof at the trial established, not only the title of the plaintiffs to, and their right to recover on the said note, as against the only objection which was urged against their right of recovery, but also the facts and circumstances which led the defendant to give, and the plaintiffs to accept, the said note. These facts and circumstances furnished strong additional reasons for defendant\u2019s liability. True, they showed, among other things, that the first note for two thousand dollars had been made and delivered to William Wallace Perkins for his accommodation. But that constituted no available defense on that note as against the plaintiffs, who discounted it for the benefit of Perkins. This was fully conceded before us by the learned counsel of the defendant. Upon the maturity of that note, which had been indorsed by Perkins, the liability of the defendant and of Perkins to the plaintiffs for the amount thereof became fixed. Perkins, at defendant\u2019s request, then arranged that the plaintiffs should receive five hundred dollars on account thereof; that for the balance they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>should accept a new note made by the defendant to the order of, and indorsed by Perkins, and that they should deliver up the old note. This arrangement was communicated by Perkins to the defendant, and the latter not only agreed to it, but he also carried it into effect, so far as he had the power to do it. He made out a new note for fifteen hundred and eighteen dollars, payable to the order of Perkins, and delivered the same, together with the sum of five hundred dollars, not to Perkins, but at Perkins\u2019 request, to the plaintiffs, and thereupon received from them the two thousand dollar note. Having thus procured a surrender of the evidence of his original indebtedness, and voluntarily bound himself anew directly to the plaintiffs, so far as that was possible for him to do under the arrangement so made, and it being the manifest intention of all the parties when the said arrangement was made, and of the defen dant-when he carried the same into effect, and of the plaintiffs, when they gave up the old note and accepted the new one in lieu thereof, that Perkins should indorse the new note, the defendant can not be permitted to avail himself of the subsequent wrongful refusal of Perkins to indorse. The second note was transferred to the plaintiffs by the joint act of Perkins and the defendant, as an obligation by which the defendant meant to bind himself to the plaintiffs, and, hence, the case is not within the rule which, but for that fact, would constitute the plaintiffs mere assignees, who, as such, hold the note subject to the equities existing between Perkins and the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">The remaining objections and exceptions contained in the case have not been alluded to in the points of the appellant, and, consequently, may be deemed to have been waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">Curtis and Speir, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
