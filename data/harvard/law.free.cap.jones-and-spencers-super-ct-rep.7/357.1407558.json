That general term directed that judgment be entered for plaintiff in the sum of two hundred and eighty-one dollars and forty-four cents. The facts of the case, and the opinions of the judges, appear in this report at page 40.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b365-11\"><em>J.

The rule of law involved is important, and affects many persons that hold, in the large and varied business of this state, the relations that subsisted between the parties to this action. As yet, the court of last resort in this state has not settled the principles that should control. In Hunt v. Roberts (45 <em>N. Y. </em>696), Judge Rapallo, said that the court \u201c was clearly of opinion that after a breach which will justify the termination of the contract, the surety has the right to require that the contract with the principal be terminated, and the claim against the surety confined to the damages then recoverable.\u201d Whether such a rule is to be applied, through inferences to be drawn from it, to a case like the present, has not been determined, so far as I know, by the court of error or of appeals. These considerations bring the present motion within Butterfield v. Radde (38 <em>N. Y. Sup\u2019r Ct. </em>44).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The motion that defendants have leave to appeal to the court of appeals, should be granted, on condition that defendants give notice of appeal, and file security within thirty days. In case of perfecting the appeal there should be ten dollars costs of motion and disbursements, to abide event, otherwise the plaintiff to have the like amount of costs and their disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">Speir, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
