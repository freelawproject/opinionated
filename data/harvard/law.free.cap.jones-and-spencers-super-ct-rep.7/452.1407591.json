In that month he mortgaged the lot to one Quackenbush.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-7\">In June, 1855, an action was commenced to foreclose the mortgage, and a judgment of foreclosure and sale was entered December 6, 1855, which judgment was assigned to Mary J. Watson. The premises were sold under the judgment in August, 1858, bid in by, and conveyed to Mrs. Watson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-8\">It was claimed on the part of the defendants, that the assignment to Mrs. Watson of the judgment, and the conveyance to her on the foreclosure sale, was merely nominal. That the money was furnished by her mother, Mary Lotta, to whom it was claimed the-property\u2014although <em>legally </em>vested in Mrs. Watson\u2014 in reality belonged.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-9\">In August, 1859, Mrs. Watson conveyed the premises to Tates, Porterfield &amp; Wells. The deed was-absolute on its face, and was recorded as a conveyance, and not as a mortgage ; but it was executed and delivered under the following circumstances:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-10\">Mrs. Watson applied to Yates, Porterfield &amp; Wells-for a loan, and as security offered a deed of these premises. The loan was made, and the deed taken <em>as security.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-11\">In the same month (August, 1859), Isabella Berrand (a daughter of Mrs. Lotta) went to Yates, Porterfield &amp; Wells, expressing dissatisfaction with the conveyance to them, claiming that the property belonged to-Mrs. Lotta, and then and there paid to them a part of the loan ; and subseqently (in June, 1860) paid to them the remainder, and then demanded a conveyance-by them to Mrs. Lotta of the property. Ho conveyance was ever given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b461-12\">In 1861 or 1862, Mary J. Watson died intestate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>and it was claimed that she was the equitable owner of the premises, subject only to her conveyance by way of mortgage to Yates, Porterfield &amp; Wells.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-5\">Upon the death intestate of Mrs. Watson, without issue, the property, or such right and interest as she had, descended or passed to her mother, Mary Lotta (for life), with the reversion to her brother and sister \u2014Robert Lotta and Mrs. Berrand, as her heirs-at-law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-6\">At and previous to the death of Mrs. Watson, Mrs. Lotta was in possession of the property, and remained in possession until her own death in December, 1864.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-7\">After Mrs. Lotta\u2019s death, Mrs. Berrand had the possession, collected the rents, and exercised general acts of ownership over the property, claiming it as her own.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-8\">At the time of the death of Mrs. Watson she was indebted to Mrs. Hudson, the plaintiff in this action, to recover which she commenced in June, 1869, an action in the supreme court of this state. The action was against Isabella Berrand and Robert Lotta (among \u25a0others) as the heirs-at-law of Mrs. Watson, to enforce payment out of property inherited by them from Mrs. Watson, the debtor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-9\">The complaint in that action alleged that Mrs. Watson, \u201cat the time of her decease, <em>was seized and possessed in fee </em>of the following real estate, namely,\u201d describing the lot in question. That the\" said real \u25a0estate, on the decease of Mrs. Watson, descended to the defendants \u201c Isabella Berrand and Robert Lotta, as her heirs-at-law.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b462-10\">A judgment was demanded against such defendants \u201cas the heirs-at-law of Mary J. Watson,\u201d and \u201cthat the plaintiff might have execution thereof, of the before \u25a0described real estate only, and not otherwise, and that as against the plaintiff and as against all persons claiming under the judgment-and execution, the other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>-defendants be barred of all right, title, and interest in said premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-5\">The summons and complaint in that action were duly served on Mrs. Berrand and Robert Lotta. Mrs. Berrand appeared in the action and answered the complaint. Robert Lotta did not appear. Mrs. Berrand, <em>denied </em>that Mrs. Watson was seized in fee of' the premises, or that it had descended to her and her brother, Robert Lotta, as the heirs-at-law of Mrs. Watson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-6\">She then set up the said mortgage from Burke to Quackenboss, the suit to foreclose same, and the recovery of a decree therein; and further that Burke requested Mary Lotta, her mother, and the mother of said Mary J. Watson, to purchase said decree, which she consented to do, and did purchase said decree for one thousand dollars ; but that being old and infirm, she delivered said one thousand dollars to said Mary J. Watson, to complete said purchase and take an assignment of said decree to her, said Mary Lotta ; but instead thereof, said Mary J. Watson \u201c erroneously and inadvertently \u201d took an assignment to herself in her own name ; that interest was thenceforth, until August, 1858, paid on said decree to said Mary Lotta; that after-wards said Mary Lotta caused said premises to be sold under said decree, and they were bid in by her agent, Mary J. Watson, who \u201c erroneously and inadvertently\u201d took the title to said premises in her name, but who in her lifetime \u201c never claimed or pretended to be the real owner thereof, or that she had the same in any other capacity than as agent of, and for the use, and subject to the direction and control of the said Mary Lotta, deceased, and not otherwise.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b463-7\">She further alleged that notwithstanding that the premises were conveyed to said Mary J. Watson, the said Mary Lotta, from the date of the sheriff\u2019s deed to Mrs. Watson to the time of her decease, was in pos<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>session of the premises, receiving the rents and profits; that Mrs. Lotta died in possession of the premises, leaving a last will, wherein she devised unto her (Mrs. Berrand), all her real and personal estate, under which devise she claimed to be the \u201c sole, true, and equitable owner of the premises.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-5\">\u00a1Neither of the defendants appeared at the trial. The action was tried by the court without a jury, and the following facts and conclusions were made:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-6\">That by a certain indenture dated August 13, 1858, made between James G. Willett, sheriff of the city and county of \u00a1New York, of the first part, and Mary J. Watson of the second part, the said James 0. Willett, as such sheriff, conveyed to said Mary J. Watson, in fee, the premises described in the complaint, and she thereupon entered into possession thereof, and that said real estate is of the value of five thousand dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-7\">That the father of said Mary J. Watson predeceased her ; that said Mary J. Watson at the time of her decease left no child her surviving, but left her surviving her mother, Mary Lotta, since deceased, and one brother, \u00a1Robert Lotta, and one sister, Isabella Berrand.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-8\">The following were the conclusions of law :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b464-9\">I.

That said bond remains unpaid, and that there is now due to the plaintiffs thereon, the sum of three thousand three hundred and fifty-one dollars and sixty-two cents for principal, and eleven hundred and fourteen dollars and thirty-eight cents for interest thereon,, making in all forty-four hundred and sixty-six dollars-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>Upon these findings a judgment was entered that the plaintiff have execution thereof, \u201c out of the real estate in the complaint described, only, and not otherwise ; and that as against the plaintiff, and as against all persons claiming under the judgment and execution the other defendants be barred,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-5\">Under an execution upon the judgment, the sheriff sold the lot in question, and in August, 1871, conveyed it to Mrs. Hudson, the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-6\">The action was tried by the late chief justice and a jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-7\">Upon proof of the facts hereinbefore stated, the court directed a verdict for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-8\">The plaintiff excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b465-9\">Judgment upon the verdict was suspended, and the exceptions directed to be heard in the first instance at the general term.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-10\"><em>J. </em>Townshend, for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b465-11\"><em>H.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AqT\">The sheriff\u2019s deed to Mrs. Watson, executed and delivered under the foreclosure judgment of the Burke mortgage, vested her with <em>legal </em>title to the premises. Any equity existing in Mrs. Lotta, arising from her having advanced the money to purchase the judgment, did not, of itself, divest the legal estate from Mrs. Watson (1 <em>B. S. </em>728, \u00a7\u00a7 51, 52), and her subsequent conveyance to Yates, Porterfield &amp; Wells, although intended as a mortgage, vested them with the legal title,' subject only to a defeasance upon establishing the nature of the conveyance.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">It is conceded that the conveyance was as a security for a loan. Thus, in effect, the grantees became mortgagees, and the equity of redemption remained in Mrs. Watson, the grantor.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>It is possible that Mrs. Lotta, being in possession and claiming to own the property, having paid the loan, had an equitable right to be subrogated to the rights and interests of the mortgagees, and could, irrespective of her claim under the alleged trust existing between herself and Mrs. Watson, have insisted upon payment of the sum by Mrs. Watson ; or could have acquired the rights of the mortagees, as the equitable assignee of the mortgage, and compelled its payment by action of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">So again, at any time during the life and -even after the decease of Mrs. Watson, the equity arising under the alleged trust could have been enforced, and the legal estate of Mrs. Watson divested in favor of Mrs. Lotta, who thereupon could have redeemed the premises from the mortgage to Yates Porterfield &amp; Wells.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">But at the decease of Mrs. Watson the <em>legal </em>title was still in Yates Porterfield &amp; Wells with the equitable title still in Mrs. Watson. The only right or interest in Mrs. Lotta, was under an unasserted and unrecognized implied, or equitable, trust, or else under some possible right acquired by payment of the loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Down, therefore, to the commencement of the present plaintiff\u2019s action in the supreme court, the rights and interest of the several parties were unchanged. Mrs. Watson died, and whatever rights she had passed to her mother and brother and sister, subject of course, if she was the owner, to the payment of her debts. Mrs. Lotta 'was and remained in possession, claiming as owner, until her decease, when all the rights she had passed to Mrs. Berrand, as her devisee.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">The theory of the action in the supreme court, was, that Mrs. Watson had seizin <em>in fee, </em>which descended to her heirs-at-law. That theory negated any seizin or other right in Mrs. Lotta, or in Mrs. Berrand, under Mrs. Lotta\u2019s will. The allegation in the complaint was to that effect, and the judgment so determined. Neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>Mrs. Lotta, during her life, nor Mrs. Berrand after Mrs.. Lotta\u2019s death, asserted or attempted to assert, any of the equitable rights or interests which it was and is-claimed she possessed. But having been in uninterrupted possession of the premises for some ten or more years, they seem to have deemed it unnecessary to defend their possession against the attempt to obtain payment of Mrs. Watson\u2019s debts out of their alleged inheritance.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">The action in the supreme court was prosecuted under the Revised Statutes (2 <em>R. S. </em>452, \u00a7 32), which' provides that the heirs of every person who shall have died intestate . . . shall respectively be liable forth e debts of such person ... to the extent of the estate, interest, and right in the real estate which shall' have descended to them, from . . such person ; and the question which prominently presents itself, is, whether the judgment in that action, and the title made under it, is not conclusive upon Mrs. Berrand, and those claiming under her.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">Judgments of courts of competent jurisdiction are-conclusive, as to the parties and privies, as to the subject-matter adjudicated upon ; and such parties are estopped from afterwards litigating the same subject matter, in any form of action whatever.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">So that if the <em>seizin </em>of Mrs. Watson, and the inheritance of the estate by Mrs. Berrand and her brother, as the heirs-at-law of Mrs. Watson, were adjudicated in that suit, all the parties are estopped from disputing-the conclusion in any other action.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">Thus in Oatram <em>v. </em>Morewood (3 <em>East R. </em>346), it was held, that if a verdict be found on any fact or title, distinctly put in issue in an action, such verdict may be pleaded by way of estoppel in another action, between the same parties or their privies, in respect to-the same fact or title.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">It was necessary in the action to compel the pay<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>ment of Mrs. Watson\u2019s debts, to establish her <em>seizin </em>of the property, or of some vendable or leviable interest in it. If she had no title or interest, it could not be subject to her debts. The statute provides (2 <em>R. S. </em>453, \u00a7 36), that it shall be incumbent on the creditor seeking to charge any heirs, to show the facts and circumstances therein required to render them liable. And the heir is allowed to take issue upon those facts, and it is only upon its appearing that any lands or tenements have <em>descended </em>to the heir, that such lands can be held for the payment of debts, and to create a descent there must have been a <em>seizin </em>in the person from whom the lands descended.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The statute regulating proceedings against heirs or devisees (2 <em>R. S. </em>454 \u00a7 54) provides that the judgment shall direct the debt to be levied of such real estate as shall <em>appear </em>to have descended, and not otherwise and gives it a preference, as a lien on the real estate descended, to any judgment or decree against the heir personally for any debt or demand in his own right.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">This, therefore, seems to me to be a clear case of estoppel by record, shutting out the defense set up in the answer; and estopping Mrs. Berrand and her grantee from claiming title through or under Mrs. Lotta. As to that subject it was fully and directly litigated in the supreme court suit, where the only legitimate inquiry related to the seizin of Mrs. Watson.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">Mrs. Berrand contested that question, and claimed title in herself under the will of Mrs. Lotta, setting up substantially the same facts, which she now claims constituted Mrs. Lotta\u2019s equitable title to the premises. That issue was adjudged against her, and in this action the former adjudication must be regarded as <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">One or two citations are sufficient for the principle. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>In Doty v. Brown (4 <em>N. Y. </em>71), the general proposition is stated to be that the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction upon a question directly involved in the suit is conclusive in a second suit between the same parties, depending on the same question, although the subject-matter of the second action be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">In Castle v. Noyes (14 <em>Id. </em>329), the action involved the <em>title </em>to personal property. The action was to recover its possession. One Houghton was the common source of title. The plaintiff claimed under a chattel mortgage executed by Houghton, and the defendant under a judgment and execution against Houghton. The defendant attempted to impeach the mortgage, which was met by proof of a former recovery in a suit wherein the defendant was plaintiff, and one Burk was defendant, in which Burk was sued for taking a part of the mortgaged property. Burk took the property as the servant of the mortgagees, and justified under the mortgage. The <em>tona Jides </em>of the mortgage was directly involved and contested in that action, and was sustained by the judgment. The court held, that the judgment was conclusive against the defendant\u2019s title in this action. The court say (p. 331) the issue upon his title is precisely the same in this suit as it was in the suit before the justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">In this case the judgment establishing the lien upon the lands as the lands of Mrs. Watson, involving as it did, the whole question of her title, as well as the whole question of the defendant\u2019s title, is an effectual estoppel against Mrs. Berrand, estopping her from now setting up any adverse title in herself, arising from the \u2022same facts or circumstances which she had already set up in the former action, and which, in that action, had been determined against her.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">In this view the plaintiff was entitled to recover. She had acquired a title under a judgment authorizing the sale of the property. The judgment was against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>those now claiming adversely to it, and they are es-topped by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">As the exception to the direction of the learned justice must be sustained, it is not necessary further to inquire whether, independently of the point decided,, the defendants had shown any title whatever in themselves, and, therefore, anything to weaken the plaintiff\u2019s claim under her judgment, which may always be done upon the principle, that in the action of ejectment a defendant may rely to defeat the action upon the weakness of the plaintiff\u2019s title. The evidence of any such right to or interest in the property, was certainly very slight, and probably not sufficient to affect or impair the title which the plaintiff had acquired under her judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The exception to the direction of the court must be sustained, the verdict set aside, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the plaintiff to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">Freedman and Sedgwick, JJ., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
