We had ruled that defendant was entitled to a credit of $8,000 since this was the sum paid by her insurance companies in settlement of the negligence claims in the action. Although not initially raised on the appeal, it was stressed in oral argument and in the petition for rehearing, and noted in our opinion, that $4,000 of the settlement was allocable to plaintiff individually and as administratrix <em>ad prosequendum. </em>Quite clearly, this payment intended to benefit plaintiff individually. The balance of $4,000 was payable to plaintiff as the guardian of her two sons as a wrongful death action recovery. The order reflecting the settlement clearly effectuates this disposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-10\">We are impelled to conclude on this record, despite plaintiff\u2019s failure to crystalize the issue earlier, that the $4,000 allocable to plaintiff, other than in her capacity as guardian for the sons, cannot appropriately be attributed to the wrongful death action award. Plaintiff individually had no viable claim against defendant under the Wrongful Death Act and the ultimate award recovered by plaintiff after trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was solely on behalf of her two sons, decedent\u2019s next of kin. It is only the portion of the previous settlement based upon the wrongful death action claim of the sons which should be credited aginst the wrongful death action award \u2014 this on the thesis that there should be but a single recovery for compensatory damages in a wrongful death action, regardless of the circumstances of the decedent\u2019s demise. Consequently, that part of the settlement in favor of plaintiff individually should not be deducted from the recovery under the Wrongful Death Act. Accordingly, our opinion is amended to reflect that the credit allowable against the wrongful death action damages be $4,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Plaintiff also has raised the question in her petition that prejudgment interest under <em>R. </em>4:42~ll(b) be assessed on the entire amount awarded including survival action damages and funeral expenses. This result was intended by our previous opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">As amended and clarified herein, the judgment below is modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
