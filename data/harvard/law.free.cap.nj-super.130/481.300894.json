A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AgM\">Plaintiffs appeal from a denial of their motion for new trial after an adverse jury verdict, in this automobile negligence action involving the death of a pedestrian. They assert as grounds that the verdict was against the weight of the evidence and that the trial judge erred in permitting defendant to read extensively from his deposition during the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 proofs. We find no merit in either ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-10\"> The accident in question occurred in the early morning dark on Ponte <em>27 </em>in South Brunswick. It was not denied that an automobile operated by defendant struck and killed plaintiffs\u2019 decedent as he was apparently crossing the highway on foot. Defendant testified on his own behalf, and while this testimony may have had some inaccuracies and inconsistencies, nothing approaching negligence as a matter of law, asserted by plaintiffs, appears. Clearly a jury question was made out, fairly submitted, and decided. We find the trial judge to be justified by the record in his observation at the motion for new trial that he was not persuaded of a miscarriage of justice. In such circumstances he correctly refused to preempt the jury function. <em>Dolson v. Anastasia, </em>55 <em>N. J. 2 </em>(1969). Nor does our careful review of the record disclose a miscarriage of justice under the law. Our duty in this respect, then, is to affirm. <em>R. </em>2:10-1; <em>Poison, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>With regard to the procedural issue, plaintiffs\u2019 counsel read extensively \u2014 approximately 55 transcript pages \u2014 from defendant\u2019s deposition. Immediately thereafter and during plaintiffs\u2019 case, defendant\u2019s attorney was permitted over plaintiffs\u2019 objection to read from defendant\u2019s deposition in supplementation of plaintiffs\u2019 reading. Two things are clear. First, defendant\u2019s offer was not a move to compel plaintiffs to offer as a part of their reading other omitted parts \u201cwhich ought in fairness be considered with the part introduced.\u201d <em>B. </em>4:16-l(d). It was an offer of defendant\u2019s evidence, said to be \u201cthings that were left out and are certainly proper to clear up on the record which might tend to mislead the .jury.\u201d Second, plaintiffs did not below challenge the admissibility of that which was read nor the right of defendant to read it. Their sole complaint there was that defendant was permitted to read his evidence during the presentation of plaintiffs\u2019 case. (As a matter of fact, in framing his objection below \u2014 with respect to the \u201cright [of defense counsel] to read everything into the record\u201d \u2014 in terms of the timing, plaintiffs\u2019 attorney said, \u201cHe will have an opportunity on his own case.\u201d) Plaintiffs acknowledge the time-honored rule that the procedural conduct of a trial rests in the sound discretion of the trial judge and that no reversal will follow except for an abuse of that discretion. <em>Munson v. Johnson, </em>110 <em>N. J. L. </em>564 (E. &amp; A. 1933). They urge, however, that this rule of law must succumb to that which they conceive to be the implicit direction.of <em>B. </em>4:16-l(d), that when any party other than the reading party offers any other parts of the deposition pursuant to the express permission of that rule, he must do it only on his own ease. We reject the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">In the first place, the rule neither says nor implies that which plaintiffs attribute to it. We will not intrude on a salutary and respected long-standing rule of procedural discretion on the basis of an imagined implication. In addition, such an interpretation would prevent the trial judge from accomplishing one of his most important tasks: the preven<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>tion of the triumph of gamesmanship over fair play and justice. Selective use of deposition testimony has a real potential for insidious unfairness. Timing may be vital to prophylactic measures in this regard. <em>Cf. Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. Wray Equipment Corp., </em>286 <em>F. </em>2d 491, 494 (1 Cir. 1961), <em>cert. </em>den. 366 <em>U. S. </em>929, 81 S. Ct. 1650, 6 L. Ed. 2d 388 (1961). A trial judge should not be shackled in his efforts to control the problem.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">The judge below demonstrated a perfect awareness of the problem and the rationale we here articulate, and at the same time impressed upon the record the soundness of the exercise of his discretion in his explanation at the time as to why he overruled plaintiffs\u2019 objection and permitted the reading. He said lie felt that to permit the contiguous reading \"would make more sense to the jury * * * than it would when you [defendant] present your case.\u201d We think, in this ease at least, he was entirely right.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Here plaintiffs belatedly also claim, as plain error since no objection appeared below in this regard (see above), that defendant was permitted to read too much of his own deposition. We need not here determine that issue. We have reviewed the record carefully and find such error \u2014 if indeed it was error \u2014 lacked the necessary capacity to produce an unjust result in any event. <em>R. </em>2:10-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
