On October 1, 1961 he received his permanent appointment and thereupon was enrolled in PERS. Pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43:15A-11 <em>(L. </em>1954, c. 84, \u00a7 Jl) he could have applied at any time to purchase the prior temporary credit. He did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">On June 17, 1971 <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :15A\u201411 was amended by <em>L. </em>1971, c. 213, \u00a7 3 \u2014 the essential pertinent change being that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-8\">* \u00ed. &lt;\u2019 rpjle member must agree to make such contributions <em>-within X pear after the effective date of this act </em>or during his first year of membership in the retirement system. [Emphasis supplied]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">On October 1, 1972, three months after the expiration of the newly impoesd statutory limitation, appellant filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">On appeal he contends that (1) PEES was required to notify his certifying agent in the Housing Authority of the amendatory legislation and failed to do so, and (2) he is entitled to purchase the sought credit under N. <em>J. S. A. </em>43: 15A-54. The latter point was not made below. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>The hearing officer in the proceedings below found that the Newark Housing Authority in fact had been notified of the amendment. Appellant\u2019s principal argument on this appeal is a challenge of that finding. We need not reach it since we are satisfied that there was no requirement that PERS notify employers of amendatory legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\"><em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :15A-6 <em>et seq. </em>(Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System of New Jersey) imposes the primary obligation to enroll employees in the system on the employer through its certifying agent. <em>Bahrle v. Mirabelli, </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>361, 365 (Law Div. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">PERS is mandated to issue a copy of the Employee Benefit Manual to each certifying agent. <em>N. J. A. C. </em>17:1-1.18(a) and (b). The duty of administering each employing unit resides in its certifying agent. <em>N. J. A. C. </em>17:2-1.5; <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43 :15A-67. Nowhere do we find, expressed or implicit, any continuing statutory obligation on PERS to disseminate to certifying agents amendatory legislation concerning the retirement system at the time of its enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We may not create judicially a difficult and onerous obligation (we deal here with hundreds of thousands of employees and thousands of certifying agents) where the Legislature chose not so to do. If the Legislature deemed the limitation on credit purchase contingent on such notice, it could have so stated. Illustratively, we note that is has, in treating of substantive rights under another pension system (Teachers\u2019 Pension and Annuity Eund, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A :66-l <em>et seq.) </em>mandated written notice by that fund to employers. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>18A:66-7. Here, it simply did not. <em>Meyer v. Board of Teachers\u2019 Pens. &amp; Annuity Fund, </em>49 <em>N. J. Super. </em>255, 259 (App. Div. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">Lastly, defendant\u2019s contention (not raised below) that he is entitled to the sought credit by virtue of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>43: 15A-54 (correction of errors; approval of application for prior service credit) is without merit and does not warrant discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
