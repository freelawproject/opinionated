Other criminal counts were dismissed after the pleas.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">Defendant appeals for alleged excessiveness of the sentences. The charge of private lewdness in this case was based upon the complaint of a 21-year-old woman that defendant had forced her to commit fellatio upon him.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">We find the sentences well within the range of permissible sentencing discretion of the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">By supplemental letter memorandum defendant urges he was not guilty of private lewdness, within <em>State v. Dorsey, </em>64 <em>N. J. </em>428 (1974). Aside from objections as to the procedural irregularity of raising the issue in this fashion, we find it without merit. The expression of the Supreme Court in <em>Dorsey </em>as to the scope of private lewdness encompasses acts of \u201cindecent exposure.\u201d 64 <em>N. J. </em>at 433. There was obviously an indecent exposure of defendant to the victim in the instant situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
