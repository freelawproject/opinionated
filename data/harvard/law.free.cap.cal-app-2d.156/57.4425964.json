The will, which was admitted to probate, bequeathed the estate to two sons by a prior marriage. Testator also left surviving a wife, Erna Deutsch, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>a resident of Germany, who nominated the bank as administrator with will annexed, and opposed the Elmore appointment.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">The trial court found that decedent\u2019s attorney, Aaron Elmore, who had prepared and retained a copy of the will, knew of decedent\u2019s death which occurred on February 25, 1954, and knew as early as June 4, 1954, that this instrument was decedent\u2019s last will and \u201cthat he was named as Executor in said document; and that . . . said document was in the possession of one of decedent\u2019s sons.\u201d Notwithstanding this knowledge, \u201cAaron Elmore failed to petition for probate of said will . . . until January 27, 1957,\u201d after the surviving spouse had caused a petition for letters of administration to be filed, \u201cand that no good cause for such delay appears or is shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">As a further reason for the denial of Elmore\u2019s belated petition, the trial court found that subsequent to decedent\u2019s death, Elmore \u201cgave legal advice to a portion of the persons interested in the estate, concerning transactions which affect the rights of other persons interested in the estate; that in giving such legal advice Aaron Elmore has committed himself in a manner which is adverse to the interests of such other persons,\u201d whose rights \u201cwould be prejudiced and adversely affected\u201d by the attorney\u2019s appointment as executor; and that the best interests of the estate would be served by appointment of the Bank as administrator c.t.a.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">It is appellant\u2019s contention that the testator\u2019s expressed will concerning appointment of an executor \u201cis strong and overpowering. Almost Absolute\u201d; that neither mere delay in applying for letters testamentary nor adverse interest should prevent appellant\u2019s appointment as executor; that no adverse interest was shown, and that the trial court abused its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Section 324 of the Probate Code provides that \u201cIf the person named in a will as executor, for thirty days after he has knowledge of the death of the testator and that he is named as executor, fails to petition the proper court for the probate of the will and that letters testamentary be issued to him, he may be held to have renounced his rights to letters, and the court may appoint any other competent person administrator, unless good cause of delay is shown.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b76-9\">As stated in <em>Estate of Fiddyment, </em>74 Cal.App.2d 72, 74 [168 P.2d 61], the provisions of section 324 are not mandatory but discretionary, and the action of the trial court will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>not be disturbed in the absence of a showing of an abuse of discretion. In the instant case no such abuse of discretion has been made to appear.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Appellant\u2019s delay of more than two and a half years in petitioning for letters testamentary, coupled with the giving of legal advice to decedent\u2019s sons during that period, pertaining to the estate and committing \u201chimself in a manner which is adverse to such other persons\u201d interested in the estate, furnishes ample support for the court\u2019s exercise of discretion in refusing to appoint appellant as executor.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">The record discloses letters written by appellant attorney to decedent\u2019s sons, advising that certain shares of stock sold were not assets of the estate and were not community property and that the testator had made a valid gift of such stock; that testator\u2019s widow, respondent herein, was not entitled to support or family allowance, and had no interest as an heir in decedent\u2019s estate, and that the estate had no interest in a certain partnership having assets of about $8,000, and an annual income of about $5,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Appellant testified that no compensation was received from the sons but that advice was given and letters written. \u201cProbably from a purely technical standpoint it can be said that I did represent them, but those are the facts.\u201d As stated by the trial court, \u201cif you are in a position where you would be representing the sons, there would be a definite conflict of interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">In view of the situation as shown by the record, it cannot be said that the trial court abused its discretion or committed any reversible error in declining to appoint appellant as executor of the estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The order is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">White, P. J., and Fourt, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
