The appellant filed a motion to tax the costs claimed by respondent and to strike from respondents\u2019 memorandum all of the items and to disallow each of them upon the ground that they were not proper charges. The motion was heard and denied as to the items with reference to the costs of printing the briefs and the printing of respondents\u2019 answer to appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing in the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-5\">Appellant contends that the brief of the respondents was little more than the printing of their memorandum of points and authorities filed in the trial court in support of their demurrer to the plaintiff\u2019s third amended complaint, which was sustained without leave to amend. Appellant asserts that had respondents directed the clerk to include such memorandum in the clerk\u2019s transcript on appeal, it would have been before the appellate court and would have cost the appellant but $7.20, whereas, by having it printed as a brief the cost was $89.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">As to the other item, respondents, in answering the petition of appellant for a hearing in the Supreme Court, filed a printed answer, and appellant insists that in effect respondents copied the matter which was before this court and that such was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">Further, the appellant contends that the briefs could have been printed at a cheaper price elsewhere, and that in any event they should not have cost more than $22.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">The appellant relies upon rule 26(c), Rules on Appeal, as authority for his position that the items should be disallowed. We have perused the rule in question and find nothing therein to sustain any of the appellant\u2019s contentions. In our opinion, the prices paid for the printing of the briefs and the answer to the petition in the Supreme Court were reasonable and proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">Order affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">White, P. J., and Drapeau, J.,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-11\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied February 26, 1958.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b479-12\">Assigned by Chairman of Judicial Council.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
