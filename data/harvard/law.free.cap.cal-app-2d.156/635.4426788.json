Norma H. Backman and George C. Wyman, niece and nephew of decedent, contested the admission of the purported will to probate on the grounds, among others, of unsoundness of mind; and undue influence on the part of Florence Briekman. The jury returned special verdicts to the effect decedent was not of sound mind at the time she executed the purported will; and she was acting under the undue influence of Florence Briekman at said time. The court rendered judgment, based on the verdicts, denying probate of the purported will. Petitioner (Mrs. Briekman) appeals from the special verdicts and from the judgment entered thereon.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-9\">Appellant contends that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdicts and judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-10\">Mrs. Cowhick, 74 years of age, died December 12, 1955. Leaving an estate of the approximate value of $100,000. Her heirs at law were seven nieces and nephews. The purported will, which was in typewriting and dated April 18, 1955, gave $1.00 to her niece Norma Backman; $1.00 to her nephew George Wyman; $1.00 to each other relative who made claim to her estate; and gave the remainder of her property to Florence Briekman, who was named executrix without bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-11\">Mrs. Briekman and Mr. and Mrs. Cowhick became acquainted in 1952.

Mr. and Mrs. Cowhick were patrons of the restaurant. After selling the restaurant in March, 1954, Mrs. Briekman <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>rendered services as a practical nurse at various places until December, 1954. Thereafter she operated a boarding home for aged persons. The boarding home was a few blocks from Mrs. Cowhick\u2019s residence.

she also made out a check at her request to pay for insurance, and Mrs. Cowhick signed the cheek; on April 17 Mrs. Cowhick talked with Mrs. Briekman about giving Mrs. Briekman access to her safe deposit box in the Bank of America; on April 19 Mrs. Cowhick signed an authorization for her to have access to Mrs. Cowhick\u2019s safe deposit box where there was $3,400 in cash; the bank would not accept the authorization, and Mrs. Cowhick signed another paper about 9 p. m. of that day;

he went there pursuant to a telephone call from her the night before, wherein she said that someone at her home wanted to make a will; when he arrived there he asked her where the lady was who wanted the will drawn;

(Mrs. Cowhick died December 13, 1955, and the petition for probate was filed December 29, 1955.)</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>On Hay 27, 1955, the Bank o\u00a3 America was appointed guardian of Mrs. Cowhick\u2019s estate, and Mr. Bridwell was appointed guardian of her person.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">On May 31 Mrs. Cowhick was taken to a hospital.

Olson, an attorney, called as a witness by contestants, testified: on May 3, 1955, he called on Mrs. Cowhick at Mrs. Brickman's residence to serve a citation <em>(re </em>appointment of guardian) on her; he saw her for about 20 minutes; he tried to talk to her but she did not respond; she mumbled, but she did not seem to comprehend what he was talking about.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">Dr. Diekerman testified that he considered that Mrs. Cow-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>hick was competent; she told him that she did not like her niece Norma Backman because Norma charged her $10 for every visit Norma made and when Mrs. Cowhick cut the charge to $5.00 Norma quit coming to visit her.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Mr. and Mrs. Bridwell, who had known Mrs. Cowhick since 1950, testified that Mrs. Cowhick was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">Mrs. Briekman testified that Mrs. Cowhick said that she did not like Norma Backman or George Wyman because Norma mistreated her mother (Mrs. Cowhick\u2019s sister), and they did not care whether she (Mrs. Cowhick) lived or died.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Norma Backman testified that Mrs. Cowhick told her by telephone that she did not like Mrs. Briekman because she was always criticizing her and she was domineering. She also testified that she visited Mrs. Cowhick as often as she could and there was no animosity between them; when Mr. Cowhick died in 1953, Mrs. Cowhick asked her to make the funeral arrangements and help with the details regarding his estate; she went to Mrs. Cowhick\u2019s home and lived with her several months; she had a key to the house, and at the request of Mrs. Cowhick, she made an inventory of her bonds.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">Rules with reference to circumstances under which a presumption of undue influence arises, in the execution of a will, are stated in <em>Estate of White, </em>128 Cal.App.2d 659 [276 P.2d 11], It was said therein at page 668: \u201cA presumption of undue influence arises from proof of a confidential relation between a beneficiary and a testator plus proof of activity on the part of the beneficiary in the preparation of the will. Some of the eases say, instead of proof of activity on the part of a beneficiary in the preparation of the will, proof of activity on the part of a beneficiary in procuring the execution of the will. Other cases say that in addition to proof of a confidential relation plus activity in the preparation of the will there must be proof that the beneficiary unduly profited by the will in order that the presumption arise.\u201d  It was stated further therein at page 669: \u201cThe presumption is rebuttable. When proof is made sufficient to give rise to the presumption, the burden is on the beneficiary to show that the will was not procured by his undue influence.  Whether the presumption was overcome is a question for the trier of fact.\u201d In the present case it was established that a confidential relation existed between the testatrix and the principal beneficiary, Mrs. Briekman. There was evidence that prior to, and at the time of, executing the will Mrs. Briekman assisted the testatrix in writing checks and attending to her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>financial affairs. At the trial it was conceded that a confidential relationship existed. The trial judge asked counsel for proponent if it was conceded that the relationship existed. Counsel replied that in one of the instructions of proponent the fiduciary relationship was conceded. A part of one of the instructions requested by proponent, and given by the court, was: \u201cBefore you can properly apply the so-called presumption of undue influence, you must find from the evidence each of the following: 1. A confidential relationship existed between Alice Cowhick and Florence Briekman, her friend. This is freely admitted by Florence Briekman. ...\u201d Since a confidential relationship existed between the testatrix and the beneficiary Mrs. Briekman, the burden was upon Mrs. Briekman to prove that the will was not procured by her undue influence.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">The evidence was sufficient to prove that the beneficiary Mrs. Briekman was active in the preparation of the will. She selected the attorney who drew the will, called him by telephone and made the appointment for him to come to her home for the purpose of preparing the will. When the attorney was at her house, pursuant to the appointment, he did not go into the room where the testatrix was lying in bed. He did not know the testatrix and did not talk to her. At that time Mrs. Briekman told him what provisions should be in the will. The attorney prepared the will and delivered it to Mrs. Briekman at her home the following day. He did not see or talk to the testatrix at that time. Mrs. Briekman paid him $10 for his services. She placed the will under the pillow of the testatrix.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The beneficiary Mrs. Briekman unduly profited by the will. She was not a relative of the testatrix and had been acquainted with her about two and a half years. The approximate value of the estate was $100,000. According to the provisions of the will Mrs. Briekman would receive practically all the estate. It appears that in the absence of a will the estate of Mrs. Cowhick would be distributed to her nieces and nephews. There was evidence that Mr. Empey, the attorney who represented Mrs. Cowhick in the administration of her husband\u2019s estate, advised her that if she did not make a will her property would go to her nieces and nephews.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">As above stated, at the time of signing the will the testatrix was ill, confined to a bed in Mrs. Briekman\u2019s home, and was paralyzed on one side of her body.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-8\">The evidence was sufficient to support the verdict that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>testatrix was acting under the undue influence of Mrs. Brick-man at the time the will was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">In view of the above conclusion, it is not necessary to discuss the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict as to unsoundness of mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\">The purported appeal from the verdicts is dismissed. The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-8\">Shinn, P. J., and Vall\u00e9e, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-9\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied March 6, 1958.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
