J.</author>\n<p id=\"AnV\">Plaintiffs complained because the defendant, operating stores where shoes were retailed, refused to serve the plaintiffs when they sought to buy shoes, the refusal being, as alleged, solely because of the fact that the plaintiffs were members of the Negro race. A general demurrer to the complaint was sustained without leave to amend. We are reversing the judgment of dismissal that followed, for we have concluded that the demurrer should have been overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">We need seek no further than section 51, of the Civil Code, and the cases interpreting it, for the applicable public policy of this state. That section reads: \u201cAll citizens within the jurisdiction of this state are entitled to the full and equal accommodations, advantages, facilities and privileges of inns, restaurants, hotels, eating-houses, places where ice cream or soft drinks of any kind are sold for consumption on the premises, barber shops, bath houses, theaters, skating rinks, public conveyances and all other places of public accommodation or amusement, subject only to the conditions and limitations established by law, and applicable alike to all citizens. \u2019 \u2019 Section 52, Civil Code, declares that a citizen denied any privilege vouchsafed by section 51, has an action for damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">As a store retailing shoes is not one of the enterprises expressly mentioned in the section, and it obviously is not a place of amusement, our problem narrows down to this: Is a shoe store one of the \u201call other places of public accommodation ? \u2019 \u2019  The section is to be given a liberal, not a strict, construction (see <em>Orloff </em>v. <em>Los Angeles Turf Club </em>(1947), 30 Cal.2d 110, 113 [180 P.2d 321, 322-323, 171 A.L.R. 913]). In <em>Evans </em>v. <em>Fong Poy </em>(1941), 42 Cal.App.2d 320, 321 [108 P.2d 942], the words we have quoted above in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>paragraph were given emphasis and the court declared: \u201cSuch sweeping language as that italicized obviously covers public bars or saloons.\u201d This sweeping language does not cover \u201call places,\u201d however. In <em>Long </em>v. <em>Mountain View Cemetery Assn. </em>(1955), 130 Cal.App.2d 328, 329 [278 P.2d 945, 946], it was held not to cover a mausoleum, one of three, operated by the defendant, the one set aside for the exclusive use of members of the Caucasian race. In reaching this conclusion the court recognized that \u201cThe settled rule of law is that the expression \u2018all other places\u2019 means all other places of a like nature to those enumerated\u201d but concluded that mausoleums were not of a like nature. Applying the same test, in <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Middlestaff </em>(1957), 147 Cal.App.2d Supp. 833, 834-835 [305 P.2d 1020, 1021-1022], we found a dentist\u2019s office not to be a place of a like nature to those specifically referred to in the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The test\u2014of a like nature\u2014would be, of course, unworkable if the place in question had to be like each of those mentioned in the section, for they are too diverse to have a common, pertinent characteristic, other than that of being a place of public accommodation.  When the question is presented: is a place not mentioned specifically in section 51 included by its reference to \u201call other places\u201d?, an affirmative answer is to be given if it is a place of public accommodation and it is like one or more of those mentioned.  Hence a saloon, although not like a public conveyance (one of those listed) is included in the \u201call other places,\u201d because it is like a restaurant, and a place selling soft drinks, not alike in all particulars, but alike in sufficient essential characteristics to warrant the conclusion that the legislature meant to cover it. Webster defines \u201caccommodation\u201d as \u201cwhatever supplies a want or affords ease, refreshment, or convenience; anything furnished which is desired or needful.\u201d  A retail shoe store is a place of <em>public </em>accommodation that is essentially like a place where ice cream and soft drinks are sold; each is open to the public generally for the purchase of goods. It cannot be argued that either is not a place of public accommodation because the proprietor undertakes to limit his patrons to those of the white race, for it is this discrimination that the law condemns. The fact that the defendant, in this case, sells shoes and neither ice cream nor soft drinks, does not serve to distinguish its services, at the point of importance, from those of the vendor of refreshments.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">The judgment of dismissal is reversed with directions to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>the trial court to overrule the demurrer to the complaint. The appeal from the order of July 26, 1957, sustaining the demurrer without leave to amend is dismissed. Appellants are to have their costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Swain, J., and Kauffman, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
