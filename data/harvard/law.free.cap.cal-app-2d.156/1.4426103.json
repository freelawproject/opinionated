Instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b21-13\">Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b21-14\">Ward Saunders, store manager of Super X Market in San Francisco, testified that about 8:20 p. m. August 24, 1956, two men entered the store, one going to the liquor department. Saunders asked him if he could be of help and the man replied \u201cNo.\u201d Saunders started to approach the second man who was standing at the checking stand and then noticed that the latter was holding a gun on the cashier, Elinor Retter. The first man (later identified by Saunders as <em>Richard </em>Francis\u2014 defendants are brothers) then stuck a gun in Saunders\u2019 ribs and told him to take a paper bag and empty the cash registers into it. Richard, facing Saunders and still holding the gun, demanded Saunders\u2019 wallet. Saunders fainted. Mrs. Retter testified that she did not see the two men enter the store. She was first aware of a holdup when she was approached by a man whom she later identified as Gilbert Francis. He said \u201cThis is a holdup.\u201d She replied \u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Thereupon he produced a revolver, pointed it at her and told her to put all the currency and half dollars in a bag. When she handed him the money she watched him very closely to get a good description of him. She also noticed the other \u201cboy\u201d but did not see his face. She noticed Saunders putting money into a bag. Richard told him to hurry. Gilbert said \u201cRico, hurry up, he\u2019s going to have a heart attack. Let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Saunders at a police lineup identified Richard but was unable to identify Gilbert. Mrs. Retter at a lineup <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>identified Gilbert but was not able to identify Richard positively, although by his tone of voice, back of his head and side he looked familiar to her. Saunders said the gun pointed by Gilbert at Mrs. Retter was a black one. She said it was a \u201csteel-gray\u201d color.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-5\">Richard did not testify. Gilbert did, claiming that he was at his own home at the time the robbery took place. Gilbert denied that he ever called his brother \u201cRico\u201d prior to his arrest but admitted doing so once or twice since.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-6\">1. <em>Statements.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b22-7\">Police Inspector Zimmerlin testified to a conversation with Richard, in the presence of an assistant district attorney and another inspector. When asked about his whereabouts the night of the robbery Richard stated that he arrived home from work between 4 and 5 p. m. He listened to the fights on the radio, then he and his wife Nancy went to a Mission Street restaurant two or three doors away. While having dinner, Gilbert entered and joined them. On leaving the restaurant, Richard and Nancy went to Richard\u2019s mother\u2019s home, where they remained for some time visiting his sister. Later he and his wife returned to their home.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-8\">Later the same night that the conversation testified to by Zimmerlin took place, the officers talked- to Gilbert. He said that the early part of the night in question he was home watching the fights on television. About 10 p. m. he went down town to pick up his wife. They went to a drive-in for food and then home. He did not see Richard or Nancy after he watched the fights.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-9\">Zimmerlin later talked to Nancy and then had another talk with Richard. Zimmerlin told Richard that he had talked to Nancy and to Gilbert; that Gilbert had stated that he had not seen Richard any time following the fights, and that Nancy had said that Richard had not listened to the fights, that she had dinner with Richard and Gilbert, but that following the dinner Richard and Gilbert left her and she went home alone; that she went to Richard\u2019s mother\u2019s house, leaving a note for Richard at home. Zimmerlin said that as a result, the police had concluded that Richard\u2019s earlier statement was false.</p>\n<p id=\"b22-10\">After hearing Zimmerlin\u2019s statement of what he claimed Gilbert and Nancy had said, Richard stated, \u201cWell, I know that isn\u2019t so but I can\u2019t tell you what happened ... I\u2019ll fight it out in court. \u2019 \u2019 Richard said several times that he was in a position which prevented him from telling what happened that night. Zimmerlin testified that in all conversations both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>defendants denied committing the robbery. Defendants objected to tb\u00e9 admission of Zimmerlin\u2019s testimony concerning what he had told Richard that Gilbert and Nancy had said.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">The court limited the statements of Gilbert to Zimmerlin to Gilbert\u2019s case alone. It also ruled that Nancy\u2019s statement could not be considered against Gilbert. However, it ruled that both Gilbert\u2019s and Nancy\u2019s statements could be admitted as against Richard, not for the purpose of proving the conversation between Nancy and the inspector or the truth of the statements therein contained, but only to show the conversation between the inspector and Richard.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">So far as defendant Gilbert is concerned, there could have been no prejudice in the admission of his statement to Zimmerlin as later in the case Gilbert testified to the same effect except that he claimed that he said that he could not remember whether or not he had seen Richard and Nancy that night. Inspector Zimmerlin\u2019s testimony to the effect that Gilbert had told him he did not see either one would have been admissible later by way of impeachment. As to Nancy\u2019s statements the court ruled that they were not admissible against Gilbert.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-8\">This brings us to the question of the admissibility against Richard of these statements. Respondent concedes that these statements were not accusatory statements within the rule of People v. <em>Simmons, </em>28 Cal.2d 699 [172 P.2d 18], but contends that they showed that Richard admitted falsifying his original story and that they were admissible under the rule of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cole, </em>141 Cal. 88, 90 [74 P. 547], that \u201cDeception, falsehood, and fabrication as to the facts of the case are treated as tending to show consciousness of guilt, and are admissible on the same theory as flight and concealment of the person when charged with crime.\u201d (See also <em>People </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>99 Cal.App.2d 238, 243 [221 P.2d 287]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Tolson, </em>109 Cal.App.2d 579, 581 [241 P.2d 32].) The statements referred to in the Cole and the other cases above cited were statements of <em>the defendant </em>which showed falsehood, not hearsay statements of other persons. In fact, in the Cole case, the court pointed out (p. 92) that on a proper motion all the hearsay statements would have been ruled out. Zimmerlin properly testified that Richard told him that he lied in the story defendant had previously told the officer. But the statements of Gilbert and Nancy were completely hearsay as to Richard and were not admissible. The above cases are not authority for the admission of third party statements. The only exception to the hearsay rule is in the case of accusatory statements which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number><em>these </em>concededly were not. Additionally, as to the statements attributed to Nancy\u2014Nancy could not have testified to their substance at the trial, because of the privilege provided by section 1322, Penal Code, and under no circumstances should they have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">In view of the positive identification of Gilbert by Mrs. Better, and by Saunders of Richard, the use of the name \u201cRico\u201d at the holdup, Richard\u2019s admission that he had falsified <em>his </em>alibi and all of the circumstances of the case, there can be no doubt as to his guilt, and that the jury could not have arrived at any other conclusion. Therefore, under section 4% of article YI of the Constitution, the error was not such as to require a reversal of the judgment. Our ruling on this subject fully answers defendants\u2019 contention that the prosecuting attorney was guilty of misconduct in offering Zimmerlin\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">2. <em>Alleged Error </em>As <em>to Evidence.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">Mrs. Better testified that at the lineup Richard was required to repeat the words used at the holdup \u201cThis is a stickup\u201d and that the tone of his voice was similar to that of the person who there used the words. Defendant Richard contends that his constitutional right against self-incrimination (Cal. Const., art. I, \u00a7 13) was violated by this requirement. Inasmuch as no objection was raised at any time to the introduction of this evidence we deem it unnecessary to determine this question. \u201cIt is a general rule of appellate review, early established and long adhered to, that questions not raised in the trial court will not be considered on appeal.\u201d (3 Cal.Jur.2d \u00a7 140, p. 604; see cases cited there and in 1957 Supp. for vol. 3, p. 50.)</p>\n<p id=\"b24-8\">On cross-examination of Zimmerlin a picture of the lineup portraying the men who participated was produced and Zimmerlin was asked if a certain one of the men was dismissed from any robbery charge. The court sustained plaintiff\u2019s objection. The court then denied defendants\u2019 request to make an offer of proof. We see no error in this action, first, because there was no request that the offer be made out of the presence of the jury, and secondly, because we can think of no circumstances and none have been called to our attention, under which evidence of what happened to one of the men in the lineup as a result of some other robbery could possibly have been admissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">Defendant Richard complains of the sustaining of objections to the following questions asked by defendants in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>cross-examination of Inspector Zimmerlin: Whether at the time Zimmerlin talked to Richard, the latter had an attorney, was advised by Zimmerlin of his constitutional rights, was told that his statement would be used in court, or was booked to have no visitors without Zimmerlin\u2019s first seeing them. We know of no requirement that before taking a statement from a defendant in custody the police officer must advise him of his constitutional rights or that his statement might be used in court. Therefore, while that information as well as the fact that defendant then had no attorney might very well have been admitted for the jury\u2019s information, we see no prejudice in the court\u2019s ruling. The manner of booking Richard was not material and therefore the court ruled properly.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">3. <em>Instructions.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The court gave an accusatory instruction similar to CALJIC Number 30, stating that if the jury found that \u201cDefendant, under conditions which fairly afforded him an opportunity to reply, failed to make denial ... in the face of an accusation, expressed directly to him or in his presence, charging him with the crime of which he is now on trial tending to connect him with its commission ...\u201d the circumstances of his conduct might be considered by them. Defendants contend that the court should have defined \u201caccusation\u201d in this instruction. The instruction seems to us to require no further definition than that given, an \u201caccusation\u201d \u201ctending to connect\u201d defendant with the crime. Moreover, if defendants desired further definition they should have offered an instruction on the subject. Citing <em>People </em>v. <em>Black, </em>73 Cal.App. 13 [238 P. 374], where it was held that the refusal of the trial court to give an instruction to the effect that before the jury should consider any <em>confession </em>they must find that it was freely and voluntarily made, defendants contend the court should have so instructed the jury as to the <em>statements </em>made by the defendant. Defendants here offered no instruction on the subject nor was there any confession. Defendants contend that the Zimmerlin statements to Richard did not constitute accusatory statements. Zimmerlin did accuse Richard of giving false statements to the police and in answer thereto Richard admitted that he had done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">The court instructed the jury to view with caution the testimony of any witness which purported to relate an oral admission of a defendant or \u201can oral confession by him.\u201d Defendants contend that as there was no confession the latter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>portion of the instruction should not have been given. Whiles, in a sense, defendant Richard \u201cconfessed \u2019 that he had lied to the officers, it would have been better not to have given that portion. However, it is clear that leaving it out of the instruction would not have changed the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">Defendants\u2019 criticism of the sentence in the instruction on weight of evidence and credibility of witnesses .reading \u201cWhether offered evidence is admissible is a question of law\u201d is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">We see no prejudice in the obviously clerical error in using the word \u201cevidence\u201d for \u201creason\u201d in the instruction concerning the court\u2019s ruling on the admission of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-7\">The judgment and order are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-8\">Peters, P. J., and Wood (Fred B.), J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
