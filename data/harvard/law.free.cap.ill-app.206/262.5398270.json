Street railroads, \u00a7 144<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when instructions in action for death of animal are erroneous as invading province of jury on question of contributory negligence. In an action against an interurban street railway company to recover damages for the killing of a cow, where it appeared that the cow was tied with a long rope to a tree in a yard of the plaintiff, in .such a position that the animal could go from such yard to the adjacent street and onto the track on the defendant\u2019s right of way, and that as the defendant\u2019s car was approaching, the motorman, who saw the cow some distance ahead, cut off the power and applied the air brake and then released the brake and permitted the car to coast towards the cow until within about six or eight feet of her, when she turned or backed onto the track and was struck, and where instructions were given that, even though the jury believed that the plaintiff permitted the cow to be tied in the front yard of the plaintiff with a rope of sufficient length so that she could get onto or near the track of the defendant, such action would not in law amount to such contributory negligence as would prevent a recovery, provided the jury further believed that the plaintiff was otherwise entitled to recover, but that the jury might take into consideration all the facts and circumstances shown in evidence in making up their verdict, held that such instructions were erroneous as they took from the jury the question of contributory negligence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"Aki\" pgmap=\"307\">2.
