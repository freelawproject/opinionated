Municipal corporations, \u00a7 1098<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when evidence sufficient to show negligence in failing to remove projecting pipes at edge of sidewalk. Where certain steel pipes projected about six inches above a sidewalk at its outer edge on a public street of a city and were allowed by the city to so remain for several years, held that a finding that such condition was a menace to persons traveling over the walk and had existed for such a length of time that the city should take notice thereof and remedy it was justified, in an action to recover damages for injuries sustained thereby.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AHV\" pgmap=\"211\">2. Municipal corporations, \u00a7 1098*\u2014when evidence sufficient to show that pipes projecting above sidewalk are dangerous. The fact that a person traveling on a public sidewalk in the usual manner of traveling upon meeting another person and attempting to pass tripped on a steel pipe projecting six inches above the walk and fell and injured herself, held to justify a finding that such pipe was a menace to persons traveling on the walk, notwithstanding such pipe may have been just outside the walk in close proximity to it.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AAiq\" pgmap=\"211\">3. Municipal corporations, \u00a7 1098*\u2014when evidence sufficient to show due care of pedestrian tripping on projections above sidewalk. Evidence held to sustain finding that plaintiff was in the exercise of due care for her own safety at the time she tripped on certain pipes projecting about six inches above defendant\u2019s sidewalk, notwithstanding she had passed over the walk frequently and had never observed the pipes.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AxX\" pgmap=\"211\">4.
