Appeal and error, \u00a7 1411<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\u2014when judgment not reversed because verdict is against evidence. Where the evidence on a controverted question is sharply conflicting, judgment will not be reversed on the ground that the verdict was against the manifest weight of the evidence.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AiF\" pgmap=\"261\">2. Railroads\u2014what is meaning of phrase \u201cflag the crossing\u201d in contract for crossing railroad by another company. The testimony of certain expert witnesses held to show that the term \u201cflag the crossing,\u201d used in a certain contract requiring defendant to flag plaintiff\u2019s railroad crossing before crossing same, meant that the party flagging looked in both directions up and down the track to see if anything was approaching, and should listen, should see that the way was clear, that if he went to the crossing after he stopped his car, looked in both directions and saw nothing, listened and could hear nothing, then if he gave the signal to the motorman to come across, that would be flagging the crossing.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AML\" pgmap=\"261\">3. Trial, \u00a7 103*\u2014when evidence not objected to should be excluded. In an action to recover on a contract by defendant to indemnify plaintiff for loss arising from the negligent crossing of plaintiff\u2019s right of way by defendant\u2019s cars, held that evidence that the air brake on defendant\u2019s street car caused the car to stop on plaintiff\u2019s railroad tracks and that the motorman tried to release the air four times, but was unable to do so, should have been excluded, although not objected to when offered, as not tending to prove any issue in the. case.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"A9s\" pgmap=\"261\">4. Trial, \u00a7 204*\u2014when refusal to direct verdict for plaintiff is proper. Refusal to direct a verdict for plaintiff held proper where there was evidence tending to support the defense that defendant was not guilty of the negligence charged.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AAT\" pgmap=\"261\">5. Appeal and error, \u00a7 1413*\u2014when similar verdict by succes- \u25a0 sive juries not disturbed. Where three juries have passed upon a case and have each found the same way, an Appellate Court will be slow to disturb the verdict in the absence of prejudicial error.</headnotes> <footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\"> <p id=\"b261-9\" pgmap=\"261\">See Illinois Notes Digest, Vote.
