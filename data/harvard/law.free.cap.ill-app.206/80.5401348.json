That there was no brakeman upon the rear car of a train run with the engine in the rear and no watchman at the crossing where plaintiff\u2019s intestate was struck by such train, held to be facts to be considered by the jury with all the other evidence in determining whether or not, under the circumstances, the engin\u00e9 and cars were driven negligently and carelessly as charged, notwithstanding there may be no law specifically requiring a brakeman and watchman to be so placed.</headnotes><headnotes data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"ALS\" pgmap=\"125\">4.

An instruction limiting the exercise by the deceased, who was struck and killed by defendant\u2019s railroad train, of the degree of care which an ordinarily prudent person would* have exercised under like circumstances prior to the time of the injury, held, if erroneous as omitting the time immediately prior to the injury, to be cured by other instructions including such prior time.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"A03\" pgmap=\"126\">7. Death, \u00a7 73*\u2014when instruction on measure of damages is proper.
