Evidence held sufficient to show that plaintiff\u2019s intestate was not at the time he was injured in the exercise of due care for his own safety, where he stood on defendants\u2019 railroad track at a crossing with an unobstructed view of the track for four to six hundred feet, on a clear day, and there were no other trains or unusual noises or things tending to confuse him or cause him to fail to look or listen, and he did not look or listen, and two ordinary steps would have carried him beyond the reach of the train which struck him.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\" pgmap=\"143\">Appeal from the City Court of Alton; the Hon.

Railroads, \u00a7 754*\u2014when failure of person about to cross track to look for train is negligence in fact. Failure of a person about to cross a railroad track to look to see if a train is approaching may be negligence in fact if there are no conditions or circumstances which excuse the looking or listening.</headnotes> <headnotes id=\"AMi\" pgmap=\"144\">4. Negligence, \u00a7 250*\u2014when finding as to want of due care disturbed. While a court of appeals should be careful in disturbing verdicts for want of due care upon the part of the person injured, yet when it appears from the evidence that there are no circumstances or surroundings of any kind that would excuse the looking or listening, and that to have looked or listened the injury could have been avoided, the court will hold that such failure to look or listen shows a want of due care.</headnotes> </opinion> </casebody> ",
