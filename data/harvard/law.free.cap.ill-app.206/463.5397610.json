In an action to recover damages for breach of contract not to engage in the saloon business within a certain number of blocks for a period of three years, where the defendant sold his saloon to the plaintiff and within about a month conducted a saloon within said radius, and where defendant contended that there was no basis in the evidence for the verdict rendered, unless speculative profits were made the basis, and the facts showed a flagrant violation of the contract and that plaintiff\u2019s loss of business was occasioned by the opening of the\" saloon, and the only question was as to the amount of damages, held that proof of plaintiff\u2019s damages was difficult, and as plaintiff lost $20 per day after the other saloon was opened, and $2,000 in cash, and was compelled to close his doors in about eight months, a verdict for $1,300 was warranted.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-7\" pgmap=\"507\">Appeal from the City Court of East St. Louis; the Hon.
