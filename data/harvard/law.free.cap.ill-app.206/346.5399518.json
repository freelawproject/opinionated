In an action to recover the price of \u00e1 stove purchased by plaintiffs from the defendant, where there was a failure .of warranty, held that a requested instruction which told the jury that a warranty was not part of a contract of sale, except as a part of the consideration received for the price paid, and that the vendee\u2019s remedy upon a sale was on the warranty, without which he had none, and his right of recovery was limited to the amount of depreciation due to the breach, and he could not lawfully compel the vendor to take back the property and return the price paid, was not a correct statement of the law applicable to the facts, as the contract in question by its terms gave the vendee the right to return the property in case of a breach of the warranty.</headnotes><summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\" pgmap=\"390\">Appeal from the Circuit Court of Marion county; the Hon.
