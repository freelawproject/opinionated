Heard on defendant\u2019s demurrer to the declaration at the March Term, 1918, Orleans County, <em>Slack, </em>J., presiding. The demurrer was sustained, the declaration adjudged insufficient, and judgment for the defendant. The plaintiffs excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-5\">The declaration, in' substance, alleges that on October 5, 1915, the defendant owned and maintained an electric light and power transmission line and the plaintiffs were the owners of certain farms in the towns of Glover and Albany and desired the defendant to extend his electric power transmission line to their buildings so that they could secure \u20181 electric current for lighting and power purposes to be used upon their said farms\u201d; that on said October 5, 1915, they entered into a contract with the defendant to extend his transmission line from one Grant White\u2019s for the purpose of furnishing them electric_ current and they \u201cthen and there severally promised and agreed to and with the said defendant to pay to said defendant the sum of one hundred twenty-five dollars each, when said transmission line should be constructed to a point opposite their buildings, and one hundred twenty-five dollars each when their buildings should be by said defendant properly wired and equipped for turning on said electric current\u201d; that the defendant erected said transmission line and wired the buildings of the plaintiffs and they each paid him the sum of two hundred fifty dollars, amounting in the whole to the sum of two thousand dollars, \u2018 \u2018 and all in accordance with the terms of said contract. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b287-6\">The declaration further alleges that in said contract the defendant promised and agreed to and with the plaintiffs \u201cthat, if, during the life of said contract, any person living on said transmission line as constructed under said contract desired to obtain electric current of and from the said defendant, he, the said defendant, would charge said person two hundred fifty dollars for connecting said person\u2019s buildings with said transmission line, one-half of which two hundred fifty dollars should be retained by the said defendant and the other half equally divided by the said defendant between the plaintiffs and other persons whose buildings should thereafter be connected with said transmission line under said agreement;\u201d that, since the construction of said transmission line under said contract the defendant has connected with said transmission line the store of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>W. E. Graham and E. J. Douglas in the village of South Albany and the buildings of Lynn Anderson in Glover, said persons then and there living on and adjacent to said transmission line; that \u201cthe said defendant not regarding said promises, agreements and undertakings to and with the plaintiffs neglected and refused to pay these plaintiffs their said several shares of money accruing to them under the terms of said contract and by reason of the said defendant having connected with said transmission line the buildings of the said Lynn Anderson and the store of the said Graham and Douglas.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b288-5\">The ground of demurrer is that there is a misjoinder of plaintiffs, for that the contract declared upon is, as to them, several and not joint.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-6\">W.-W. <em>Beirden </em>for the plaintiffs.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b288-7\"><em>Frank D.

Note, 1 Saund. 154; <em>Beckwith </em>v. <em>Talbot, </em>95 U. S. 289, 24 L. ed. 496; <em>Emmuleth </em>v. <em>Home Benefit Assn., </em>122 N. Y. 130, 25 N. E. 234, 9 L. R. A. 704. This rule of the common law was, at an early day, approved and adopted as the law of this jurisdiction. In <em>Geer </em>v. <em>School District, </em>6 Vt. 76, Judge Mattocks says, in effect, that in all actions on contracts suit must be brought in the name of the party who has the legal interest, though the form of the undertaking might require some one else to sue. And in <em>Sharp </em>v. <em>Conkling, </em>16 Vt. 355, Judge Eedeield, upon a consideration of the common-law authorities, asserts the fully established rule to be that, if the interest in the subject-matter secured by the contract is several, though the terms thereof are joint, the engagement will be taken to be' several, unless such interpretation is excluded by the language used.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">So it is that when the promise is to pay a group of persons a stated sum to be divided among them in proportions named, the engagement, ordinarily, will be joint and not several. 1 Parsons, * 13; <em>Lane </em>v. <em>Drinkwater, </em>1 C. M. &amp; R. 599; <em>Byrne </em>v. <em>Fitzhugh, </em>1 C. M. &amp; R. 613.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>On the other hand, when payment is to be made not to the group, but to its several members, each to receive from the promisor his own share, the engagement, ordinarily, will be several and not joint. 1 Parsons, * 19; <em>Owings\u2019 Exrs. </em>v. <em>Owings, </em>1 Har. &amp; <em>G. </em>484.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-5\">When tested by the above rule, the complaint before us breaks down. The interests of these plaintiffs are several. The consideration for the defendant\u2019s promise moved from them, not jointly, but severally, and this alone is enough to make that promise <em>prima facie, </em>several. 2 Page, \u00a7 1142; <em>Satler Lumber Co. </em>v. <em>Exler, </em>239 Pa. 135, 86 Atl. 793. Moreover, the contract set up in this complaint does not require the defendant to pay the sum specified to the plaintiffs, but binds him to divide it between them. So the defendant\u2019s promise though joint in form, is several in essence. In legal consequence, it is a group of separate promises, and gives rise to separate actions in favor o\u2019f thp several promisees.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">We note, in passing, that the complaint contains the common counts in assumpsit, but as neither party makes reference thereto, we ignore them in disposing of the questions raised by the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">The defect in this declaration should have been corrected below. The Practice Act provides for. such cases. G. L. 1798. The fault was sufficiently pointed out by the demurrer <em>(Reynolds </em>v. <em>Bean, </em>91 Vt. 247, 99 Atl. 1013), but instead of asking the court to act under the section just cited, counsel chose to litigate the question. In these circumstances it was not error for the court to neglect to act. <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Bean, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
