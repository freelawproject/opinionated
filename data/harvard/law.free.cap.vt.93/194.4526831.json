The Court denied that motion. Thereupon I filed a petition with the Supreme Court, asking that my name be stricken from the roll of attorneys and solicitors of the Supreme Court, stating as reasons for this petition, that my health, and the inability to get the necessary evidence for defence would prevent me from making a proper showing of my innocence. The Court has denied the prayer of ipy said petition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b219-10\">\u201cThere are many other reasons for making these motions. In order to defend myself in the proceedings before you, it would be necessary to try many of the substantial issues of the criminal cause against me., One of the principal witnesses that can give evidence tending to establish my innocence of the charges in the complaint that you are to consider, is himself charged with per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>jury in a criminal case not yet tried, on many of the same issues that are charged against me. In the exercise of his constitutional right, he does not desire to be a witness in this case before his case is tried, and his attorneys do not feel that they should advise him to testify at this time in my behalf. Another important witness is charged with criminal conduct in the complaint before you, and has a constitutional right to decline to give evidence in my behalf at this time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-5\">\u2018 \u2018 Notwithstanding the decision of the Court that the hearing on the complaint before you shall not be postponed to await the trial of my criminal case, I beg to state that I do not feel myself warranted in going into my defence on that complaint-before the trial of my criminal case. I am of the opinion that a full defence in this proceeding cannot be had at this time, and a .partial defence would seriously prejudice my defence in the criminal case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-6\">\u201cAs the matter appears to me and to my attorneys, I am put in the embarrassing position of choosing between defending myself fully in the proceeding before you, and thereby impairing my chances in the criminal case, or decline to make a full defence in this proceeding and thereby better preserve my chances of success in the criminal case. Between these two alternatives I cannot hesitate to choose. An unfavorable result of this proceeding would at most only deprive me of the privilege of practicing law, while an unfavorable result in the criminal case would take away my liberty and brand me as a criminal. My liberty is more precious to me than membership of the bar, although I prize that of great importance, especially in view of my long and arduous struggle to obtain it. I am therefore compelled to take the chance of my innocence appearing by an <em>ex parte </em>evidence of the State without developing my defence at this time, rather than to hazard doing anything that might jeopardize the defence of my liberty. But, if I did judge it best to make a full defence before you, I know that I am not physically able to do so. The state of my health forbids that I should attempt the prolonged mental strain that a full defence would require.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b220-7\">\u201cI understand too, that it is the intention of the State to take considerable evidence outside of the State, and I am not in a physical condition to undertake the effort of attendance upon the taking of such evidence. I would say too, that, because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>my long and serious illness which involved two capital operations, I have not heretofore been able to assist my attorneys in making a due preparation of my case at this time. It is but recently that I have been able even to leave my house, and I have found that mental labor soon wearies me.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-5\">\u2018 \u2018 The case, if fully presented, involves an immense amount of details, and the sifting and arrangement of them is a matter for a man in vigorous health, and I am conscious that I am not physically able to properly participate in such labor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-6\">\u201cBecause of the facts herein stated, I respectfully decline to further participate in the trial of this case at this time, and desire that the cause be continued to a time when I can fairly present my defence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-7\">\u201cTherefore, I respectfully submit to the discretion of this commission to take such action as it deems proper and fair in the premises. \u2019 \u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-8\">That the commission refused to continue the ease, because: \u2018 \u2018 So far as the existence of this criminal case that is to be tried is concerned, we should not be justified in continuing the case because of that, because that was the question you took to the Supreme Court and has been passed upon. That as to the possibility of some of the witnesses now charged with some criminal offence claiming their privilege and refusing to testify, we should hardly be justified in continuing the case for that reason, in trying to forecast what they might say or refuse to say. \"We can only deal with those things as they come. As to the statement made here by the defendant, by his attorneys, as to his physical condition and inability to go on with this case, we say that we should hardly be justified in continuing the case on that statement alone; that if the case was to be continued by reason of the illness or sickness or inability of the defendant to participate in these proceedings, it should be upon such proof as to fully satisfy the commission of that fact and justify their action. As the case now stands we think the hearing should go forward.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-9\">That thereupon said counsel for defendant withdrew from the hearing and did not further participate therein before the commission, although one of them remained in the court room as an observer and listener throughout most of the hearing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b221-10\">The commission further reported that, after hearing the evidence produced by the State, they found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>\u201cIn October, 1916, the Supreme Court of Vermont rendered a unanimous decision affirming a decree of the court of chancery, Rutland County, awarding damages to the Vermont Marble Company against George P. Eastman which amounted to about $24,000, including interest, and established title in favor of the Vermont Marble Company against said Eastman and Percival W. Clement to a strip of valuable marble land in West Rutland, about three rods wide. This suit involved the determination of a disputed boundary line, and, if the claim of Eastman and Clement as to said boundary line had been established in said suit, not only would said award of damages against said Eastman have been avoided, but said Vermont Marble Company would have become liable in damages to said Eastman and Clement for a large amount of marble quarried by said company on the disputed land. Following said decision, and on October 11, 1916, said Eastman and Clement filed their motion for a re-argument of said cause, which was denied by the Court May 1, 1917. This cause is reported in 91 Vt. 425 (101 Atl. 151), to which we refer. The mandate was filed in said court of chancery May 4, 1917. Tuesday, May 7, 1917, was fixed for the settlement of the final decree, and on that day attorneys for Eastman delivered to attorneys for said -company a motion to amend their pleadings by way of a proposed supplemental cross bill, based upon a document bearing date of July, 1892, and alleged to have been newly discovered on May 6, 1917. Said document is known as Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1.'</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-5\">\u201cOn May 16, 1917, said Eastman filed in said court of chancery in the cause above referred to his motion for leave to file supplemental cross bill therein. This motion was also based on said document as newly discovered evidence in said cause. Upon hearing, said motion was denied on July 27, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b222-6\">\u201cOn July 28, 1917, said Eastman and Clement brought to said court of chancery their petition for leave to file in said cause a supplemental bill in the nature of a bill of review, based upon said document as being newly discovered evidence in said cause. Indeed, in said proceedings for review it was claimed by said Eastman that this document would render impossible the making by the chancellor of certain findings of fact, and the making by the court of the decree relating to said boundary line and damages, that had been made in said cause, and we are satisfied that such claims as to the effect of said document, if genuine and re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>ceived in evidence in said cause, were well founded. This document purported to be an agreement fixing the boundary line, that had been litigated in said case, in accordance with the claims therein of Eastman and Clement, and also containing twenty-five year options from said company which, if exercised, as said Eastman on May 17, 1917, attempted to exercise them, would take from said company interest in land deeded to said company by said Eastman in November, 1911, under a decree of said court of chancery, in the cause of <em>Vermont Marble Company </em>v. <em>Carlos E. Mead and George P. Eastman, </em>reported in 85 Vt. 20, 80 Atl. 852, to which we refer, as well as other interests in the same land and other lands adjoining thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-5\">\u201cThe Vermont Marble Company filed its answer to said petition, and thereby put in issue the genuineness of said document and its character as being newly discovered evidence. Issue being joined, hearing was had thereon in October, 1917. No decision having yet been. rendered, on February 14, 1918, the Vermont Marble Company moved to open the cause for the purpose of taking additional, evidence in New York. The following day, and in compliance with their request, written notice was given to said plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys, by said company\u2019s attorneys, setting forth the names and location of certain witnesses, whose evidence it was so proposed to take, and a general statement of certain things their evidence would tend to establish, including statements and acts of said Eastman tending to ' show, as it was claimed, that after November 5, 1916, he was .engaged in or contemplating the making of said document. On the same day, February 15, 1918, upon hearing, said cause was ordered re-opened for taking such evidence, whereupon certain of the attorneys for said Eastman and Clement went to New York to investigate the matters referred to in said notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b223-6\">\u201cBefore the evidence in New York was taken and on March 8, 1918, Eastman\u2019s attorneys filed their motion requesting the chancellor to set a time and place when said Eastman might be heard to make some corrections in his testimony formerly given in the case, and thereon, on the same day said Eastman was heard. At said hearing said Eastman corrected the testimony he had formerly given in said case, namely, that he did not know of the existence of said alleged written agreement before May 6, 1917, by testifying that he did know of it before May 6, 1917; whereupon his attorneys moved for a discontinuance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Attorneys for the Vermont Marble Company insisted on an order dismissing the case with costs to them and with judgment in their favor, and it was thereupon ordered by the court that said suit be dismissed and judgment entered for the defendant company with costs, said judgment order being filed on said March 8, 1918; and pursuant thereto said company subsequently received nearly $27,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-5\">\u201cThis alleged agreement (Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1) purporting to have been made and entered into July 18, 1892, to have been'executed by the Vermont Marble Company by Fletcher D.

No. 1, is not a genuine instrument but a forgery. From the evidence before us, we are unable to find exactly when or where said written instrument was forged. Considering the motives which we find he had to do so, however, and from all the evidence in the case, we find that said Eastman forged or caused to be forged said Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, at some time not earlier than the year 1916.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b224-8\">\u201cWe find that the defendant, Ernest H. O\u2019Brien, is an attorney of the Supreme Court of this State, and was such attorney during the times he conducted himself in the manner hereinafter stated. At the trial of the proceedings for review, hereinabove referred to, in October, 1917, said O\u2019Brien testified among other things, in substance, as follows: That he found the alleged written instrument in the office in which he practiced in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Rutland, Vermont; that this office was the same office occupied by Joel C. Baker in his lifetime and down to his death in 1904; that said O\u2019Brien had occupied the same office since that time, and that said written instrument was found by him in the old files of said Joel G. Baker, in a verticle document file which had been in that office ever since O\u2019Brien went there in 1899; that he found said written instrument and other papers with which it was, the same year that he built his garage and either four or five years ago the coming winter (referring to the winter of 1917-1918) ; that, after his discovery of the said written' instrument, it, together with said other papers, had been kept in his old safe until November, 1916, when he transferred them to a new safe he then bought, where they remained until one Sunday in May (referring to the month of May, 1917); that his attention was called to these papers about that time by reading in one of the local papers a decision of the Supreme Court in the Bastman-Vermont Marble Company case, also that Mr. Lawrence had made some motion before the Supreme Court in reference to that ease; that at the time he took occasion to look at said papers again and after that, not far from noon, on a Sunday, delivered them to Walter C: Fenton, one of the attorneys for the plaintiff in the case then on trial before Chancellor Fish; that before that time he had the custody of the said papers for the last three or four j ears; that he supposed they had been in the file; that he found them in the file; that after the finding of said written instrument he did not tell any one anything about it until the time Avhen he turned it over to said Fenton upon that Sunday in May; that on the occasion when said O \u2019Brien Avent to Albany, N. Y. on May 5, 1917, he received four hundred dollars; that on that occasion he did not see said Eastman at Albany; that the two purported signatures of Joel C. Baker upon said document AA'ere, in his best judgment, the signatures of Joel C. Baker, and the purported signature-of Thomas W. Moloney was, in his best judgment, the signature of Thomas W. Moloney; that the figures and words written in ink on said document, namely \u201818 July A. D. 1892\u2019 and \u2018of James BroAvn dated Sept. 27, 1866\u2019 were, in his best judgment, in the handwriting of Joel C. Baker; that the last time before May 6, 1917, said-O\u2019Brien saw Eastman to have conversation with him, was when said O\u2019Brien brought suit against several parties in West Rutland in which Eastman was interested, and that was a year or two prior to May 6, 1917; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>that when said 0 \u2019Brien was in Albany on 'May 5, 1917, he met a man by the name of Stiegel at the Stanwix Hall Hotel and conferred with him about two hours; that said 0 \u2019Brien hired and paid for the room he stayed in; that said 0 \u2019Brien did not say to Attorney Frank C. Archibald that the Vermont Marble Company had done what it could to injure the said O \u2019Brien and that said O\u2019Brien was going to get even with it; that said O\u2019Brien did not say to said Archibald that the said 0 \u2019Brien had a case for damages at one time pending against the Vermont Marble Company which it settled out from under him, and, because it had done that, he, the said O\u2019Brien, felt unfriendly toward it and had made up his mind when the chance came he would get even with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-5\">\u201cAt said trial said Eastman testified, among other things, in substance as follows: That he first knew of the existence of said written instrument on May 6, 1917; that he was in New York City on May 5, 1917, until he left for Boston about midnight ; that in his said testimony he gave a detailed statement of his whereabouts at different times during the evening of that day. He was cross-examined at length on the question of when he first knew of the existence of said written instrument, and at all times adhered to his testimony that he did not know of it before May 6, 1917.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b226-6\">4\u2018\"We find that said O\u2019Brien, in Rutland, on Saturday, May 5, 1917, was expecting a telephone communication from said Eastman, in New York; that that afternoon, while O\u2019Brien was absent from his office, he received several urgent telephone calls from New York, and upon his return to his office answered said call and communicated by telephone with the person calling him; that he then went to Albany, N. Y., arriving there that evening, and there met said Eastman at the Stanwix Hall Hotel, where Eastman was registered under the alias of \u2018 G. L. Brown, Boston, \u2019 and assigned to room 63, to which room O\u2019Brien was also assigned upon his arrival; that on this occasion they were both escorted to said room by the bell boy who then knew Eastman and afterward identified O\u2019Brien; that they both occupied the said room and were there together; that some hours later said Eastman left Albany for 'Boston where he arrived the following morning, and that he paid for the room so occupied in Stanwix Hall Hotel, both for himself and for O\u2019Brien, before leaving; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>that O\u2019Brien returned to Rutland the following day, Sunday, May 6, 1917, and at about noon of that day delivered to said Fenton Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1, together with other papers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-3\">\u201cWe find that said O\u2019Brien did not find Plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit No. 1 in the old files of Joel G. Baker, a conclusion in. which we are fortified by the fact that a certain character in the typewriting of said written instrument could not have been in use during the business life of said Baker, as above alluded to. We find that said 0 \u2019Brien did not keep said written instrument in his safe until one Sunday in May, 1917. We find that said written instrument came into his possession through some arrangement and understanding between him and said Eastman. We find that their meeting at Albany on this occasion had to do with said written instrument, its supposed discovery, and its delivery to said Fenton on the day following. We are helped to this conclusion by the testimony of said 0 \u2019Brien in said trial, detailing the cause and occasion of his presence there and what occurred there \u2014 an explanation both unreasonable and incredible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b227-4\">\u201cTherein he said he was called by telephone from New York by a man named Stiegel, with whom he had had no business or correspondence, whom he had never seen, and as to whose usual business he had no knowledge; that upon meeting said Stiegel in said hotel office in Albany, he learned that the occasion of their meeting was to consult about the-formation of a corporation in Vermont; that he was called upon to explain the corporation laws of Vermont, but received no explanation from Stiegel as to the business the proposed corporation was to transact; that they also talked over the matter of some explosive but couldn\u2019t tell how long; that they talked about corporation matters for from fifteen minutes to half an hour; that he talked with Stiegel for about two hours; that there was another man with Stiegel, who was with them when they talked of corporation matters, but whose name he couldn\u2019t tell; that on this occasion he learned nothing whatever respecting Stiegel\u2019s past or what he intended to do later; that Stiegel did not give him his address in New York, or tell him where he lived or what state he lived in; that he received a fee of four hundred dollars for his services on that occasion, which was paid at the time, the fee being arranged before he left his office in Rutland.
