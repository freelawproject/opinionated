In 2009, a trial was held before a Judicial Hearing Officer which resulted in a judgment, dated January 6, 2010, which, inter alia, held \u201cthat the courses and distances defining defendant [s\u2019] property are accurately described and set forth on the Youngsblood map dated September 4, 1979 . . . and the Dolson map dated August 1, 2006.\u201d The judgment did not address the defendants\u2019 counterclaim seeking injunctive relief against the plaintiffs. In February 2012, the defendants filed an order to show cause under the same index number as the judgment, inter alia, to hold the plaintiffs in contempt for their alleged violation of the judgment, to enjoin the plaintiffs from performing any construction work on or near the properties\u2019 boundaries pending a determination of the proceedings to hold the plaintiffs in contempt, and to permanently enjoin certain construction work.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-4\">A hearing was held on that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to hold the plaintiffs in contempt. During the hearing, the Supreme Court, in effect, preliminarily enjoined the plaintiffs from performing certain construction work pending a determination of that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion, stating that it was \u201cissuing a stop work order immediately.\u201d After the hearing but prior to any determination of that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to hold the plaintiffs in contempt, the plaintiffs moved, by order to show cause, inter alia, to dismiss the proceedings to hold them in contempt and to vacate the \u201cstop work order\u201d issued during the hearing. In the order appealed from, the Supreme Court, among other things, denied those branches of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion, and the plaintiffs appeal. Now, more than three years after the \u201cstop work order\u201d was issued, the Supreme Court has not made any determination on that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to hold the plaintiffs in contempt, and the \u201cstop work order\u201d remains in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">A court\u2019s power to punish for civil contempt is found in Judiciary Law \u00a7 753 (A) (3) <em>(see Matter of Department of Envtl. Protection of City of N.Y. v Department of Envtl. Conservation of State of N.Y., </em>70 NY2d 233, 239 [1987]). \u201cTo sustain a finding of civil contempt, a court must find that the alleged contemnor violated a lawful order of the court, clearly expressing an unequivocal mandate of which that party had knowledge, and that, as a result of the violation, a right of a party to the litigation was prejudiced\u201d <em>(Town of Huntington v </em>Reuschenberg, 70 AD3d 814, 815 [2010]; <em>see McCain v Dinkins, </em>84 NY2d 216, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>226 [1994]; <em>Incorporated Vil. of Plandome Manor v Ioannou, </em>54 AD3d 365, 366 [2008]). Here, contrary to the defendants\u2019 contentions, the judgment dated January 6, 2010, only declared \u201cthe courses and distances defining defendant [s\u2019] property\u201d as reflected in two maps; it did not contain an unequivocal mandate such as an injunction <em>(see Matter of Smith v De Paz, </em>105 AD3d 749, 751 [2013]; <em>Matter of Korn v Gulotta, </em>186 AD2d 195, 197 [1992]; <em>see also </em>Judiciary Law \u00a7 753 [A] [3]; <em>Berlitz Publs. v Berlitz, </em>37 NY2d 878, 880 [1975]; <em>Hush v Taylor, </em>121 AD3d 1363, 1365 [2014]). As such, the plaintiffs cannot be found in contempt of the judgment (see <em>Delijani v Delijani, </em>73 AD3d 972, 973 [2010]). Therefore, the Supreme Court should have granted those branches of the plaintiffs\u2019 motion which were to dismiss the proceedings to hold them in contempt and to vacate the \u201cstop work order\u201d that was issued during the contempt hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-4\">However, the matter must be remitted to the Supreme Court, Rockland County, for a hearing and determination of the remaining branch of the defendants\u2019 motion, which was to grant them permanent injunctive relief against the plaintiffs. In order to compel the plaintiffs to respect the boundary lines as set forth in the judgment, the defendants were required to either bring a separate plenary action to enforce their rights <em>(see Lynch v Bailey, </em>279 App Div 650 [1951], <em>affd </em>304 NY 669 [1952]; <em>see also Maflo Holding Corp. v S. J. Blume, Inc., </em>308 NY 570, 575 [1955]; <em>Dale Renting Corp. v Bard, </em>39 Misc 2d 266, 267-268 [Sup Ct, Kings County 1963], <em>affd </em>19 AD2d 799 [1963]), or to move \u201cat the foot of the judgment\u201d for follow-up relief <em>(Berlitz Publs. v Berlitz, </em>37 NY2d at 879 [internal quotation marks omitted]; <em>see Matter of Korn v Gulotta, </em>186 AD2d at 198; <em>Auer v Dyson, </em>125 Misc 2d 274, 275-276 [Sup Ct, Oneida County 1984], <em>affd </em>112 AD2d 803 [1985]; <em>see also </em>Siegel, NY Prac \u00a7 441 at 771 [5th ed 2011]). The defendants, in effect, chose the latter course by filing the order to show cause, inter alia, for permanent injunctive relief under the same index number as the judgment. However, the Supreme Court did not address that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was for permanent injunctive relief. Rather, the Supreme Court only held a hearing on that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was to hold the plaintiffs in contempt for their alleged violation of the judgment. Accordingly, that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion which was for permanent injunctive relief remains pending and undecided, and we remit the matter for a hearing and determination of that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion. In order to maintain the status quo pending the hearing and determination of that branch of the defendants\u2019 motion, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>temporary restraining order issued by the Supreme Court on March 2, 2012, continues to remain in full force and effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">In light of our determination, we need not reach the parties\u2019 remaining contentions.</p>\n<judges id=\"Amv\">Dillon, J.P., Dickerson, Duffy and Barros, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
