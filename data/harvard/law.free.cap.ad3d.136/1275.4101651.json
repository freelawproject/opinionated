Dillon, J.], entered Apr. 17, 2015) to review a determination of respondent. The determination terminated the employment of petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-7\">It is hereby ordered that the determination is unanimously confirmed without costs and the petition is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1099-8\">Memorandum: Petitioner commenced this CPLR article 78 proceeding seeking to annul the determination finding him guilty of misconduct and terminating his employment as a firefighter. Contrary to petitioner\u2019s contention, we conclude that the determination is supported by substantial evidence, i.e., \u201csuch relevant proof as a reasonable mind may accept as adequate to support a conclusion or ultimate fact\u201d <em>(300 Gramatan Ave. Assoc. v State Div. of Human Rights, </em>45 NY2d 176, 180 [1978]; <em>see </em>CPLR 7803 [4]). We likewise reject petitioner\u2019s contention that the Hearing Officer erred in determining that he misrepresented the facts of the 911 call underlying this proceeding. Although petitioner presented evidence to the contrary, \u201c[t]he Hearing Officer was entitled to weigh the parties\u2019 conflicting . . . evidence and to assess the credibility of the witnesses, and \u2018[w]e may not weigh the evidence or reject [the Hearing Officer\u2019s] choice where the evidence is conflicting and room for a choice exists\u2019 \u201d <em>(Matter of Clouse v Allegany County, </em>46 AD3d 1381, 1382 [2007], quoting <em>Matter of CUNY-Hostos Community Coll. v State Human Rights Appeal Bd., </em>59 NY2d 69, 75 [1983]; <em>see Matter of Childs v City of Little Falls, </em>109 AD3d 1148, 1149 [2013]). We further conclude that the penalty imposed is not \u201c \u2018so disproportionate to the offense [s] as to be shocking to one\u2019s sense of fairness,\u2019 \u201d and thus it does not constitute an abuse of discretion <em>(Matter of Kelly v Safir, </em>96 NY2d 32, 38 [2001], <em>rearg denied </em>96 NY2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1276\">*1276</page-number>854 [2001]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AqYW\">Present \u2014 Smith, J.P., Peradotto, Lindley, DeJoseph and Scudder, JJ.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
