The word, affairs, in the provision of \u00a7 7, article IH. of the constitution, which prohibits the passage of any local or special act regulating the affairs of a county, means such affairs as affect the people of that county: Morrison v.

Frost against John Cherry, which appeal was put at issue by the prothonotary, on the plea of nil debet.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-9\">When the case was called for trial on October 10, 1887, a case stated was agreed upon and filed, in the nature of a special verdict, and was as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-10\">A. Frost, the above named plaintiff, was heretofore, to-wit: on the first day of July, A. D. 1887, possessed of a certain close, to-wit: fields and grounds kept for inclosures, in the township of Cherrytree, in the county of Venango; and, while so thereof being possessed, the cattle of said defendant on, to-wit, the first day of July A. D. 1887, entered into and trespassed on said fields and grounds kept for inclosures, to the damage of the said plaintiff in the sum of six dollars ; and said plaintiff further states that the said close, to-wit: the fields and grounds kept for inclosures, were not fenced in requirement to the provisions of the act of 1700, or any subsequent legislation as to fences in the commonwealth of Pennsylvania.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-11\">And the said defendant admits the trespass as above alleged ; and, that prior to the time of said trespass, an election had been held in said county of Venango in pursuance of the provisions of \u00a7 2, act of June 23,1885, P. L. 142, and for the purpose therein set forth, and that a majority of the electors of said county voted at said election \u201cIn favm of repeal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b442-12\">If the court be of the opinion that upon the facts as above stated the plaintiff is entitled to judgment, then judgment so to be entered; if not, then judgment for defendant; the costs <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number>to follow the judgment, and either party reserving the right to sue out a writ, of error therein.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-5\">The cause was argued on October 26,1887, and on January 23, 1888, the court, Taylob, P.

McKinney, Addison, 258; Gregg v. Gregg, 55 Pa. 227.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-7\">The questions raised and argued by counsel may be reduced to these propositions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-8\">1. Was the 1st section of the act of 1700 in force in Yenango county at the time of its alleged repeal, in pursuance of the act of June 23, 1885?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-9\">2. Is said act of June 23, 1885, unconstitutional by reason of its being special or local legislation ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-10\">3. Is said act unconstitutional by reason of its delegation of the sovereign power to the people ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-11\">1. As to the first question, was the 1st section of the act of 1700 in force in this county at the time of the alleged repeal?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-12\">Since the act of 1700 there has been enacted in this commonwealth 65 general and local acts for separate counties, and at least 120 local acts affecting particular cities, townships and boroughs, relating to fences and strays.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-13\">By the successful overthrow of the authority of the British crown, all laws theretofore enacted under its authority, or by its representatives, were abrogated, and on the 28th day of January, 1777, the general assembly enacted the following statute : \u201c That each and every one of the laws or acts of general assembly that were in force and binding on the inhabitants of said province on the 14th day of May last, shall be in force and binding on the inhabitants of this state from and after the 10th day of February next, as fully and effectually to all intents and purposes as if said laws had been enacted by this general assembly: \u201d 1 Sm. L. 429. During the seventy-six years which elapsed between the enactment of 1700 and the 14th day of May, 1777, several acts relating to fences and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>strays had. been passed. An examination of these acts shows that on the 14th day of May, 1777, the only part of the act of 1700 then in force was the first clause, which provides: \u201cThat all cornfields and grounds, kept for inclosure within the said province and counties annexed, shall be well fenced.\u201d In the case of Gregg v. Gregg, decided in 1868, Justice Strong, delivering the opinion, reviews the different acts, and holds that the clause of the act of 1700, above recited, is in force without restriction or limitation to any portion of the state. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the first clause of the act of 1700, requiring owners of improved lands to fence the same, was in force in this county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-5\">2. The second proposition raises the question of the constitutionality of the act of June 28,1885, by reason of its alleged special or local legislation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-6\">The act is entitled: \u201c An act to repeal the 1st section of an act for regulating and maintaining of fences, passed in 1700.\u201d After reciting the 1st section of the act of 1700 verbatim, it closes as follows: . . . .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b444-7\">The 7th section of article III. of the constitution of 1.874, inter alia, provides: \u201c The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, horou-ghs, or school districts.\u201d In another clause: \u201c Nor shall the general assembly indirectly enact such special or local law by the partial repeal of a general law ; but laws repealing local or special acts may be passed.\u201d The word, affairs, as herein used, has received a judicial construction. Prior to the framing and adoption of the constitution of 1874, special or local legislation had become an evil of great magnitude, and it required and received special attention upon the part of the convention moulding the organic law, in order, if possible, to effectually prevent the recurrence of the public wrongs and evils which had been perpetrated by such special and local legislation in the past. The earnest endeavors of the members of the convention to effectually eradicate all special or local legislation, thenceforth, from our statute books, is evident by the fact that they not only prohibited such legislation in plain, unmistakable language, thus: \u201c The general assembly shall not pass any local or special law,\u201d etc., but to emphasize their intention that no more of the vicious legislation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>should in an indirect manner be enacted, in another clause they farther extended the prohibition as follows: \u201cNor shall the general assembly indirectly enact such special or local laws by the'partial repeal of a general law,\u201d etc. Our Supreme Court, in their construction of acts apparently in conflict with these wise provisions of the constitution, have rigidly adhered to such an interpretation as carried into effect the intention of its framers, and upon every occasion have placed their seal of condemnation, not only upon every open violation, but also every secret attempt to evade the wise provisions \u201c under the attempted disguise of a general law:\u201d Scowden\u2019s App., 96 Pa. 425.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-5\">That general legislation upon all subjects is impossible, and therefore classification upon subjects and persons is necessarily without the limits of constitutional prohibition may be conceded : Wheeler v. Philadelphia, 77 Pa. 346; Kilgore v. Magee, 85 Pa. 401; Commonwealth v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-6\">Under the latest decision of our Supreme Court, a local or special act is one which operates or may operate within only a portion of the territory occupied by the persons or things to which the legislation naturally and properly relates. In the light of this definition of what constitutes local or special legislation, let us examine the act of 1885. If the 1st section stood alone, there would be no difficulty, for it simply repeals the 1st section of the act of 1700 ; but the 2d section is inseparably connected with the 1st. The 1st is a dead letter upon the statute books, dependent upon the provisions of the 2d section being carried affirmatively into effect; further, the 1st section expressly provides that the 1st section shall not take effect until the provisions of the 2d are fully consummated. The two sections must, therefore, respectively be construed and passed upon as a whole.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b445-7\">The first thing to be noticed is the innate modesty of the act. The 2d section commences: \u201c That it shall be the duty of the sheriff of any county, on the request of the county commissioners thereof,\u201d etc. The whole law is to be put in operation at the request of the county commissioners. Suppose the commissioners should refuse to act, how would they be compelled? I am aware that the word \u201cmay,\u201d in some cases where the public interests are at stake, has been construed as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>\u201c shall,\u201d but I do not now remember of a single case where a simple request has been enforced by mandamus. I am informed, whether correctly or otherwise, that, in the mountainous counties of the state, the citizens are largely opposed to the law; whether true or not, matters not; the principle is the same. Each separate county in the state may accept of the provisions, or may reject them. The act contemplates the division of the state into counties; each one to act by itself, and for itself. In one or more the popular vote may be in favor of \u201c the repeal,\u201d and in such county or counties it is provided that \u201c the act shall take effect forthwith,\u201d and thenceforth therein the common law is the rule of action. And every owner of cattle in such county would be held responsible for any damages arising from their trespasses. Other counties may vote \u201cagainst the repeal,\u201d qr not vote at all, and in such counties the first clause of the act of 1700 still remains the law. Thus it is seen that we have different laws upon the same subject-matter, bounded and defined by distinct territorial limits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b446-5\">Such a result creates the very evil the framers of the constitution intended to remedy or prevent. It matters not that every county in the commonwealth may accept the provisions of the act of 1885; the vice in the act consists in that any county may reject it. In Scranton Sch. D.\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 176, the 1st section of the syllabus is as follows: \u201cIf an act regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, etc., .... either produces or may produce local results, it offends against \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution, and is therefore void.\u201d In the opinion it is, inter alia, said: \u201c Whether the methods \u2022 prescribed by the act shall be the law, will depend, not upon the act of the legislature, but upon the will of others who are hot law-makers at all; and what may be the law in one city of the third class, may not be the law in another city of the same class. In other words, a majority of the members of the city council, in any city of the third class, may impose upon the inhabitants of that city a method of taxation which may not prevail in any other city of this commonwealth. A law which authorizes this to be done, in our judgment, is clearly obnoxious to the 7th section of article III. of the constitution, which prohibits the general assembly from passing any local or special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>law regulating the affairs of counties, etc.....The circumstance that the power to determine the question is delegated to another body does not at all affect the question. The practical result is the same ; the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept, and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are, or may be, produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against the provisions of the constitution, and is void,\u201d citing Commonwealth v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258; Scowden\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 425, and other cases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-5\">This ruling of the Supreme Court is decisive of the question. Some counties may accept, \"the provisions of the act of 1885, while others may reject, and the practical result is that the act will be limited to those counties who do accept, aud this makes the act local. I am, therefore, of the opinion that the act clearly is within the constitutional prohibition, and is void.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-6\">The third proposition, relating to the delegation of sovereign power, would seem to be ruled by Locke\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 491; but the view which I have taken of the second question raised makes it unnecessary to express an opinion upon it. For the reasons given, judgment is ordered to be entered for the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-7\">Judgment having been entered as ordered, the plaintiff took this writ and specified that the court erred:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-8\">1. Tn declaring the said act of June 28, 1885, unconstitutional.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b447-9\">2. In rendering judgment for the defendant, on the case stated.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b447-10\"><em>Mr. J. JI. Osmer </em>(with him <em>Mr. H. D. Jlaneoelc), </em>for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b447-12\">1. Tt is not claimed, nor can it be, that the first section of the act of June 23, 1885, P. L. 142, standing alone, is unconstitutional. The first section of the act of 1700 is unconditionally and absolutely repealed by the act of 1885, and while we do not concede the unconstitutionality of the latter act, for any reason, we say that though part of a statute is unconstitutional, that fact does not authorize the courts to declare the remainder void, unless all the provisions are so connected in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>subject matter, depending on each other, operating for the same purpose, or otherwise connected in meaning, that it cannot be presumed the legislature would have passed one without the other: Cooley\u2019s Const. Lim., 5th ed. 212, 178*; Commonwealth v. Potts, 69 Pa. 164.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-5\">2. But the validity of the act in question does not require such construction. It was declared unconstitutional by the court below, solely because it is provided by its second section that it should not go into effect in any county until after a majority of the electors of such county should vote in favor of such repeal; and, because it is manifest that some counties might vote in favor of and others against the repeal, or, by not voting at all, retain the act of 1700, it is therefore special legislation and violative of \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution. But special or local legislation is prohibited by the constitution only as to the subjects enumerated in \u00a7 7, article III. As to all other subjects, the power of the legislature is the same as it was before the adoption of the constitution.</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-6\">8. The act of 1700 cannot be said in any sense to regulate county, city, township, ward, or school district affairs. Whether the owner of land fences it or not, is optional with him under that act; it is purely a personal and individual affair. Hence, the act of 1885 does not relate to either of the prohibited subjects. It was the subject matter of the statutes, passed upon in Scranton Seh. D.\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 176; Commonwealth v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258, and Morrison v. Bachert, 112 Pa. 322, which determined their un constitutionality, and we submit that these adjudications have no application.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b448-7\">4. Moreover, there is no delegation of legislative power in the act of 1885. The act as passed and approved is complete-. Only the question as to whether its provisions are desirable or expedient is left to the electors of the several counties. \u201cWhen the legislature calls to its aid only the means of ascertaining the utility of a measure, and does not delegate the power to amend the law, it is acting within its powers: \u201d Locke\u2019s App., 72 Pa. 491. Such was the ruling of this court upon the constitutionality of the local option law. Laws of this nature, relating to subjects like the retailing of intoxicating drinks, or the running at large of cattle, are sustained as being within the class of police regulations in respect to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>it is proper that the local judgment should control: Cooley Const. Lim., 5th ed., 125*; Commonwealth v. Bennett, 108 Mass. 27 (11 Amer. R. 304); Commonwealth v. Dean, 110 Mass. 357.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b449-5\"><em>Mr. W. J. </em>Breene, for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-6\">1. \u201cA constitution is not to receive a technical construction, like a common law instrument, or a statute. It is to be interpreted so as to carry out the great principles of government, not to defeat them: \u201d Commonwealth v. Clark, 7 W. &amp; S. 127. When it speaks of the affairs of a county, it means such affairs as affect the people of that county: Morrison v. Bachert, 112 Pa. 322. The word affairs is to he liberally and beneficially interpreted: Buckalew on The Constitution, 72.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b449-7\">2. It is self-evident that the whole machinery of the act of 1885 is to he put into operation by the county commissioners acting as such, and not in their individual capacity; the sheriff, by virtue of his office, must satisfy the requirements as to publication ; and lastly, the qualified electors of the particular county decide whether or not the act shall take effect in that county. Thus the legislature recognizes the proposed regulation of the fence law of 1700 by the act of 1885, as a regulation of county affairs. The act is therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b449-8\">Opisiox,</p>\n<author id=\"AWh\">Mu. Justice Paxson :</author>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">This case involves the constitutionality of the act of assembly of June 23, 1885, P. L. 142, entitled \u201cAn act to repeal the first section of an act entitled \u2018 An act for regulating and maintaining of fences,\u2019 passed Anno Domini one thousand and seven hundred.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">The first section repeals in terms the above recited act of 1700, commonly known as the fence law. Had it stopped here, there would have been no question as to its validity. But the second section contains this important provision: \u201c That it shall be the duty of the sheriff of any county, on the request of the county commissioners thereof, to cause this act to be published therein, with and in the same manner that notices of the next general election shall be published; and for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not the provisions of this act are deemed expedient and desired in such county, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>qualified, electors thereof may vote, at such next general election, by ballots, written or printed, as follows, namely: On the outside the words, \u2018 Repeal of the\u00b0fence law,\u2019 and on the inside the words, \u2018In favor of repeal,\u2019 or 1 Against repeal; \u2019 and in receiving, counting, and making returns of the ballots aforesaid, the judge, inspectors, and clerks shall be governed by the laws of this commonwealth regulating general elections; and if, upon a proper count of such ballots in any county, it shall appear that a majority thereof are \u2018 In favor of repeal,\" this act shall forthwith take effect therein; but the same shall not take effect in any county of this commonwealth until it has been ascertained that the provisions thereof are deemed expedient and desired therein by an election as hereinbefore provided: Provided, That if at an election held in any county under the provisions of this act, it shall appear that a majority of the votes cast thereat are \u2018 Against repeal,\u2019 no vote shall be taken again as herein provided for the period of three years thereafter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">It is contended, and the learned judge below so held, that the act is in conflict with \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution, which provides, inter alia, that \u201c The General Assembly shall not pass any local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">The word, affairs, as used in the constitution, has received a judicial construction by this court. In Morrison v. Bachert, 112 Pa. 322, it was said: \u201c When it (the constitution) speaks of the affairs of a county, \u201c it means such affairs as affect the people of that county.\u201d We accordingly held in that case that an act to ascertain and appoint the fees to be received by prothonotaries and other county officers was an act regulating the affairs of counties; while in Commonwealth v. Patton, 88 Pa. 258, and in Scowden\u2019s Appeal, 96 Pa. 422, we ruled that an act of assembly which authorized the holding of special sessions of the courts of Crawford county, away from the county seat, offended against this clause in the constitution. The particular device resorted to in these cases to evade the constitutional prohibition was classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">The act of 1885 concerns the great body of the people of the county. It affects every farmer, almost every lot-holder, and every person who keeps horses or cattle, sheep, hogs, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>goats. It would seem difficult to frame an act which could more generally concern the people. Moreover, it prescribes certain duties to the sheriff, the commissioners, and all the election officers. How then can it be said that it does not relate to the \u201c affairs \u201d of counties within the meaning of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Is it a local law ? Upon this point we are free from doubt. It is to be observed that the first section, repealing the act of 1700, does not go into effect in any county by its own force. If it did, we might sustain it even if the rest of the act were unconstitutional. But the first section is tied to the second section by an umbilical cord. If we cut it they both perish. The first section is only effective after a vote of the people in each county. If a majority in any county vote in favor of it, then the act takes effect in such county ; if the majority should be against it, the act does not take effect. Thus it may very well happen that Venango county may vote in favor of the repeal and its adjoining counties vote against it. We would then have one law in Venango county regulating fences, and a different law in the adjoining counties, both local laws, the very thing prohibited by the constitution. Nor would it make any difference were every county in the state to vote the same way. The test is not results, but possibilities. The machinery to test the sense of the people can only be put in operation by the county commissioners, and when so moved, the fact that it may be renderedlocal in its effects is fatal to the bill. In City of Scranton School D.\u2019s App., 113 Pa. 176, it was said by Mr. Justice G-eebn, in delivering the opinion of the court: \u201c The circumstance that the power to determine the question is delegated to another body does not at all affect the question. The practical result is the same; the law of 1875 will be limited to the one or more cities that do accept and that makes it local. All our recent decisions are to the effect that if local results either are or may be produced by a piece of legislation, it offends against this provision of the constitution and is void ; \u201d citing Commonwealth v. Patton, supra, and other cases. Scranton School D.\u2019s App., is upon all fours with the case in hand. The act of 1875 there referred to was an act for the assessment, levy, and collection of all taxes authorized to be collected in certain cities, and to which by the proviso of the fifth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>section no city of the third class shall become subject until . they are accepted by ordinance of councils, approved by the mayor, and it was held that the first five sections thereof were thus limited to the one or more cities that accept, and were therefore local and in conflict with \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">If there is anything now settled in the constitution it is that the legislature can no longer pass a valid local or special law regulating the affairs of counties, cities, townships, wards, boroughs, or school districts. And what the legislature may not do directly, it cannot accomplish by indirection, as by classification resting upon no necessity nor reason of public policy, or by calling in the aid of the people at the polls to breathe life into an otherwise dead statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">I have not considered it necessary to discuss the question of the delegation of power. The act of 1885 is in such direct conflict with \u00a7 7, article III. of the constitution, that the learned judge below could not have done otherwise than declare it void for that reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
