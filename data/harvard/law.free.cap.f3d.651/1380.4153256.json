Smith (\u201cSmith\u201d) appeals a decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) that denied him a rating of total disability based on individual unemployability (\u201cTDIU\u201d). Smith argued that the Veterans Administration (\u201cVA\u201d) was required to obtain an industrial survey from a vocational expert to evaluate TDIU claims such as Smith\u2019s. The Veterans Court rejected this argument. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">Smith served in active military duty for training from July 1972 to November 1972, active military duty from February 1975 to February 1979, and in the Army National Guard before and after his active service. While not serving in the military, Smith worked as a \u201claborer in a supply company and in the coal mines ... for 13 years\u201d and as a carpenter. J.A. 38. In January 1997, Smith filed a claim for entitlement to TDIU. TDIU provides a veteran with a total disability rating even where his disability rating is below 100% if the veteran is at least 60% disabled, meets other disability rating criteria, and is \u201cunable to secure or follow a substantially gainful occupation as a result of service-connected disabilities.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.16(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-12\">In September 1998, the VA regional office denied Smith\u2019s TDIU claim. From 1998 to 2007, the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) remanded Smith\u2019s claim to the VA for further development three times, and Smith underwent a total of five VA medical examinations. By 2007, Smith had a combined service-connected disability rating of 80% based on neck, back, cardiovascular, eye, and hearing disorders. Finally, in November 2007, the Board denied Smith\u2019s TDIU claim. The Board found that his 80% combined rating (with at least one disability rated at 40%) met the threshold requirements for a TDIU claim. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.16(a). However, taking into account Smith\u2019s work history, his educational background, and reports from VA medical examiners, the Board found that Smith\u2019s disabilities were not \u201cso disabling as to prevent him from securing and maintaining all forms of substantially gainful employment consistent with a work background that would be consistent with either sedentary employment or certainly light manual labor.\u201d J.A. 35. The basis for this finding was, in significant part, the conclusions of the VA medical examiners.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-13\">While the medical examiners did not suggest that Smith could perform his previous employment as a laborer in the coal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1011\">*1011</page-number>mines or a carpenter, they concluded that he was not prevented from performing other jobs. One examiner concluded, based in part on Smith\u2019s enrollment in business classes, that he would be capable of \u201c[d]esk jobs\u201d or other activities \u201csimilar to that of schooling\u201d that would not involve \u201cheavy labor.\u201d J.A. 45. Another examiner stated that Smith \u201cshould be able to assume gainful employment doing most types of work which do not involve heavy lifting (above 20-30 pounds), excessive bending, or climbing. He would certainly be able to assume all types of sedentary and light work.\u201d J.A. 50-51. A third examiner determined that Smith\u2019s cardiovascular disorder would not prevent him from being gainfully employed. Lastly, a VA examiner found that Smith\u2019s eye disorder would only preclude him from jobs where excellent depth perception was required or double vision would be a serious risk (i.e., jobs involving driving or heavy equipment operation).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Smith appealed the Board\u2019s decision to the Veterans Court, which affirmed. The Veterans Court found that the Board\u2019s conclusion was not clearly erroneous. It also rejected Smith\u2019s argument that the Board did not take \u201chis potential transferable occupational skills or educational background\u201d into account. <em>Smith v. Shinseki, </em>No. 08-3702, 2010 WL 3180417, slip op. at 3 (Vet.App. Aug. 11, 2010). Lastly, the Veterans Court held that the VA was not obligated to obtain an industrial survey from a vocational expert in order to evaluate whether Smith was employable in a job other than his former occupation (i.e., a job that did not involve heavy manual labor). Smith timely appealed, and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a) and (c), our review of decisions of the Veterans Court is limited to a \u201cchallenge to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof____\u201d Smith challenges the Veterans Court\u2019s interpretation of 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A \u2014 the duty to assist statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The duty to assist statute provides that the VA \u201cshall make reasonable efforts to assist a claimant in obtaining evidence necessary to substantiate the claimant\u2019s claim for [veterans] benefit[s].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Smith argues that an industrial survey from a vocational expert (or its equivalent) is \u201cnecessary\u201d in all TDIU cases in which \u201ca veteran\u2019s service-connected disabilities prevent him ... from performing the duties of his ... prior employment\u201d but where he may be able to \u201csecure alternative employment.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 11, 15. According to Smith, in this situation, only an industrial survey \u201ccan ... tell us what jobs are available in the labor market [that are] compatible with the claimant\u2019s physical [and] mental limitations [and] educational and employment experience.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 19. Although Smith fails to fully explain what an industrial survey entails, it apparently involves collecting job market data, comparing available jobs with an individual\u2019s skills and experience, and thereby enabling a vocational expert to determine \u201cwhether jobs are available, to which ... [the] claimant can make a work adjustment, and the incidence of those jobs in the economy.\u201d Jon C. Du-bin, <em>Overcoming Gridlock: Campbell After a Quarter-Century and Bureaucratically Rational Gap-filling in Mass Justice Adjudication in the Social Security Administration\u2019s Disability Programs, </em>62 Admin. L.Rev. 937, 965 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">This question whether the VA is obligated to supply a vocational expert as a matter of course in eases where the veteran cannot perform his old job is an issue of first impression. We agree with the Vet<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1012\">*1012</page-number>erans Court that the statute does not require the VA to obtain such a survey in all cases in which a veteran is unable to return to his former occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">We note first that the statute includes no explicit reference to industrial surveys or vocational expert reports. In contrast, the statute specifically requires the VA to obtain \u201c[t]he claimant\u2019s medical records,\u201d \u201c[a]ny [other] relevant records\u201d identified by the claimant (including government records), and \u201ca medical examination or ... a medical opinion\u201d when that examination or opinion is \u201cnecessary.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A(b)-(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The explicit reference to medical expert reports without a reference to vocational expert reports provides evidence that Congress did not view such industrial surveys as \u201cnecessary.\u201d Like the statute, nothing in the VA\u2019s regulation implementing the duty to assist statute explicitly requires the VA to obtain an industrial survey or consult non-medical experts even though the regulation identifies specific instances in which the duty to assist applies, including \u201cobtaining records\u201d and \u201cproviding medical examinations or obtaining medical opinions.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.159(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">Nevertheless, in and of itself, the failure of the statute or the regulation to specifically require the VA to provide an industrial survey from a vocational expert is not dispositive. The duty to assist statute could still require the VA to obtain an industrial survey if it were \u201cnecessary to substantiate\u201d the veteran\u2019s claim. However, here, the administrative scheme makes it clear that such a survey is not \u201cnecessary\u201d as a matter of course for TDIU claims of the type identified by Mr. Smith.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Smith\u2019s primary argument is that the VA must consider the availability of work in making a TDIU determination. The VA regulation governing TDIU claims includes no requirement that the agency consider the availability of work and makes no reference to vocational experts or industrial surveys. <em>See </em>38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.16. While the TDIU regulation requires that the veteran be capable of obtaining employment that would provide income \u201cexceeding] ... the poverty threshold for one person,\u201d it does not state that a particular job meeting this standard must exist in the national or local economy. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4.16(a). The VA\u2019s Adjudication Procedures Manual (published by VA in order to provide guidance to its adjudicators) explicitly states that the \u201cavailability of work\u201d is an \u201cextraneous factor\u201d that is irrelevant to the TDIU determination. VA Adjudication Procedures Manual Rewrite M21-1MR, Part IV, Sub-part ii, Chapter 2, Section F, 2-F-12.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1013\">*1013</page-number>We have previously held that VA interpretations of its own regulations in its Adjudication Procedures Manual are \u201ccontrolling\u201d as long as they are not \u201cplainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\u201d <em>Thun v. Shinseki, </em>572 F.3d 1366, 1369 (Fed.Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 461, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997)). We thus defer to this interpretation of the TDIU regulation, which is consistent with the Veterans Court\u2019s standard. That standard does not require a showing that jobs exist in sufficient numbers in the economy. <em>See, e.g., Van Hoose v. Brown, 4 </em>Vet.App. 361, 363 (1993) (\u201cThe sole fact that a claimant is unemployed or has difficulty obtaining employment is not enough. A high rating in itself is a recognition that the impairment makes it difficult to obtain and keep employment. The question is whether the veteran is <em>capable </em>of performing the physical and mental acts required by employment, not whether the veteran can find employment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Given that a TDIU determination does not require any analysis of the actual opportunities available in the job market, we decline to conclude that an industrial survey is \u201cnecessary\u201d for that purpose in connection with TDIU claims. Because job market information is not required, the duty to assist does not require the VA to provide such information through an industrial survey.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">To support his contrary interpretation, Smith relies on cases involving Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) disability determinations. These cases held that, at least in some circumstances, the SSA was required to provide vocational expert testimony or similar evidence. <em>See, e.g., DeLorme v. Sullivan, </em>924 F.2d 841, 850 (9th Cir.1991); <em>Fields v. Bowen, </em>805 F.2d 1168, 1170 (5th Cir.1986). However, the SSA scheme differs significantly from the VA\u2019s approach. The SSA regulations expressly provide that \u201cany other work [besides your former occupation] that you can adjust to must exist in significant numbers in the national economy\u201d and that \u201c[SSA is] responsible for providing evidence that demonstrates that other work exists in significant numbers in the national economy that you can do, given your residual functional capacity....\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1560(c). The SSA regulations also specifically envision that \u201c[SSA] may use the services of a vocational expert or other specialist,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 404.1566(d), and a 1983 Social Security precedential ruling determined that, in some cases, \u201cthe assistance of a vocational resource may be necessary.\u201d SSR 83-14: Titles II and XVI: Capability To Do Other Work (1983), <em>available at </em>http://www. socialsecurity.gov/OP_Home/rulings/di/02/ SSR83-14-di-02.html.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Smith argues that, quite apart from determining the availability of work, a vocational expert may be necessary to determine whether a veteran is qualified in education and experience for the type of job that he is medically fit to perform. He notes that the regulation provides that \u201cemployment history, [and] educational and vocational attainment\u201d of the veteran are relevant to a TDIU claim. 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.16(b). At the same time, the duty to assist statute provides that \u201c[n]othing ... shall be construed as precluding the Secretary from providing such other assistance ... to a claimant in substantiating a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1014\">*1014</page-number>as the Secretary considers appropriate.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103A(g). At oral argument, the government agreed that the statute provided the VA with the discretion to offer additional assistance in the form of a vocational expert when the VA concluded that it was necessary. Thus, the VA agrees that a vocational expert could be \u201cnecessary\u201d under the facts of a particular case (if, for example, the veteran were found medically qualified for a particular type of job, but there was an unusually difficult question as to whether the veteran had the educational or vocational skills for the position).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">But the relevance of education and experience or the fact that such an expert is sometimes necessary does not suggest that a vocational expert is <em>always </em>required for this purpose, and we hold that such an expert is not invariably required. We note in particular that Smith\u2019s counsel at oral argument \u201cconeede[d]\u201d that \u201cthere has to be some discretion [with] the [VA]\u201d in determining \u201cwhen and where\u201d such evidence is necessary, Oral Arg. at 10:44-11:03, <em>available at </em>http://oralarguments. cafe.uscourts.gov/default.aspx?fl=20107145.mp3.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">Smith appears to argue that the VA should have found that an expert was necessary for this purpose in this case. Even if the question of whether a vocational expert was necessary in this case were within our jurisdiction \u2014 a question on which we express no opinion \u2014 we could not conclude on these facts that the VA abused its discretion in declining to provide a vocational expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<p id=\"b372-10\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b372-11\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b368-10\">. A veteran who does not meet the disability rating thresholds may still be able to secure TDIU benefits under some circumstances if he is still \"unable to secure or follow a substantially gainful employment as a result of service-connected disabilities.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.16(b).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b370-7\">. The statute also explicitly defines when such a medical examination is \"necessary.\" It is \"necessary\u201d if the record \"contains competent evidence that the claimant has a current disability, or persistent or recurrent symptoms of disability;\u201d and \"indicates that the disability or symptoms may be associated with the claimant\u2019s active military, naval, or air service;\u201d but \"does not contain sufficient medical evidence for the Secretary to make a decision on the claim.\u201d <em>38 U.S.C. </em>\u00a7 5103A(d)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b370-8\">. So too a precedential VA general counsel opinion determined that in order to \"require an employability assessment [from VA\u2019s vocational rehabilitation service] as a matter of generally applicable adjudication policy for determining a veteran's entitlement to [TDIU] ... the Secretary must ... first promulgate substantive regulations defining the scope, purpose and criteria for conducting such an assessment.\u201d Precedential Opinion of the Office of Gen. Counsel for the Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, No. 08-1994, 4-5 (Mar. 25, 1994), <em>available at </em>http://www.va.gov/ogc/docs/1994/ Prc08-94.doc.
