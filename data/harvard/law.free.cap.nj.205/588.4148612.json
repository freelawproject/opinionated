After the Appellate Division affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions in an unpublished opinion, we granted certification to review a number of the contentions raised by defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-6\">While we now affirm the Appellate Division and sustain defendant\u2019s convictions, we hold that Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS) expert testimony cannot include any reference to the credibility of sexual abuse victims, and that an adverse inference charge may be given when a police officer destroys his or her investigatory notes before trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b639-8\">The proofs at trial included (1) the introduction of a prior inconsistent statement of the victim, defendant\u2019s step-daughter, D.L.; (2) CSAAS testimony of an expert, Dr. Richard Coco; (3) fresh complaint testimony of D.L.\u2019s boyfriend, J.C.; and (4) defendant\u2019s videotaped confession. Because specific facts relevant to each contention are noted with respect to the claims before us, we need only recite the essential proofs introduced at trial, as found by the Appellate Division, with essential additions, to be sufficient to sustain the conviction:</p>\n<p id=\"b639-9\">On January 1, 2005, at approximately 4:00 a.m., J.C. spoke with D.L., his then-sixteen-year-old former girlfriend. She told him that she and family members had been out celebrating the new year and then went home to bed. At some point thereafter, her cousin came to her bedroom and raped her. While telling J.C. this, she also told him that defendant, who is her stepfather, had also previously sexually abused her when she was fourteen years old. According to J.C., D.L. was \u201chysterical\u201d and \u201ccrying a lot.\u201d J.C. discussed what he was told with his older sister who subsequently called the Division of Youth and Family Services (DYFS).</p>\n<p id=\"b640-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>On January 12, 2005, the Passaic County Prosecutor\u2019s Office (PCPO) received a referral from DYFS, which indicated that D.L. was being sexually abused by her stepfather. Detective Donna Gade, the supervisor of the PCPO\u2019s Special Victim\u2019s Unit, immediately commenced an investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-5\">At approximately 9:00 p.m., two DYFS investigators arrived at defendant\u2019s home and asked to speak with D.L. G.R., D.L.\u2019s mother and defendant\u2019s wife, called D.L. downstairs, and the investigators spoke with D.L. privately in the kitchen for approximately fifteen minutes. The investigators did not give G.R. a reason for the visit, but G.R. assumed it had to do with the incident involving her nephew. The investigators said they would return later that evening, but did not. Instead, at approximately 10:00 p.m. that evening, Det. Gade, Detective Matthew Gallup, and two other detectives went to defendant\u2019s home to \u201ctry to locate [D.L.] and her mother as well as the suspect if he were home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b640-6\">G.R. told Det. Gade that defendant was not home. G.R. contacted defendant and he returned home about fifteen minutes later. Det. Gade testified that she met defendant outside of the house and said that she was interested in speaking with him regarding a \u201cfamily problem[.]\u201d Det. Gade asked defendant if he would accompany the detectives to the prosecutor\u2019s office and defendant agreed. G.R. also agreed to go to the prosecutor\u2019s office, and D.L. was asked to accompany her. Det. Gade transported G.R. and D.L.; defendant rode with other detectives in another ear. They arrived at the prosecutor\u2019s office around 11:00 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b640-7\">At the PCPO, defendant was placed in the polygraph room. D.L. and G.R. were placed in separate rooms because Det. Gade \u201cdidn\u2019t want anybody talking to each other.\u201d Det. Gade interviewed D.L., who said that, on two separate occasions, defendant had penetrated her vagina with his fingers and his penis. D.L. said that, after these incidents, defendant stopped touching her in a sexual manner. According to Det. Gade, D.L. appeared visibly upset and uncomfortable discussing the matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>Sometime between 12:27 a.m. and 1:40 a.m., D.L.\u2019s statement was typed. D.L. reviewed it and placed her initials on the top and bottom of each page. D.L. then signed and swore to the truthfulness of her statement before Det. Gallup. After D.L. signed her written statement, Det. Gade took defendant to an interview room for questioning. Defendant was not handcuffed and Det. Gade was not armed.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">Det. Gade provided Miranda<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> warnings to defendant, using the PCPO\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>rights and waiver form. She read each right to defendant and asked him if he understood what she said. Defendant replied that he understood and placed his initials after each right listed on the form, indicating his understanding of his rights. He also signed the \u201cwaiver of rights\u201d portion of the form. Det. Gade and Det. Gallup each signed the form as witnesses at approximately 2:10 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">Det. Gade then interviewed defendant. Defendant answered Det. Gade\u2019s preliminary questions; Det. Gade explained that defendant appeared to be \u201cpretty comfortable\u201d and \u201cacted like a gentleman throughout the whole interview.\u201d Det. Gade informed defendant that she had learned that he had engaged in inappropriate conduct with D.L. According to Det. Gade, defendant was \u201cvery shocked\u201d and denied that anything inappropriate had occurred. Defendant said that he would never do anything to hurt D.L. and she was like his \u201cown child.\u201d However, after sitting for a while and thinking, defendant told Det. Gade that \u201cyeah, you know, I do remember a time when 1 did have sex with her.\u201d Elaborating further, defendant stated that he had been drunk, came home, went to D.L.\u2019s room, crawled into D.L.\u2019s bed and had sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-7\">Defendant agreed to provide Det. Gade with a written statement. At approximately 3:42 a.m., Det. Gade left the room and returned with an individual who typed defendant\u2019s responses to her questions. Det. Gade also videotaped defendant\u2019s statement. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>In his videotaped and transcribed statement, defendant acknowledged that he had sexual relations with D.L. twice.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">Defendant stated that, on both occasions, he placed his fingers and penis in D.L.\u2019s vagina. Det. Gade asked defendant how she had treated him that evening, and he said Det. Gade had treated him \u201cwith kindness and care.\u201d After defendant\u2019s statement was completed, it was printed and given to defendant for review and signing. Defendant placed his initials on the top and bottom of each page, and signed it at the end. As they had in respect of D.L.\u2019s written statement, Det. Gade and Det. Gallup each signed the statement as witnesses. Defendant was formally arrested and charged at about 5:00 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">At trial, D.L. recanted her earlier statement; she testified that the statement she gave to the investigators was false. She said that she was in love with J.C. at the time, and defendant and G.R. did not approve of the relationship. D.L. stated that if she could not be with J.C., she would claim that defendant sexually abused her so that defendant and her mother too could not \u201cbe together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b642-7\">Defendant also testified at the trial. He said that, on January 12, 2005, he left work at around 5:00 or 5:80 p.m. and went to a \u201csocial club.\u201d Defendant drank two beers and two \u201cshots\u201d of gin. Defendant left the club about thirty to forty-five minutes later, went to his home to get maracas, and returned to the club to play with a band. Defendant said that he drank four more drinks and a \u201ccouple of shots\u201d after returning to the club.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-8\">According to defendant\u2019s trial testimony, he left the club around 10:00 or 10:15 p.m. As he was leaving, he received a phone call from G.R., who said that someone was at their house looking for him. Defendant returned home at approximately 10:15 or 10:30 p.m. A police car was in the driveway. He stated that one of the police officers grabbed him and told him to put his hands against the wall. The officers patted him down and put him into the police vehicle. Defendant asserted that he did not have an opportunity to refuse to get into the ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Defendant further testified that he was taken to the prosecutor\u2019s office, placed in a locked room and told to wait there. Although the door to the room was locked, he was allowed to leave the room with supervision to go to the bathroom. Defendant claimed that he was kept in the room for about two or two-and-a-half hours and then taken to another room. He asserted he still had no idea why he was at the prosecutor\u2019s office, and had nothing to eat or drink after he arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-6\">He also testified that he was \u201ctired\u201d and \u201ctipsy\u201d but tried to \u201ckeep [his] cool[.]\u201d According to defendant, he was taken to another room, and that Det. Gade entered the room and told him to sign a piece of paper. Defendant believed the paper was the <em>Miranda </em>form. Defendant testified that he did not remember if he understood his rights because he had never seen a form like that before.</p>\n<p id=\"b643-7\">Defendant additionally testified that Det. Gade told him that D.L. had provided a statement indicating that defendant had sex with her. Defendant denied the allegations, but Det. Gade kept repeating the details \u201cover and over again[.]\u201d He said that Det. Gade told him that he had to tell her what she wanted to hear \u201cbecause that\u2019s the only way we can all go home.\u201d Defendant testified that he was \u201ctired\u201d and \u201cjust wanted to go home.\u201d He stated that he eventually told Det. Gade \u201cwhat she wanted to heart.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b643-8\">Defendant was convicted of first-degree aggravated sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:14-2a(2)(c), second-degree sexual assault, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2c(4), second-degree endangering the welfare of a child, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:24-4a, and fourth-degree aggravated criminal sexual contact, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:14-2a(2)(e) and 14-3a. After appropriate mergers, defendant was sentenced on the aggravated sexual assault count to ten years\u2019 imprisonment, subject to the provisions of the No Early Release Act (NERA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-7.2, and to a consecutive five-year prison sentence on the endangering count. In the aggregate, then, defendant was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 imprisonment subject, on the aggravated sexual assault, to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>period of parole ineligibility of eight-and-one-half years and a mandatory five-year period of parole supervision.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-5\">On appeal, the Appellate Division affirmed the convictions over various challenges directed to evidence presented, the prosecutor\u2019s summation, the jury instructions, and certain procedural rulings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b644-6\">We granted defendant\u2019s petition for certification, 201 <em>N.J. </em>442, 991A 2d 232 (2010), and affirm the Appellate Division\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-8\">We first examine the admissibility of defendant\u2019s statement. He asserts it should have been \u201csuppressed\u201d because he was detained without probable cause and questioned \u201cin the early morning hours until his will was overborne.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Essentially defendant claims that his confession was not voluntarily given.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>As already noted, defendant was taken to PCPO headquarters at approximately 11:00 p.m., but was not given his <em>Miranda </em>warnings until 2:10 a.m. His formal statement did not start until 3:42 a.m., ended after 4:00 a.m., and he was arrested at approximately 5:00 a.m. In his videotaped statement defendant acknowledged that he drank two bottles of beer and a shot of gin the day the police came to his house, but voluntarily went to headquarters with Det. Gade. After making the statement, and acknowledging that it was truthful, defendant signed the statement in front of Det. Gallup and Det. Gade as witnesses.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b645-6\">Defendant claims that he was intoxicated, denied food, water and sleep, and forced to remain in a \u201cfour by four box\u201d for hours before being taken to another room and interrogated for more than an hour and one-half. Defendant also asserts that he gave an untrue statement and stated what Det. Gade wanted to hear because he was tired and \u201cjust wanted to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b645-7\">Before us, defendant first asserts there was no probable cause to \u201carrest\u201d and take him to PCPO headquarters. We disagree. First, while he points to defense testimony at the hearing on the motion to suppress that officers entered defendant\u2019s home without a warrant looking for him, there was no such finding by the trial judge. In any event, defendant was not there and nothing was seized. Had the police sought to arrest defendant in his home, probable cause to obtain a warrant would have been required. <em>State v. Brown, </em>205 N.J. 133, 14 A.3d 26 (2011) (\u201cAbsent exigent circumstances or consent, the police must obtain a warrant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>conduct an arrest inside a home.\u201d) (citations omitted) (Op. at 145, 14 A3d 26).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-5\">The motion judge found that defendant returned home to meet Det. Gade and voluntarily agreed to accompany her to PCPO headquarters with other family members to discuss a family matter. The voluntary act of going to headquarters thus negates the need for probable cause in this case. Furthermore, while at PCPO headquarters, it was entirely appropriate for Det. Gade to keep defendant separated from his family while obtaining information from the victim, her mother, and a DYFS investigator. Such separation does not necessitate probable cause, but was instead an attempt to safeguard D.L. <em>See State v. Buda, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>278, 949 A.2d 761 (2008) (reiterating that safety of children shall be of paramount concern and children in need must immediately be safeguarded from further injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b646-6\">We also reject defendant\u2019s contention that his recorded statement was not admissible. At the <em>N.J.R.E. </em>104 hearing to determine the admissibility of the statement, Det. Gade testified that she had been employed with PCPO for approximately twelve years, with seven years in the Megan\u2019s Law Special Victims Unit. She further testified that she \u201cread each right aloud ... verbatim,\u201d and did not force or coerce defendant to sign the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form. She admitted that she did not tape the pre-statement interview, and left defendant in the interview room by himself for a few hours.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b646-7\">With respect to the statement itself, the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> guarantees the right against self-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>incrimination, <em>Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 399-400, 963 A.2d 316; <em>Presha, supra, </em>163 <em>N.J. </em>at 312, 748 A.2d 1108, and has been codified in the New Jersey Rules of Evidence, <em>N.J.R.E. </em>503, pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2A:84A-19. <em>Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 399-400, 963 A.2d 316; <em>Cook, supra, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>at 549-50, 847 A.2d 530. Inherent in every Fifth Amendment analysis is the question of whether the statement was voluntary, and, independently, whether the law enforcement officers taking it complied with <em>Miranda. Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 400, 963 A.2d 316 (citing <em>Miranda, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 467, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1624, 16 L.Ed.2d at 719 (quotation and internal quotation marks omitted)). <em>See also Mincey v. Arizona, </em>437 <em>U.S. </em>385, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>2408, 57 L.Ed.2d 290 (1978); <em>State v. Knight, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>449, 461-63, 874 A.2d 546 (2005) (detailing factors to be considered under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances\u201d in determining voluntariness).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b647-5\">In his written opinion admitting defendant\u2019s statement, the trial judge determined:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-6\">When [defendant] was escorted at around 11:00 p.m. to the PCPO headquarters, he was not under arrest, not restrained and in no manner under duress. He enjoyed pleasant conversation with the officers in the vehicle and was placed in an office upon arrival at headquarters. The office ... is a standard six feet by six feet, windowless room containing a table and chairs. There were no trappings of restraint or police-work such as handcuffs, bars or other weapons. While [defendant] was waiting in the room, he was able to use the restroom, if he so chose, he was able to walk freely within the room and he even read an entire People Magazine. Granted, the Td]efendanl had to wait over three hours to be interviewed and he did not eat or drink at all during that time, that length of time does not pose a problem for the [c]ourt. The officers were conducting multiple interviews with the victim, the victim\u2019s mother and others to determine what role, if any, the [defendant had in the DYFS referral.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b647-7\">The [defendant was not questioned in any way until he was moved to an interrogation room with a video camera to record the proceedings. At that point, he was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights by ... Gade, which [defendant] subsequently waived, and the interrogation leading to his confession began. This [c]ourt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>reviewed the videotaped confession and found no improprieties by the officers. There was no coercion, force or threats, made toward the [d]efendant for him to confess.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b648-5\">This court is satisfied that the confession was the product of a knowing, voluntary and intelligent waiver of [defendant's <em>Miranda </em>rights. As well, the videotape confession shows the entire conversation the officers had with [defendant], and at no time was [he] under duress, threatened with force, forced to confess or coerced to do so. Therefore, this Court denies the [defendant's request to suppress the confession.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b648-6\">The Appellate Division likewise rejected defendant\u2019s claims that his confession was involuntary, and found sufficient evidence in the record to sustain the trial court\u2019s fact finding. The panel determined that the trial judge carefully considered the totality of the circumstances in upholding the admissibility of the recorded statement. <em>See Nyhammer, supra, </em>197 <em>N.J. </em>at 408-09, 963 A.2d 316 (no abuse of discretion where trial judge\u2019s determination was supported by sufficient credible evidence in record). <em>See also State v. Mann, </em>203 <em>N.J. </em>328, 336-37, 2 A.3d 379 (2010); <em>Elders, supra, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>at 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007);<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>State v. Locurto, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>463, 471, 724 A.2d 234 (1999) (discussing scope of review on motions to suppress physical evidence); <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>131 <em>N.J.Super. </em>168, 329 A.2d 75 (App.Div.1974), <em>aff'd o.b., </em>67 <em>N.J. </em>267, 337 A.2d 371 (1975) (findings of trial judge will not be disturbed if reasonably reached on sufficient credible evidence in record). The record justifies the Appellate Division holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">We now turn to the most disturbing procedural aspects of the case\u2014one caused by a discovery rule violation and the other by CSAAS expert testimony. As a result of these errors, we must also consider their impact on the fairness of the trial and our conclusion on the appeal. We turn first to the discovery question.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-6\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-7\">We need not take much time to state, once more, that law enforcement officers may not destroy contemporaneous notes of interviews and observations at the scene of a crime after producing their final reports. <em>See State v. Branch, </em>182 <em>N.J. </em>338, 367, n. 10, 865 A.2d 673 (2005); <em>State v. Cook, </em>179 <em>N.J. </em>533, 542 n. 3, 847 A.2d 530 (2004). <em>See also State v. P.S., </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>232, 263, 997 A.2d 163 (2010) (regarding loss of victim\u2019s taped statement); <em>State v. Delgado, </em>188 <em>N.J. </em>48, 902 A.2d 888 (2006) (regarding recordation of identification procedures). Here, Det. Gade conceded on cross-examination that, after she wrote her report, she destroyed notes taken at interviews she conducted with both D.L. and defendant. She explained that she was taught by her superiors not to retain the contemporaneous notes.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-8\">Before us, the State asserts that defendant has not shown the possibility of an inconsistency between the notes and the officer\u2019s report, nor requested a charge on that subject. The Attorney General, as <em>amicus curiae, </em>urges that \u201cthis Court should refuse to compel police officers to preserve their notes after the information contained in the notes has been transferred to a comprehensive report.\u201d The Attorney General contends that: (1) once the notes are embodied in an officer\u2019s report they are no longer needed; and (2) an officer at the scene of a crime or involved in a hot pursuit or other emergent circumstances may not have accurately recorded the events observed or statements he or she obtained. Yet the possibility of a misrecording is precisely why the notes must be maintained\u2014a defendant, protected by the Confrontation Clause and our rules of discovery, is entitled to test whether the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>contemporaneous recording is accurate or the final report is inaccurate because of some inconsistency with a contemporaneous recordation. It is for the jury to decide the credibility of the contemporaneous or other recordation made while an investigation is on-going prior to preparation of a formal report.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">Our criminal discovery rules do not currently require the recordation of all statements of witnesses obtained by law enforcement officers. But they do provide for discovery of all statements whether signed or unsigned, of witnesses as well as police reports which are \u201cin the possession, custody and control of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>See R. </em>3:13\u20143(c)(6), (7) and (8). Therefore, we hold today that the <em>Rule </em>encompasses the writings of any police officer under the prosecutor\u2019s supervision as the chief law enforcement officer of the county. <em>See generally, R. </em>3:13-3; <em>State v.

In 1993, this Court held that expert testimony in the area of CSAAS was permissible in order to \u201cexplain why many sexually abused children delay reporting their abuse, and why many children recant allegations of abuse and deny that anything occurred.\u201d <em>State v. J.Q., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>554, 579, 617 A.2d 1196 (1993). Such testimony is categorized as behavioral-science testimony because it describes behavior commonly observed in sexually-abused children. <em>Id. </em>at 566, 617 A.2d 1196. The behavioral studies of CSAAS are designed not to provide certain evidence of guilt or innocence, but rather to insure that all agencies, including the clinician, the offender, the family, and the criminal justice system offer \u201cthe child a right to parity with adults in the struggle for credibility and advocacy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 571, 617 A.2d 1196 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-7\">The rationale supporting the use of CSAAS testimony was first presented in a comprehensive manner by Dr. Roland Summit. Roland C. Summit, M.D., <em>The Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome, </em>7 <em>Child Abuse &amp; Neglect </em>177 (1983). Dr. Summit undertook a scientific study of child-sexual-abuse victims to remedy the systemic injury to the child that results from disbelief of abuse. <em>J.Q., supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 567, 617 A.2d 1196. The \u201cpurpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>of the study was to improve the health of the child, ensure that children receive adequate treatment for what they had suffered, and guarantee that society\u2019s response is not flawed by misperceptions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 617 A.2d 1196. The CSAAS \u201crepresents a common denominator of the most frequently observed victim behaviors.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It includes five categories of behavior, each of which contradicts the most common assumptions of adults: (1) secrecy; (2) helplessness; (3) entrapment and accommodation; (4) delayed disclosure; and (5) retraction. <em>Id. </em>at 568-70, 617 A.2d 1196. Accordingly, CSAAS provides a \u201ccommon language\u201d for analysis and a more \u201crecognizable map\u201d to the understanding of sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 571, 617 A.2d 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">When CSAAS evidence is presented to a jury, the court must ensure that it is used in accordance with its scientific underpinnings, \u201ci.e. the evidence [i]s not offered to explain the conflicting behavioral traits in this case either of accommodation or delayed disclosure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 617 A.2d 1196. Accordingly, the evidence cannot be presented to the jury to prove directly and substantially that sexual abuse occurred. <em>Ibid. </em>Dr. Summit did not intend the accommodation syndrome as a diagnostic device\u2014it does not detect sexual abuse. <em>Id. </em>at 579, 617 A.2d 1196. Instead, it assumes the presence of sexual abuse, and explains a child\u2019s often counter-intuitive reactions to it. <em>Id. </em>at 579, 617 A.2d 1196. CSAAS has a limited, therapeutic purpose, not a predictive one, so \u201cthe evidence must be tailored to the purpose for which it is being received.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 568, 617 A.2d 1196 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">In <em>State v. P.H., </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>378, 840 A.2d 808 (2004), the Court summarized the purpose of CSAAS expert testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">CSAAS expert testimony may serve a \u201cuseful forensic function\u201d when used in a rehabilitative manner to explain why many sexually abused children delay in reporting their abuse, or later recant allegations of abuse____That is, it helps to dispel preconceived, but not necessarily valid, conceptions jurors may have concerning the likelihood of the child\u2019s truthfulness as a result of her delay in having disclosed the abuse or sought help____ CSAAS expert testimony should be admissible to assist a jury in evaluating evidence about an alleged victim\u2019s post-assault conduct or behaviors when that conduct may be misperceived by jurors as inconsistent with the truthfulness of the claim of assault. Such testimony properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>can be used to explain why a victim\u2019s reactions, as demonstrated by the evidence, are not inconsistent with having been molested.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b653-6\">[178 <em>N.J. </em>at 395 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">Simply stated, CSAAS cannot be used as probative testimony of the existence of sexual abuse in a particular case. <em>State v. Michaels, </em>264 <em>N.J.Super. </em>579, 598-99, 625 A.2d 489 (App.Div.1993), aff<em>'d, </em>136 <em>N.J. </em>299, 642 A.2d 1372 (1994). Therefore, introduction of such testimony will be upheld so long as the expert does not attempt to \u201cconnect the dots\u201d between the particular child\u2019s behavior and the syndrome, or opine whether the particular child was abused. <em>State v. R.B., </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>308, 328, 873 A.2d 511 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b653-8\">In the present matter, Dr. Coco, a psychologist at the Audrey Hepburn Children\u2019s House, testified as an expert witness about CSAAS. Dr. Coco explained to the jury that CSAAS was developed by Dr. Summit to describe behaviors of child sexual abuse victims. He noted that Dr. Summit\u2019s purpose was to educate lay people who would otherwise not understand the typical behaviors of such child victims. Dr. Coco outlined these typical characteristics as: (1) secrecy; (2) helplessness; (3) entrapment and accommodation; (4) delayed or unconvincing disclosure; and (5) retraction or recantation. After discussing each characteristic, Dr. Coco noted that CSAAS is \u201cnot a diagnosis,\u201d and cannot be used as \u201ca tool to decide whether or not sexual abuse had happened.\u201d He clarified that \u201call [the CSAAS] is telling you is that these are very common responses that children have to child sexual abuse[.]\u201d Dr. Coco emphasized that he knew nothing about D.L. or this particular case, and that his testimony did not \u201crelate ... to this case in any way.\u201d He stressed that the purpose of his testimony was \u201cto inform solely about the\u2014the accommodation\u2014the child sexual abuse accommodation syndrome and that\u2019s all.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b653-9\">On cross-examination, Dr. Coco reiterated that he had not, at any point, interviewed the alleged victim pertaining to this case nor reviewed any of her alleged statements. He repeated that he had \u201cno opinion\u201d as to whether CSAAS applied to D.L. Dr. Coco reiterated that CSAAS is not a diagnostic tool and cannot be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>to determine \u201cwhether or not the alleged victim in this particular case is telling the truth.\u201d He did, however, \u201cconcede ... that there are people, even children, who do falsely report sexual abuse,\u201d but added that \u201cthe great majority of them do not.\u201d Focusing on this statement, Dr. Coco was examined about whether certain age brackets are more likely to falsely allege sexual abuse. He responded that it was \u201cprobably more [likely] in the younger age,\u201d but that he could not recall Dr. Summit\u2019s research precisely.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">On re-direct examination, Dr. Coco again noted that children infrequently lie about child sexual abuse. When asked to \u201cestimate for us in your clinical experience how many children have lied in your experience about it[,]\u201d defendant objected, claiming that Dr. Coco was not to discuss his clinical experience and challenging how he knew whether kids lied. The trial judge overruled that objection, noting that defendant had \u201copened the door\u201d by trying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b654-6\">to turn this guy around as your expert, which is fine, that\u2019s legitimate, but now you can\u2019t stop him from coming back and getting into the facts. You asked him so many questions and so many questions about the accommodation syndrome, you tried to use him as your expert, that\u2019s fine. I don\u2019t blame you for that, but he gets a right to come back and rebut that. I think the door\u2019s open, I\u2019m going to permit the question.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-7\">Dr. Coco again was asked, in his \u201cclinical experience,\u201d how often he has observed children lie about sexual abuse. He replied:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A2D\">You know, yeah, the research is pretty clear that the great majority of children do not lie about. Of course the research is going to differ in what the actual percentage is of that. So you know, you might be anywhere from five percent of children are found to lie to 10 percent, but it\u2019s hard to get a real number on that. But the great majority of children do not lie about the sexual abuse. And in many ways they actually under report what actually happens to them, in terms of the details of the actual abuse incident.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b654-8\">On re-cross, Dr. Coco reiterated that the great majority of children do not lie about sexual abuse. The following colloquy ensued:<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Q: What about 16 year olds? You said it\u2019s not across the board, that as you got down the age scale that it\u2019s more likely that the kids are telling the truth when they report being sexually abused. Do you [have] any statistical analysis either from Dr. Summit or your own\u2014your own clinical analysis as to what the percentage of times is for a 16 year old?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-6\">A: The research is not, you know going\u2014there\u2019s nothing that\u2019s going to be able to give you a clear number on that, but again, an adolescent has more ability to do things with information than a younger child does so that they would be more capable of fabricating <em>something </em>than a younger child would.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-7\">Q: So the statistics that you provided, five percent,, very low level, don\u2019t necessarily apply to a 16 year old who discloses something?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-8\">A: I can\u2019t say it does.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-9\">Q: Sometimes in fact there\u2019s false allegations in that type of hypothetical and you have no type of statistical breakdown that you could give us right now as to that hypothetical, right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-10\">A: You\u2019re asking <em>for </em>a specific number, I can\u2019t give <em>you that, but I can </em>stick to the fact that the great majority of children, throughout the age groups, do not lie about child sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-11\">Q: Do statistics bear that out then, you just talked about a dynamic in kids. Do the statistics bear that out? Do the statistics that you just talked about, do they bear out that a greater percentage of the kids in the low age of range of childhood tell the truth versus kids at the upper range of childhood? Do the statistics bear out the dynamic that you just talked about?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b655-12\">A: The statistics show that over the range ages, the great majority of children do not lie about sexual abuse. That there are many things that intervene with adolescents that can effect their, you know, their stories or their disclosures. But like t said before, the dynamics of hostility and what have you are not something that we relate to children lying about sexual abuse. Adolescents have more ability to fabricate stories, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they do it more frequently in regards to sexual abuse.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b655-13\">Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony included an assertion <em>that only </em>5-10% of children exhibiting CSAAS symptoms lie about sexual abuse. Such testimony creates an inference that D.L. told the truth in her original accusation, despite her motives to fabricate the allegations, and notwithstanding her trial testimony recanting them. Certainly, that is not the purpose of CSAAS testimony or the reason for its admission. Even Dr. Coco so acknowledged. Accordingly, we hold that expert testimony about the statistical credibility of victim-witnesses is inadmissible. Statistical information quantifying the number or percentage of abuse victims who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>lie deprives the jury of its right and duty to decide the question of credibility of the victim based on evidence relating to the particular victim and the particular facts of the case. Any CSAAS expert testimony beyond its permissible, limited scope cannot be tolerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-5\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-6\">The impact of Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony in this case, however, presents a different question. Convictions after a fair trial, based on strong evidence proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, should not be reversed because of a technical or evidentiary error that cannot have truly prejudiced the defendant or affected the end result. That is often the true issue in many appeals.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> This appeal is no different.</p>\n<p id=\"b656-7\">In order for Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony to not unduly prejudice defendant, it had to be clear to the jury that he did not interview or evaluate D.L. and that he was not commenting on her credibility or testimony. So viewed, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances neither deprived defendant of a fair trial nor compels reversal. First, Dr. Coco repeatedly clarified that the purpose of his testimony was to advise the jury about characteristics child abuse victims may exhibit. Second, it was clear that D.L. was almost an adult and, therefore, at the age of intellect and experience at which more alleged abuse victims may lie. Third, it was defense counsel, on cross-examination, who first addressed the issue of falsification by children at different age levels. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>Fourth, the State did not refer in summation to the portion of Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony concerning the percentage of young women who lie. And finally, the trial judge instructed the jury not to consider Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony \u201cas offering proof that child sexual abuse occurred in this case,\u201d or \u201cwhether abuse occurred or did not occur,\u201d or to \u201cconsider that testimony as proving in and of itself that [DL], the alleged victim here, was or was not truthful.\u201d More to the point, after a detailed and exhaustive jury charge concerning the proper use of CSAAS testimony, the judge concluded that charge by underscoring that the jury \u201cmay not consider the expert testimony as in any way proving that [W.B.l committed an act or did commit any particular act of\u2014of abuse. Testimony as to the accommodation syndrome is offered only to explain certain behavior of an alleged victim of child sexual abuse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b657-6\">Thus, the totality of the circumstances did not deprive defendant of a fair trial, and reversal is not warranted. This result also flows from the other evidence in the case. At trial, D.L. recanted her statement to Det. Gade and explained it was a \u201cdisaster\u201d for her family when defendant was arrested. Defendant did not contest the ruling permitting the admission of D.L.\u2019s statement on his appeal before the Appellate Division, nor did he raise it as an issue in the petition for certification. Accordingly, that determination is not before us for review. In this regard, we simply note, however, that the judge conducted a Gross<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> hearing at which Det. Gade testified and the record clearly supports the trial judge\u2019s determinations concerning admission of D.L.\u2019s statement and the fresh complaint testimony. <em>See also State v. Burns, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>312, 337, 929 A.2d 1041 (2007). Moreover, the aggregate of D.L.\u2019s prior statement, admitted as a prior inconsistent statement under <em>N.J.R.E. </em>803(a)(1), after the <em>Gross </em>hearing, J.C.\u2019s testimony about the allegations in the victim\u2019s call to him, and defendant\u2019s own statement provided the jury more than sufficient evidence on which to sustain the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-5\">Defendant next asserts that the trial judge improperly admitted, as \u201cfresh complaint\u201d testimony, evidence that, on January 1, 2005\u2014more than one and one-half years after defendant\u2019s last assault\u2014D.L. told her former boyfriend J.C. that defendant had sexually assaulted her. \u201c[T]o qualify as fresh complaint, the victim\u2019s statements to someone [he or] she would ordinarily turn to for support must have been made within a reasonable time after the alleged assault and must have been spontaneous and voluntary.\u201d <em>State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 163, 578 A.2d 370 (1990) (internal citation omitted).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Whether these criteria for admissibility are satisfied is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge. <em>State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 147-48, 578 A.2d 364 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-6\">As <em>P.H., supra, </em>makes clear, the fresh complaint rule was developed to counteract the persistent \u201ctiming myth\u201d that victims of sexual assault would cry out and alert others to the crime. 178 <em>N.J. </em>at 392, 840 A.2d 808 (explaining that \u201chue and cry\u201d myth dates back to thirteenth-century notions of feminine behavior). The rule allows the State to neutralize this myth by introducing evidence that the victim did indeed make a complaint within a reasonable time after the alleged assault. <em>See ibid, </em>(citing <em>Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 163, 578 A.2d 370).</p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">Fresh complaint evidence has a narrow purpose: it is admissible \u201cto prove only that the alleged victim complained [at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>particular time], not to corroborate the victim\u2019s allegations concerning the crime.\u201d <em>State v. R.E.B., 385 N.J.Super. </em>72, 89, 896 A.2d 1224 (App.Div.2006) (quoting <em>Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 146, 578 A.2d 364). A witness may testify only to the general nature of the complaint, and unnecessary details of what happened should not be repeated. <em>Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 163, 578 A.2d 370; see <em>also State v. J.S., </em>222 <em>N.J.Super. </em>247, 257, 536 A.2d 769 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>111 <em>N.J. </em>588, 546 A.2d 513 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">The record is clear that D.L. made a spontaneous complaint to J.C., a person in whom she would be expected to confide. The spontaneity prong merely requires that the complaint not be the result of coercive interrogation. <em>See Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 145, 578 A.2d 364 (children\u2019s statements made directly in response to \u201ccoercive questioning\u201d not admissible); <em>Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 167, 578 A.2d 370 (statement not excluded where elicited by \u201cgeneral noncoercive questioning\u201d); <em>State v. D.R.H., </em>127 <em>N.J. </em>249, 264-265, 604 A.2d 89 (1992)(statements made as a result of \u201cpointed, inquisitive, coercive interrogation\u201d not admissible). D.L.\u2019s complaint to J.C. far exceeds the spontaneity requirement. D.L. told J.C. by telephone about the past attacks by defendant almost immediately after she was sexually assaulted by her step-cousin following a New Year\u2019s Eve party. Thus, D.L.\u2019s disclosure, an excited reaction incident to a similar traumatic event, was understandable and \u201cinvest[ed] ... with spontaneity and plausibility.\u201d <em>Commonwealth v. Smith, </em>59 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>181, 794 N.E.2d 1241, 1244 (2003) (internal citation omitted). In this context the statement to J.C. about defendant\u2019s conduct as part of the contemporaneous and excited report concerning her cousin takes on an enhanced indicia of reliability.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">The admissibility of the fresh complaint evidence also turns on whether D.L.\u2019s complaint was made in a \u201creasonable time\u201d after the last assault. The Appellate Division concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that D.L. reported the assaults to J.C. \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d and in permitting J.C.\u2019s testimony concerning the content D.L. reported to him. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">It is well settled that the requirement of reporting a sexual assault within a reasonable time must be \u201capplied more flexibly in cases involving children than in [cases] involving adults.\u201d <em>State v. L.P., </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>369, 382, 800 A.2d 207 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>546, 810 A.2d 65 (2002). In deference to children\u2019s \u201cspecial vulnerability to being cajoled and coerced into remaining silent by their abusers, courts allow children additional time to make a fresh complaint.\u201d <em>Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 143, 578 A.2d 364. Stated differently, the reasonable time component of the fresh complaint rule must be applied flexibly \u201cin light of the reluctance of children to report a sexual assault and their limited understanding of what was done to them.\u201d <em>P.H., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 393, 840 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The more lenient approach to defining what constitutes a \u201creasonable time\u201d for child complainants is also consistent with the theory of CSAAS, which lists delayed reporting and secrecy among the behaviors common to sexually abused children. Thus, allowing a victim\u2019s initial complaints, \u201ceven if made a significant time after the abuse, is especially appropriate in a case where the State relies upon CSAAS evidence\u201d to explain those behaviors commonly exhibited by sexually abused children. <em>L.P., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 383-84, 800 A.2d 207 (explaining that child sexual assault victims commonly exhibit specific behavioral traits including secrecy, helplessness, accommodation, and delayed disclosure).</p>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">D.L. was fourteen years old when the attacks by defendant occurred, and sixteen when she confided in J.C. She told J.C. she had previously told no one else because she was \u201cscared.\u201d D.L.\u2019s status as a teenager at the time of disclosure, her \u201copen rebellion\u201d against her mother and defendant because they disliked J.C., and the lapse of time between the attacks and disclosure are relevant factors in determining the \u201creasonableness\u201d of the interval before <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>disclosure. However, D.L., as defendant\u2019s stepdaughter, appears to have lived with defendant at least some of the time during that interval and also indicated to J.C. that she was afraid to report the abuse. Both are factors that impact the determination of \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Cf. L.P., supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 383-85, 800 A.2d 207 (allowing fresh complaint evidence where nearly a year had passed since last alleged assault after describing \u201caura of intimidation,\u201d which included living with defendant in foster care setting and continued contact with defendant\u2019s natural daughter); <em>Smith, supra, </em>794 N.E.2d at 1244 (fifty-one month delay not reasonable because victim had moved out of house); <em>Commonwealth v. Hyatt, </em>31 <em>Mass.App.Ct. </em>488, 579 N.E.2d 1365, 1367-68 (1991) (two-year delay reasonable where first disclosure was to boyfriend when he tried to kiss victim and she had been fearful of disrupting home where she and defendant continued to live). Accordingly, we conclude that the interval between the assault and the complaint was reasonable for purposes of admitting the fresh complaint testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">Defendant further claims that his convictions must, in any event, be reversed because the jury charge amounted to an instruction to convict and usurped the jury\u2019s responsibility to assess credibility. In gauging this claim, we are mindful that the trial judge used the model charge as amended by this Court in <em>P.H., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at <em>399-400, 840 A.2d 808.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b661-7\"><em>P.H. </em>considered, in detail, the admissibility of both fresh complaint and CSAAS testimony, as well as the relevant jury charges. Both doctrines deal with problems stemming from an abuse victim\u2019s failure to report an event, delayed reporting, and popular misconceptions for so doing. <em>Id. </em>at 389-401, 840 A.2d 808. In <em>P.H., </em>the victim was the defendant\u2019s daughter <em>and </em>the sexual abuse occurred during seven visits with her father from 1984 through 1990. <em>Id. </em>at 383-84, 840 A.2d 808. Although she disclosed certain instances of inappropriate sexual behavior, she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>not report the sexual assaults until 1996. <em>Id. </em>at 384-85, 840 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The trial court instructed the jury on both the Model Jury Charge on Fresh Complaint (concerning a victim\u2019s failure to report or delayed reporting) and CSAAS (concerning use of the expert testimony on that subject) after presentation of CSAAS expert testimony by both the State and defense. <em>Id. </em>at 387-88, 396-399, 840 A.2d 808. <em>Id. </em>at 388, 840 A.2d 808. On appeal, the Appellate Division reversed and remanded for a new trial, determining \u201cthat defendant\u2019s due process and confrontation rights were violated by instructions that precluded the jury from considering the belated nature of [the victimj\u2019s disclosure in the context of assessing her overall credibility.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">After granting certification, we concluded that instructing on both fresh complaint and CSAAS \u201cclearly had the capacity to confuse the jury\u201d as to its role in assessing the victim\u2019s credibility. <em>Id. </em>at 399, 840 A.2d 808. We explained that, to the extent our jurisprudence on \u201cfresh complaint\u201d instructions and, particularly, <em>Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 144-49, 578 A.2d 364,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-7\">may be read to render victim silence or delay in reporting irrelevant to a jury\u2019s overall assessment of credibility, the case before us provides a vehicle for clarification. In performing its exceedingly important task of assessing credibility, the jury should be permitted to consider all relevant testimony. Viewed in the context of all the facts surrounding the claimed abuse, the timing of the report of abuse, or silence about it, can be relevant for the jury to consider in the totality of the circumstances. So long as the jury is instructed that such silence or delay, in and of itself, is not inconsistent with a claim of abuse, the proper balance is struck.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acs\"><em>[P.H., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 397, 840 A.2d 808.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">We emphasized, however, that CSAAS testimony may explain \u201cwhy a child victim may remain silent\u201d and \u201cnot have made a fresh complaint.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>It may also explain the behaviors and conduct of a child victim, \u201csuch as the child\u2019s affection towards the abuser\u201d [and] \u201crecantation of the complaint____\u201d \u201cthat can east doubt or otherwise affect the evaluation of the child\u2019s testimony,\u201d and is admissible for that purpose. <em>Id. </em>at 397-98, 840 A.2d 808. <em>See also J.Q., supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 579-81, 617 A.2d 1196. As a result, we instructed the trial court, on remand, to use the <em>Model Jury </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>Charge (Criminal) </em>for Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (2001), if the trial judge found proof of delayed disclosure and CSAAS testimony was admitted in response, rather than using both the Fresh Complaint and CSAAS Model Jury Charges. <em>P.H., supra, </em>178 <em>N.J. </em>at 399, 840 A.2d 808.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">To maintain the necessary and proper balance, we also directed inclusion of the following language at the beginning of the charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-7\">The law recognizes the stereotypes about sexual assault complainants may lead some of you to question [complaining witness\u2019s! credibility based solely on the fact that [he or she] did not complain of the alleged abuse sooner. You may not <em>automatically </em>conclude that [complaining witness\u2019s] testimony is untruthful based only on [his or her] silence/delayed disclosure. Rather, you may consider the silence/delayed disclosure along with all of the other evidence including [complaining witness\u2019s] explanation for his/her silence/delayed disclosure when you decide how much weight to afford to [complaining witness\u2019s] testimony. You also may consider the expert testimony that explained that silence, is in fact, one of the many ways in which a child may respond to sexual abuse. Accordingly, your deliberations in this regard should be informed by the testimony you heard concerning child abuse accommodation syndrome.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 400, 840 A.2d 808 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-9\">We explained our reason for so directing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-10\">By including that statement, or one of similar wording, as a preface to the model CSAAS charge, the instruction will address the concerns expressed in <em>Bethune </em>as well as our findings in <em>J.Q. </em>In situations in which a defendant presents relevant evidence of a child victim\u2019s delay in reporting alleged abuse, and the State does not present evidence of CSAAS, the appropriate instruction if requested by the State, would be one similar to the statement outlined above absent the last two sentences. We refer this matter to the Model Charge Committee for their consideration and suggestions for refinement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b663-11\">\n<em>[Ibid.]</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-12\">With that amendment, the suggestion that jurors could not consider for any purpose the \u201cchild victim\u2019s delay in reporting alleged abuse\u201d was eliminated. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b663-13\">We adhere to <em>P.H. </em>and find no basis on which to reverse the conviction because the model CSAAS charge, as amended, was given and the \u201cfresh complaint\u201d charge was not. We caution, however, that our suggested preface \u201cor one of similar wording\u201d to the CSAAS charge and referral to the Model Charge Committee did not cast the suggested charge in stone. To the extent a defendant may believe the word \u201cautomatically\u201d unduly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>limits the jury\u2019s right and obligation to evaluate credibility or, as defendant puts it, \u201cconstitute^] a directive to the jury that it must accept the expert\u2019s CSAAS testimony and filter its view of the case through that testimony,\u201d the word \u201cautomatically\u201d is to be substituted by the words \u201cmay or may not conclude that ...,\u201d or words of like effect. We direct the Model Jury Charges (Criminal) Committee to study the issue on an expedited basis and report back to us with any further recommendations. Moreover, as with all charges, we reiterate that a trial judge should conduct a charge conference on the record and consider the parties\u2019 position on any issue they or the judge raises before deciding how to charge the jury on a given issue. <em>See R. </em>1:8-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b664-6\">Defendant next argues that his videotaped confession was played back to the jury during its deliberations, and because the tape itself was not admitted into evidence, the trial judge did not follow the procedures for such playback as detailed in <em>State v. Burr, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>119, 948 A.2d 627 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b664-7\">In <em>Burr, </em>the victim\u2019s pretrial, videotaped statement was admitted into evidence, and played back, \u201cover defendant\u2019s objection,\u201d in open court at the jury\u2019s request. <em>Id. </em>at 131-32, 948 A.2d 627. <em>Burr </em>approved the playback, but codified a four-step procedure for the proper use of such playbacks. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 948 A.2d 627. First, the jury should be asked if a readback of the statement would suffice. <em>Id. </em>at 135, 948 A.2d 627. \u201cIf the jury persists in its request to view the videotape again, then the court must take into consideration fairness to the defendant.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Second, \u201c[t]he court must determine whether the jury must also hear a readback of any direct and cross-examination testimony that the court concludes is necessary to provide the proper context for the video playback.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Third, the trial judge must permit the defendant to demonstrate that \u201cconsequential prejudice ... from the playback could not be ameliorated through other means.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Fourth, the playback \u201cmust occur in open court.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>State v.

Here, the playback of the videotape was in open court, and the tape\u2014whether admitted into evidence<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>\u2014was played to the jury as part of the State\u2019s case. Moreover, the trial itself was videotaped, and there was no court reporter or transcriber available to read back what was played to the jury. And, defendant\u2019s reliance on that statement\u2014as evidenced by his statement in summation that the videotape was \u201cin evidence\u201d and his encouragement of the jury to request a \u201cread-back\u201d and listen carefully'\u2014looms large in the resolution of this question.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Against that factual backdrop, there is no basis to reverse defendant\u2019s convictions, even if the videotape was not admitted into evidence, merely because the jury saw the playback of a videotaped statement that already had been played to it as part of the State\u2019s case.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b666-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">The judgment of the Appellate Division is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b641-8\"> <em>Miranda v.

First, the majority finds harmless the testimony of a State\u2019s expert who gave his assessment of the collective credibility of child-abuse victims, calculating that ninety to ninety-five percent tell the truth. The expert had never met D.L., the putative victim, who recanted her statements implicating defendant. Yet, with his statistically based testimony\u2014without the need to be burdened by the evidence in <em>this </em>case\u2014the jury was left to ponder whether, if there was a ninety to ninety-five percent probability that the putative victim was telling the truth, then there must be a ninety to ninety-five percent probability of defendant\u2019s guilt. The majority validates as harmless an expert\u2019s opinion that denied defendant an individualized assessment of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-8\">Second, the majority has grossly distorted the doctrine of fresh complaint to justify the admission of a hearsay statement incriminating defendant. In this new jurisprudential world, a victim\u2019s statement made to her boyfriend more than fifteen months after alleged sexual encounters with defendant is deemed a \u201cfresh\u201d complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-9\">Last, despite the violation of our court rules, the majority sees no problem in the court\u2019s giving to the jury during its deliberations a videotaped statement of defendant that was <em>not </em>placed in evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b666-10\">Because I believe that these errors individually and cumulatively denied defendant a fair trial, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>I.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">\n<em>Guilt by Statistics</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">The trial in this ease was about the individual credibility of both D.L., who on the stand recanted out-of-court statements implicating defendant, and defendant, who protested his innocence and claimed that the police coerced a confession from him through psychological pressures. The jury had to determine whether D.L. was telling the truth, under oath, when she testified or when she spoke to the police. Under our system of justice, we do not permit the jury to assess the credibility of a model victim, a statistical stereotype, and on that basis to infer guilt, no more than we would permit a jury to infer that the defendant on trial must be guilty because most defendants are guilty. Allowing group assessments of credibility to replace individualized assessments of credibility is antithetical to our system of justice. The deleterious impact of the type of testimony presented in this case, which was sanctioned by the trial court, cannot be ignored or wished away.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">The State presented Dr. Coco as an expert in Child Sexual Abuse Accommodation Syndrome (CSAAS). The purpose of Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony was to explain, generally, the reasons a child would delay reporting sexual abuse or, once reporting the abuse, recant the accusation. <em>See State v. J.Q., </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>554, 579, 617 A.2d 1196 (1993) (citation omitted). CSAAS testimony is not offered as proof of a defendant\u2019s guilt. As Dr. Coco conceded: \u201c[I]t cannot be offered as a tool to decide whether sexual abuse had happened.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 578, 617 A.2d 1196 (\u201cCSAAS is not relied on in the scientific community to detect abuse.\u201d). Yet, Dr. Coco\u2019s testimony departed from the strict limitations our law places on CSAAS testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">During cross-examination, the defense attorney elicited from Dr. Coco that some children falsely report sexual abuse. Then, under the pretext of counsel\u2019s having opened the door, the court permitted the prosecutor on redirect examination to introduce statistical evidence that approximately ninety to ninety-five per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>cent of child-sexual-abuse complainants are truthful. Even if the defense attorney cracked the door open slightly into this impermissible area, the trial judge, whose obligation is to ensure the fairness of the proceedings, should not have kicked the door wide open.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">The jury was permitted to convict defendant based on a simple syllogism totally unrelated to the evidence: if ninety to ninety-five percent of sexual-abuse complainants tell the truth, then D.L. by the laws of statistical probability must have been telling the truth when she reported the sexual abuse to the police; and if D.L. was therefore truthful, then defendant must be lying and guilty of the crimes charged. The defense loudly objected; however, no correction was made by the trial court. The jury was never told that it could not draw the obvious damning inferences that flowed from Dr. Coco\u2019s use of statistics to bolster D.L.\u2019s initial complaint. The majority concedes that this testimony was improper and did not fall within the realm of CSAAS evidence, but claims that the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">Police officers and social-science experts are <em>not </em>allowed to vouch for the credibility of witnesses. <em>See State v. Frisby, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>583, 591-92, 595, 811 A.2d 414 (2002) (finding plain error in police officer\u2019s testimony that potential suspect in child-abuse case was \u201cmore credible\u201d than defendant).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In <em>J.Q., </em>we specifically disapproved of a CSAAS expert touting the credibility of an alleged sex-victim whom the expert had interviewed. <em>J.Q., supra, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>at 556, 575, 617 A.2d 1196. Opining on the alleged victims\u2019 credibility was an error that went to the heart of the very integrity of the proceedings, and therefore was not deemed harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 556, 617 A.2d 1196. How much worse in this ease where the expert\u2014based on mere statistics\u2014placed his authoritative imprimatur on the credibility of D.L.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>The majority does not deny that the expert misused statistics to support the credibility of D.L. in this case. We disagree about the gravity of that error. For me, the presentation of a statistical, truth-telling, stereotypical victim\u2014that presumably encompassed the alleged victim in this case\u2014cannot be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Appellate courts are not required to put blinders on when assessing whether patently inadmissible evidence has the clear capacity to taint the jury. Here, the State\u2019s case hinged on the credibility of witness testimony, not physical, objective evidence. The alleged victim testified under oath that her previous statements implicating defendant were false, and defendant on the stand testified that he was innocent and that the police elicited from him a false confession. Given this less than overwhelming evidence of guilt, it is impossible to say that Dr. Coco\u2019s impermissible testimony did not tip the scales of justice unfairly against defendant. <em>See Frisby, supra, </em>174 <em>N.J. </em>at 596, 811 A.2d 414 (holding that \u201c[a]ny improper influence on the jury that could have tipped the credibility scale\u201d could not be harmless); <em>R. </em>2:10-2 (stating that new trial should not be granted unless error was \u201cclearly capable of producing an unjust result\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Because the error in this case could not be harmless, defendant should be entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-8\">A <em>Fifteerir-Month-Delayed Report Posing as Fresh Complaint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b669-9\">That the majority sanctions as a \u201cfresh\u201d complaint a report of sexual abuse that occurred fifteen months earlier indicates that the fresh-complaint doctrine has now become completely untethered from its historical underpinnings. The fresh-complaint doctrine is derived from the common-law requirement that a sexual-assault victim utter a \u201chue and cry\u201d \u201cto dispel any suspicion\u201d of her consensual involvement in the act. <em>See State v. Hill, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>150, 157, 578 A.2d 370 (1990). Under that requirement, it was assumed that \u201ca \u2018normal\u2019 woman would \u2018naturally\u2019 complain after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>having been raped.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 162, 578 A.2d 370. Outmoded views about how \u201cnormal\u201d women would react to a sexual assault reflected in the \u201chue and cry\u201d requirement gave way to the more nuanced, modern version of the fresh-complaint rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-5\">Under the present fresh-complaint doctrine, a victim\u2019s out-of-court report is admissible to support her in-court testimony for the purpose of negating the inference that her silence would be an indication she was <em>not </em>sexually assaulted. <em>Id. </em>at 163, 578 A.2d 370 (citation omitted). To qualify as a fresh complaint, the victim\u2019s statement must have been made to someone she ordinarily would have called for support, <em>\u201cmust have been made within a reasonable time after the alleged assault </em>and must have been spontaneous and voluntary.\u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(citations omitted) (emphasis added). The fresh-complaint rule serves the narrow purpose of rebutting the negative inference the jury would draw from silence. <em>Ibid. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cOnly the fact of the complaint\u201d is admissible, not the particulars of the accusation. <em>Ibid, </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-6\">Reporting a sexual offense within a \u201creasonable time\u201d is a precondition to the admission of fresh-complaint evidence. The fifteen-month delay now permitted by the majority completely eviscerates the \u201creasonable time\u201d requirement and will make every complaint\u2014regardless of when it is reported\u2014fresh. While \u201ccourts allow children additional time to make a fresh complaint\u201d when they claim sexual abuse, <em>State v. Bethune, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>137, 143, 578 A.2d 364 (1990), there must be some logical end to that period. Here, the \u201cchild\u201d was a young adult, age sixteen, when she made her initial complaint. Today\u2019s opinion is the first time that the Court has expanded the fresh-complaint doctrine to permit allegations made so long after an alleged assault. <em>Cf. State v. Smith, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>376, 378-79, 730 A.2d 311 (1999) (complaint one day after assault admissible); <em>State v. Mann, </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>410, 415, 426, 625 A.2d 1102 (1993) (complaint within one day after assault admissible); <em>Hill, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 152, 154, 169, 578 A.2d 370 (complaint to friend within six weeks after assault admissible); <em>Bethune, supra, </em>121 <em>N.J. </em>at 140-41, 145-46, 578 A.2d 364 (permitting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>two-week-delayed complaint, but questioning whether statement was voluntary); <em>State v. Tirone, </em>64 <em>N.J. </em>222, 225-26, 314 A.2d 601 (1974) (complaint within one day after assault admissible); <em>State v. Balles, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>331, 334-35, 339, 221 A.2d 1 (1966) (complaint within one day after assault admissible).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">That some lower courts have allowed much longer periods to report a sexual assault, while still characterizing the complaint as \u201cfresh,\u201d is no reason for this Court to allow the doctrine to become so distorted and muddled that any result affirming a conviction can be rationalized. <em>See ante </em>at 617-19. Moreover, the \u201cfresh\u201d complaint in this case was not admitted to support the in-court testimony of the alleged victim but to impeach that testimony. We have never held that fresh-complaint testimony can be used for any purpose other than to show that the prior complaint is consistent with the witness\u2019s testimony on the stand. <em>Cf. Smith, supra, </em>158 <em>N.J. </em>at 378, 730 A.2d 311 (stating that fresh complaint was consistent with alleged victim\u2019s trial testimony); <em>Bailes, supra, </em>47 <em>N.J. </em>at 335, 221 A.2d 1 (same). An additional irony is that the State introduced the fifteen-month-late report as \u201cfresh\u201d at the very same time that it introduced CSAAS testimony through an expert to explain why the report was so delayed. One must wonder how a complaint can be admissible based on its \u201cfreshness\u201d and yet require the extensive testimony of a CSAAS expert to explain why the complaint was not freshly made.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-6\">The importance of evidence to the State does not validate its admission. Process is an end in itself. It assures fairness in all proceedings and legitimizes a trial\u2019s outcome. The majority\u2019s new and improved fresh-complaint doctrine takes the \u201cfresh\u201d out of the doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-8\">\n<em>Playing Back Videotaped \u201cConfession\u201d Not Introduced in Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b671-10\">Last, I cannot conclude, as the majority does, that the trial court properly exercised its discretion by playing back for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>jury, during its deliberations, defendant\u2019s videotaped \u201cconfession\u201d that had never been moved into evidence. Indeed, in the circumstances here, the court was not invested with discretion. The plain language of our court rules permits a deliberating jury only to \u201ctake into the jury room the exhibits <em>received in evidence.\u201d R. </em>l:8-8(a) (emphasis added). Here, the court allowed the jury to review an exhibit that had not been introduced into evidence. That the video itself had been played previously in open court is irrelevant. If a knife is marked only as an exhibit and observed by the jury during the trial, a request by the jury, during its deliberations, to view the knife would have to be denied because it was not moved into evidence. This is not a flexible rule. It is not applied pragmatically. Every trial attorney and trial judge knows that the jury can only receive items that have been moved into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\"><em>State v. Burr, </em>195 <em>N.J. </em>119, 948 A.2d 627 (2008), lends no support to the majority\u2019s position. In <em>Burr, </em>the videotape played back to the jury \u201cwas admitted into evidence as an exhibit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 133, 948 A.2d 627. In contrast, here the videotape was not admitted into evidence, although the jury did view the tape during trial. This was a videotaped trial. The jury was entitled to a replay of that portion of the trial during which defendant\u2019s taped confession was played or to a reading of a transcript of that part of the trial\u2014nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-6\">When a clear and sensible rule is breached with the blessing of this Court, it will be difficult to predict where and how the next incremental breach will occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-8\">Our ultimate charge is 'to ensure the integrity of the trial process. When that process has been compromised, as it was here, the public can have no confidence in a jury\u2019s verdict. The errors in this trial were profound and undermined the fairness of the proceedings. They were not harmless.
