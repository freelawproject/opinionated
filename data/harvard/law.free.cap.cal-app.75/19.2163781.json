Rohde, 257 U. S. 469 [25 A. L. R. 1008, 66 L. Ed. 321, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157, see, also, Rose\u2019s U. S. Notes Supp.], wherein the facts were that a carpenter, who was employed upon a launched but incompleted vessel, sustained an injury. It was held that the state law, known as the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, applied. The court, however, pointed out that the contract for constructing the vessel \u201cwas nonmaritime, and although the incompleted structure upon which the accident occurred was lying in navigable waters, neither Rohde\u2019s general employment, nor his activities at the time, had any direct relation to navigation or commerce.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">In the case of <em>State Industrial Com. </em>v. <em>Nordenholt Corporation, </em>259 U. S. 933 [25 A. L. R. 1013, 66 L. Ed. 933, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 473], a longshoreman was injured on a dock while he was assisting in the unloading of a cargo from a vessel. It was held that the dock was an extension of the land and that the state statute could be made effective without material prejudice to the general maritime law.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-8\">While, in addition to the foregoing cases, a long list of authorities has been submitted in support of the several contentions of the parties to the controversy, for the reason that in similar proceedings recently had before the supreme court of this state, like questions on analogous facts, with identical authorities, were fully considered, it becomes necessary to determine herein only the applicability in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>principle of the cases heretofore decided by the supreme court of California to the facts of the instant case, and therefrom to deduce a conclusion as to the questions submitted in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">The first case is that of <em>Alaska Packers\u2019 Assn. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>191 Cal. 763 [218 Pac. 561]. Therein it was shown that for a number of years preceding the happening of the accident the petitioner had been a seaman and fisherman on annual voyages made from the city of San Francisco to Alaska waters by a bark known as \u201cStar of England.\u201d On one of its return trips to the bay of San Francisco and while the vessel was lying afloat in navigable waters of said bay, the petitioner therein was engaged in working upon the said boat as a rigger to make it ready again for sea travel. His duties at that time consisted in going over the ropes attached to the yards of the vessel, looking for defective equipment. When a defective rope was found he took it ashore for the purpose of repairing same. He was injured while removing\u2019 a rotten foot-rope from the yardarm of the vessel. It thus appears that the employment of the rigger was similar to that of the petitioner in the instant case, in that a part thereof was to be done on board a boat afloat in navigable waters and the remainder of his work was to be performed by him on shore. The court held that the employment being maritime in its nature, the rights and liabilities connected therewith were within admiralty jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-5\">The next case to which attention is directed is that entitled <em>Zurich General Acc. etc. Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>191 Cal. 770 [218 Pac. 563]. The facts in that case were that one Denny was employed as a dredger deck-hand and launch operator. His work was performed mainly upon a dredger operating on navigable waters. He was drowned while engaged upon an errand in connection with his employment in attempting to proceed from the dredger to the shore in a motor-launch which was afloat in navigable waters. The principal authorities relied upon by the employee for the purpose of establishing the jurisdiction of the Industrial Accident Commission were reviewed by the supreme court and the conclusion reached that such Commission was without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>In the case of <em>James Rolph Co. </em>v. <em>Industrial Acc. Com., </em>192 Cal. 398 [220 Pac. 669], it appears that one Hayes was employed and was engaged in the capacity of stevedore upon a vessel which was discharging its cargo at a dock. On the morning of the accident before going to the hold of the vessel where he was required to work, Hayes secured an iron plate used in the unloading process of the vessel and in attempting to throw the plate below, overbalanced and fell into the hold of the vessel, sustaining injuries from which he died. It was held that the Industrial Accident Commission was without jurisdiction therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">In <em>Grant Smith-Porter Co. </em>v. <em>Rohde, </em>257 U. S. 469 [25 A. L. R. 1008, 66 L. Ed. 321, 42 Sup. Ct. Rep. 157], the general rule is announced that \u201cin contract matters, admiralty jurisdiction depends upon the nature of the transaction, and in tort matters upon the locality.\u201d  In our present ease petitioner\u2019s employment apparently was of a mixed variety. Part of his duties occupied his time in a lumber-mill located on the land, and a considerable portion of his work consisted in operating, or assisting in the operation, of a launch and in breaking up log rafts. Petitioner\u2019s injuries occurred while engaged in the latter employment; that is to say, his first injury occurred while he was operating the launch and in towing a derrick scow on navigable waters; and he sustained his second and his third injury while performing services as a member of the crew of the derrick scow, but while actually standing on a log raft\u2014 all in navigable waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">If the question of \u201ccontract\u201d as between the petitioner and the lumber company may be said to enter into the correct determination of the controversy, it is clear that the contract included a matter of a maritime nature, and hence that admiralty jurisdiction would prevail. On the other hand, if for the sole purpose of determining jurisdiction, the relationship of the employer and the employee be left out of consideration, the injuries sustained by the petitioner might then assume an aspect comparable with a tort committed in navigable waters, and from such a standpoint the jurisdiction would be in admiralty.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>It follows that the order of the Industrial Accident Commission should be affirmed. It is so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Conrey, P. J., and Curtis, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the district court of appeal on November 30, 1925.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
