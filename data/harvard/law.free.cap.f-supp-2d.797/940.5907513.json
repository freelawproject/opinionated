MARTONE, District Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">We have before , us defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on the issue of general causation (doc. 1374), plaintiffs\u2019 response (doc. 1412), and defendants\u2019 reply (doc. 1426).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">I. MDL Background</p>\n<p id=\"b981-8\">Plaintiffs allege that their use of Zicam Cold Remedy Intranasal Gel Spray or Swabs caused them to lose their sense of smell. For a description of the Zicam intranasal products, see our <em>Order on Defendants\u2019 Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs\u2019 Causation Experts (\u201cDaubert Order\u201d) </em>at 2-3 (doc. 1360).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Defendants moved to exclude the opinions of four of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, <em>see Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs\u2019 General Causation Experts </em>(doc. 1061); <em>Motion to Exclude Plaintiffs\u2019 Expert Jay Sirois </em>(doc. 1063), which we granted in part and denied in part. We admitted Dr. Greg Davis\u2019s opinions about (1) the diffuse location of olfactory tissue in the nose, and (2) the toxicity of Zicam. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 19. We admitted Dr. Ashim Mitra\u2019s opinions about (1) the distribution and deposition of Zicam within the nasal cavity, (2) the principle of diffusion, and (3) the effect of the preservative benzalkonium chloride on the absorption of Zicam. <em>Id. </em>at 23. We admitted Dr. Steven Pike\u2019s opinions about the toxicity of Zicam to olfactory epithelium (\u201cOE\u201d) and its potential to cause anosmia, but excluded his reliance on certain studies. <em>Id. </em>at 28.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b981-13\">II. Legal standards</p>\n<p id=\"b981-14\">We grant summary judgment if defendants show \u201cthere is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). We draw all justifiable inferences in favor of the non-moving party. <em>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., </em>477 U.S. 242, 255, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 2513, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-15\">Plaintiffs assert causes of action under the products liability laws of their respective states. In a products liability action brought in federal court pursuant to diversity jurisdiction, we apply state substantive law. <em>Stilwell v. Smith &amp; Nephew, Inc., </em>482 F.3d 1187, 1193 (9th Cir.2007). As an MDL transferee court, we apply the substantive law of each transferor forum. <em>Ferens v. John Deere Co., </em>494 U.S. 516, 525, 110 S.Ct. 1274, 1280, 108 L.Ed.2d 443 (1990) (choice-of-law rules do not change following a transfer). It is uncontested that each transferor forum applies the substantive law of the place where plaintiff resides, purchased the product, and was injured. <em>See Motion </em>at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>The parties also agree that each applicable state requires plaintiffs to prove general and specific causation for their claims for negligence, strict liability, failure to warn, breach of warranties, and consumer fraud. <em>See Motion </em>at 16. Plaintiffs must show a causal link between their alleged injury, anosmia, and their use of Zicam, the allegedly defective product. \u201cGeneral causation\u201d means \u201cwhether the substance at issue had the capacity to cause the harm alleged.\u201d <em>In re Hanford. Nuclear Reservation Litigation, </em>292 F.3d 1124, 1133 (9th Cir.2002). The general causation inquiry is \u201cwhether exposure to a substance for which a defendant is responsible ... is capable of causing a particular injury or condition in the general population.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1133. Specific or individual causation \u201crefers to whether a particular individual suffers from a particular ailment as a result of exposure to a substance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Where the distinction between general and individual causation is made, \u201cit must be strictly observed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1135</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Defendants move for summary judgment solely on the issue of general causation. They contend that we (and the transferor courts) need not reach the issue of specific causation unless plaintiffs\u2019 evidence is sufficient to show that anosmia can be caused by the circumstances of their exposure. <em>Motion </em>at 17 (citing <em>Ruggiero v. Warner-Lambert Co., </em>424 F.3d 249, 254 (2d Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">The admission of significant portions of plaintiffs\u2019 experts\u2019 opinions does not necessarily mean that the evidence is sufficient to support the general causation element of plaintiffs\u2019 claims. <em>See Stilwell, </em>482 F.3d at 1195 (affirming grant of summary judgment because the inclusion of the rejected testimony of plaintiffs expert does not establish causation). Even where scientific evidence \u201cmeets the standards of Rule 702,\u201d summary judgment may be an \u201cappropriate safeguard.\u201d <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>509 U.S. 579, 596, 113 S.Ct. 2786, 2798, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993). \u201c[Pjroof of causation must be such as to suggest \u2018probability\u2019 rather than mere \u2018possibility,\u2019 precisely to guard against raw speculation by the fact-finder.\u201d <em>Sakaria v. Trans World Airlines, </em>8 F.3d 164, 172-73 (4th Cir.1993); <em>see also Domingo ex rel. Domingo v. T.K., </em>289 F.3d 600, 607 (9th Cir.2002) (\u201cbits and pieces of testimony of defendants\u2019 experts could not give rise to a triable issue of causation.\u201d). However, as we noted in our <em>Daubert Order, </em>\u201c[vigorous cross-examination, presentation of contrary evidence, and careful instruction on the burden of proof are the traditional and appropriate means of attacking shaky but admissible evidence.\u201d <em>Daubert, </em>509 U.S. at 596, 113 S.Ct. at 2798.</p>\n<p id=\"Ahn4\">III. The delivery of a toxic dose.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-7\">To defeat summary judgment, plaintiffs\u2019 collective expert opinions and evidence must be sufficient for a fact-finder to reliably conclude that ordinary use of Zicam can deliver zinc ions to the OE in an amount capable of damaging enough OE to cause smell loss in humans. Defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot meet their burden because: (1) evidence of the toxic level of Zicam is insufficient; (2) evidence of how much Zicam reaches the OE is insufficient; and (3) evidence of the location of smell tissue is speculative.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-8\">A. Toxic level of Zicam</p>\n<p id=\"b982-9\">1. Is a showing of a toxic dose required?</p>\n<p id=\"b982-10\">Defendants contend that plaintiffs cannot meet then.- causation burden because they have not demonstrated how much Zicam (or zinc) exposure is necessary to cause smell loss. <em>Motion </em>at 13. Plaintiffs argue they need not prove a \u201ctoxic dose,\u201d but rather must simply demonstrate a \u201ccausal relationship between the defect and the injury.\u201d <em>Response </em>at 15. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>therefore first determine whether plaintiffs must introduce evidence of the level of exposure that could cause anosmia, i.e. whether they must demonstrate a toxic dose.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-4\">A central tenet of toxicology is \u201c\u2018the dose makes the poison\u2019; this implies that all chemical agents are intrinsically hazardous \u2014 whether they cause harm is only a question of dose.\u201d Fed. Judicial Ctr., <em>Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence </em>at 403 (2d. ed. 2000). An \u201cimportant component of toxicological research is dose-response relationships.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 406. This is the concept \u201cthat the more intense the exposure, the greater the risk of disease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 377. Some causal agents do not exhibit a dose-response relationship. For example, exposure may not cause disease until it exceeds a certain dose. \u201cThus, a dose-response relationship is strong, but not essential, evidence that the relationship between an agent and disease is causal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b983-5\">However, while a Zicam dose-response relationship may exist, determining the toxic dose of a drug is challenging. Drugs, in contrast to toxins, are intended to be ingested. We do not require studies on \u201cliving humans with intact physiology and operative metabolic and immune function\u201d to demonstrate \u201cthe amount needed to destroy a sufficient amount of OE to compromise smell function.\u201d <em>See Motion </em>at 20. While this sort of study might be helpful to a trier of fact, it presents significant ethical problems. <em>See Daubert Order </em>at 14 (citing <em>Reference Manual </em>at 405).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-6\">Given the challenge of determining a toxic dose, and plaintiffs\u2019 concession that they have not done so, the issue is whether this failure entitles defendants to summary judgment on general causation. Related to this question is the parties\u2019 disagreement about whether plaintiffs\u2019 actions arise under the law of \u201cproducts liability\u201d or \u201ctoxic tort.\u201d <em>See Response </em>at 13; <em>Reply </em>at 9. Clearly, there is some overlap between toxic tort and products liability litigation in actions where plaintiffs allege that a product\u2019s defect is its chemical toxicity to humans. <em>See, e.g. McClain v. Metabolife Intern., Inc., </em>401 F.3d 1233, 1239 (11th Cir. 2005) (classifying personal injury actions arising from pharmaceutical use as kind of toxic tort case in which the medical community does not generally recognize toxicity of agent); <em>see also Leathers v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>233 F.R.D. 687, 690 (N.D.Ga.2006). However, the relationship between toxic tort and products liability law is not exactly the issue before us. The issue is whether the toxic dose showing required in environmental exposure actions is applicable to products liability claims for allegedly toxic drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-8\">Defendants cite a lengthy list of cases in support of their argument that products liability claims about the toxicity of drugs require evidence of a toxic dose. <em>See Reply </em>at 15. However, only two of these decisions involve medicine. First, in <em>McClain v. Metabolife Intern., Inc., </em>401 F.3d 1233, 1236 (11th Cir.2005), plaintiffs alleged they sustained \u201cserious injuries after taking Metabolife 356, an herbal appetite suppressant containing ephedrine and caffeine.\u201d The court categorized the action as a toxic tort case in which the medical community does not \u201cgenerally recognize the agent as both toxic and causing the injury plaintiff alleges,\u201d as distinguished from actions involving known toxins like asbestos and cigarette smoke. <em>Id. </em>at 1239. The court excluded a scientific expert\u2019s opinion in part because he could not \u201cprovide any opinions about the general dose-response levels for Metabolife\u2019s toxicity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1241. In toxic tort cases, the court concluded, \u201cscientific knowledge of the harmful level of exposure to a chemical is a minimal fact necessary to sustain plaintiffs burden,\u201d and \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate the levels of exposure that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>are hazardous to human beings generally as well as the plaintiffs actual level of exposure to the defendant\u2019s toxic substance before he or she may recover.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">In so concluding, the <em>McClain </em>court did not cite any drug or pharmaceutical cases, but instead relied on environmental exposure decisions. See <em>McClain, </em>401 F.3d at 1241 (citing <em>Allen v. Pennsylvania Eng\u2019g Corp., </em>102 F.3d 194 (5th Cir.1996) (exposure to chemicals used in hospital where plaintiff worked); <em>Mitchell v. Gencorp, </em>165 F.3d 778 (10th Cir.1999) (exposure to chemicals in \u201cflammable room\u201d at work); <em>Wright v. Willamette Industries, Inc., </em>91 F.3d 1105 (8th Cir.1996) (exposure to particulate emissions from fiberboard manufacturing plant); <em>Moore v. Ashland Chem. Inc., </em>151 F.3d 269 (5th Cir.1998) (exposure to chemicals spilled from leaking drums plaintiff delivered)).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Defendants also cite <em>In re Bextra &amp; Celebrex Mktg. Sales Practices &amp; Prod. Liab. Litigation, </em>524 F.Supp.2d 1166 (N.D.Cal.2007), in which over 3,000 plaintiffs alleged that they (or their family members) suffered cardiovascular injuries as a result of taking Celebrex, a pain medication. The court stated that \u201c[a]ll of plaintiffs\u2019 experts, with perhaps a single exception, agree that there is a dose effect with Celebrex; that is, that it is more toxic, and is therefore more likely to cause an adverse side effect, when taken at greater doses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1174. In deciding to evaluate plaintiffs\u2019 causation experts\u2019 opinions on the 200 milligram dose separately from their opinions about the 400 milligram dose, the court relied on environmental exposure cases requiring a showing of the toxic exposure level. <em>Id. </em>at 1174-75 (citing <em>Mitchell, </em>165 F.3d at 781; <em>Allen, </em>102 F.3d at 199; <em>Hanford, </em>292 F.3d at 1133 (exposure to radioactive emissions from nuclear facility)). The court then concluded that there was insufficient evidence of causation of adverse events from Celebrex at the 200 milligram dose or less. <em>Id. </em>at 1175.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-7\">Insofar as <em>McClain </em>and <em>Bextra </em>applied the \u201ctoxic dose\u201d requirement from environmental exposure litigation to drug products liability actions, they appear to be unique. Defendants cite no other cases involving pharmaceuticals; the remaining cases on which they rely are environmental exposure cases that do not involve drug products. <em>See Motion </em>at 17; <em>Reply </em>at 14; <em>Mitchell, </em>165 F.3d 778 (chemicals in \u201cflammable room\u201d); <em>Abuan v. General Elec. Co., </em>3 F.3d 329 (9th Cir.1993) (exposure to PCBs and other chemicals); <em>Dee v. PCS Property Management, Inc., </em>174 Cal.

Kaiser Gypsum Co., </em>98 Cal.App.4th 1098, 120 Cal.Rptr.2d 23 (2002) (asbestos exposure); <em>Parker v. Brush Wellman, </em>2010 WL 3730924 (N.D.Ga.2010) (exposure to beryllium); <em>Higgins v.

Marriott Hotel Servs., Inc., </em>501 F.Supp.2d 1011 (W.D.Mich.2007) (exposure to pest control spray in hotel room).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">In addition, other courts considering environmental exposure claims have concluded that while \u201cprecise information concerning the exposure necessary to cause specific harm is beneficial, such evidence is not always available, or necessary, to demonstrate that a substance is toxic.\u201d <em>Clausen v. M/V NEW CARISSA, </em>339 F.3d 1049, 1059-60 (9th Cir.2003) (internal citations omitted) (oyster death caused by oil spill). Plaintiffs need not show a \u201cmathematically precise table equating levels of exposure with levels of harm.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>91 F.3d at 1107 (exposure to particulate emissions from fiberboard plant); <em>see also Heller v. Shaw Industries, Inc., </em>167 F.3d 146, 154 (3d Cir.1999) (\u201cif a person were doused with chemical X and immediately thereafter developed symptom Y, the need for published literature showing a correlation between the two may be lessened.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">In contrast to <em>Bextra, </em>other courts reviewing drug product defect claims have not required evidence of a toxic dose. <em>See, e.g., McClellan v. I-Flow Corp., </em>710 F.Supp.2d 1092, 1111 (D.Or.2010) (\u201cWhile plaintiffs\u2019 experts cannot identify the precise threshold dose of bupivacaine or the length of exposure that triggers irreparable chondrocyte damage, <em>\u2018Daubert </em>does not require that every aspect of a theory of medical causation be supported by research on the identical point.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Domingo, </em>289 F.3d at 607)); <em>In re Avandia Marketing, Sales Practices and Products Liability Litigation, </em>2011 WL 13576 (E.D.Pa.2011) (denying motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts\u2019 opinion about causal connection between Avandia and myocardial infarction without discussion of toxic dose); <em>Bartlett v. Mutual Pharmaceutical Company, Inc., </em>760 F.Supp.2d 220 (D.N.H.2011) (denying motion for judgment as a matter of law because plaintiff presented sufficient evidence that drug\u2019s risks outweighed its benefits without discussion of toxic dose); In re <em>Fosamax Products Liability Litigation, </em>645 F.Supp.2d 164 (S.D.N.Y.2009) (denying motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts\u2019 opinion that drug can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw without requiring demonstration of toxic dose); <em>In re Neurontin Marketing, Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation, </em>612 F.Supp.2d 116 (D.Mass.2009) (denying motion to exclude plaintiffs\u2019 general causation experts\u2019 opinion that Neurontin can increase risk of suicide without determination of dose-response relationship). These cases considered contentions that the drugs could cause the harm alleged without discussion of the level of exposure that could be toxic.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-7\">That the toxic dose issue does not arise more frequently in the drug products liability context makes sense. Toxicology and pharmacology are distinct disciplines. <em>Reference Manual </em>at 403. In environmental exposure litigation, plaintiffs may allege injury caused by a substance with which many people interact harmlessly at lesser degrees of exposure. In order to explain how a pervasive substance is harmful, one must show that at a particular level of exposure, the substance becomes .toxic. Without requiring this kind of evidence, the door is open to meritless claims based <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>on generally harmless levels of exposure. But that risk is less severe in drug product liability actions. Unlike, for example, the allegation that dust emissions from a factory caused injury, plaintiffs allege anosmia caused by a metered dose of Zicam that they injected directly into their bodies. The level of exposure will be mostly the same for all plaintiffs, and is easily distinguished from the general population\u2019s level of zinc gluconate nasal ingestion (i.e., none).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-4\">Having considered the limited precedent and the relevant practical concerns, we conclude that to establish general causation, plaintiffs need not prove a toxic dosage of Zicam. Instead, plaintiffs must demonstrate Zicam \u201cis toxic to humans given substantial exposure.\u201d <em>Westberry v. Gislaved Gummi AB, </em>178 F.3d 257, 264 (4th Cir.1999) (citations omitted). Plaintiffs need not provide \u201cprecise information concerning the exposure necessary to cause specific harm to humans.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, they must put forth sufficient evidence from which a reasonable person could conclude that it is more probable than not that Zicam caused their anosmia. A qualitative, rather than quantitative, analysis can suffice.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-5\">2. Have plaintiffs provided sufficient evidence of toxicity?</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">The issue before us then is whether the opinions of plaintiffs\u2019 experts are sufficient to show that Zicam can be toxic at a level of exposure similar to that which plaintiffs experienced.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We admitted the toxicity opinions of Dr. Davis and Dr. Pike. In doing so, we found their reliance on studies by Jae H. Lim and Sanja Pavlica to be methodologically sound. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-8\">We denied defendants\u2019 motion to exclude Dr. Davis\u2019s toxicity opinion even though he does not know exactly how much OE must be compromised to produce smell dysfunction. Dr. Davis\u2019s lack of knowledge of the exact amount of OE damage necessary to cause smell dysfunction does not undermine the reliability of his testimony. Every step of a theory of causation need not be supported by research on the identical point. <em>See Daubert Order </em>at 18 (citing <em>Domingo, </em>289 F.3d at 607). Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion may be properly considered by a jury, and contributes to the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">We admitted Dr. Pike\u2019s opinion about the toxicity of Zicam to OE and the drug\u2019s potential to cause anosmia. Specifically, we permitted Dr. Pike\u2019s reliance on <em>in vitro </em>studies of Zicam\u2019s toxicity to OE for his conclusion that above \u201c300 micromolar (0.3 mM) concentration all zinc salts are toxic to olfactory cells,\u201d and that the zinc gluconate concentration in Zicam is 100% higher than that level. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 27; <em>Pike Report </em>at 15 (doc. 1067-10). Defendants argue that Dr. Pike\u2019s opinion about the amount of zinc in zinc gluconate that can kill an OE cell is insufficient because it is based on an <em>in vitro </em>cytotoxicity study. <em>Motion </em>at 20. According to defendants, because the <em>in vitro </em>studies \u201cinvolve the interaction of the chemical only with isolated cells, this study sheds no light whatsoever on causation of any specific medical condition in living humans with intact physiology and operative metabolic and immune function.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In their <em>Daubert </em>motion, defendants similarly argued that <em>in vitro </em>studies could not form the basis of general causation conclusions, because they do not account for human <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>physiology and the zinc-tissue cell relationship. <em>See Motion to Exclude Causation Experts </em>at 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-4\">We do not agree that there is no basis to extrapolate from the amount of zinc capable of killing isolated cells to the amount necessary to cause anosmia. While <em>in vitro </em>evidence may not prove the exact level of exposure necessary for a human to lose the sense of smell, that level of precision is not necessary. As we concluded in our <em>Daubert Order, </em>\u201ca lack of knowledge as to the exact amount of OE damage necessary to cause smell dysfunction does not necessarily render Dr. Pike\u2019s opinions about Zicam\u2019s toxicity unreliable.\u201d <em>Daubert Order </em>at 28. We further conclude that such evidence creates an issue of material fact about Zicam\u2019s ability to destroy a person\u2019s OE at a given level of exposure.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-5\">Plaintiffs need not establish the toxic dose of Zicam. Plaintiffs\u2019 evidence of toxicity is sufficient to create a material issue of fact regarding general causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-6\">B. Distribution and reach of Zicam in the nasal cavity</p>\n<p id=\"b987-7\">Defendants contend that there \u201cis no non-speculative evidence in the record that Zicam reaches the OE in a sufficient dose to cause smell dysfunction under conditions of normal use.\u201d <em>Motion </em>at 18. We admitted the opinions of Dr. Mitra and Dr. Pike on the distribution of Zicam within the nasal cavity.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-8\">We admitted Dr. Mitra\u2019s opinion about \u201cthe distribution and deposition of the Zicam gel and zinc ions within the nasal cavity,\u201d concluding that his opinion that positively charged zinc ions disassociate from the zinc gluconate in Zicam after the gel enters the body is reliable. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 21. We further found reliable his opinion that zinc ions reach the \u201colfactory mucosa present in the posterior area of medial turbinate due to capillary action, postural effects and sniffing.\u201d <em>Id </em>at 22. Defendants argue that Dr. Mitra\u2019s diffusion opinion is insufficient because there is no evidence of how much zinc will reach the OE. <em>Motion </em>at 19. They claim there is no evidence beyond Dr. Mitra\u2019s \u201cbare opinion\u201d that any measurable amount of Zicam will \u201covercome the forces of gravity, mucociliary clearance and absorption into the nasal mucosa and ultimately the bloodstream\u201d to make it to the OE. <em>Motion </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-10\">Despite Dr. Mitra\u2019s admission that he does not know exactly how much zinc will reach the OE through diffusion, his opinion still helps to create a genuine dispute about material facts. To show that Zicam is capable of causing anosmia, plaintiffs must explain how Zicam, or disassociated zinc, could reach a plaintiffs smell tissue. Dr. Mitra\u2019s theory applying the well-established principle of diffusion may properly contribute to the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 case on this point. Its significance is not wholly dependant on plaintiffs\u2019 ability to prove the exact amount of zinc that reaches the OE. Defendants\u2019 questions about the rate of substance dispersion, clearance and absorption, and how much OE would interact with zinc may be explored on cross-examination and through defendants\u2019 expert testimony. <em>See Daubert Order </em>at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-11\">We also admitted Dr. Pike\u2019s opinion that disassociated zinc ions can reach the OE because of differences in the electronegativity of the nose and mouth. <em>See Daubert Order </em>at 26. Over defendants\u2019 objection that Dr. Pike\u2019s theory was untested and unproved, we concluded it was a reliable extrapolation and therefore admissible. <em>Id </em>As with Dr. Mitra\u2019s opinion, Dr. Pike\u2019s opinion supports plaintiffs\u2019 case that Zicam can reach smell tissue.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-12\">Defendants additionally argue that several studies involving dyed Zicam show no significant diffusion and that the gel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"948\">*948</page-number>cleared through the nasal passage. <em>Motion </em>at 21 (citing Jesus Herranz Gonzalez-Botas et al., <em>Anatomical Distribution and Transport of a Topical Liquid Nasal Gel, </em>57 Acta Otorringolaringol Esp. 130 (2006) (doc. 1068-10); Jesus Herranz GonzalezBotas et al., <em>Study to Determine the Distribution Pattern of a Nasal Gel Using a Radial Design Nasal Actuator </em>(2010) (unpublished) (sealed) (doc. 1068-9)). However, contradiction between plaintiffs\u2019 methodologically sound theories and defendants\u2019 evidence does not entitle defendants to summary judgment. Plaintiffs\u2019 reliable theories about the distribution of Zicam create a material factual dispute about the reach of the drug in the nasal cavity. The significance of conflicting research may be explored through defendants\u2019 cross-examination of plaintiffs\u2019 experts. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-4\">It is also not dispositive that plaintiffs have not offered evidence of the amount of Zicam or zinc that can reach the OE through diffusion, electro-osmosis, or other mechanisms. <em>See Motion </em>at 23. Plaintiffs must provide \u201csufficiently compelling proof that the event must have caused the damage somehow.\u201d <em>Domingo, </em>289 F.3d at 607 (citing <em>Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 1311, 1314 (9th Cir.1995) <em>(\u201cDaubert II\u201d)). </em>However, we do not require that \u201cevery aspect of a theory of medical causation be supported by research on the identical point.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The absence of studies on exactly how much Zicam may move through the nasal cavity does not render plaintiffs\u2019 theories insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-5\">In support of their experts\u2019 opinions about the distribution of Zicam, plaintiffs also point to the Zicam patent and the deposition testimony of defendants\u2019 experts. <em>See Response </em>at 17-18. According to the patent, the product \u201cmaintains ionic zinc in direct contact with the nasal membrane, preferably for an extended period of time of at least one-quarter hour, and delivers rapidly zinc into the nasal membrane and into blood in the nasal membrane.\u201d <em>Daubert Response, </em>ex. 5, \u201cU.S. Patent 6,080,783\u201d at 32 (doc. 1231-2). In addition, as we noted in our <em>Daubert Order, </em>two of defendants\u2019 experts agree that some diffusion of zinc ions is likely and it is plausible that zinc could reach the OE. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 22 (citing <em>Daiby Deposition </em>at 88 (doc. 1278-1); <em>Schwob Deposition </em>at 61 (doc. 1231-2)). We agree that the patent and the opinions of several of defendants\u2019 experts bolster plaintiffs\u2019 showing that Zicam can reach the OE.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-7\">We conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 expert opinions about the reach of Zicam and zinc within the nasal cavity contribute to the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence that the product can cause anosmia.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">C. Location of OE</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">We admitted Dr. Davis\u2019s opinion that OE is located diffusely through the nasal cavity. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 8. We concluded that although Dr. Davis\u2019s theory is not the majority view, it is based on valid scientific methodology. Defendants argue that because Dr. Davis does not know how much OE is located in particular regions of the nasal cavity, or how much must be compromised to produce smell loss, Dr. Davis\u2019s theory is speculative and insufficient to prove causation. <em>Motion </em>at 23. We addressed this contention and concluded that even though more precise information about the location of OE and the amount that must be destroyed to cause anosmia is not yet available, Dr. Davis\u2019s theory may still be helpful to a jury. <em>Daubert Order </em>at 9 (citing <em>Clausen, </em>339 F.3d at 1059-60).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">For the same reason, we conclude that the theory supports the sufficiency of plaintiffs\u2019 case on causation. In conjunction with plaintiffs\u2019 expert testimony about the toxicity and reach of Zicam, Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>Davis\u2019s opinion about the location of the OE may support a trier of fact\u2019s finding that it is scientifically possible for Zicam to have caused a plaintiffs anosmia.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">In sum, we conclude that the totality of plaintiffs\u2019 evidence regarding the toxicity of Zicam, the distribution and deposition of Zicam and zinc in the nasal cavity, and the location of OE, is sufficient to create a triable issue of fact as to whether Zicam can cause anosmia. A reasonable fact-finder could conclude that ordinary use of Zicam can cause plaintiffs\u2019 alleged injuries. Therefore, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment on the issue of general causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">IV. Differential diagnosis</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">Plaintiffs argue that even in the absence of any expert testimony on causation, they may rely on differential diagnosis or the immediate onset of symptoms following exposure to establish causation, and therefore, defendants are not entitled to summary judgment. <em>Response </em>at 20. Because we conclude that plaintiffs\u2019 expert opinions and evidence are sufficient to create a triable issue of fact on causation, we need not reach plaintiffs\u2019 alternative contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">IT IS ORDERED DENYING defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment (doc. 1374).</p>\n<p id=\"b989-10\">DATED this 2nd day of June, 2011.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b981-10\">. Defendants assert that the only plaintiffs with claims currently pending in this MDL are those who did not opt to participate in the global settlement of the personal injury actions. <em>See Motion </em>at 9; <em>Notice of Settlement of Partial Withdraw of Motion for Summary Judgment </em>(doc. 1412) (notifying court of settlement of three additional actions). However, the settled actions have yet to be dismissed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b981-11\">. We excluded Dr. Davis\u2019s opinions about (1) the distribution of Zicam within the nasal cavity, and (2) the effectiveness of Zicam. We excluded Dr. Mitra\u2019s opinions about (1) Zicam\u2019s toxicity to the OE, (2) anosmia, and (3) Zicam\u2019s efficacy.
