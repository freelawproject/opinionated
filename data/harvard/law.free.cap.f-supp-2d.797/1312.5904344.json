Now, in support of its Motion, Defendants cite a recent Eleventh Circuit decision, <em>Baptista v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>640 F.3d 1194 (11th Cir.2011), which held that the National Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 21 <em>et seq. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1316\">*1316</page-number>(\u201cNBA\u201d), preempted an action based upon a state consumer protection law directed at limiting the ability of a bank to charge fees for certain services.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendants contend that <em>Baptista </em>mandates that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims be considered preempted by the NBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-4\">Upon consideration and after holding oral argument on this issue on July 12, 2011, the Court finds that <em>Baptista </em>does not demand reversal of this Court\u2019s Omnibus Order. Therefore, Defendant Chase\u2019s Motion to Dismiss on Grounds of Preemption and Further Consideration, as well as the joinder motions of the other Defendant banks, is denied for the following reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-5\">I. Omnibus Order\u2019s Ruling on Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b1356-6\">On December 22, 2009, Defendants filed an Omnibus Motion to Dismiss (DE # 217) on the partial basis that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were preempted by the NBA. In its Omnibus Order (DE # 305) entered March 11, 2010, the Court analyzed the issue of preemption in the context of the NBA, ultimately finding that Plaintiffs\u2019 claims were not preempted thereunder. <em>See also In re: Cheeking Account Overdraft Litig., </em>694 F.Supp.2d 1302, 1310-14 (S.D.Fla.2010). Rather than summarizing herein the Court\u2019s findings in that Order, the Court cites in full the relevant parts as to NBA preemption:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-7\">As the Eleventh Circuit explained in <em>Rine v. Imagitas, Inc., </em>\u201c[ujnder the Supremacy Clause, any state law that conflicts with federal law is preempted.\u201d 590 F.3d 1215, 1224 (11th Cir.2009) (quoting <em>Gibbons v. Ogden, </em>22 U.S. 1, 9 Wheat. 1, 6 L.Ed. 23 (1824)). Defendants assert that the activities of national banks in conducting the \u201cbusiness of banking\u201d are subject to exclusive federal</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1356-10\">Plaintiffs respond that they are not trying to prevent banks from engaging in the business of banking, they are merely asking the banks to do so in good faith. Specifically, Plaintiffs claim they are not challenging the bank\u2019s right to charge overdraft fees. Instead, they are challenging the banks\u2019 practice of manipulating the overdraft fees \u201cin order to maximize a benefit to them and to the great detriment of the parties who are their account holders.\u201d (Oral Arg. Tr. at 33.) Plaintiffs explain that the banks are not federally authorized to manipulate the transactions as alleged and therefore their claims are not preempted by federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 38. The Court agrees. As Defendants point out, regulation of national banks is one of the few areas in which preemption of state law is presumed. <em>Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A v. Nelson, </em>517 U.S. 25, 32, 116 S.Ct. 1103, 134 L.Ed.2d 237 (1996). National banks are chartered by the federal government pursuant to the National Bank Act (\u201cNBA\u201d) and the NBA grants national banks \u201call such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking.\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24 (Seventh) (2006). To insure that nation<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1317\">*1317</page-number>al banks can carry out the business of banking without the impairment of inconsistent or intrusive state laws, courts have \u201crepeatedly made clear that federal control shields national banking from unduly burdensome and duplicative state regulation.\u201d <em>Watters v. Wachovia Bank, </em>550 U.S. 1, 11, 127 S.Ct. 1559, 167 L.Ed.2d 389 (2007).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-5\">The United States Supreme Court has upheld the doctrine of federal preemption to shield the banking activities of national banks from the application of state law. <em>See e.g., Barnett Bank of Marion County, </em>517 U.S. 25, 116 S.Ct. 1103 [134 L.Ed.2d 237]; <em>Franklin Nat. Bank of Franklin Square v. New York, </em>347 U.S. 373, 74 S.Ct. 550, 98 L.Ed. 767 (1954). In <em>Barnett Bank </em>the Supreme Court determined that a federal law allowing national banks to \u201cact as the agent for any fire, life, or other insurance company\u201d preempted a state law outlawing financial institutions from engaging in insurance agency activities. 517 U.S. at 26, 116 S.Ct. 1103. The <em>Barnett Bank </em>Court explained that to determine preemption the Court must look at whether the federal and state statutes are in <em>irreconcilable conflict. Id. </em>at 32, 116 S.Ct. 1103. In other words, whether compliance with both statutes is a physical impossibility, or whether the state law stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the Court in <em>Franklin National Bank </em>held that federal statutes which authorize national banks to receive savings deposits conflicted with New York state legislation that prohibited national banks from using the word \u2018saving\u2019 or \u2018savings\u2019 in their advertising or business. 347 U.S. at 376-79, 74 S.Ct. 550. The Court found the statutes incompatible; finding that since advertising is a natural part of the business of banking, the government cannot allow the banks to receive savings deposits without allowing them to advertise the same. <em>Id.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-7\">Further, the Court in <em>Watters </em>held that an operating subsidy of a national bank cannot be subject to state mortgage lending requirements such as registration, inspection and enforcement regimes. 550 U.S. 1, 127 S.Ct. 1559. The Court explained that \u201c[s]tates are permitted to regulate the activities of national banks where doing so does not prevent or significantly interfere with the national bank\u2019s or the national bank regulator\u2019s exercise of its powers. But when state prescriptions significantly impair the exercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA, the State\u2019s regulations must give way.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 12,127 S.Ct. 1559.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1357-8\">Nevertheless, as Plaintiffs argue, the aforementioned cases all address state laws specifically targeted at national banks. State laws of general applicability, however, have been found not to be preempted. <em>See e.g. Baldanzi v. WFC Holdings Corp., </em>2008 WL 4924987 (S.D.N.Y.2008) (\u201cIn contrast to findings of federal preemption in cases involving specific state regulations that conflict with the NBA, causes of action sounding in contract, consumer protection statutes and tort have repeatedly been found by federal courts not to be preempted.\u201d). In fact, the Supreme Court held in <em>Watters </em>that \u201cfederally chartered banks are subject to state laws of general application in their daily business to the extent such laws do not conflict with the letter or general purpose of the NBA.\u201d <em>Watters, </em>550 U.S. at 12, 127 S.Ct. 1559,. Looking specifically at whether federal law preempts general state law claims addressing overdraft fees, the court in <em>Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A. </em>found that the state law claims were not preempted. 622 F.Supp.2d 946 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1318\">*1318</page-number>(N.D.Cal.2009). Explaining that \u201cpreemption would likely apply if a customer were challenging a bank\u2019s fundamental right to employ an overdraft fee at all,\u201d the court held that there was no preemption in <em>Gutierrez </em>because \u201cthe issue is whether Wells Fargo has been manipulating-indeed downright altering-customers\u2019 transaction records so as to maximize overdraft penalties imposed on customers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 950. Addressing the same issue in <em>White v. Wachovia Bank, N.A., </em>the court held that \u201cwhile the lawsuit may incidentally implicate Wachovia\u2019s largest-to-smallest transaction posting policy, it, more importantly, claims that Wachovia\u2019s policy allows the routine imposition of an overdraft fee for transactions that do not result in an actual overdraft. This allegation which forms the basis for all of its claims is not of a regulatory nature that would subject it to federal preemption.\u201d 563 F.Supp.2d 1358, 1367 (N.D.Ga.2008).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-4\">In their oral argument, Defendants relied heavily on the Sixth Circuit case, <em>Monroe Retail Inc. v. RBS Citizens, </em>589 F.3d 274 (6th Cir.2009). In <em>Monroe Retail, </em>the court found that the NBA\u2019s grant of authority to charge fees includes the authority to determine service fees for the garnishment process. The court found that Ohio\u2019s state conversion claim which would require the bank to freeze accounts immediately upon receipt of a garnishment order was preempted. Notably, the court agreed with the aforementioned cases and found that state laws of general applicability that do not target banks are \u201cexempted from preemption \u2018to the extent that they only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks\u2019 deposit taking powers.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. The court then went on to find that \u201c \u2018when state laws significantly impair the exercise of authority, enumerated or incidental under the NBA\u2019, the state laws \u2018must give way.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283 (quoting <em>Watters, </em>550 U.S. at 12, 127 S.Ct. 1559).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-6\">Here, the federally authorized powers have been enumerated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (\u201cOCC\u201d). The OCC, the regulatory agency charged with implementing the NBA, has promulgated a binding regulation confirming that the federally authorized \u201cpowers\u201d of national banks include the power to impose non-interest fees such as overdraft fees. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002(a) (\u201cAuthority to impose charges and fees. A national bank may charge its customers non-interest charges and fees, including deposit account service charges.\u201d). Further, the OCC sets out the factors a national bank is supposed to use to establish those fees, their amounts and the method of calculating them. 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002(b)(2). Namely, a national bank should establish non-interest fees, \u201cin its discretion, according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Further, when asked if the process followed by the Banks in deciding to use a high-to-low order of check posting is consistent with the safety and soundness considerations of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002(b) the OCC held, in Interpretive Letter No. 997, that \u201cwe agree that the Banks\u2019 decision to set fees based on a given order of check posting falls within the Banks\u2019 authority to set fees pursuant to section 4 (Seventh) and section 7.4002. We further agree that the process the Banks used in deciding to adopt the order of check posting described in your submissions is consistent with section 7.4002.\u201d 70 FR 9127-01.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1358-7\">The OCC also addresses federal preemption of regulations on deposit-taking activities. In Section 7.4007(b)(2) the OCC states \u201c[a] national bank may exercise its deposit-taking powers without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1319\">*1319</page-number>regard to state law limitations concerning: ... ii) Checking accounts; iii) Disclosure requirements; iv) Funds Availability ...\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4007(b)(2). The OCC goes on to clarify \u201cstate laws that are not preempted\u201d in Section (c): \u201cState laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the deposit-taking powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent that they only incidentally affect the exercise of national banks\u2019 deposit-taking powers: 1) Contracts; 2) Torts; 3) Criminal History ...\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4007(c).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-5\">The state law claims before this Court are contracts and tort claims; thus this Court\u2019s inquiry is limited to whether Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, as alleged, more than \u201cincidentally affect the exercise of national banks\u2019 deposit taking powers.\u201d The Court finds that they do not and are therefore not preempted.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-6\">Defendants assert that the language of the OCC expressly preempts any state law regulations on overdraft fees, but this is not the case. Section 7.4002 gives Defendant banks the right to charge overdraft fees, but it does not authorize banks to ignore general contract or tort law. Further, the OCC\u2019s interpretative letter does not authorize debit card postings in a high to low order to increase fees, it merely states that doing so does not <em>violate </em>the OCC\u2019s requirement that banks set fees using sound banking judgment. A bank could follow both the requirements of sound banking judgment outlined in Section 7.4007 and good faith; these principals are not in irreconcilable conflict. In fact, as cited by the <em>Gutietrez </em>court, the OCC itself advised a California bank that it must act in good faith when reordering checks for overdraft fees. <em>Gutierrez, </em>622 F.Supp.2d at 952 (\u201cThe only restraint on the discretion given to the payor under subsection (b) is that the bank act in good faith.\u201d). Thus, the OCC did not expressly manifest its intent to preempt these state law claims in the language of the regulation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-8\">Similarly, federal regulation in this field is not so pervasive that we can reasonably infer that Congress left no room for the states to supplement it. \u201cStates ... have always enforced their general laws against national banks \u2014 and have enforced their banking-related laws against national banks for at least 85 years ...\u201d <em>Cuomo v. Clearing House Ass\u2019n, </em>557 U.S. 519, 129 S.Ct. 2710, 2720, 174 L.Ed.2d 464 (2009). Moreover, Section 7.4007(c) explicitly reserves general areas of law to the states such as contracts, torts, criminal law and rights to collect debts, if the laws only incidentally affect the exercise of a national bank\u2019s deposit taking power.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1359-9\">Finally, these are state laws of general application that do not vitiate the purposes of the NBA, and banks could comply with both the NBA, OCC regulations and state laws if they refrained from engaging in the criticized posting procedures. Again, the Court\u2019s only inquiry at this stage is whether the state law claims, as alleged, more than incidentally affect the exercise of the banks\u2019 deposit taking power. The Plaintiffs alleged claims are <em>not </em>that banks lack the right to charge overdraft fees as part of their deposit-taking powers. Instead, Plaintiffs attack the allegedly unlawful manner in which the banks operate their overdraft programs to maximize fees at the expense of consumers. At this stage, these allegations do no more than incidentally affect the banks\u2019 exercise of their deposit taking power and are therefore not preempted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">(DE # 305 at 9-16); <em>see also In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., </em>694 F.Supp.2d 1302 (S.D.Fla.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1320\">*1320</page-number>II. Eleventh Circuit\u2019s Holding in <em>Baptista</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">Now, over 14 months later, Defendants have moved for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s earlier determination, contending that a case decided by the Eleventh Circuit on May 11, 2011 dictates a different result. Defendants provide no other basis for reconsideration of the Court\u2019s earlier ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">The case to which Defendants refer is <em>Baptista v. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., </em>640 F.3d 1194 (11th Cir.2011). <em>Baptista </em>involved a woman, Vida Baptista, who had received a check written to her by a Chase Bank account holder. When she cashed the check in-person at a local Chase branch, Chase charged her a $6.00 fee because she was not herself an account holder. While she paid the charge, she later filed a putative class action complaint against Chase, purporting to state two causes of action for recovery: 1) violation of Section 655.85, Florida Statutes; and 2) unjust enrichment. Defendant Chase sought dismissal of her claims, contending primarily that they were preempted by the NBA.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court dismissed plaintiffs claims on that basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit considered whether a state consumer protection statute that was purposefully directed at a bank\u2019s fee-charging authority was preempted by the NBA. To make this determination, the court considered the Florida statute in relation to the NBA. Specifically, Section 655.85 states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1360-7\">Settlement of Checks. Whenever any check is forwarded or presented to an institution for payment, except when presented by the payee in person, the paying institution or remitting institution may pay or remit the same, at its option, either in money or in exchange drawn on its reserve agent or agents in the City of New York or in any reserve city within the Sixth Federal Reserve District; however, an institution may not settle any check drawn on it otherwise than at par. The provisions of this section do not apply with respect to the settlement of a check sent to such institution as a special collection item.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APL\">Fla. Stat. \u00a7 655.85 (emphasis added). Under the NBA, however, banks are permitted to \u201cexercise ... all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to carry on the business of banking ...\u201d 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 24. The Office of Comptroller of Currency, the supervisory agency empowered with supervising and regulating federally chartered banks, interpreted the NBA to permit banks to \u201ccharge its customers non-interest charges and fees.\u201d 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002(a). Therefore, the issue before the Eleventh Circuit was whether the state statute was preempted by the NBA and its subsequent OCC interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">The court found that the standard for preemption in the context of the NBA was provided by an amendment to the NBA, found in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010,12 U.S.C. \u00a7 25b(b)(l). Therein, Congress mandated that, in the context of the NBA, \u201cstate consumer laws are preempted only if ... in accordance with the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, et al., </em>517 U.S. 25, 116 S.Ct. 1103 ..., the State consumer financial law prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by the national bank of its powers.\u201d <em>Baptista, </em>640 F.3d at 1197 (citing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, 12 U.S.C. 25b(b)(l)). <em>Barnett </em>itself held that the determinative question in considering preemption of a state statute by the NBA was \u201cwhether the state statute forbids, or ... impairs significantly the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Barnett, </em>517 U.S. at 33, 116 S.Ct. 1103).</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">As such, in determining if Section 655.85, Florida Statutes, was preempted by the NBA, the Eleventh Circuit implicitly considered whether the state statute \u201cforbids ... or impairs significantly the exercise of a power that Congress explicitly granted.\u201d Having determined that \u201c[t]he state\u2019s prohibition on charging fees to non-account holders, which reduces the bank\u2019s fee options by 50%,\u201d is in substantial conflict with federal authorization to charge such fees, the Eleventh Circuit adopted the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reasoning in <em>Wells Fargo Bank of Texas, N.A. v. James, </em>321 F.3d 488 (5th Cir.2003). The Eleventh Circuit further found that the Florida statute significantly impaired a bank\u2019s ability to \u201ccharge fees to non-account-holders presenting checks for payments.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>In relevant part, the court relied upon \u201cthe significant objective of 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002 [ ] to allow national banks to charge fees and to allow banks latitude to decide how to charge them .... in its discretion, according to sound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1198 n. 2. As such, \u201callowing the banks the option of <em>how </em>to charge fees was a significant objective of the NBA and regulations promulgated thereunder <em>...\u201d Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1361-7\">Therefore, this Court reads <em>Baptista </em>as holding that a state statute is preempted by the NBA where it is directed at limiting a right expressly granted to federally chartered banks by the NBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">III. Distinction Between <em>Baptista </em>and MDL 2036</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">In light of that holding, <em>Baptista, </em>while relevant to any \u2022 discussion of the preemptive effect of the NBA, does not overturn this Court\u2019s earlier determination that the NBA does not preempt Plaintiffs\u2019 claims. Instead, the Court finds that its earlier reasoning in its Omnibus Order accords with the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation of the preemptive reach of the NBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">At it simplest, <em>Baptista </em>was concerned with a state statute that specifically sought to delimit federally-granted authority to banks to charge fees to their customers and directly interfered with that right. As such, the Eleventh Circuit was faced with the question of whether a state statute, purposefully directed at impinging upon the NBA federal legislation, can serve as a basis for recovery. Unsurprisingly, the Eleventh Circuit found that the state statute was preempted not only because it was intended to undermine the NBA, but also because it had more than an incidental impact upon a bank\u2019s authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">MDL 2036 is distinguishable from <em>Baptista </em>because it is not predicated upon a bank\u2019s authority to charge fees. As this Court previously noted in its Omnibus Order, <em>In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., </em>694 F.Supp.2d at 1310-1311, none of the MDL Plaintiffs have claimed that banks are unable to charge fees to their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number>customers. Indeed such a claim would fail in light of the OCC\u2019s interpretation of the NBA, which permits banks to \u201ccharge fees and to allow banks latitude to decide how to charge them.\u201d <em>See also \u25a0 </em>12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4002(b)(2). Instead, Plaintiffs only seek recovery for the manner in which banks manipulated their debit and checking charges, rather than the manner in which those fees were computed. <em>Cf. In re Checking Account Overdraft Litig., </em>694 F.Supp.2d at 1313-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">The Court previously noted this same distinction in its Omnibus Order. However, it bears further discussion. A desire to limit a bank\u2019s authority to charge a fee is not synonymous with a desire to hold a bank liable for the bad-faith manner in which an account is reorganized to justify a larger number of overdraft charges. <em>Baptista </em>holds that the former cannot be permitted in light of the NBA\u2019s preemptive reach. But neither this Court nor the Eleventh Circuit can prevent a lawsuit by an individual under the latter, since the NBA has not foreclosed such claims. Instead, very much to the contrary, 12 C.F.R. \u00a7 7.4007(c) states as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1362-5\">State laws are not preempted. State laws on the following subjects are not inconsistent with the deposit-taking powers of national banks and apply to national banks to the extent that they only <em>incidentally affect </em>the exercise of national banks\u2019 deposit-taking powers: (1) Contracts; (2) Torts; [and] (3) Criminal Law ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1362-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). Inherently, therefore, the NBA rests upon a foundation of state contract law that it does not \u2014 it cannot \u2014 preempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">Therefore, just like when it previously passed on the issue of preemption, the issue before this Court in MDL 2036 is whether the claims raised by Plaintiffs\u2014 and the state laws upon which they are founded \u2014 only \u201cincidentally affect the exercise of national banks\u2019 deposit-taking powers\u201d and the other powers granted to them by the NBA. The Court so finds. Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cincidental\u201d as \u201c[subordinate to something of greater importance; having a minor role ...\u201d <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 111 </em>(8th ed. 2004). As noted above, Plaintiffs are not seeking to overturn the banks\u2019 authority to charge fees, which is certainly of \u201cgreater importance\u201d within the meaning of <em>Black\u2019s </em>definition of \u201cincidental.\u201d Instead, Plaintiffs seek only to ensure that the banks\u2019 actions are not taken in bad faith and in breach of the banks\u2019 duty to act in good faith towards their depositors. Notwithstanding the substantial damages alleged by Plaintiffs, the oft-presumed duty of good faith and fair dealing is certainly subordinate to a bank\u2019s ability to \u201ccharge fees and to allow banks latitude to decide how to charge them.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Moreover, insomuch as Plaintiffs are seeking only to enforce the \u201csound banking judgment and safe and sound banking principles,\u201d <em>Baptista, </em>640 F.3d at 1198 n. 2, the purpose of their claims are harmonized with the stated intent of the NBA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">Accordingly, insomuch as Plaintiffs\u2019 respective claims are based upon state contract principles expressly untouched by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>NBA, the application of which has only an \u201cincidental impact\u201d upon the exercise of a banks\u2019 deposit-taking powers, <em>Baptista </em>has not mandated preemption of those claims. Nor, as implied by the Savings Clause of the NBA, could it.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-5\">IV. Denial of Certification of Interlocutory Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-6\">Finally, although Defendants request that this Court certify an interlocutory appeal in the event it finds that <em>Baptista </em>does not apply here, the Court finds such certification inappropriate. Under the terms of \u00a7 1292(b), a court must find that three conditions are satisfied: 1) such an order involves a controlling question of law; 2) as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and 3) that an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b). The Court finds that this test is not met here, as certainly neither of the first two conditions is satisfied: <em>Baptista </em>does not control under the facts as alleged by Plaintiffs, and the NBA cannot preempt state contract claims that are expressly untouched by the NBA\u2019s own terms. <em>Cf. McFarlin v. Conseco Servs., LLC, </em>381 F.3d 1251, 1256-59 (11th Cir.2004). Therefore, Defendants\u2019 request for certification of an interlocutory appeal must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-8\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-9\">It is therefore ORDERED, ADJUDGED, and DECREED that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-10\">1. Defendant JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Motion for Reconsideration (DE # 1484), be and the same is hereby, DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-11\">2. Defendant JPMorgan Chase\u2019s Motion for Certification of Interlocutory Appeal (DE # 1484) is DENIED.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1363-12\">3. Defendants\u2019 joinder motions, filed respectively by Union Bank, NA. (DE # 1509); Citizens Financial Group (DE # 1521); Comerica, Inc. (DE # 1568); TD Bank, NA. (DE # 1575); Capital One (DE # 1587); and PNC Bank, N.A. (DE # 1591), are similarly DENIED.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1363-13\">DONE AND ORDERED in Chambers at the James Lawrence King Federal Justice Building and United States Courthouse in Miami, Florida this 13th day of July, 2011.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1355-12\">. The Court also considers the fully briefed joinder motions filed by other Defendant banks. In particular, the Court considers the following joinder motions: Union Bank, N.A.\u2019s Joinder (DE # 1509), filed May 20, 2011; Citizens Financial Group, Inc.\u2019s Joinder (DE # 1521), filed May 24, 2011; Comerica, Inc.'s Joinder (DE # 1568), filed June 3, 2011; TD Bank, N.A.'s Joinder (DE # 1575), filed June 3, 2011; Capital One\u2019s Joinder (DE # 1587), filed on June 7, 2011; PNC Bank, N.A.\u2019s Joinder (DE # 1591), filed June 8, 2011. Therefore, for convenience, the Court will refer to individual Plaintiffs and Defendant banks collectively.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1356-8\">. Plaintiffs filed their Response in Opposition (DE # 1578) on June 3, 2011, to which Defendant Chase filed its Reply (DE # 1605). Therefore, the underlying matter is ripe for determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1360-8\">. Additionally, Defendant also argued that the plaintiff could not allege essential elements of her unjust enrichment claim. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">. In arriving at this conclusion, the Eleventh Circuit also noted that the Fifth Circuit had found both that the OCC had the authority to promulgate rules applicable to the NBA, and that the OCC\u2019s interpretation warranted deference under <em>Auer v. Robbins, </em>519 U.S. 452, 117 S.Ct. 905, 137 L.Ed.2d 79 (1997). However, because neither of these issues is relevant to this Court's inquiry, they need not be further addressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1362-7\">. This Court is not alone in finding that the types of claims raised by Plaintiffs are not barred by the NBA. For instance, the court in <em>Gutierrez v. Wells Fargo Bank N.A., </em>No. 07-05923, 2010 WL 1233885 (N.D.Cal. Mar. 26, 2010) held, \"[t]his practice has nothing to do with whether Wells Fargo has the right to establish overdraft fees, or whether individual overdraft fees are reasonably related to actual underlying costs.... Rather, the \u201cunfair\u201d claim in this litigation targets whether Wells Fargo\u2019s manipulation of customer transactions \"behind the scenes\u201d to maximize the occurrence of overdraft fees during the posting process was a breach of the bank\u2019s duty to act in good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
