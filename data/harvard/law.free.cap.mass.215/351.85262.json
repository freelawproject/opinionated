It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>was brought in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston and on appeal came on for trial in the Superior Court. Before the jury was impanelled the defendant orally objected to the counsel of record for the plaintiff acting -for her on the ground that he had previously been of counsel for the estate of the defendant\u2019s intestate in the same matter. Later a written motion was filed to the same effect. The defendant\u2019s exceptions to the refusal by the judge<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> to direct the plaintiff\u2019s counsel not to proceed brings the case here. Rule 3 of the Superior Court, provides that \u201cthe right of an attorney of this court to appear for any party shall not be questioned by the opposite party, unless the objection be taken in writing within ten days after his appearance. \u201d This rule was well within the authority of the Superior Court and had the force of law. <em>Pratt </em>v.

The right of an attorney to appear for one of the parties had no connection whatever with the rights of the respective parties touching the matters to be tried in the action. To interject at this stage a collateral matter having nothing to do with the merits of the case could not fail to be distracting and might work injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The conduct of the trial judge was not open to exception in the respects complained of.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The case was submitted on briefs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\"><em> Hitchcock, </em>J.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
