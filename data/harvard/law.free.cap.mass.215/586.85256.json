On the story being told to the judge <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> a warrant to search the house of the plaintiff\u2019s brother was issued; four of the geese were found in the cellar, and the plaintiff, who was a boarder in the house, was'found upstairs and arrested as the person in whose possession the geese were found. He was held in custody until Monday, December 27, when a complaint was made against him signed by the chief of police, charging him with the larceny of the geese. He was tried on December 31 and acquitted. Thereupon this action for malicious prosecution was brought. At the trial the defendant admitted that the plaintiff was not \u201changing around\u201d his place in Saugus on the evening in question. The plaintiff testified that he asked the defendant \u201cwhat he had me arrested for\u201d and that the defendant said \u201che was sorry, he thought I was the one.\u201d In this the plaintiff was corroborated by his wife. The defendant without going on the stand as a witness rested on the plaintiff\u2019s evidence and asked for a ruling that on this evidence the plaintiff could not recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">Even then a verdict for the defendant well might have been expected, but we cannot say that as matter of law the jury were bound to find for him. They were warranted in finding on the admissions of the defendant that he caused the charge of larceny to be made against the plaintiff in the ease at bar, although the complaint was signed by the chief of police. And the fact that the defendant here told the chief of police that he saw the plaintiff \"hanging around\u201d his place on the night before, when admittedly the plaintiff was not there, warranted a finding that the charge was made without probable cause to believe him to be guilty; and from this the jury were warranted in inferring that the charge was made in bad faith, without any sincere belief in the plaintiff\u2019s guilt.
