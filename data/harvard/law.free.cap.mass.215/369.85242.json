L. c. 6, \u00a7 77, upon certain funds retained by the Commonwealth under a contract for the construction of a State highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-12\">On February 19, 1909, Henry J. Green was permitted to file a similar claim as an intervening claimant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-13\">The case was referred to Henry T. Richardson, Esquire, as master. The case was heard upon the master\u2019s report by <em>Hardy, </em>J., who made a memorandum of decision as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-14\">\u201cOn the basis for settling a decree in this bill I make the following allowances, namely: Claims for stone actually used on the highway; claims for gravel used in the construction of the highway; claim for labor in feeding stone crusher; claim for labor level-ling stone; claim for cement used in construction of highway; claim for drainpipe used in construction of highway.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b397-15\">\u201cI disallow the following claims, namely: Claims for hauling stone to crusher and to portions of highway; claims for teaming, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>purpose not in evidence; claims for boards used for concrete forms; claims for boards for conduit; claim for coal furnished for steam roller; claim for netting used in construction of highway; claim for cotton line; claim for rules; claim for road scraper; claim for buggies in transporting help; claim for use of scales; claim for freight paid. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-3\">A final decree based on these allowances and disallowances was made by the judge, from which the plaintiff Thomas and the intervening claimant Green appealed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b398-4\">The case was submitted on briefs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-5\"><em>J. H. Vahey &amp; P. Mansfield, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-6\"><em>J. W. Worthington, </em>for the defendant Pacific Surety Company.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b398-7\"><em>G. H. Wyman &amp; F. L. Brier, </em>for the intervening petitioner.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b398-8\">Hammond, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMr\">This case is before us upon the respective appeals of the plaintiff Thomas and the intervening creditor Green from a final decree in which certain items in the account of Thomas and the whole account of Green were disallowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-9\">The particulars relating to the claims disallowed are set forth in the report of the master and need not be repeated. It is clear upon the report that the items for boards used for concrete forms and for conduits, for netting, cotton line, rules, road scraper, buggies used in transporting help, use of scales, freight money paid, and for coal for the steam roller, were all properly disallowed, the last under the principle enunciated in <em>George H. Sampson Co. </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>202 Mass. 326, 337, 338, and the others upon the principle of <em>Kennedy </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>182 Mass. 480.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-10\">The claim of Green is entirely for teams used for \u201chauling stone from various stone walls in the vicinity of the highway to the crusher and for hauling cracked stone on to the road from the crusher.\u201d We think that this claim cannot be logically distinguished from the claim for hauling lumber and sand in <em>Webster </em>v. <em>Real Estate Improvement Co. </em>140 Mass. 526, and therefore it was properly disallowed. And so of similar items in the account of Thomas. There is nothing in <em>Friedman </em>v. <em>County of Hampden, </em>204 Mass. 494, inconsistent with the result herein reached. Of course the items for teaming for purposes not shown in evidence were properly disallowed. Indeed we do not understand that either of the appellants contends to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-11\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
