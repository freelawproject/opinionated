LeBow, seeking an accounting by the defendant for sums received by him as mortgagee from the sale in foreclosure of two mortgages on separate parcels of land on Homestead Street in that part of Boston called Roxbury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-10\">The case was referred to Frank M. Forbush, Esquire, as master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b506-11\">The master refused to allow the defendant credit for certain sums due as interest on the mortgage notes at the time of the foreclosure sales. It appeared that each mortgage contained the usual provision that, out of money arising from a foreclosure sale, the mortgagee might retain all sums then secured by the mortgage, \u201cwhether then or thereafter payable, including all costs, charges and expenses incurred or sustained by them by reason of any default in the performance or observance of the\u201d conditions of the mortgage. The published advertisement of each sale contained the statement, \u201cTerms and conditions of sale announced at time and place of sale.\u201d At each sale the auctioneer announced that the property was \u201csold subject to interest, taxes and a dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>puted claim for personal property\u201d then on the premises. The item of interest, with other items, was on a piece of paper which the auctioneer handed to the person who, after receiving the paper, made the highest bid and purchased the property. The amount bid in each case included the principal amount of the mortgage, the interest alleged to be due, the cost of advertising and amounts stated on the auctioneer\u2019s paper to be fees for the auctioneer and the attorney for the mortgagee, which items made up the entire amount bid by the purchaser. The master found that the items for auctioneer\u2019s and attorney\u2019s services were somewhat too large, so that the price for which the property was sold slightly exceeded the aggregate of the face of the mortgages with expenses and interest as found by the master.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b507-3\">The case was heard on the master\u2019s report by <em>Richardson, </em>J., who ordered a final decree directing the defendant to pay to the plaintiff, among other sums, a sum equal to the amount of interest due on the mortgages at the time of the sale. From a decree so entered, the defendant appealed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-4\"><em>C. W. Cushing &amp; D. Powers, </em>for the defendant, submitted a brief.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b507-5\"><em>J. H. Blanchard, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b507-6\">Rugg, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AT2\">The plaintiff is the trustee in bankruptcy of the owner of the equity of redemption in two parcels of real estate upon which the defendant held mortgages, and which he foreclosed. One of the terms of each foreclosure sale was stated to be that the property would be sold subject among other claims to the unpaid interest, the amount of which was announced. The property was purchased by the defendant, whose bid slightly exceeded the aggregate of the face of the mortgage and expenses and interest. The question is whether in this suit for an accounting the defendant is entitled to retain the unpaid interest out of the proceeds of the sale, or whether the plaintiff is entitled to the excess above the face of the mortgage and the expenses of foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">It must be assumed in the absence of any finding to the contrary that the foreclosure sale was conducted fairly and that the price bid was the reasonable value of the property under all the conditions. The announcement that the purchaser must take the property subject to a stated amount of unpaid interest must be presumed to have produced its natural effect upon prospective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>bidders and the price at which finally it was struck off may be assumed to have been the fair price. Taken according to its terms that price meant that the purchaser was willing to give it and in addition pay the interest up to the amount stated, as well as the taxes and the other claims announced at the sale. The defendant having become the purchaser and being bound to exercise the utmost good faith in making the foreclosure sale, cannot with justice be heard to say that the terms of the sale did not mean what they were announced to be. It cannot be presumed in his favor under these circumstances that others present would not have been bidders upon a literal interpretation of the publicly stated terms of sale, and that therefore he ought not to be held to them. The fair implication from all the facts is that he has become the owner of real estate fairly worth the sum stated as the interest, subject to which the sale was made, more than the face of the mortgage and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
