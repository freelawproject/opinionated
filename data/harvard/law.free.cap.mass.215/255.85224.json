The judge gave the instructions and made the ruling which are quoted in the opinion. He then submitted to the jury the following questions, to which the jury gave the answers which are printed after the respective questions:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-4\">1. \u201cWhat was the market value of the easement for the sewer taken in the strip of land in question, having reference to all purposes or uses to which the land was adapted including its adaptability for cemetery purposes?\u201d The jury answered, \u201c$3,857.35.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-5\">2. \u201cWhat was its market value disregarding the adaptability of the land for cemetery purposes? \u201d The jury answered, \u201c $529.37.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-6\">3. \u201cWhat damage, if any, was done to the remaining land of the petitioner? \u201d The jury answered, \u201cNone.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b284-7\">The judge reported the case for determination by this court.

The only question raised by the report relates to a riding and certain instructions on the subject of damages given by the trial judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-11\">The judge instructed the jury among other things as follows: \u201cThe sum to be awarded where real estate is taken is the fair market value of the property having reference to all the uses for which it is adapted. Its value for any special purpose is not the test although it may be considered with a view of ascertaining what the property is worth in the market for any use for which it will bring the most.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">\u201cIn determining damages in a case of this kind, the jury should consider not only the value of the property taken but also the effect of the taking upon that which is left; and in estimating the value of that which is taken, they may consider all the uses to which it-might properly have been applied if it had not been taken. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>Damages are not to be awarded with reference to the peculiar situation or circumstances or plans of the owner or to the business in which he happens to be engaged, but any and all the uses to which that land considered as property, may profitably be applied, whether contemplated by the owner or not, may well be taken into account by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">The judge also ruled that the jury, in determining the value of the easement, might \u201ctake into consideration the adaptability of the land for cemetery purposes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">The ruling and instructions were correct and in accordance with well established principles as set forth by this court. <em>Conness </em>v. Commonwealth, 184 Mass. 541, 542. <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Northampton, </em>157 Mass. 218, 219. <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>210 Mass. 259.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">The respondent\u2019s argument that the amount found by the jury was excessive might properly have been addressed to the trial judge on a motion for a new trial, but is not pertinent to the question before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">In accordance with the report, judgment is to be entered for the petitioner for $3,857.35.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">\n<em>So ordered.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
