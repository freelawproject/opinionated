At the close of the charge, a colloquy took place at the bench, during which the judge made a statement which, if heard by the jury, would have cured his error. A bill of exceptions filed by the plaintiff stated that the judge\u2019s later statement was made \u201cin the presence but not in the hearing of the jury.\u201d The bill afterwards was amended to state merely that the statement was made in a colloquy at the bench. The statement was taken down by a stenographer and bore the character of a statement to the jury. <em>Held, </em>that presumably the statement was heard by the jury, and, the bill not making manifest that it was not so heard, the plaintiff did not show that he was harmed by the error and the exception must be overruled.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\">Tort for personal injuries alleged to have been received on November 23,1903, at about ten o\u2019clock in the evening, and to have been caused by the plaintiff being thrown to the ground by the sudden moving forward of a street car of the defendant as he was, in the act of alighting therefrom .at Lauriat Avenue in that part of Boston called Dorchester. Writ dated July 20, 1907.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Bond, </em>J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">The facts which the plaintiff\u2019s evidence tended to prove are stated in the opinion. The plaintiff contended that he was thrown from the car by its suddenly starting ahead after it had slackened its speed and had nearly come to a stop. The plaintiff had testified at a former trial that the car had slowed up, and that he was thrown off on the in-town side of Lauriat Avenue. A witness for the defendant testified that the car had slowed up on the in-town side of Lauriat Avenue. The defendant, to show a reason for this slowing up of the car on the in-town side of Lauriat Avenue when the stop was on the out-of-town side, was allowed, subject to exceptions by the plaintiff, to introduce in evidence the following ordinance and regulation which required the speed of cars to be reduced when approaching an intersecting street and forbade the stopping of cars in front of such a street, and which the judge admitted in evidence after the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>had refused to refrain from arguing that there was no reason.for .such slowing up of the speed of the car:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-3\">Revised Ordinances of the City of Boston of 1898, c. 6, \u00a7 24:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-4\">\u201cNo person having the control of the speed of a street railway-car shall stop any such car on a cross-walk or in front of an intersecting street, except to avoid collisions or danger to persons, or as directed by a police officer. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-5\">Regulations of the Aldermen of Boston, 1903, c. 1, as revised and approved by the Railroad Commissioners, September 9, 1903 : \u201c...

He had testified in cross-examination that he had not caused a number of persons, whose names appeared upon a report by the conductor of the car, to be summoned. On redirect examination, he testified, subject to exceptions by the plaintiff, that he had not summoned such persons because he had received from them communications in writing stating that they did not know anything about the accident.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-9\">Other material facts are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-10\">There was a verdict for the defendant; and the plaintiff filed a bill of exceptions. That bill stated that the statement by the judge in the colloquy at the bench at the close of the charge, referred to in the opinion, was \u201cin the presence but not in the hearing of the jury. \u201d After the death of <em>Bond, </em>J., an amendment to the bill was allowed by <em>Wait, </em>J., striking out the above words and substituting the words, \u201cat the judge\u2019s bench,\u201d and a substitute bill embodying that amendment afterwards was allowed by him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b201-11\">The case was argued at the bar in March, 1913, before <em>Rugg, C.

The ordinances and regulations were properly admitted. They tended to show that the act of the defendant\u2019s servants which was complained of was required by competent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>authority, and so was not in itself negligent. <em>Maisels </em>v. <em>Dry Dock, East Broadway &amp; Battery Street Railroad, </em>16 App. Div. (N. Y.) 391. <em>Stiasny </em>v. <em>Metropolitan Street Railway, </em>58 App. Div. (N. Y.) 172, affirmed in 172 N. Y. 656. This is the converse of the rule declared in <em>Stevens </em>v. <em>Boston Elevated Railway, </em>184 Mass. 476, and <em>Horsman </em>v. <em>Brockton &amp; Plymouth Street Railway, </em>205 Mass. 519.</p>\n<p id=\"A3c\">2. The witness Carney was allowed to testify that the reason he had not caused certain persons whose names had been taken by the defendant\u2019s conductor to be summoned as witnesses was that he had learned that they said they knew nothing about the occurrence. This was correct. The testimony did not tend to show, and was not admitted to show, that those persons in fact had no such knowledge. It tended to show the reason why Carney had not procured their attendance; and the jury could find that it was a good one. If so, it answered the claim which otherwise might have been made that the evidence was suppressed because it would have been unfavorable to the defendant. For this purpose it was competent to show Carney\u2019s belief and the reasons therefor. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Goldberg, </em>212 Mass. 88, 91. <em>Rumrill </em>v. <em>Ash, </em>169 Mass. 341, 347. <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Costello, </em>119 Mass. 214.</p>\n<p id=\"AxOg\">3. The plaintiff had reason to complain of the judge\u2019s charge as not covering the issues raised by the plaintiff\u2019s contention. That contention was that after the conductor\u2019s failure to cause the car to be stopped in accordance with the plaintiff\u2019s request, he went to the rear platform and complained to the conductor; that the conductor then gave the signal to stop the car at the next stopping place; that the plaintiff in preparation for alighting put his foot upon the step, having with his hand a tight hold on the guard or hand rail, ready to alight as soon as the car should have stopped; that the car slowed up and either stopped or came nearly to a full stop, at the regular stopping place; but that then the conductor gave the signal to start the car, it started with a sudden jerk, and threw the plaintiff off. This contention might seem improbable; but it was supported by the plaintiff\u2019s testimony, and he had a right to have the jury pass upon it. Upon the omission to charge the jury with reference thereto, he had a right to call the judge\u2019s attention to the matter and to save any exception that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>he might desire. Thereupon a colloquy took place at the judge\u2019s bench; and the judge said, \u201cIf that car came to a stop at the post on the other side of the street, where the car was expected to stop, intended to stop to let off passengers, and, before the plaintiff had time to get off, the car was suddenly started up and he was thrown, the defendant would be liable. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">If this was said to the jury, or even merely in their hearing but so that they understood it to be the rule which they must follow if they found the facts to be as the plaintiff contended, any previous defect in the charge was cured, the plaintiff had his full rights, and he has now no ground of exception. If it was not given to the jury for their guidance, the plaintiff\u2019s exceptions must be sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">The burden is always upon the excepting party to make it manifest that he has been aggrieved. Whatever is necessary to show this must be averred. <em>Richards </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>9 Gray, 315. As the plaintiff was not aggrieved if this language of the judge was addressed to the jury, it was for him to show that this was not so. His bill of exceptions says that it was at the close of the charge, presumably in the presence and hearing of the jury. It seems to have been taken down by the stenographer, which would tend to indicate that it was not a conversation apart, but part of the public proceedings of the trial. That it was said in a colloquy at the judge\u2019s bench does not indicate that it was not addressed to the jury. If it were not so addressed, that would naturally have been stated in the exceptions. It is of some significance that a statement that it was not in the hearing of the jury was at first made in the exceptions, and has since been stricken out by amendment, and the matter left wholly undetermined. Moreover, the language of the judge is such as he naturally would have addressed to the jury rather than merely to counsel upon the matter being brought to his attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-12\">On the whole, it does not appear that as the case finally was left to the jury, the plaintiff has any right of exception to the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-13\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
