Writ in the Municipal Court of the City of Boston dated December 23, 1910.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-5\">On appeal to the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Sell, </em>J. The undisputed facts shown by the plaintiff\u2019s evidence are stated in the opinion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-6\">The answers of the defendant\u2019s assistant general manager to interrogatories filed by the plaintiff, after stating that the horse in question on November 14, 1910, the date of the accident, was driven by one Carney who had been in the defendant\u2019s employ for more than nine years, contained the following statement: \u201cThe horse was purchased November 11, 1910, from H. S. Harris Sons, Boston, Mass., and the horse Carney was driving that morning was a green horse, so called; that the horse Carney was then driving had no shoes on its hind feet; that it was not its custom to shoe horses until after they had been worked two or three days.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b169-7\">The defendant offered no evidence and asked the judge to order a verdict for the defendant. The judge refused to do this, and submitted the case to the jury. A part of the judge\u2019s charge was as follows: \u201cI am leaving it to you as a question of fact, as men living in this vicinity with a knowledge of affairs, to say whether or not in your judgment it was negligence on the part -of the defendant to put a horse bought as this one was, to put it into the streets of Boston before they knew whether the horse was reasonably accustomed to cars and would not shy and do harm. That is the question. According to your experience \u25a0of men, according to your knowledge and experience of men, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>was the defendant negligent in putting a horse bought as this horse was, knowing about it what they did know, much or little, on the streets of Boston where it would meet electric cars, until they knew by test or inquiry that that horse was a safe horse to drive on the streets where there were electric cars. If you find that it was a negligent thing to do, according to your knowledge, then you are of the opinion that this act, sending this horse out that morning, might have been a negligent one. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-3\">At the close of the charge the defendant excepted \u201cto that part of the charge that there is evidence of negligence. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b170-4\">The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $50; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b170-5\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlWO\">This is an action of tort to recover damages alleged to have been caused by the negligence of the defendant. The undisputed facts showed that the defendant sent a \u201cgreen horse, \u201d which it had owned three days, through one of the busiest parts of Boston in charge of a competent driver without any knowledge or making any effort to ascertain whether the horse was used to the sounds and sights of a great city. At the noise of the first electric car the horse shied and broke a plate glass window of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">The question of the defendant\u2019s negligence rightly was submitted to the jury. The jury as men of common experience might have inferred that a green horse was one understood to be fresh from the country and entirely unwonted to the distracting conditions of Boston streets, and that the responsible agents of the defendant knew this. To take out such a horse for its first journey under the circumstances here disclosed might have been found to have been wanting in due care.</p>\n<p id=\"AeO\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
