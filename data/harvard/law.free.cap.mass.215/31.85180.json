These are brought by the trustees under a deed of trust called the General Investment Trust. The decision in <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Milton </em>is decisive of the true character of the General Investment Trust. It is a trust and the <em>cestuis que trust </em>are not partners. It follows that the plaintiffs 'are entitled to an abatement in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>petition against the city of Boston, but not in the other petitions.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"b60-4\"><em>J.
