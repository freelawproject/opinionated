The $25,000 was paid and the contractor brought.an action against the owner for the balance of $10,000. The defendant offered to prove that when the second contract in writing was made a portion of the building had not been completed and \u201cthat it was the purpose of the parties to provide that the $10,000 should be paid only when the waterproofing of the sub-basement was completed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\u201d This evidence was excluded by the judge, who ordered a verdict for the plaintiff. <em>Held, </em>that the words of the contract were not plain and that the evidence should have been admitted to show their true meaning as relating to a contract that had not been completed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b217-17\">Contract to recover $10,000 as a balance alleged to be due upon a contract in writing dated March 6, 1909, to construct for the defendants a building on Avon Street in Boston for the sum of $760,000, in accordance with an alleged promise to pay such balance contained in a further contract in writing between the parties dated February 15,1911.

It appeared that the $25,000 mentioned in the contract of February 15, 1911, was paid by the defendants to the plaintiff. The defendants admitted that at the date of the writ no lien or attachment was permitted to be filed or remain on the property of the defendants or any part of the premises for or on account of any labor or materials claimed or other demand against them; that at the date of the writ there was no lien, attachment or incum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>brance caused or suffered by the contractors lawfully existing on the premises; and that the defendants had not been restrained from making any payment by any legal process. The plaintiff then rested.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_D\">Thereupon the defendants offered to prove that on February 15,1911, there was a controversy between the parties as to numerpus matters involving the construction of the building and involving the penalties for delay, and that it was asserted by the defendants (and the assertion was understood by the plaintiff) that a portion of the building had never been completed, namely, the waterproofing of the sub-basement, and that it was the purpose of the parties to provide that the $10,000 should be paid only when the waterproofing of the sub-basement was completed in accordance with the terms of the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Azl\">The judge excluded the evidence offered and ruled that all controversies in relation to the construction of the building existing between the parties on February 15, 1911, were disposed of by that contract and that the plaintiff was entitled to recover on the evidence submitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A_L\">The judge ordered the jury to return a verdict for the plaintiff in the sum of $10,792; and the defendant alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A6uo\"><em>C.

That no lien, attachment, or incumbrance caused or suffered by the contractors then lawfully exist in the premises, and</p>\n<p id=\"A2-\">\u201c2. That the owners be then restrained from making such payment by no legal process; and</p>\n<p id=\"A2k\">\u201c 3. That at such time the final balance on all accounts then due the contractors from the owners in the premises shall have been found and certified accordingly in writing by the architects and the contractors, or found and determined by the award of the arbitrators as hereinafter provided. \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AqT\">It is the defendants\u2019 contention that the payment of the $10,000 specified in the agreement of compromise of February 15, 1911, was made subject to the third clause set forth above as well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>as to the first and second clauses by virtue of the provision in the agreement of compromise that \u201cThe balance [$10,000, was] to be paid as provided by the terms of said contract. \u201d That is to say, the $10,000 was to be paid when the architects certified that the work was \u201c complete and perfect in every respect . . . to the satisfaction of Winslow, Bigelow &amp; Wadsworth, successors to Winslow &amp; Bigelow, of Boston, Architects. \u201d If this be the true meaning of that clause, the controversy which was settled by the agreement of compromise was a controversy as to the amount due or to become due, not a controversy as to the amount then due.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-3\">It is the plaintiff\u2019s contention on the other hand that the controversy which was settled by the agreement of compromise was as to the amount then due and that consequently compliance with the third clause set forth above was dispensed with by the agreement of compromise which fixed the amount then due. That left the first and second clauses as the only provisions of the original contract on which the words in question (namely, \u201cThe balance to be paid as provided by the terms of said contract\u201d) should operate. In that case the balance was to be paid at the time provided by the contract, not as provided by all the terms of said contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">A controversy as to the amount due does not ordinarily arise between a contractor and the owner until the contractor asserts that he has completed his work, and, if a controversy as to the amount due arises when a contractor asserts that he has completed his work, the controversy as to the amount due includes <em>inter alla </em>the question whether the work has been completed. For these reasons, in the absence of evidence as to the circumstances under which the contract was made, we are of opinion that the construction given to the agreement in the Superior Court was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">But we are also of opinion that the wording of the contract is not plain, and that evidence of the circumstances under which it was made is admissible to ascertain the true meaning of it.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Formerly the rule on which the courts went in admitting or excluding such evidence was Lord Bacon\u2019s distinction between a patent and a latent ambiguity. See for example <em>Putnam </em>v. <em>Bond, </em>100 Mass. 58. As to Lord Bacon\u2019s distinction see Wig-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>more, Ev. \u00a7\u00a7 2472 <em>et seq. </em>But in the later cases, if the wording of the contract is such that the circumstances under which it was made would control the meaning to be given to it, the evidence has been admitted. See for example <em>Proctor </em>v. <em>Hartigan, </em>143 Mass. 462; <em>Macdonald </em>v. <em>Dana, </em>154 Mass. 152; <em>Bassett </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>162 Mass. 47. The reason why it is not competent to add to, contradict or vary a written agreement is because where a trade between two parties is struck by their entering into an agreement in writing the trade struck is that stated in the written agreement. <em>Butterick Publishing Co. </em>v. <em>Fisher, </em>203 Mass. 122. If the terms of the trade which are in writing are plain, they cannot be added to, contradicted or varied by paroi. But if they are not plain, the true meaning of them can be ascertained by evidence of the circumstances under which the written contract was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">In the case at bar the defendant offered to prove \u201cthat it was the purpose of the parties to provide that the $10,000 should be paid only when the waterproofing of the sub-basement was completed in accordance with the terms of the contract. <em>\u201d </em>That was in effect an offer to prove that at the date of the contract there was no controversy as to the fact that the contract had not been completed by reason of the failure to finish the waterproofing of the sub-basement. If there was in fact no controversy in respect to the contract not having been completed, this agreement could not be construed to be a settlement of a controversy as to that matter and the construction contended for by the defendants must be adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b221-6\">\n<em>Exceptions sustained.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
