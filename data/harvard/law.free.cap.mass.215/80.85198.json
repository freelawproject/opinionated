Vahey (hereinafter called the defendant) and the Plymouth Stove Foundry Company, upon a promissory note of that company payable to its own order and indorsed to the plaintiff by the company, the defendant Vahey, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Mary A. Gavin (afterwards Fenton), Thomas J. Gavin and Jennie A. Gavin. Writ dated July 10, 1908.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-5\">In the Superior Court the case was tried before <em>Wait, </em>J. The Plymouth Stove Foundry Company was defaulted and judgment was entered against it under Ride 23 of the Superior Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-6\">It appeared that the note, having been indorsed by all the indorsers in blank, had been discounted by the Union Market National Bank.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-7\">The plaintiff contended, and there was evidence to support his contentions, that the Union Market National Bank had sold the note to one Gleason, who had brought the action through the plaintiff as his agent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-8\">The defendant contended and his evidence tended to show \u00bb that Mrs. Fenton, one of the accommodation indorsers of the note,.having borrowed the necessary amount from one Gleason, caused R. W. Sawyer, Jr., Esquire, who was associated with the firm of Brand\u00e9is, Dunbar and Nutter, her attorneys, to pay to the Union Market National Bank the amount due upon the note, the bank by its cashier signing a receipt as follows: \u201cReceived of R. W. Sawyer, Jr., twenty-four hundred ninety-six dollars for which sum we have this day sold and delivered to him a note for $2250, signed by Plymouth Stove Foundry Co. dated Apr. 23, 1906, and maturing Aug. 23, 1906.\u201d The words \u201cPay to the order of John P. Shea\u201d then were written above the indorsements on the back of the note and this action was brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-11\">The defendant also, subject to an exception by the plaintiff, was allowed to introduce evidence tending to show that there had been an agreement among the indorsers at the time of the indorsements that the liability of each should not exceed one third of the amount due on the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b109-12\">In his charge, the judge instructed the jury in part as follows: \u201cIf Mr. Gleason is the owner, the verdict should be for the full amount and interest. If Mrs. Fenton is the real owner, and no agreement with regard to Mr. Vahey\u2019s liability was entered into, or if no such agreement is proved by a fair preponderance of the evidence, then the verdict is for the plaintiff for the full amount and interest. If the agreement testified to by Mr. Vahey was made, then Mrs. Fenton is entitled to recover one half of the amount of the note and interest, if the agreement was that they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>were to share equally. If it was not that, but was made, and Mr. Vahey\u2019s liability was to be one third, and Mrs. Fenton is the owner, then\" she is entitled to recover one third the full amount and interest.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-5\">The Plaintiff excepted to portions of the charge as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-6\">\u201c1. As to so much of the charge as permitted the jury to find a verdict for the plaintiff for less than the full amount of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-7\"><em>\u201c2. </em>As to so much of the charge as permitted the jury to find a verdict as small as one third of the amount of the note.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-8\">\u201c3. As to so much of the charge as leaves it possible for the jury to find a liability of one third of the amount of the note. \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-9\">The jury found for the plaintiff in the sum of $891.62, being one third of the amount of the note with interest. The plaintiff alleged exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-10\"><em>E. F. McClennen, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-11\"><em>G. L. Mayberry, </em>(P. <em>Mansfield </em>with him,) for the defendant Vahey.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b110-12\">Rugg, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqbz\">There was evidence from which it might have been found that the plaintiff was simply the agent of one of the indorsers of the note in taking up the note after maturity and in bringing this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-13\">The defendant was the first of the four indorsers upon the note. The true relation as between themselves of parties liable on a note may be shown by oral evidence in actions between them to determine their respective obligations. It is only in the absence of proof to the contrary that the law fixes the legal effect of their liability on the instrument in accordance with the order of the signatures. <em>Enterprise Brewing Co. </em>v. <em>Canning, </em>210 Mass. 285. When an outside agreement is proved, the rights of the parties as to each other are fixed in accordance with its terms regardless of the order in which the signatures appear on the note. <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Monahan, </em>173 Mass. 122. There was ample evidence to support a finding that the indorsers, of whom there were three at the outset, agreed before signing the original note chat they should share equally whatever they might be required to pay on it, and that later when the wife of one of the three signed a renewal of the original note, making four indorsers, it was agreed that the proportion of liability of the defendant should remain the same. The jury, as shown by the verdict, believed that this agreement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>was made. The plaintiff technically was not entitled to recover on the note. The action should have been by the indorser who has paid for contribution upon the oral agreement. The rulings were sufficiently favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
