The defendant\u2019s claim against the estate of the intestate is barred by the statute of limitations. The defendant having lost his right to collect the debt due him from the intestate now seeks to recoup his loss by taking the amount of it out of income of the property of the intestate\u2019s heirs. And he seeks to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>justify this by suggesting that if he had collected his debt from the intestate\u2019s estate the property which came from her to the heirs would have been diminished by the amount of it. Were that a justification, a debt barred by the statute of limitations always could be collected from the debtor.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">There appears to be an error of $36.23 against the plaintiffs in the amount carried forward as the corrected balance of the second account.
