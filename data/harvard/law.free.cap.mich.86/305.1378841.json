If the effect of the <em>assignment </em>of a promissory note is to make it thereafter non-negotiable, the assignee can bring suit thereon in his own name under the statute; and if such is not the effect, the indorsement of the note in blank by the assignee, and its delivery to a third party, entitles him, as holder, to bring suit in his own name.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b351-9\">Error to Wayne.

The words, \u201cfor value received, I hereby assign all interest in and to this note to Ralph E. Watson,\u201d do not affect or limit the negotiability of the note, and were sufficient, by the subsequent indorsement of Watson, to pass title to Stevens as purchaser for value before maturity, and this action can be maintained in his name; citing Tied. 'Com. Pap. \u00a7 265; Rand. Com. Pap. \u00a7 704; 2 Pars. Notes &amp; Bills, 53; Story, Pr. Notes, \u00a7\u00a7 121, 142; <em>Sears v. Lantz, </em>47 Iowa, 658; <em>Adams v. Blethen, </em>66 Me. 19; <em>Vanzant v. Arnold, </em>31 Ga. 210; <em>Shelby v. Judd, </em>24 Kan. 161; <em>Dixon v. Clayville, </em>44 Md. 573; <em>Richards v. Frankum, </em>9 Car. &amp; P. 221; <em>Leavitt v. Putnam, </em>3 N. Y. 494; Danl. Neg. Inst, \u00a7 699.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b351-20\">2. An indorsement is a separate contract, and the obligations of the parties to it are to be determined according to the law of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>the state where it was made and first became effectual; citing Edw. Bills, \u00a7 381; <em>Everett v. </em>Vendryes, 19 N. Y. 436; <em>Brown v. Finance </em>Co., 31 Fed. Rep. 516; and in Ohio, where this indorsement was made, the holder, Stevens, would be entitled to bring an action in his own name, for a promissory note there is negotiable by delivery, and without indorsement, giving the right of action to the holder; citing <em>Avery v. Latimer, </em>14 Ohio, 542; Rev. Stat. Ohio, \u00a7\u00a7 3171, 3172.</p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-4\">8. Should it be held that this indorsement is on its face restrictive, and destroys the negotiability of the note, then\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AkJk\">a \u2014 Evidence should have been admitted to show that these words were purely accidental, and not intender by the indorsee or indorser to limit such negotiability citing <em>Farwell v. Ensign, </em>66 Mich. 600; <em>Avery v. Miller, </em>76 Ala. 495; <em>Cahal v. Frierson, </em>3 Humph. 411; <em>Slack v. Kirk, </em>67 Penn. St. 380; the sole question being as to their intention at the time of their indorsement; citing <em>Farr v. Ricker, </em>46 Ohio St. 265.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AtK\">b \u2014 But if the indorsement is held to destroy such negotiability, the plaintiff, being the assignee of the non-negotiable instrument, could bring suit in his own name under the statute; citing <em>Bank v. Carson, </em>60 Mich. 432; <em>Draper v. Fletcher, </em>26 Id. 154; Wetmore <em>v. Neuberger, </em>44 Id. 363.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-6\">4. Although the original payee may restrain the negotiability of a promissory note by indorsement or otherwise, yet a subsequent indorsee may give it currency and negotiability from him, and then its negotiable quality recommences; citing <em>Carruth v. Walker, </em>8 Wis. 252; <em>Long v. Smyser, </em>3 Iowa, 266; <em>Seymour v. Van Slyck, </em>8, Wend. 403; <em>Cromwell v. Hewitt, </em>40 N. Y. 491; <em>Perkins v. Catlin, </em>11 Conn. 213; <em>Castle v. Candee, </em>16 Id. 223; <em>Kuntz v. Tempel, </em>48 Mo. 71.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b352-7\"><em>H. B. Spalding (John D. Gonely, </em>of counsel), for defendant Hannan, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-9\">1. It is settled in this State that the assignee of a negotiable instrument must sue in the name of the payee; citing How, Stat. \u00a7 7344; <em>Redmond v. Stansbury, </em>24 Mich. 445, <em>Robinson v. Wilkinson, </em>38 Id. 299; <em>Spinning v. Sullivan, </em>48 Id. 5.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-11\">2. We arrive at the intention of parties by a logical process based on facts capable of preception by the senses of others, and such facts may be given in evidence. But an intention cannot be so perceived, and, until given such expression as may be so perceived, it is for all legal purposes non-existent; citing <em>White v. Corlies, </em>46 N. Y. 467.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b352-13\">3. The intention to which Watson undertook to testify was imma<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>terial, and its oral expression, if such there was, would also be immaterial. The law regards what the parties <em>did, </em>not their unembodied intentions, and an oral expression of an understanding that this writing should be considered an indorsement, if admissible on other'grounds, would be unavailing, for an indorsement must be in writing; citing Danl. Neg. Inst. \u00a7 666; <em>Bank v. Taylor, </em>100 Mass. 18; <em>Haskell v. Mitchell, </em>53 Me. 468.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-4\">4. The evidence at most establishes nothing but a mistake in law, which cannot be shown; citing <em>Holmes v. Hall, </em>8 Mich. 66; <em>Martin v. Hamlin, </em>18 Id. 354; <em>Macklem v. Bacon, </em>57 Id. 342; <em>Tompkins v. Hollister, </em>60 Id. 485; <em>Cook v. Brown, </em>62 Id. 473; <em>Bank v. Taylor, </em>100 Mass. 18.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b353-6\">5. All joint makers are discharged by the discharge of one; citing Danl. Neg. Inst. \u00a7 1294; and the identity of names of the names of the maker and indorser raises a presumption of identity of person, and apprised plaintiff of the fact of payment; citing <em>Goodell v. Hibbard, </em>32 Mich. 47; <em>Campbell v. Wallace, </em>46 Id. 320.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b353-8\">McGrath, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFv\">Defendants Hannan, Coolican, and Watson executed and delivered to defendant Batchelder, in part payment for some land, the following note:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-9\">\u201c$1,300.00. Toledo, 0., Nov. 1, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-10\">\u201cOn or before one year after date we promise to pay to the order of Wm. M. Batchelder thirteen hundred (1,300) dollars, at Toledo, 0., value received, with interest at the rate of 6 per cent, per annum, payable semiannually.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-11\">\u201cWilliam W. Hannan. \u201cJames S. Coolican. \u201cBalph E. Watson.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">On the 4th of November, 1887, Batchelder transferred the note to Watson by written assignment of the note on the back thereof, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-13\">\u201cToledo, Ohio, Nov. 4, 1887.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AUa3\">\u201cEor value received, I here,by assign all interest in and to this note to Balph E. Watson.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b353-14\">\u201cW. M. Batchelder.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-15\">Watson transferred it in turn to the plaintiff, for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>value,'before maturity, by writing his name on the back, and delivering it to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">The declaration was on the common counts, with a copy of the note and the writings on its back appended, with the usual notice. On the trial a count was added, averring an assignment of the note from Watson to plaintiff. Defendants had judgment, and plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">The defendant Hannan upon the trial insisted\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">1. That the plaintiff could not sue in his own name,' but should have brought suit in the name of the payee.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-7\">2. That the note, being transferred to Watson, one of the makers, was paid, and therefore could not again be put in circulation so as to charge defendant Hannan in a suit upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-8\">I do not think that the first point is well taken. If the effect of Batchelder\u2019s indorsement was to make the note thereafter non-negotiable, then the assignment from Watson to plaintiff entitled plaintiff to sue in his own name under the statute, and, if Batchelder\u2019s indorsement did not affect its negotiability,, then Watson\u2019s indorsement entitled plaintiff, as holder of the note, to sue in his own name.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-9\">The second point raised is well taken. Watson, while the note was in his possession under the assignment or indorsement to him, could not have brought suit, except for contribution, and he could not, by assignment or indorsement, convey any greater .right than he himself had. His name appearing as one of the makers was sufficient notice to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">The judgment below is affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-11\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
