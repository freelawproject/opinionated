The-declaration is set out in the record, and describes the-highway and encroachment thereon. The highway is-described as beginning at the corner of sections 10, 11, 14, and 15, in said township, and thence north along the-section line to the Sand Beach and Sebewaing State road, while the encroachment is described as commencing at, these section corners, and extending south twelve rods; that is, that the defendant maintained a fence south of' the point where the highway is described as commencing. This is a fatal defect, and no recovery should have been permitted in the court below.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">The judgment of the court below must be vacated, and judgment entered for defendant in this Court for costs, of both courts.</p>\n<judges id=\"b244-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
