If it appears that the plaintiff\u2019s own negligence contributed to her injury, she cannot recover; citing <em>Drew v. The Chesapeake, 2 </em>Doug. 33; <em>Railroad Co. v. Van Steinburg, 17 </em>Mich. 99; <em>Railroad Co. v. Miller, </em>25 Id. 274; <em>Daniels v. Clegg, </em>28 Id. 32; and, the facts touching her negligence being undisputed, it became a question of law for the court; citing <em>Mynning v. Railroad Co., </em>67 Mich. 677; <em>Haas v. Railroad Co., </em>47 Id. 401.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b390-20\"><em>T. C. Carpenter {T. R. Sherwood, </em>of counsel), for plaintiff, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-22\">1. Defendant was organized by special act of the Legislature in 1855, and reorganized under the general law of 1875 for the incorporation of villages, of which acts the Court will take notice, and under which the village council had power to establish sidewalks in public streets, and to control the same, and to require them to be constructed, and the ordinances of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>the village in force at the time of such reincorporation were adopted by the 1875 act. It therefore appears that the law applied to all walks then in the village, if erected in streets, no matter when or by whom built, and that from the time the act of 1875 took effect such walks should have been kept in repair by defendant.</p>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-4\">2. The question of the negligence of the parties was for the jury. The time and place of the injury, and its extent, and the defect in the walk, were all proved, and that it had existed for at least 14 months; citing <em>Lowell v. </em>Watertown, 58 Mich. 568; <em>Dundas v. Lansing, </em>75 Id. 499; <em>Tice v. Bay City, </em>78 Id. 209.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ANa\">See <em>Lonibar v. East Tawas, </em>86 Mich. 15 (head-note 5), and cases cited in foot-note.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b391-10\"> See <em>Roux v.

The plaintiff was on her way to see her daughter. She testified that she knew of the defect in the walk, and had passed and avoided it frequently. She testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b391-7\"><em>\u201cI </em>am generally in the habit of walking very quickly, but this evening, I don\u2019t know, I was walking quite slowly, and thinking I must hurry home as quick as I could get through, and all of a sudden I thought I must be careful of this sidewalk,-^-I must be near the broken sidewalk, \u2014 and the thought wasn\u2019t any sooner in my head than my foot slipped into the hole. I had my shawl over my head, and my hands were wound in this way. My hat was up stairs, and I had my shawl in this way, and my arms were rolled up in it tight around me. It was chilly, and that was one reason why my arms were foul, as to helping myself in this position. When my foot went down I gave myself a sudden jerk, and fell over. * * * I was thinking I must be near the broken sidewalk at the time, and all of a sudden my foot went out. I was very careful. * * * I was always careful about going over there. I generally walked on one side, and I didn\u2019t think I was so close to it as I was at the time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>She further stated that the night was cloudy, and the moon -obscured.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">Defendant\u2019s counsel requested the court to instruct the jury as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff\u2019s own negligence forbids her recovery. She knew of the defect, if it existed, had passed it many times, and generally passed it by walking by on the east half of the walk, and could have done so the evening she claims to have been injured, but, instead of doing so, walked on the inside quite near the fence, with a shawl over her head, with her arms folded in it, so that she was unable to use them in any way for her protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-6\">\u201cIt has not been established by sufficient evidence that the sidewalk in question was put down by the village authorities or authorized' by them, or that they were in any way responsible for the condition of the walk, and therefore plaintiff cannot recover.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-7\">These instructions were properly refused. The question of contributory negligence of plaintiff was fairly and properly submitted to the jury. This Court has frequently held that the knowledge of the existence'of a defect is not conclusive evidence of plaintiff\u2019s negligence. It is not necessary to show, in this class of cases, that the municipality either constructed or ordered the construction of the walk in question. The statute fixes defendant\u2019s responsibility, and makes it its duty to see that its walks are in a condition reasonably safe for travel.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-8\">The judgment will be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b392-9\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
