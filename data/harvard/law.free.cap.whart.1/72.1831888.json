Defendant\u201d (meaning the plaintiff,) \u201c pleads payment and no rent in arrear, and replies that he is not liable, to pay the sum of twenty-five pounds sterling, per year, to any one, and that he is liable to pay no more than the balance of the said sum, after the taxes upon the land and rent-charge are first deducted, and that the plaintiffs (meaning the defendants) in said suit, have no right to recover any thing of him.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AYc\">On the 6th of November, 1834, the cause came on for trial, when the jury was sworn as between Samuel D.

And in like manner, the like proceedings shall be renewed at the expiration of every term of one hundred and twenty-one years thereafter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-5\">By force and virtue of divers conveyances and assurances in law, and of an act of assembly, passed the 31st of March, 1792, annexing the Loganian Library to the Library Company of Philadelphia, the land above described, charged with the above mentioned rent, became vested in Samuel D. Ingham, the defendant in error, and the rent so charged became vested in the Library Company of Philadelphia, in trust for the use of the Loganian Library, the plaintiffs in error.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-6\">On the 1st of March, 1833, one year\u2019s rent, amounting to twenty-five pounds sterling, or one hundred and eleven dollars and eleven cents, became due; and on the 1st of August, 1833, Mr. Ingham paid the sum of eighty-three dollars and eleven cents, T*751 011 accoun* *\u00b0f S\u00a3dd rent charge, retaining a balance L J of twenty-eight dollars, which sum he alleged was the proportion for which the rent was liable for taxes, and therefore he claimed a right to deduct it. This balance was the matter in dispute, the Library Company contending that the said rent was not chargeable with so large a proportion of taxes, the same having been estimated above its par value. The Library Company therefore distrained for the rent alleged to be in arrear, and Mr. Ingham replevied the goods distrained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b84-7\">The question relative to the par value of this rent-charge was brought before the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, for their opinion, by a petition presented by the Library Company to September term, 1829, and an appeal from the triennial assessment, under a special act of assembly, passed the 14th of April, 1828.

Ingham, Richard Randolph, and John Bye: The Court are of opinion and accordingly decree, that the equitable and just valuation of the ground rent of twenty-five pounds sterling, issuing out of the lands granted by James Logan to Jonathan Ingham, on .the 1st day of May, 1747, is eighteen hundred and fifty dollars; and that the equitable and just valuation of the ground rent of ten pounds sterling, issuing out of the lands granted on the 26th day of May, 1747, by James Logan to Jacob Dean, is seven hundred and forty dollars, and no more; and accordingly do adjudge, order and decree that the sum to be levied and assessed on the said ground rent of twenty-five pounds sterling, for county rates and levies, shall be three dollars and seventy cents; and that the sum to be levied and assessed on the said ground rent of ten pounds sterling for county rates and levies, shall be one dollar and fifty-eight cents, the same being at the rate of twenty cents of tax to the one hundred dollars of value; and the Court do further order *and adjudge, that the County of Bucks shall pay the costs of the said appeal.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-12\">Prior to swearing the jury in the present cause, the following plea to the jurisdiction of the court was filed:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b85-13\">\u201cAnd the said defendant,\u201d (Sands, the constable,) \u201cby his attorney, further says, that the trial of the suit aforesaid, is not subject to the jurisdiction of the president judge of the district of which the County of Bucks is a part, but that it is subject to the jurisdiction of a special court, appointed, and to be held by the president of another district; for that the said president judge of the said County of Bucks has been concerned as counsel, \u201c <em>touching the same </em>subject-matter,\u201d in a former suit' or case, to wit, in the matter of the petition and appeal of the Library Company of Philadelphia, to September term, 1829, in this court; which said suit or case and proceeding, the said president judge of the said court certified to a special court for argument and decision; and the said defendant, by his attorney, and on behalf of the Library Company of Philadelphia, in trust for the Loganian Library, respectfully requests that the suit aforesaid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>may be certified to tbe Special Court, to \u2022 be held in the said county, for trial.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-5\">The court overruled the above plea, in reference to which, the president judge delivered the following opinion:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\"><em>\u201c </em>The ground of this request is, that the president judge has been concerned as counsel, <em>\u201ctouching the same subject-matter,\" </em>in a former suit, to wit, in the matter of the petition and appeal of the Library Company of Philadelphia, in this court, to September term, 1829.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-7\">\u201c The act of assembly provides, that whenever the president judge has been concerned as counsel'for either of the parties in any suit instituted in the Court of Common Pleas, <em>touching the same </em>subject-matter, then such suit shall be subject to the jurisdiction of a Special Court. The counsel for the Library Company supposes that if the subject-matter be the same, the case is subject to the jurisdiction of the Special Court, although the parties may be different, and has drawn his plea with a view to such a case. I differ with him. I think the parties and subject matter must be the same; and therefore entertain jurisdiction of the cause, and overrule the plea.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-8\">\u201cI have heretofore been inclined to send to the Special Court all cases, wherein either party supposed, I had been in any Arise connected, either as to party, or subject-matter, or question; but I am now disposed to confine the removal strictly to cases where it is ^required to be done by the act of assembly. It is now nearly five years since I was appointed president .judge of this district; and a considerable part of the business certified to the Special Court remains undisposed of, and probably some of it will yet remain long undetermined. The removal of a case to that court, I therefore consider as an injury to one of the parties, which I have no right to inflict unless the law requires me to do so.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-9\">To this opinion, exception was taken by the counsel of the Library Company.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-10\">In the course of the trial, the counsel of the plaintiff below, called as a witness, Jonathan Ely, Avho testified as follows: \u2014 \u201c I live in Solebury township, where this property is situated. I have been the assessor of that township, and am at this time. I was the assessor at the last triennial assessment in 1881. I was the assessor in 1830. Previous to the last triennial assessment, it Ayas assessed separately, a portion of it was assessed to the tenants, and a part to the company; in 1831, it was assessed to the tenants, the whole to Mr. Ingham, and Mr. Randolph. In 1828 to 1831, the valuation put upon that part belonging to the Loganian Library, was assessed at eight thousand eight hundred and sixtytAYO dollars. In 1831, the AYhole AYas assessed to Mr. Ingham and</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>Mr. Randolph, and valued at In 1825, it was valued at In 1822, it was valued at In 1819, it was valued at In 1816, it was valued at In 1815, it was valued at</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-6\">$34080, on the 396 A., 120 P. 8730,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-7\">10611, the same,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-8\">11790,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-9\">4000.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-10\">The counsel of the plaintiff below, then propounded to the witness the following question: \u201cAre you acquainted with the Loganian interest in the premises; and what value would you put upon it?\u201d The question was objected to by the counsel for the Library Company, but the court overruled the objection, and exception was taken to their opinion. The witness then proceeded as follows: \u2014 \u201c It would be a very difficult matter to say what it is worth, but in assessing, we put the bona fide value that it would sell for. I should suppose it would bring four thousand dollars \u2014 the valuation in 1815. I have reason to believe it would sell for four thousand dollars, if it was put up at market. I did not assess the property before 1831, at the triennial assessment. There has been a barn built on it since my recollection. I heard Mr. Ingham say, he was willing to give four thousand dollars for it \u2014 have had frequent conversations on the subject \u2014 I think that is a pretty good reason. From what I know of the property, independent of that, I should suppose it was ^somewhere about the valuation. That is all the reason r*&gt;ro-| I have for supposing it would bring four thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b87-11\">The counsel for the plaintiff below, then called Dr. John Wilson, who testified as follows: \u2014 \u201c It is a subject I have thought of, being agent for the Library Company for some years, and I have frequently talked with the members of that company, with respect to the sale of their interest in it. I have never fixed with them any valuation, although I have advised them to sell. I have been acquainted with what the tenants were willing to give Richard Randolph; he informed me that they were willing to give four thousand dollars, including Samuel D. Ingham, and himself; he, Randolph, holds a part of it. I should have advised the Library Company to accept the four thousand dollars. It had been on my mind to advise them to accept it. I was agent for that company from 1817-18, till 1826. I should think that a fair valuation, as near as my judgment would establish a value. I do not know the amount of the rent; the property, exclusive of the mills, rented for six hundred dollars, Ingham\u2019s part, in 1829-30. I have heard it said the paper mill rented for eleven hundred dollars a year. Randolph\u2019s property,'until a year or two, was to the shares; the mill rented by Randolph, is for six hundred dollars a year; the land is worked to the shares; there was a large barn on Ingham\u2019s part, and a grist mill and oil mill <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>on Randolph\u2019s part. During many years that I was agent for the company, I have had many conversations with Randolph on the subject; cannot recollect the time. I don\u2019t know that he ever made an offer of any specific sum though he had frequent interviews with the company on the subject. I don\u2019t recollect that he informed me he offered any specific sum to them. He, Dr. Park, always told me he didn\u2019t think the company were prepared, generally, to sell. I had frequent conversations, with Samuel Coats, the former treasurer and secretary of the company.\u201d ' The counsel for the plaintiff below, then gave in evidence a receipt, dated August 1st, 1833, from Thomas Sands to Samuel D. Ingham, for eighty-three dollars eleven cents, and on account of a certain ground rent for the year, ending March 1st, 1833, for Samuel D. Ingham and Richard Randolph; and also one other receipt, dated December 9th, 1833, for sixty-nine dollars ninety-two cents, Thomas Sands to Samuel D. Ingham, in full for county and state tax, including the tax on the Loganian ground rent; and also one other receipt, dated August 1st, 1833, Thomas Sands to Richard Randolph, for two dollars fifty-four cents, balance of county tax for 1832, also for eighty-five cents in\u2018full, of balance of state tax, for the year 1832; and also one other receipt, dated August 1st, 1832, Thomas Sands to Richard Randolph, for two dollars fifty-four cents, for road tax for the year 1832.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-5\">1*791 *The counsel for the plaintiff below, also gave in eviL -1 dence certain duplicates, showing that in the year 1833, the state tax upon the land and ground rent included, amounting to sixteen dollars thirty-six cents, at the rate of one mill to the dollar, upon the land occupied by Samuel D. Ingham, exclusive of the tax upon the land occupied by Richard Randolph; that the land and ground rent were valued at twelve thousand three hundred and sixty dollars, and the paper mill at four thousand dollars, amounting in the whole to sixteen thousand three hundred and sixty dollars, which, at the rate of thirty cents to every hundred dollars of value, made the county tax $49 08</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-6\">The state tax at one mill to the dollar, was 16 36</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-7\">The road tax for that year, the same as the county tax 49 08</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b88-8\">Making upon the part occupied by S.

I gave him a receipt. Cooper was the supervisor. The road tax and' county tax were the same that year; last season they were changed. I made Ingham\u2019s distress at the house and barn. I distrained some hay, I forget whether any thing else, in the east end of the barn.. Didn\u2019t make any distress upon the part occupied by Richard Randolph. I cannot say whether the money, eighty-three dollars eleven cents, was paid before the distress. The warrant was issued before the payment was made. My impression is, that the rent was paid at the time I went to the house to make the distress.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-6\">After the evidence for the plaintiff was closed, the counsel for the defendants below, offered in evidence, the petition and appeal of the Library Company, for the use, &amp;c. in the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks County, to September Term, 1829, from the triennial assessment of taxes, and the decree of the Special Court thereupon. The evidence was objected to by the counsel for the *plaintiff below, and rejected by the court; who signed a ' r*on-| bill of exceptions. *- -*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-7\">The evidence in the cause being closed, it was contended on the part of the plaintiff, that, as he had paid eighty-three dollars eleven cents, on account of the rent charge, he had a right to defalk, and retain the balance of twenty-eight dollars, for the proportion of taxes paid by him to the collector, which ought to be borne by the rent charge; alleging that the proportion accruing upon the rent charge, amounted to twenty-eight dollars. He also contended that the Library Company were bound to allow and pay the taxes accruing not only upon the rent charge, but also on the land on which it was charged, and that he was entitled to defalk and retain out of the said rent, the whole amount of taxes, as well upon the land as upon the rent charge. These propositions were denied by the counsel for the Library Company ; who submitted certain propositions to the court, on which he requested them to instruct the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-8\">The president Judge delivered to the jury the following charge:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b89-9\">\u201c The Library Company claim from Samuel D. Ingham, one hundred and eleven dollars eleven cents, or twenty-five pounds sterling, as a ground rent due from him to them. It is proved and admitted, that Mr. Ingham has paid to the Library Company, on account of this claim, the sum of eighty-three dollars eleven cents; and he further contends that he has paid to the proper collector of taxes, the taxes upon the land, and upon the ground rent, the amount and more of the balance claimed, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>that he is entitled to defalk it out of the rent claimed of him. He claims that under the sixth section of the act of the 3d April, 1806, directing the mode of selling unseated lands for taxes, and. the eighth section of the road law of the 6th April, 1802, he is entitled to pay all taxes which may be assessed on the land, and ground rent, and defalk the amount from the rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-5\">\u25a0 The Library Company deny that the acts of assembly so relied upon, apply to cases of ground rent. I can see no reason why their provisions should not be applied to cases of ground rent, as well as to any other rent. The terms of the law are general, and the reasons for such provisions will apply equally to all cases.-</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-6\">The next question is, who is properly chargeable with the taxes ? The Library Company admit that they are chargeable with the taxes on the ground rent, but aver that Mr. Ingham must pay the taxes on the land. I believe that in the City and County of Philadelphia, the practice always has been to have a clause in the ground rent deed, providing for the payment by the tenant, of all taxes which may be assessed, as well upon the land, 1 as uPon *rent. I believe that the opinion in PennsylL -* vania at the bar, is uniform, that the landlord is bound to pay the taxes, unless there be some- agreement to the contrary, between him and his tenant. I am unable to distinguish this case, in this particular, from any other between landlord and tenant, and I therefore say, that as there is no provision in the deed, nor any other evidence of a contract, by which the tenant agreed to pay the taxes, they must be paid by the landlord.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-7\">. The tenant, therefore, has a right to defalk, as well the taxes upon the land, as upon the ground rent, out of the rent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\">The only remaining question, is the value of the ground rent. That must be estimated by what it will fairly sell for in the market, for ready money, and is a question of fact for you to decide. If you believe the witnesses, it would bring in the market four thousand dollars.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-9\">The following is a statement of the points submitted to the court, and the answers of the president to them, viz.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-10\">1. That the Library Company of Philadelphia, in trust, for the use of the Loganian Library, were entitled to receive from the plaintiff on the 1st of March, 1833, the amount of the rent charge for one year, ending at that time, charged upon the plaintiff\u2019s land, by virtue of the deed from James Logan to Jonathan Ingham, and by virtue of the other assurances given in evidence in the cause, to wit, the sum of twenty-five pounds sterling.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-11\">Answer. <em>They were so entitled, unless the jplaintiff had a right to defalk the taxes on the land, or ground rent.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-12\">2.

The plea to the jurisdiction of the president judge ought not to have been overruled. The intention of the act of 23d of March, 1813, was to prevent the opinions and prejudices of counsel interfering with the administration of justice. It is not necessary that the parties should be the same on the record. If the person for whom the judge was counsel, was a party <em>in interest, </em>it is sufficient. In this case, there is no doubt that the defendant in error was the real party in interest, and that <em>\u201c </em>the subject matter\u201d was the same. The act of the 14th April, 1834, section 37, chapter 4, is decisive upon the point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-11\">2. The judge erred in supposing 'that any taxes were due from the Library Company. By the act of 1799, relating to <em>\u201c </em>County rates and levies,\u201d ground rents are treated as a species of property, distinct from the land out of which they issue; and so they have always been considered. By that act they were first made taxable; and the obvious intention was to create a new source of revenue; not to divide the burthen between the owner of the ground rent and the owner of the land. No tax can be demanded, unless all the steps mentioned in the act of 1799 have been previously taken; and in this case none of those requisites appear to have been attended to in respect to the ground rent. The valuation by the assessors is material. <em>Respublica </em>v. <em>Deaves, </em>(3 Yeates, 465.) If the result of this case should deprive the county of the tax on these ground rents, for the time being, we are not to blame, having always been ready to pay the tax properly assessed on the ground rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-12\">3. If the ground rent had been duly assessed, the defendants in error had no right to deduct the amount of the tax from the arrears of rent. His claim to do so rests upon two acts of assembly, which relate to matter of a different description, (Acts of 6th April, 1802, s. 8, and 3d April, 1804, s. 6.) Both of these acts refer to tenants <em>for years, </em>and have no application to a rent, payable out of the fee, like the present.</p>\n<p data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>4. The standard by which the value of the ground rent was estimated, was uncertain and inequitable. That the opinions of witnesses are no evidence, except in certain cases of science and trade, is well settled. 1 Phillip\u2019s Evid. 226. There are two standards, either of which might have been taken. \u2014 1. The value of money, or 2d. That adopted by the Special Court. Whatever may be the value of the increased ground rent in 1861, it will be <em>then </em>properly assessed, and the company, or the owner of it, will be bound to pay a tax in proportion to that value. But it would be obviously unjust to take that future value as the basis of present assessment. The decree of the Special Court was an express adjudication upon the same subject matter, and ought to have been followed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">5. The doctrine that the owner of a ground rent is bound to pay *the taxes upon <em>the land, </em>out of which the rent issues, r^o^-i is clearly untenable. A ground rent is a rent reserved upon a grant in fee. It differs materially from a rent reserved upon a lease for years, which is always for a less term than the lessor has in the premises. 3 Cruise Dig. Tit. 32, s. 1. The grantor has an estate in fee upon a condition subsequent. Litt. Sec. 325; Co. Litt. 201. The rent has all the qualities of real estate. <em>Hurst </em>v. <em>Lithgow, </em>(2 Yeates, 24;) <em>Wilder </em>v. <em>Foster, </em>(2 Penn. Rep. 26.) If this doctrine were established, the consequences would be ruinous to the owners of this species of property. In fact, the point has been decided by this court, <em>(Franciscus </em>v. <em>Reigart, </em>Harrisburgh, 1835, <em>MS.)</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b93-7\"><em>Mr. W.

A judge is not to be excluded from sitting, because he has fixed views upon any principle of law. The question is, whether he had been concerned for one of the <em>parties</em>. Now, Mr. Ingham was not a party to the appeal. The parties really and nominally were the County Commissioners and the Library Company. Besides, this was a question addressed to the discretion of the judge, and not examinable in a Court of Error. <em>Ellmaker </em>v. <em>Buckley, </em>(16 S. &amp; R. 72.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-9\">2, 3. A ground rent in Pennsylvania, means a rent of inheritance. In this case, the rent was reserved for <em>years, </em>though the land was conveyed in fee. It was therefore a chattel interest for the first hundred years, though the company claim an interest in the land beyond the present rent. The act of 1799, does not say that the rent must be assessed <em>separately. </em>In the act of 1724, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>\u201clands and tenements\u201d were spoken of generally, as subjects of taxation.- (Hall &amp; Sellers\u2019 Laws, 132.) In England, the original subsidies were on the rental. (1 Com. Dig. tit. Sewers, F. 5 &amp; E. 2.) The visible owner of property must be assessed. <em>Shaeffer </em>v. <em>M'Kabe, </em>(2 Watts, 422.) Here the tax was laid upon the -whole \u2014 rent and land \u2014 and Mr. Ingham, having paid more than his proportion, ought to be allowed to deduct the excess. Such is the rule in England, in the case of the land tax. (Platt on Covenants, 211; Comyn on Land. &amp; Ten. 187.) The acts of assembly expressly authorizes a tenant to deduct the tax from his rent. (Act of 1799, s. 25, and Act of 1804.) In 4 Term Rep. 511, it was held that to an avowry for rent, the tenant might plead payment of a ground rent to the original landlord.</p>\n<p data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-6\">4. The real question here is, what is the true standard of the value of the ground rent. The judge of the Common Pleas said, that the jury were to consider what it would fairly sell for in the market for ready money. Now this is almost literally according to the *act of 1799, (s. 8.) There cannot be two stand-L 1 ards of value, each absolutely certain, as was asserted on the other side. The value of money varies with the varying situation of the country and other circumstances. There is no instance of the assessment of ground rents at six per cent. The decree of 1829, cannot control subsequent assessments. The law requires assessments to be made triennially. If the par value of the ground rent is the true standard, why did Judge King go beyond the sixteen years and two-thirds purchase ? The. true measure is the price the company Ayould be willing now to take, looking at the certain future increase.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-8\">5. This is not the case of an ordinary ground rent, if it can be called by that name. The Library Company have an interest in the land beyond the rent. It is more like a rent for a long term of years. If rent be reserved to a man and his <em>heirs </em>upon a lease for years, the executor cannot take. Gilbert on Rents, 66. The case of <em>Darragh </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em>(Cro. Eliz. 645,) shows that on the death of Mr. Logan this rent went to his Executors.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-9\">This was a <em>rent-seek, </em>not a <em>rent-charge. </em>Gilbert on Rents, 14, 15; Co. Litt. 143, s. 216, 217; 3 Cruise Dig. 188. The Stat. 4 Geo. 2, c. 38, s. 5, which extends the remedy by distress to <em>rents-seck, </em>is not in force in this state. [Kennedy, J.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AIN\">The only principle that could produce an effect on the event, has already been determined in <em>Franciscus </em>v. <em>Reigart; </em>where it was held that the conditional owner of the fee cannot defalcate taxes assessed on the land. What is there in this case besides ? It is not pretended that there was a separate assessment on the ground rent; and if there had been, what concern would the occupant have had with it ? The act of the 3d of April, 1804, subjects the tenant to taxes assessed on the land, and empowers him to recover it from his landlord by action or defalcation; but the tax on ground rent is chargeable on a distinct species of property. Besides, though the owner of it is usually called the ground landlord, the expression is evidently an inaccurate one. Subinfeudation no more exists here than it does in England, since- the statute of <em>quia emptores; </em>and there is nothing like tenure, where the rent is not incident to the reversion. Now, such a rent as the present, is charged on the land, the instant the ground landlord parts with the fee, leaving in him but a condition of re-entry; and even the reservation of that may be omitted. And it may, by force of *the deed, be r*oe-i charged on land of which the ground landlord never was *- -\u25a0 the owner. The clause in the act above quoted, has respect to taxes, for which the tenant is liable by his position - as the occupant, but for which he is not liable by any agreement with his landlord. His case would call for a liberal construction, if he were exposed to payment of the ground rent taxes; but by no statute whatever is his person or chattels chargeable with any burthen, that is not assessed specifically on the land. The statute has expressly subjected ground rents to taxation, <em>eo nomine ; </em>but it has provided no remedy to enforce payment by distress on the land from which it issues; and the tax is consequently to be collected as a tax on land was previously to be collected \u2014 by recourse to the person or chattels of the owner. It is undoubtedly true, that he, like the owner of land when the tenant was irresponsible, may be beyond the reach of the collector. Taking for granted, however, that this species of property, unlike a chattel interest which attends the person of the owner, is to be taxed, but in the county where the land lies, the right of taxing it not being determinable by the domicil, yet, as the statute which makes the tenant liable for taxes assessed on the land, has not made him liable for taxes -on quit rents issuing out of the land, we cannot supply what we might suppose to be the effect of an oversight. Nor do we conceive that the defect, if there be one, is of great magnitude, as it is the practice in the country to assess a full tax on the land, without regard to incumbrances, and to overlook the quit rents altogether; in consequence of which, an inconvenience from want of means within, in the county, has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>not been so striking as to challenge legislative inquiry. But if that were otherwise, to provide such means would exceed our power.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The proposition also asserted here, that separate taxes, on separate subjects of taxation, separately owned by distinct persons, maybe indiscriminately assessed on the same subject matter, leaving the owners to settle their respective proportions of what would thus be made a common burthen, is still more extravagant. To admit that a tax on the quit rent may be assessed conjointly with that on the land,, would deprive the rent-holder of his separate right of appeal, which, by a particular legislative provision, lies in this case to the Common Pleas. There was in fact and in law, therefore, no assessment on the quit rent, and no duty owing for it; but if that were otherwise, it would not be material to inquire whether there was error in the method adopted to ascertain the measure of its relative proportion; for, whether it were assessed jointly or separately, the occupant could not, by voluntary payment, make himself a creditor of the person properly chargeable with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">But the exception to the jurisdiction is not sustained. We have already intimated that an objection to competency, under the act for the establishment of Special Courts, must be addressed to the *discretion of the judge himself; and this is conformably to the principle of the common law, which exempts a judge from challenge. Nor can there be danger in leaving the matter to him. A sense of duty in keeping his administration not only pure but unsuspected; and the reprobation that would ensue an evident desire to favour a party by retaining the cause, must always incline him to surrender it where he may do so by the most comprehensive construction. Into the supposed relations of the parties, therefore, we are forbidden to inquire; and we are bound to suppose that the legal discretion of the judge, in holding himself exempt from the bias incident to the imputed causes of it, has been soundly exercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">Judgment reversed and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">Cited, by Counsel, 5 Wharton, 315; 2 Barr, 169.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-10\">Cited by the Court, 9 Casey, 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-11\">See also, 1 Barr, 351.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
