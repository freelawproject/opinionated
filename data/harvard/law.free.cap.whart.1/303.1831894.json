In trespass for breaking the plaintiff\u2019s close, and carrying away his goods, evidence of the value of the goods is admissible on the part of the plaintiff, although he may have brought <em>replevin </em>for the same goods, if the defendant has pleaded property in that action, and it is still depending ; and <em>a fortiori, </em>if it has been discontinued, though such discontinuance was after the commencement of the trial of the action of trespass.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b321-14\">2. If a paper purporting to be a receipt, is rejected by the Court, but after-wards admitted on proof of its authenticity by the person signing it, the rejection in the first instance cannot be assigned for error, on the ground that it compelled the party offering it, to call as a witness the person <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>signing it, who was the witness of the other party, and thus gave the other party the benefit of the cross-examination.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b322-6\">3.

I can\u2019t say whether he planted the willows. It was a willow lot long back. It *always went by the name of Daniel r*onc-i Lafferty\u2019s Garden, since I knew it; I have known him L J cut the willows on it. He keeps a tavern on the banks of the Schuylkill, farms, and last season followed basket-making. I went there to help Peeling cut willows down in April, 1831. We had cut down all but some which were in the water, which was cold, and we thought we would leave them for a warm day. We had tied up 18 or 20 bundles. Lafferty came and asked by whose authority we cut. Peeling said, by Mr. Krider\u2019s. Lafferty said he considered them his property, and forbad Peeling-taking them away. Peeling said if that was the case, he would quit them and let them be. We left the garden and all went away together. Lafferty, Peeling, Wm. Hoffner, a man named <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>Billy, myself, and I think one or two of Peeling\u2019s men, all went with intention to help Peeling cut down willows. Peeling is a basket-maker, lives near the Buck. Lafferty wished him to leave them till Monday morning, he would show him something. Can\u2019t say how many bundles were cut, as we did not tie them up. I am a basket maker. It Avas the proper season for cutting Avillows. We had tied 18 or 20 bundles, not a quarter of them. I have bought willows sometimes, can\u2019t say for how much. I remember its being called Lafferty\u2019s Garden ten or twelve years ago.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-6\">The plaintiff then called a witness to prove the value of the willows cut by the- defendant\u2019s order; but the defendant\u2019s counsel objected to any evidence being given of their value, on the ground that an action of replevin had, previously to bringing this suit, been instituted by Lafferty against Peeling, in the Court of Common Pleas; wherein the defendant had claimed property and given a property bond to the sheriff. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel, however, produced a certificate from the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, dated on the day of the trial, setting forth that the action of replevin had been discontinued on that day. The Judge admitted the evidence, and the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-7\">On his part, the defendant gave in evidence the sheriff\u2019s deed, bearing date the 20th of September, 1880, and acknoAvledged on the 24th of the same month, conveying to him in fee <em>(inter alia) </em>the said one acre lot. He then called Richard Peltz a witness, who testified as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-8\">\u201cI am the son-in-law of the late John Lentz, and the acting executor of his Avill. I am acquainted with the two tracts of land mentioned in the sheriff\u2019s deed. It includes the acre of willow ground. The Avhole property in the deed Avas during the life of John Lentz, senior, let by him to his son John Lentz, junior. John Lentz, junior, held the property as tenant from March 1817, till the sale to Krider. After the death of his father, John Lentz paid the rent to me as acting executor. I r*80fl never knew as executor, any one *as tenant of the *- -* property but John Lentz. No one but John Lentz paid me the rent. I gave him receipts for the whole rent due the heirs, and took receipts from him for his portion of what might be due, exchanging the balance of money which might be due from one to the other. I settled yearly with him. John Lentz is also an executor. The executors of John Lentz, sen., are, Philip Peltz, John Lentz and myself. The lease was originally, as I understood, from old John Lentz, for his son to take possession, and rent to commence on the first of March, 1817. He had possession before, but the rent to commence then; John had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>possession before 181T; but I can\u2019t say he had particularly possession of that one acre lot, but his father gave him permission to do as he pleased as tenant. John Lentz, jr. knew Lafferty had a lease of the acre lot, and was in possession, at the time he' took the farm of his father. I do not know that Lafferty was in the habit of settling and paying rent to John Lentz as executor. I knew that Lafferty had taken that acre of land from John Lentz deceased, and had planted willows in <em>it; </em>and I knew that in the arrangement between John Lentz and his father, he, John Lentz, jr., was to receive the rent from Lafferty for his own private use. I knew this from the father and son. The son was to receive the rent from Lafferty for his own private use. The lot was a grass lot or meadow before Lafferty took it. Lafferty occupied it from the date of his lease 24th February, 1816, till the time of the sale by the sheriff.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-6\">Philip Peltz, another witness produced by the defendant, testified that he was one of the executors of Lentz, that he never received any rent from Lafferty or any other person, and as executor, he did not know Lafferty as tenant: that, however, he knew that Lafferty held the willow garden from the date of the lease, sixteen or seventeen years, till the property was sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-7\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then offered in evidence (having proved the hand-writing,) a paper signed' \u201c John Lentz,\u201d dated the 14th of September, 1830, which was alleged to be an acknowledgment of the receipt of the sum of $ 10, as a consideration for delivering immediate possession of the land purchased by the latter at the sheriff\u2019s sale. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of the paper, and the Judge refused to permit it to be read; to which also the defendant excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then called John Lentz, who testified that the receipt was signed by him and that Lafferty had no notice of the arrangement, to his knowledge. On his cross-examination, he was asked \u201cwhat the money mentioned in the receipt was paid for,\u201d to which question the defendant\u2019s counsel objected; but the Judge *permitted it to be put, and r*qnyi another exception was taken. The witness, in answer *- to the question testified as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-9\">\u201c The money was paid for possession of the premises I occupied, with the exception of the turnip patch. It was not paid for the possession of the willow lot; I never considered it in my possession. Previously to Lafferty\u2019s taking the lot, I had offered my father a price for the farm including that lot. He did not think proper to take my offer, and afterwards let the lot to Lafferty for willows. This was upwards of a year before my father and I had agreed. I offered to pay my father seven hundred dollars a year. He refused, but after letting the willow <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>lot he accepted the seven hundred dollars, and I considered for that reason I was to receive the rent for the plaintiff\u2019s lot. He never let me the willow lot. I knew it was let to plaintiff, and my father knew that I knew it. Lafferty got the lot for fifteen dollars a year. My original offer of seven hundred dollars included the willow lot and all, and for that reason I considered myself entitled to receive the rent for the willows. My father died in September afterwards. He never let me the willow lot. My father agreed I should have the place. Nothing was said between him and me about the willow lot. No objections were made to my receiving the fifteen dollars, by the rest of the heirs. I received the rent for the willows, not as executor, but as an individual, as my right. It was understood by the executors that I was entitled to receive that. The rent was paid to me by Lafferty. Lafferty planted the willows I think in 1816: part I think in 1817. He appeared to me to take care of them. He cleaned the grass. Willows begin to sprout the second year. I should not suppose they were in their prime before the third year. There was an understanding between Lafferty and me as to my receiving the rent; but none as to the character in which I received the rent, and he paid it to me. There were accounts between Lafferty and myself. I owed him money. There is an unsettled account between the plaintiff and me. We have never settled any accounts. I have received goods from him and manure sometimes. He has paid me money for rent. I never was Mr. Lafferty\u2019s landlord, further than as executor. I have not settled an account as executor in the office. I settled with Mr. Peltz, he settled with the office. I never kept an account of rents received from Lafferty. I had some little entry of them in a book which I have at home. When my father let me the whole place, it included more than was sold to Krider: fourteen and a quarter acres besides, with the building. I considered the whole rent as seven hundred dollars, and not seven hundred and fifteen dollars. I don\u2019t recollect that any thing was said about the willow lot, when the arrangement was made by me with Krider.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-8\">The defendant\u2019s counsel then put in the said paper, which was read as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-9\">1*3081 *\u201c Received, September 14th, 1830, of John J. Kri- *- -* der, $10 in full for immediate possession of the 18 acres and 20 perches of land that he bought of the estate of John Lentz deceased, except the piece in turnips, which I promise to deliver him 20 bushels, and give him possession of all the land the 25th of November next.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b326-12\">John Lentz.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>When the evidence was closed on both sides, the defendant\u2019s counsel requested the Judge to instruct the jury as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-6\">1. That the instrument of writing dated February 24th, 1816, from John Lentz to the plaintiff, is not a lease, but if operative, conveyed to him a fee simple in the willow lot, reserving an annual rent; or if not a fee, it conveyed to the plaintiff an estate, either for his own life or that of Lentz, and that in either case not being recorded prior to the purchase by Krider, it was void against him, he having no notice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-7\">2. That if the instrument referred to, did not convey a fee, but is to be considered a lease, it was void for uncertainty, no time being mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-8\">3. That if held to be valid as a lease, Lafferty by payment of rent, recognized John Lentz, Jr. as his landlord, became his sub-lessee, and had no rights against the owner of the property, except through Lentz, Jr. and was not therefore entitled to notice to quit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-9\">4. That the arrangement made on the 14th of September, 1830, between Krider and Lentz, was operative upon the sub-lessee Lafferty; that it was equivalent to or operated as notice to quit, to Lentz, and was as such, binding on Lafferty his under-tenant ; and that at all events it prevented any implied renewal of the lease, after the expiration of the current year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-10\">5. That the defendants in this case were at most unintentional trespassers, and the plaintiff entitled only to nominal damages.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-11\">6. That the willows having been suffered to lie some time on the ground after they were cut, and before they' were carried away, the plaintifl could not support trespass for carrying them away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-12\">The judge after recapitulating the evidence, charged the jury upon the points presented to him as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b327-13\">\u201c As to the points of law on which I have been requested by the defendant\u2019s counsel to charge you ; I instruct you that the instrument of writing dated Feb. 24th, 1816, from Lentz deceased to the plaintiff, is a lease, and did not convey to him a fee in the premises described therein, reserving an annual rent. It is unskilfully drawn, and on its face is ambiguous. It begins with a mutilated word, probably <em>memorandum, </em>and if so is a memorandum under hand and seal of the parties, by which it appears that the said John Lentz hath let unto the said D. Laferty his legal heirs and representatives, a certain Apiece of meadow land containing one acre be the same more or less, at the rate of fifteen dollars per acre, to be paid by the said D. Lafferty or his legal heirs annually to the said John Lentz, his heirs and assigns. It is expressly a <em>letting </em>at $15 per acre annually. The word <em>let </em>is strictly applicable to a lease <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>and not to a deed in fee: and a lease is for life, for years or- at will, and always for a less time \u2022 than the interest of the lessor in the premises. If this be a lease for life, whether it be for the life of the lessee or lessor, not being recorded, it is void against a purchaser Avithout notice. It is, however, impossible from the face of. the paper to ascertain, Avith any/iegree of certainty, the agreement of the parties in regard to the duration of the interest intended to be transferred, and therefore the instrument on its face would be void for ambiguity and uncertainty, if the defect be not explained and removed by external evidence, so as to give it validity to a certain extent, <em>e. g. </em>as a lease for a year or from year to year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-6\">If the evidence proves that the plaintiff was put in possession of the premises, under a rent of $15, by the elder Lentz, that he cultivated the land, and paid or accounted for the rent as. tenant from 1816 until the sheriff\u2019s sale to Krider, the instrument of Avriting, with the other evidence, may establish Lafferty\u2019s right as tenant from year to year; and as such he was entitled to .three months\u2019 notice to quit before the expiration of the year, from his lessor or his representatives, or his or their assigns, that is from Krider, the defendant. If, hoAvever, he paid rent to J. Lentz, Junr. as his landlord individually, he became subtenant \u25a0of J. Lentz, Junr.; tod notice to J. Lentz, Junr. would be sufficient.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-7\">If, under the whole evidence, the jury are satisfied that Lafferty Avent into possession of the premises in 1816, as the tenant of John Lentz the elder, under an agreement to pay an annual rent, notAvithstanding the written lease was thus ambiguous and uncertain; that the agreement was performed during the elder Lentz\u2019s lifetime, and since his death until the purchase by Krider, then at the time of Krider\u2019s purchase, Lafferty\u2019s tenancy was from year to year, whether he held under the executors as their tenant, or as subtenant of John Lentz the younger.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-8\">If the plaintiff was tenant of the executors, and not a subtenant, he was unaffected by the agreement between J. Lentz and Krider, and the defendants had no right to enter on the premises.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-9\">The Court would like the jury to find specially, Avhether the plaintiff Avas tenant of the executors or, the subtenant of J. Lentz the younger, as in the latter event several principles of law arise, which Avill embarrass the case unnecessarily unless such a finding takes place.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b328-10\">If, however, the plaintiff was the subtenant of J. Lentz, Jun. still he was not affected by the receipt or agreement betAveen Lentz and Krider, especially as it is distinctly proved he had no pgio-i notice of it. *A notice to quit to Lentz would have been *- -* sufficient, Avithout notice to Lafferty.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>On the 4th point, I charge that the law is not, as contended by the defendant\u2019s counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-6\">On the 5th point, I also give a negative charge. If the jury are satisfied from the evidence and law as explained by the Court, that the plaintiff has been injured in the manner described in the declaration, the jury may give him in damages a fair compensation for the injury he has sustained.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-7\">6th point. (The Judge here stated the claim from the declaration.) If this lot were let to grow willow twigs for basket-making ; and the annual crop of the plaintiff, after breaking and entering his close, was cut partly down and partly destroyed, and the part cut down was subsequently, after lying on the ground, by the continuous and connected acts and conduct of the defendants, taken and carried away from the premises, such acts and carrying away the willows may be taken into consideration by the jury, in estimating the damages in this action. The existence of the facts, here referred to, is left to the jury on the evidence as matter of fact. If these facts are established, and particularly that the willow twigs were the annual crop of the plaintiff, trespass can be sustained by the plaintiff, for such cutting, taking and carrying away.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-8\">When the judge had concluded his charge, one of the jury asked the following question, \u201cWhose tenant is the plaintiff now, he being in possession of the premises ?\u201d The judge declined answering the question, stating that \u201c it might embarrass the cause, and that it was not necessary to its decision.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-9\">The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff with $150 damages, and they also found, that the plaintiff was the \u25a0 tenant of John Lentz, the elder, and not of John Lentz, the son.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-10\">The defendant having removed the record to this Court, assigned the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-11\">\u201c1. That the Court erred in admitting evidence of the value of .the willows cut by the plaintiff in this action of trespass, <em>quare clauswm </em>fregit, while at the time of the institution of this suit, and at the time of the offering the evidence, an action of replevin was pending to recover the value of the willows.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-12\">2. That the Court erred in refusing to admit in evidence the receipt of John Lentz, dated September 14th, 1830, from John Krider; the hand-writing of the said Lentz having been proved, unless the said Lentz were first examined, and proved that the money in the said receipt mentioned, was paid at the' time of the giving thereof.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b329-13\">3. That the Court erred in admitting said Lentz\u2019s testimony, as to what the money in the said receipt mentioned, was paid for; *the object of the testimony being to vary, alter, and r*q-riq contradict the said written receipt. -*</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>4. That the Court erred in their answers to the several points, on which they were requested by the counsel of the plaintiffs in error to instruct the jury: because the Court charged the jury,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-6\">1. That the instrument of writing, dated February 24th, 1816, from John Lentz to Lafferty, did not convey a fee simple to Lafferty in the willow lot, but that the same was a lease, and did not convey any freehold; and that though void on its face for uncertainty, the jury might resort to extrinsic evidence, and that if, on the whole evidence, they were satisfied that Lafferty went into possession under an uncertain lease, but which operated from year to year, and continued, then Lafferty was tenant from year to year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b330-7\">2.

The circumstance of another action pending between the parties for the same cause, was not a sufficient objection to it. If two actions be brought for the same cause at the same time by the plaintiff against the defendant, he may plead the one in abatement of the other, and by this means abate them both. <em>Pie </em>v. <em>Cook, </em>(Hob. 128, s. c. Moore, 864, pl. 1193); 1 Roll. Abr. 353; 39 H. 6, 13, pl. 16, per Prisot, Justice, cited 5 Mass. 179, in note; <em>Mayor, &amp;c. </em>v. <em>B. </em>(1 Freem. 401, pl. 526, s. c. 3 Keb. 491); 3 Burr. 1434; Com. Dig. Tit. Abatement; Ib. 24; <em>Beach </em>v. <em>Norton, </em>(8 Conn. 71.) But if one action be commenced before the other. tbe defendant may abate tbe second by pleading tbe pendency of tbe first; and unless be plead it in abatement, be cannot take advantage of it, because it forms no bar to tbe plaintiff\u2019s *right of action, and therefore cannot be given in eviL 1 dence under tbe general issue, or any other plea in bar. Beyond, however, tbe vexation of having two suits on band, to attend to at tbe same time, tbe defendant cannot be prejudiced; because after a trial and judgment rendered in one of the actions, no matter if it be tbe first or tbe second, in respect to tbe time of its commencement, be may plead such judgment <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>in bar of tbe other, and thus protect himself against all liability in it. <em>Garvin </em>v. <em>Dawson, </em>(13 Serg. &amp; R. 146.) Tbe taking and carrying away tbe willows were charged in tbe plaintiff\u2019s declaration as part of bis complaint; and after evidence given on the trial tending to prove tbe fact, tbe evidence objected to, was certainly material to'the issue, and therefore properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-6\">Tbe second error is not sustained either: because even admitting that tbe Court were wrong in refusing to permit tbe receipt to be read in evidence, still they may be considered as having corrected their error afterwards by admitting it. Tbe counsel for tbe plaintiffs in error, however, allege, that their ebents were prejudiced, notwithstanding tbe subsequent admission of tbe receipt in evidence: because in consequence of tbe Court\u2019s refusing to permit tbe receipt to go in evidence to tbe jury when first offered, they say, that they were compelled to adduce John Lentz, jr. as their witness, who was unfavourably disposed towards them, and in bis testimony gave a colouring to the case, in some respects,' that was untrue and calculated to prejudice tbe jury against them: also, that tbe plaintiff below, who, as they bebeve, intended to adduce Lentz as a witness on bis behalf, by this gained an advantage that be could not have bad in case be bad called him first, by drawing from him all tbe testimony be wished, in answers to <em>leading </em>questions. It may be that it was no disadvantage to tbe plaintiff below, that tbp plaintiffs in error called John Lentz, jr. as their witness, but still it cannot be said with propriety, that tbe Court below compelled them to do so. If they were convinced that tbe Court was wrong in refusing to permit tbe receipt to be read in evidence when first offered, they ought, after taking their bill of exceptions to tbe opinion of tbe Court in this behalf, to have passed Lentz by, and to have proceeded with their other evidence; and if they lost tbe cause, then to have brought their writ of error. It will not do then, to say that they were forced by tbe decision of tbe Court, to call Lentz as their witness, because it was clearly at their option to do so or not as they pleased.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>But seeing that there was no evidence given, when the receipt was first offered, tending to show that it was given, or had an existence before the trespass was alleged to have been committed, I am inclined to think that the Court was right in rejecting it; for to have admitted it to be read in evidence to the jury upon proof merely that John Lentz junior\u2019s name, which was subscribed to it, was in his handwriting, would have been a pretty dangerous kind *of testimony, especially as Lentz himself \u00a1-*0141 was still in being and present, who at least could be called -J to testify, how the fact was; whether it was given at the time of its date, and whether the facts contained in it were true or not. For any thing that appeared to the Court, when it was first offered, it might have been manufactured within the last hour immediately preceding, between Krider and Lentz, for the very purpose of being offered in evidence, w.ithout there being a word of truth in any thing set forth in it; this being the case, it ap-' pears to me that it was properly rejected when first offered.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We also think there is nothing in the third error assigned. As Lafferty, the plaintiff below, was no party to the receipt, he was was not estopped from gainsaying the truth of the matters alleged in it. It was competent therefore for him to show,' if he could, that it was all a fiction, or a contrivance between Krider and Lentz, made for the purpose of defrauding him of his just rights: and this he was at liberty to show by the evidence of Lentz himself, as well as that of any other; for Lentz, not being a party to the suit, could be coerced at the instance of either party, to testify to any thing within his knowledge that was material to the issue. If the receipt was a misrepresentation of the matters set forth in it, no one could know it better than Lentz; and therefore as regarded knowledge on the subject, no body could be better qualified to testify: And even if it had been concocted for a fraudulent purpose, he would have been bound to have disclosed it, provided it were material to the issue: His being a party to the fraud, would not have excused him from giving evidence of it, as long as it were of such a nature as would not subject him to criminal punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">The authorities cited by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, showing that written agreements or instruments cannot be altered, changed or contradicted, have not the least application: the rule laid down by them is only applicable to cases of controversies between the parties to the agreements, their representatives, and those claiming under them, but not to strangers; whose rights and interests would truly be in peril if the rule were to be extended to them, in such manner as to conclude them from giving evidence tending to contradict such agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">The fourth error embraces the answers of the Court to six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>points submitted on tbe trial by tbe counsel for the plaintiffs in error; in each of which they allege the Court erred.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">The first is, as to the effect of the deed given in evidence by the plaintiff, as evidence of his title to the <em>locus in quo. </em>The counsel of the plaintiffs in error, requested the Court to instruct the jury that it conveyed a fee simple to the defendant in error ; but the Court entertaining a different opinion, told the jury that it did not pass a fee. In this I think the Court was mistaken; for the deed in express terms passes the land to Lafferty, <em>his </em>f*3161 <em>^e9al ^rs </em>and representatives, reserving *a rent of fif- *- -J teen dollars to be paid by the said Lafferty or <em>his legal heirs, </em>annually, to the said John Lentz, <em>his heirs </em>and <em>assigns. </em>The Court seems to have overlooked the words of <em>inheritance </em>in the deed, which certainly set forth the <em>quantum </em>of estate intended to be conveyed; and to have taken up the idea that as the word \u201clet\u201d is the only term used by the grantor in the deed, to part with his interest in the land, it was not sufficient to pass a fee simple, though words of <em>inheritance </em>were used in connection with it. Now it is well settled, that the construction of a deed must be as favourable and as near to the minds and apparent intent of the parties as it is possible it may be, and the law will permit: for <em>benigne sunt facienda interpretationes chartarum, propter simplicitatem laicorum. JEt verba intentioni, non e contra, debent inservire. </em>Shep. Touch. 86; Co. Litt. 314, <em>(b). </em>The words in a deed are not the principal thing to be attended to, but the design and intention of the parties. 3 Atk. 135; Plowd. 160. And accordingly, if the intent of the parties appears, the law will construe the -words in such sense as to perform that intent, rather than in any other sense. Plowd. 154. The Court below, seems to have thought that a conveyance of land in which the word \u201clet,\u201d alone, was used, to pass the interest intended to be conveyed, must necessarily be what is strictly and technically called a lease; which Sir Wm. Blackstone says must <em>always </em>be for a <em>less </em>time than the lessor hath in the premises. 2 Bl. Com. 317. And therefore something less than the fee simple, which was the most the grantor could have in the premises, passed by it. The usual words of operation, and as it is said, most <em>apt </em>in a lease, are \u201cdemise, grant and to farm let.\u201d Shep. Touch. 266; Co. Litt. 456; 2 Bl. Com. 317, 18: and the latin words, when leases were drawn in that language, were \u201c <em>dimisi, concessi et adfirmam </em>tradidi.\u201d 2 Bl. Com. 317, 18. The word \u201c let,\u201d may therefore be considered a translation of \u201c tradidi,\u201d which is from irado, signifying, \u201c to deliver, give, or yield, to deliver up, to surrender, to resign, to put into one\u2019s hands,\u201d &amp;c., and would seem to be quite as appropriate to show that it was the intention of the vendor or grantor, to part with and transfer a fee simple estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>to the vendee or grantee, when accompanied with a limitation to the <em>heirs generally </em>of the latter, as the words, \u201c <em>do\u201d </em>or <em>udedi,\u201d </em>which are considered to be the most <em>aft </em>to be used in a deed of feoffment in fee, (2 Bl. Com. 310,) the most efficacious mode in some respects, of conveying land, known to the law. Shep. Touch. 204; Co. Lit. 9, <em>a, </em>49, <em>b. </em>But it is certainly a great mistake to suppose that the words considered most apt for any particular species of conveyance, or indeed, that any of them, are at all necessary to the making thereof; for Lord Coke says, \u201cwhatever word amounteth to a <em>grant, </em>may serve to make a <em>lease.\u201d </em>Co. Lit. 45, <em>b. </em>The word <em>\u201cdemise,\u201d </em>he also says, \u201cis applied to an estate either in fee simple, fee tail, or for term of life, and so commonly is taken in many writs.\u201d 2 Inst. 483. So the words \u201cbargain and sell,\u201d are *not necessary to constitute a deed of bargain and sale, in order to pass a *- -* fee\u2019 simple or less estate in land, under the statutes of uses and the statute of 27 Hen.. 8, c. 16, requiring such deed to be enrolled within six months after its date, if the estate conveyed be a freehold; other equivalent words will be sufficient to make land pass by way of bargain and sale; such as the words \u201c alien or grant,\u201d \u201cdemise and grant,\u201d or if the owner of land \u201ccovenant to stand seized of his land to the use of another;\u201d these will all amount to good bargains and sales, if made for a <em>jpecuniary </em>consideration or one of <em>feeuniary </em>value, though ever so small, even a barleycorn. Shep. Touch. 222; 2 Inst. 672; <em>Fox\u2019s case, </em>(8 Co. 186); <em>Barker </em>v. <em>Keat, </em>(1 Mod. 262, and 2 Mod. 249.) It is perfectly clear then, from the authorities on this subject, as well as from the very structure of a deed conveying land, when the words \u201c enfeoff, give, grant, alien, bargain, sell, demise, let,\u201d &amp;c. or any of them are used, that it is not to express or to designate in the slightest degree, the <em>quantity </em>of estate intended to be conveyed, but merely for the purpose of <em>fassing </em>from the seller to the purchaser, the estate therein described, by other words introduced specially for that end, giving to it, either the character of a fee simple, fee tail, term for life or lives, or for years: as for instance, if it be a fee simple that is intended to be transferred, the words \u201chis heirs,\u201d must be inserted immediately after the name of the purchaser, for they and they alone, are sufficient to make it such according to Littleton, sec. 1. The word \u201clet,\u201d in the deed in question, according to the rules of construction already mentioned, must also be considered sufficiently <em>oferative </em>to <em>fass </em>the fee simple in the land, if from the whole tenor of the deed itself, it -appears to have been the intention of the parties to use it for that purpose. That John Lentz intended to convey by this deed, some estate in the land to Daniel Lafferty cannot be doubted; and that the word \u201clet,\u201d was used for the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>of <em>passing </em>that estate or interest, whatever it was, admits of as little doubt, because it is the only word used to which any meaning of the' kind can or ever has been affixed; and if the other words of the deed are to be regarded as they must, for in construing deeds or instruments of writing, effect must be given to every word used therein, if it can be done consistently with the other parts thereof; it is evident that the interest and estate, thereby conveyed, were not only intended to be enjoyed by Daniel Lafferty himself, but also by <em>Ms heirs </em>generally, without any restriction or limitation whatever; which cannot be without giving to Lafferty a fee simple estate in the land, subject however to a fee-farm-rent, as'it is termed by Littleton, sec. 216 and 217; or a perpetual rent, as it is called by Mr. Hargrave, in his note 5 to Co. Lit. 143, 4; and with us usually called a ground rent in f0e. And indeed it appears to me that the deed in this case, as a conveyance of the land in fee, is about as perfect as r*8171 ^he form that was adopted and prescribed by an act of L -I *the Assembly of the Province of Pennsylvania, two or three years after it was granted to William Penn, passed the 10th of March, 1683, which is in these words, to wit: \u201c A. B. of, &amp;c. the day of from him and his heirs, <em>grants </em>his acre of meadow land, with all its appurtenances lying in, &amp;c. to C. D. and his heirs, for the considdration of fifteen dollars yearly rent, to be paid to A. B. and his heirs and assigns, upon the day of In witness whereof, he sets his hand and seal.\u201d See Hall and Sellers\u2019 vol. of the Province L. appendix, 9. The word \u201cgrant,\u201d is used in the form thus prescribed, instead of the word \u201clet,\u201d which at most is but a verbal difference, and cannot change the character of the deed as a conveyance of the land, or its effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-7\">The counsel for the plaintiff in error also, in reference to this deed, requested the Court to instruct the jury, that if it were not a conveyance of the fee simple, but a mere lease of the land, it was void for uncertainty, on account of the' time of its duration not being mentioned. The Court, however, declined giving such instruction to the jury, and on the contrary advised them, that taking the deed in connexion with the conduct of the parties, of which they had parol evidence given to them, they might consider it a lease from year to year: this is also complained of by the plaintiffs in error, as being incorrect; and no doubt it is so, as has already been shown in the opinion advanced, that a fee simple passed by the deed. If, however, the counsel had asked the Court to instruct the jury, that the deed was void for uncertainty, in not describing the land intended to be conveyed, so as to enable its precise location to be ascertained, there would have been more colour for it at least. But still I do not think that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>this would have been available; for notwithstanding this uncertainty, yet it was capable of being rendered certain by the subsequent act of the parties, if not by the act of the vendor alone. For instance, if one grant me three acres of wood toward the north side of his wood, this is a good grant and certain enough. Shep. Touch. Tit. Grant, page 250. So if one be seized of two acres of land, and he doth lease them for life, and grant the remainder of one of them, but doth not say which, to J. S. ; in this case if J. S. makes his election, as to which he will have, the grant of the remainder to him will be good: or if a man having six horses in his stable, grants me one of them, without saying which, I may choose which I will have; and having made my election, and not before, the grant is good. See Shep. Touch. Tit. Grant, page 251; Perkins, sec. 74, 76. According to the principles of these authorities, the <em>location </em>of the land granted by the deed, was reduced to certainty afterwards, by the act of the parties in setting it off by metes and boundaries, and by the act of the grantee in taking possession of it in the lifetime of the grantor, by and with his consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">But, still, notwithstanding the Court erred in their instruction to the jury as to the nature and effect of the deed, it becomes necessary *to inquire, whether any injury could arise therefrom to the plaintiffs in error, for unless they may have been prejudiced by it, with the jury; it is not sufficient cause- for reversing the judgment. The effect of the charge of the Court was to induce the jury to consider Lafferty as a tenant of the land only from year to year, in place of being a tenant thereof in fee simple. Now I am utterly unable to perceive any benefit that \" the plaintiffs in error could have derived from a direction of the Court to the jury, that the deed passed a fee simple estate in the land to Lafferty, that they were not entitled to claim, in the case of its creating only a tenancy from year to year.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Admitting the distinction taken by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, between a tenant in fee and a tenant from year to year, to exist in favour of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consideration, still with what propriety could the counsel ask the Court to assume the fact, contrary as I conceive, to the testimony of the witnesses on both sides, that Krider was such a purchaser; and to instruct the jury that the title of Lafferty must, therefore, give way to him. \"This, had the Court done so, would not only in effect have been a withdrawal of the decision of a matter of fact from the. jury, but would have been a decision of it by the Court, contrary to a body of evidence, which went to prove very clearly, that the fact was otherwise. Though Lafferty had never put his deed on record, yet it appears from the testimony of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>witnesses of both parties, that he had been in the actual possession and enjoyment of the acre of land from the year 1816 to the time of the trial, and of course was in the actual possession thereof, at the time Krider became the purchaser. When Lafferty bought, it was meadow, and part of a larger tract of land, owned by John Lentz at the time. Lafferty, it seems, was a basket-maker; and immediately after his purchase, the ground being set apart from that owned by Lentz, he took possession of it, planted it with willows, for the purpose of supplying himself with materials to carry on the business of his trade, and continued to occupy it, growing willows upon it, and cutting them eyery year at the proper season. This visible change in the appearance and occupation of the ground could not well fail to attract the notice of the neighbourhood; and hence it would seem, that all the witnesses who had resided within the same, for any length of time, had become acquainted with Lafferty\u2019s occupation of the ground. His possession then being sufficiently distinct to be notorious, was sufficient to put Krider upon his inquiry, as to the right, under which Lafferty held the possession of the land; and being sufficient for that purpose was good notice in equity.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Lowe, </em>1 Atk. 490; Sug. Vend. 743. This case, as presented by the evidence, is not like the case of <em>Billington </em>v. <em>Welsh, </em>(5 Binn. 129,) to which it has been compared by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error. Welsh had never had the f*3191 acres \u00b0f land, which he alleged he bought of *Turner, *- -* laid off by survey or separated in any way from the residue .of Turner\u2019s land. Turner had erected iron-works on his part of the land, and various dwelling-houses and other buildings for the accommodation of the persons in his employ, and for carrying on his business : with which the buildings and improvements of Welsh, to the eye of the spectator, were apparently connected, and seemingly formed a part thereof; so that there was no distinct unequivocal possession of the land by Welsh, as there has been here by Lafferty. Under such circumstances it is obvious, that it would have been erroneous on the part of the Court, and have been doing great injustice to Lafferty, to instruct the jury as requested by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error. They might have made a question as to what would amount to notice to Krider, of the right of Lafferty to the land; and whether such facts and circumstances had been proved as were equivalent to it; but it would seem as if they were unwilling to encounter it; and wished to have it assumed as being in favour of their clients. The charge of the Court then, in regard to the-nature and effect of the deed, though erroneous, yet being more favoura-' <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ble to tbe plaintiffs in error, as we conceive, than their counsel had any right to claim, does not furnish a sufficient ground for reversing the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">As Lafferty acquired a fee simple estate in the' acre of land, on which the trespass is alleged to have been committed, by the deed from Lentz to him, the questions embraced in the 3d and 4th points submitted by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, to the Court below, were not material to the issue, and, therefore, require no further notice.</p>\n<p id=\"AYvk\">In regard to the 5th point; we think there was no ground whatever for asking the Court to instruct the jury, as was done by it, that in case they found for the plaintiff below, th\u00e9 damages ought to be merely nominal; as the trespass committed, if any, was <em>unintentional. </em>Krider, one of the plaintiffs in error, under whose authority the others acted, being notified expressly by Lafferty of his right to the land and the willows, persisted in going on with the trespass and taking the willows away, after they were cut, in place of tendering amends for the injury done. It was certainly not an <em>unintentional </em>trespass, but one of design, committed under the colour of right,-which has been attempted to be vindicated throughout: Lafferty, besides the loss of his property, must have been put to. considerable expense in asserting and establishing his right: and I am, therefore, not satisfied, but it was a proper case enough, to be left by the Court to the jury, to decide whether damages beyond the value of the willows taken, and the injury done, if any, to the freehold, ought not to be given: nominal damages, merely, were out of the question; for it would have been error, as it appears to me, in the Court, to have suggested less than compensatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">In regard to the sixth point; Lafferty being held to be the owner *of the land, on which the willows grew and were r^oon-i cut; and being in the actual possession of it, there can be *- -* no question, but he had a right to allege in his declaration, in addition to the breaking and entering of his close, the cutting, taking and carrying away of the willows there found growing; and having alleged it, it was competent for him to prove it, if he could; and if he proved it, he was entitled to recover damages, equal to the full value of the willows at least, as well as for the injury, done to the freehold; hence the Court committed no error in their answer to this point, that could injure the plaintiffs in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Cited by Counsel, <em>post </em>423; 2 Wharton, 108; 3 Id. 410; 5 Id. 106; 2 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 113, 311; 4 Id. 18; 6 Id. 470; 7 Id. 45; 8 Id. 68, 93, 260; 1 Barr, 209; 1 Harris, 47; 11 Id. 128; 10 Casey, <em>448</em>; 2 Wright, 77; 3 Wright, 481; 5 P.
