Ingham and John H. Ingham took a rule to show cause why they should not be permitted to take out of the sheriff\u2019s hands the amount of their execution. This rule was opposed both by Yardley and Brock; who severally claimed to be first paid out of the proceeds of sale, in the sheriff\u2019s hands. Rules were also entered to take depositions, by S. D. Ingham and John II. Ingham, and also by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>Samuel Yardley, Jr.; under which the following depositions were taken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>(Deposition of M. H. Snyder.)</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-7\"><em>u </em>From information that Mr. Ingham\u2019s execution was to be pushed, I went to see Mr. Ingham, and he agreed that if I would pay the interest up to the time, and obtain, from Mr. Brock, an agreement that Mr. Ingham\u2019s execution should have the priority, and wouldn\u2019t take advantage of Mr. Ingham\u2019s execution, that he would stay his proceedings against me. I told him I thought I could do so. He then gave me a letter to Mr. Chapman as his \u2022attorney, the substance of which letter corresponded with the above arrangements. This was about ten days or two weeks before the December term, 1834. I told Mr. Ingham that I thought I could make the arrangement. I came home and saw Mr. Field, and told him what passed between Mr. Ingham and myself. Field told me I must do it. I tried to get the money and the agreement, and I couldn\u2019t. I had part of the money, and still thought I could get the rest. I paid a part to Mr. Field, fifteen dollars, after I found I couldn\u2019t get the rest of the money, and couldn\u2019t make the arrangement with Mr. Brock. I did nothing more. I didn\u2019t tell Mr. Ingham or his attorney, that I couldn\u2019t get the money; but I told his attorney that I could. This was all the arrangement that *was made p*-. -, q-, with the sheriff or plaintiff. I felt a good deal worried, L J and wanted to make the best arrangement I could. After the sheriff had made the levy, and was going to sell, I called on Mr. Chapman, (Mr. Ingham\u2019s attorney,) at his office, for the purpose of getting a stop put to it, if it could be done. He told me he couldn\u2019t make any arrangement, or do any thing, because he was .Mr. Ingham\u2019s attorney; and that all that could be done was for me to pay the money, or the property must be sold; and that if any arrangement was to be made, he must make it with Mr. Ingham. I then went to Mr. Ingham, and obtained the letter to Mr. Chapman, referred to in the examination in chief; upon my informing Mr. Chapman that I didn\u2019t think it possible that I could be able to make the arrangement, Mr. Chapman then directed the sheriff to go on and sell. This was several days after I had seen Mr. Ingham. I called to see Mr. Field again, and he told me if I would pay the greater part of the money, give my note to him for the rest, and get the arrangement with Mr. Brock, he wouldn\u2019t sell. It was the expressed and decided intention of Mr. Ingham and his counsel, to sell the property, unless the arrangement was made. The interest amounted to about sixty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">The first levy that was made, was under the execution, return<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>able to December term. Tbe levy was made several weeks before tbe return of the execution. The goods were not advertised until after the December term. I had an account against Mr. Ingham of about fifty dollars, all his account against me was embraced in the judgment; the account I had against Mr. Ingham, and what money I paid, would have amounted to more than the interest due at the time I made the arrangement with Mr. Ingham. I said nothing to Mr. Ingham about my accounts. I forgot to mention it. My understanding was, that I was to raise sixty odd dollars in money. Mr. Chapman told me that I ought to have my claim deducted from Mr. Ingham\u2019s account, when the judgment was given; and that if I had an account* against Mr. Ingham, he had no doubt Mr. Ingham would allow it. A considerable part of my account accrued since the judgment was given; the sixty odd dollars were to be paid without any regard to my account. Sheriff Field depended upon my promise to him; the fifteen were paid the Saturday or Sunday preceding the December Court. There were seventy-five dollars rent due from me to S. Yardley. I was to pay one hundred dollars per year. Nothing had been paid from the 1st of April, until the time of sale. The rent was payable quarterly. There was no written lease, it was only a private understanding between us, that the rent was payable quarterly. Mr. Yardley don\u2019t owe me any thing.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-6\">P1201 <em>*Deposition of William Meld, the Sheriff of Dueles </em>*- -* <em>Qounty.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-8\"><em>\u201c </em>I don\u2019t recollect having any orders respecting the first <em>fieri facias. </em>I returned it stayed. The orders given to me respecting the <em>fieri facias </em>to December term, were to go on and sell. I then called on Mr. Snyder, and told him what he had to depend upon.. This direction was given to me before Mr. Snyder went to Mr. Ingham. Mr. Chapman told me if Mr. Snyder raised a certain portion of the money, (about sixty dollars,) and got an agreement from Mr. Brock not to take advantage of delays, the proceedings might be stayed. There was no time fixed in which this was to be done. I understood from Mr. Snyder that Brock would agree to make the arrangement, and that Mr. Snyder had forty dollars, and that he could make up the rest; if not, the sheriff and Doctor Mathews would lend him the rest; and I did not know that this arrangement could not be made until it was too late to sell. I depended upon the promise of Mr. Snyder. I understood from Mr. Chapman that unless this arrangement was made, I must go on and sell; and the matter was left to me to see that it was done.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-9\">Yardley\u2019s <em>fieri facias, </em>and Ingham\u2019s <em>fieri facias </em>to February <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>term, were placed in my hands, before court commenced, on the 8th of December. Mr. Ingham\u2019s <em>fieri facias </em>was placed in my hands by Mr. Purdy, the prothonotary\u2019s clerk. I never received any directions from Mr. Ingham\u2019s attorney, with regard to it\u2014 but to levy on property, not levied upon hy the <em>fieri facias </em>to December term. This was the same day the <em>fieri facias </em>issued; and Mr. Chapman said the <em>fieri facias </em>to February term had issued contrary to his orders. This was upon his being informed that the said <em>fieri facias </em>was in my hands. The orders given to me to levy on other property, I think were given after Yardley\u2019s execution was placed in my hands. I received no orders respecting Ingham\u2019s <em>fieri facias </em>to February term, until after Yardley\u2019s had issued. There was no intention ever expressed or manifested by Mr. Ingham or his attorney, to do otherwise than to sell the property; but it was their desire to have the property sold. When I told Mr. Chapman that Mr. Snyder could not make the arrangement, he stated to me that I must go on and sell; and if there was not time to sell before court, I must sell immediately after. This was a day or two before court. On Saturday before court I had hoped that Snyder would make the arrangement, and expected it. I informed Mr. Chapman that day, I had got a part, and Mr. Snyder was not to get the balance at that time. Mr. Chapman said I must take the responsibility on myself; his orders were to go on. I informed Mr. Chapman at that time that I had understood that Mr. Snyder had other property, not levied upon by the <em>fieri facias </em>to December term, to wit: a gig and harness. This property was at Mr. Pettits\u2019. I did nothing with Mr. Ingham\u2019s <em>fieri facias </em>to February *term. I placed p\u00fc-io-n it in Mr. Chapman\u2019s hands, inasmuch as I did nothing *- -* with it.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-7\">\n<em>Deposition of Joseph II. Purdy.</em>\n</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-8\">\u201c Mr. Chapman gave me a <em>praecipe </em>for a <em>fieri, facias </em>to February term, in the case of Ingham against Snyder, on Saturday afternoon preceding court. Mr. Chapman told me not to issue it until \u2014 (these were his words); \u2014 I didn\u2019t know what that meant, until it was afterwards explained, several days after; \u2014 and then pointed up. There were some persons present at the time. Upon Mr. Chapman being informed that the <em>fieri facias </em>of Ingham\u2019s had issued, and been put in the sheriff\u2019s hands, Mr. Chapman said that he had intended that it should not issue before the bell rang. I am Mr. Chapman\u2019s student, and also deputy prothonotary. I delivered the execution to the sheriff, in the capacity of student, without Mr. Chapman\u2019s knowledge. I supposed, at the time I Ayas. doing it, that I' was contributing to the interest of Mr. Chapman\u2019s client. I received no directions from Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Chapman at any time, that the execution should not be issued till the bell rung. I never, at any time before, received any directions from Mr. Chapman, not to issue a writ before the ringing of the bell. Ingham\u2019s <em>fieri facias </em>to December term, was issued after the bell rang. I was never informed by Mr. Chapman that it was necessary to wait till the ringing of the bell, before execution should issue.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-6\">I don\u2019t recollect of any instance in which Mr. Chapman ever directed an execution to issue before the ringing of the bell; but. there may have been. At the time Mr. Chapman told me not to issue the execution, and pointed up towards the cupola, I was very busy, and did not understand him. To Mr. Chapman\u2019s directions I replied \u00a3yes;\u2019 and nothing more was said.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-7\">The case came up for argument at the adjourned Court, March 18th, 1835, and was held under advisement until June 5th, 1835; when the court ordered and decreed, that the rules taken by Samuel D. Ingham and John II. Ingham be made absolute. An appeal from this decree of the Common Pleas was entered under the act of 1827, by Samuel Yardley, Jr., one of the claimants who assigned for error:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-8\">1. That the court erred in directing the rule taken by Samuel D. Ingham and John H. Ingham, to be made absolute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b132-9\">2. That the court erred in not decreeing that Samuel Yardley, Jr., should take out of the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale, the amount of his execution.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A9B\">*Mr. <em>Moss, </em>for the appellant, Yardley:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB2\">1. The record shows that the plaintiffs issued four writs of <em>fieri facias; </em>two of which were stayed by order of his attorney. To the third, also, the sheriff made return that proceedings were stayed, although he was allowed to amend the return: and the fourth was recalled by the plaintiffs. These proceedings raise a presumption that the object was not to obtain satisfaction of the debt, but security for it. Now, it is settled by a series of decisions, that the lien of an execution upon personal property, is divested by an order to the sheriff to stay proceedings. The recent cases of <em>The Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Strembeck, </em>(3 Rawle, 341,) and <em>Hickman </em>v. <em>Caldwell, </em>(4 Rawle, 376,) recognize the doctrine in its fullest extent. [G-ibso\u00edt, C. J. \u2014 The rule you have referred to, applies only to cases in which there has been an actual levy. What evidence is there here of any levy, prior to that which took place under the <em>plwries fieri facias </em>?] The evidence shows, that directions were given to stay proceedings upon that writ, in case the defendant paid the interest due upon the judgment ; and the deposition of Snyder proves, that the interest was substantially paid.</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>2. Yardley\u2019s execution was regularly issued. It appears by tbe record, that it was issued on the 8th of December, and came to the sheriff\u2019s hands on the same day, at twenty-five minutes after seven o\u2019clock, A. M. The 8th of December was, it is true, the first day of December term, and the writ was returnable to February term; but this does not render it invalid. In <em>Cashee </em>v. <em>Wisner, </em>(2 P. A. Browne, 245,) the District Court refused to set aside a writ which had been issued, on the morning of the first day of the term, upon which the defendant had been arrested on the same day, after the rising of the court. In England the rule is the same. <em>Maud </em>v. <em>Bernard, </em>(2 Burr. Rep. 812.) <em>Non con-stat </em>that the court was not in session at the time the writ issued. The rule, with respect to judicial writs, applies to <em>mesne </em>process. <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Small, </em>(4 Yeates, 187.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b133-6\">Mr. <em>W. M. Meredith, </em>for the defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-7\">1. It never has been decided that the mere staying of proceedings on a <em>fieri facias, </em>without a levy, prevents the issuing of a new execution. The second <em>pluries fieri facias_ </em>was the mistake of a clerk; and its immediate recall prevented any prejudice to the plaintiff. <em>Young </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(2 Binn. 230); <em>Burke </em>v. <em>M'Fall, </em>(2 P. A. Browne, 143); <em>Alison </em>v. <em>Ream, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; R. 142); <em>Bank of Pennsylvania </em>v. <em>Latshaw, </em>(9 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 9); Tidd, 390.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b133-8\">2. Yardley\u2019s execution was invalid, because a term was omitted. The sheriff\u2019s deposition proves, that the writ was delivered to him before the sitting of the court; which is the commencement of the *term. The point for <em>which </em>Baker v. <em>Smith </em>is cited, was not decided by the court. It is L J said by counsel <em>arguendo. </em>But this is not merely the case of a writ returnable over a term. It appears by the record, that the judgment was entered on the 8th of December, to December term. How could this take place, before the court had commenced its sitting? If the judgment was regular, the execution must be irregular, since it certainly issued before the meeting of the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b133-9\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ASe\">The recall of the second <em>pluries fieri facias, </em>before action had on it, restored matters to the footing on which they stood before it was issued; and prevented it from being, as it might otherwise have been, an abandonment of the preceding levy. It was intended not to be an actual abandonment, but to seize on property not before seized \u2014 a most unheard of proceeding, and one whose consequences could have been averted but by relinquishing it at the threshold. By reason of the recall, too, it would be unnecessary to inquire whether the execution <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>were void, by reason of having been issued before the sitting of the court on the test day; but the point presents no difficulty; for, granting for the moment, that the term begins with the actual sitting of the court, still it is proper to say that, although it is otherwise in respect to <em>mesne </em>process, the intervention of a term between the <em>teste </em>and return of judicial process, is not even an irregularity, because it gives the defendant no day in court. The lien of the execution, therefore, was not impaired.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">Decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Miles, 294.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
