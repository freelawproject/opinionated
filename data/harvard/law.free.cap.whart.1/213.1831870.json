W. Eubbell, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-c\">The testator gives one-third of his estate to his children, who may be \u201c <em>living </em>at the time of his death.\u201d I contend that the posthumous child is to be considered as <em>living </em>at the time of the death of the testator ; and, therefore, that he was \u201cprovided for\u201d within the meaning of the 23d section of the act of 17th April, 1794. The authorities show, that children \u201cliving,\u201d include such as maybe \u201cin <em>ventre sa mere.\u201d Pemberton </em>v. Parke, (5 Binn. 601); <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>(5 Serg. &amp; R. 38.) The words of this will are exactly the same with those in <em>Pemberton </em>v. <em>Parke. </em>The words, \u201c if <em>any </em>of my children should be dead at the time of my decease,\u201d &amp;c., must refer to more than two. As to the rights of the annuitants, and other legatees, there are no words which will postpone them, as among themselves. 2 <em>Williams on Executors, </em>837, 841. When the bequest is of a sum which is to supply an annual interest, it is an annuity. I contend that, as regards the real estate, there is no postponement of the annuitants to the pecuniary legatees. It is impossible now to say, what the intention of the testator was, except as it may be gathered from the will; and it would seem, from this, that he did not desire to leave his childaen a large proportion of his property. As to the power of sale, that seems to be settled by <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>(8 Binn. 498.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A7R\">*Mr. <em>Tames S. Smith, </em>for the defendants.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A79\">The rule, that a child in <em>ventre sa mere </em>is to be considered as living at the death of its parent, is an artificial one, introduced by the English courts, to prevent certain hardships which would otherwise ensue. <em>Wilson </em>v. <em>Brush, </em>(4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 506); 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 506; 2 Williams on Executors, 94. If it be for the benefit of the child that the contrary doctrine should prevail, he will be considered as <em>not </em>living. Watkyns on Descents, 142; <em>Doe </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>(2 Hen. Black. 394); 1 Ves. sen. 86; Swinburne, pt. 4, s. 15. In <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>Judge Duncan stated the rule in the same way. The consequence of admitting this child to share in the one-third given by the testator to his children, will be to reduce them to about $4,000 each; while the collateral relations will get about $17,000 among them. The will shows, that he did not look forward to the birth of this child. 1st. He provides that the interest upon the shares of his children shall be paid to their \u201c guardians, hereinafter named.\u201d He afterwards names guardians for James and Isabella, but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>takes no notice of the unborn child. 2d. It was his obvious in-' tent to protect the share of a female child. This is evident from the provision for the share of Isabella. Yet nothing is said respecting the unborn child ; whose sex was of course unknown. It is evident that Mr. Gray supposed himself to be richer than it turns out that he was. The words of the bequests to the collateral relations are rather remarkable. He gives but the principal of the third part of his estate, \u201cafter the foregoing devises are satisfied.\u201d This may be supposed to mean, after all contingencies. He knew that a large -part' of his estate consisted of outstanding debts. The case of <em>Goates </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>decides that the birth of issue is not an absolute revocation, but only so as to matters in which it may be beneficial to the wife or child to have it so considered. The word <em>any, </em>relied upon on the other side, has various meanings, and may be applied to one of two, as well as any other number. We agree that <em>Goates </em>v. <em>Hughes </em>rules this case, as to the power to sell.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b233-6\">Mr. <em>Hubhell, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A1h\">The general rule is, that the word <em>living </em>applies to infants in <em>ventre sa mere </em>; but if they are exposed to a <em>penalty </em>thereby, it will not be so construed. Every devise is supposed to be beneficial for the devisee. The legislature meant no more than that the posthumous child should receive a child\u2019s share, such as the testator allotted to his children; .not that he should receive what the testator intended for col-laterals- If the will was revoked, as to all the children, by the birth of a child, then, if a father should give a shilling to a disobedient child, and after that should have another child, and \u25a0 die, the disobedient child would get a full share. There is no reason for. doubting the intention of the testator to provide liberally for these' collateral relations. One was his mother, another his widowed sister.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">*The opinion of the court.was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b233-8\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AzP\">The principal question raised by the case stated is, whether Alexander, who is the posthumous child of James Gray, is embraced in that clause of the will, in which the testator devises \u201cthe one, full, equal, undivided third part of his estate, real and personal to his beloved children, who may be living at the time of his death.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">It seems to be a settled rule of the English law, that there must be a concurrence of a subsequent marriage, and a subsequent child, to make a revocation of a will; and that the mere subsequent birth of children, unaccompanied by other circumstances, would not amount to a presumed revocation. This being a fixed rule of construction; or, at least, the better opinion being as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>above stated, tbe legislature of Pennsylvania, as early as tbe 4th of February, 1748, enacted, \u201cthat-when any person shall, at any time hereafter, make his last will and testament, and afterwards marry, or have a child, or children, <em>not named in any such will, </em>and die, although such child, or children be born after the death of their father, every such person <em>so far as shall regard </em>the wife after married, or the child or children after born, shall be deemed and considered to be intestate; and such wife, child, or children, shall be entitled to like purparts, shares and dividends, of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased, as if he had actually died without will.\u201d This act has been altered and supplied by the act of the 19th of April, 1794. It is there enacted, \u201cthat when any person, from and after the passage of the act, shall make his last will and testament, and afterwards marry and have a child, or children, <em>not provided for </em>in any such will, and die, <em>leaving a widow and child, or either a widow or child, </em>although such child or children be born after the death of their father, every such person, <em>so far as shall regard the widow, or child, or children, </em>shall be entitled to such purparts, shares, and dividends, of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased, as if he or she had actually died without any will.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b234-6\">I have recited the two acts, in some measure with a view t\u00f3 a variance, which appears between them, which, whether essential or otherwise, may be, as may be hereafter determined. The acts vary in two particulars. The act of 1.748, speaks of children <em>not named in the will; </em>the act of 1794, of children <em>not provided for in the will; </em>the act of 1794, says, if he shall die, \u201c leaving a widow, or child, or either widow or child,\u201d a clause not contained in the act of 1748. But whether these acts essentially- differ from each other or not, yet it is certain they make a material alteration in the common law, which requires both marriage and the birth of a child, or children, to effect an implied revocation of a will.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-7\">This, then, being the rule of the English law, which in many cases operated hardly on after born children, the court naturally 1*2201 *strained the construction of phrases in a will, so as to *- -* include children in <em>ventre sa mere ; </em>and here, it has been repeatedly held, that the words, \u201c living at the death of the testator,\u201d although not the natural import of the term, will, without more, embrace the case of a posthumous child. The rule results from a principle, deduced from the equitable rule of the civil law, which declares, that infants, who are, as yet, in their mother\u2019s womb, are considered as already brought into the world, whenever the question relates to any thing which may turn to their advantage. The rule is intended entirely for the benefit of the infant, and is clearly stated by Swinburne, 562, pt. 4, s. 14. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>\u201cWhen the child,\u201d (as is there said,) \u201cis in the <em>mother\u2019s womb, at such time as the testator </em>dieth, if we would in this case know, whether that man is to be judged to have died without issue, we must consider whether it be for the benefit of the child, that the father should be accounted to have died without issue or not; for, howsoever the rule be, that he is not said to die without issue, whose wife is with child at his death; yet that rule ought to take place, when it tendeth to the benefit of the child, not when it tendeth to the prejudice, of the child, or any benefit of another. Wherefore,\u201d (says the writer,) \u201cif the testator make thee his executor, or give thee one hundred pounds, if he die without issue, after which will was made, he dieth, leaving his wife with child; in this case he is reported to die without issue; and so thou art admitted to the executorship, and mayest rebeive thy legacy; unless it be more beneficial to the child that his father should have been reputed to have died without issue; for then thou are excluded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">The principle as above stated, although not engrafted into the Common Law without jealousy, may now be taken as firmly established. The rule unquestionably is, that an infant in <em>ventre sa </em>mere, shall be considered, generally speaking, as born for all purposes, <em>for his own benefit. </em>Watk. Law of Descents, 142; <em>Doe </em>v. Clark, 2 H. Bl. 401; 1 Ves. 85; <em>Miller </em>v. Turner, 3 Br. C. Rep. 391; <em>Hall </em>v. <em>Chapman; Smith </em>v. <em>Duffield, </em>5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 40, and a variety of other cases, which I am not permitted to cite.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">The inquiry will then be, is it the interest.of Alexander to take under the will ? and it is clear that it is not. By the act of 1794, before referred to, if the father be deemed and construed, to have died intestate so far as regards him, he will be entitled to one-third of two-thirds of the estate. Now the case stated, supposes the testator to have died worth about 36,000 dollars, we will say personal estate, for even if part were real, it will make no material difference on the result. Of this sum, Alexander\u2019s share will be $8,000, if divided on the principles of the intestate laws; whereas, if he be construed to be a devisee under the will, he will be entitled to 4,000 dollars, merely. And, besides, this construction would not only be to his prejudice, but it would injure his brother and sister, who, in *the view we have taken of r^oo-) -i the case, will be entitled to $4,666, instead of $4,000. \u25a0- -*</p>\n<p id=\"b235-8\">A reason given in some of the cases, for including children, in <em>ventre sa </em>mere, in the words \u201cliving at the death,\u201d is from the presumed intention of the testator, arising from the moral obligation of a parent to provide for his offspring, a reason hardly applicable to a case like the present, where the law has made so ample a provision, in favour of the posthumous child. It would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>seem, therefore, that the rule ought to be in this state, and that an infant in <em>ventre sa mere, </em>shall not be taken to be embraced, <em>\u00b6 rima facie, </em>within these words; and particularly when it works an injury to the other children, unless it can be affirmatively shown, that it is for his benefit, or there may be other circumstances in the will, which clearly indicate such to be the intention of the testator. But be this as it may, yet the rule being adopted on a presumed intention of the testator, the presumption, like every other presumption, may be rebutted by other parts of the will, aided, as it may be, by the state of the property, and the situation of the family. 5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 39. <em>Swift </em>v. <em>Duffield.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">It has been conjectured, and not without a show of reason, that the testator thought himself richer than he really was. From the devise to his collateral relatives, it would seem that he supposed himself worth about 60,000 dollars. This estimate of the value of his property, would leave each of his children born, 10,000 dollars, a sum, it may be, in his apprehension, amply sufficient for their education and commencement in life; but if he had had an idea that his wife was then pregnant, it is thought he would not have made a will by which the provision for his children born, would be materially reduced. But there are other parts of the will which are entitled to weight in arriving at the intention of the testator; which, after all, is the governing rule. Several circumstances have been relied on at the bar, which would seem to indicate that an after born child was not in the contemplation of the testator, at the time he made his will. I shall advert to but one, although the others seem to throw some light on the transaction. After the devise to his children, the testator proceeds; \u201cAnd it is my desire and will, that the share or part of my personal estate, herein devised to my children, shall be put out at interest, and managed by my executors hereinafter named, to the best advantage, until my said children shall attain to full age, or be married; the income and interest to be paid over to their <em>guardians hereinafter named; </em>and as to the real estate hereby devised, the same is to be subject to the power of sale hereinafter directed; and the said income of the real estate herein devised to my children, so long as it shall remain unsold, .shall be received by my executors, and paid over to the guardians, respectively, of my children, until they severally attain full age, or marriage.\u201d In a subsequent part of the will, the testator r*2221 says&gt; I constitute and appoint *my brother-in- *- -&gt; law, Joseph Mosher, Esq. of Lancaster county, to be guardian of the person and estate of my daughter <em>Isabella ; </em>and my friend Frederick V. Krug, of this city, guardian of the person and estate, of my son, <em>James.\" </em>This clause, would seem to be somewhat irreconcilable with the idea, that the testator was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>aware of the pregnancy of his wife, and intended, by the words \u201c living at his death,\u201d to include the child in <em>ventre sa mere ; </em>for if that had been so, it is probable he would have made a similar provision in reference to such an event. The conclusion would then be, that James and Isabella, for whom guardians are appointed, are children to whom the interest and income of the, estate are to be paid. The words of the will are, \u201c the income of the real estate, herein devised to my children, so long as it remains unsold, is to be paid to these guardians,\u201d that is, to the guardians of James and Isabella.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Supposing, then, that Alexander does not take under the will, the next question is, whether this works a total revocation of the will, or is a revocation of the will <em>pro tanto. </em>The legislature appears to have been very guarded, in the terms used in the acts of 1748, and 1794. The marriage or birth of a child, revokes a will, only so <em>far as regards the widow, or child or children after horn. </em>These acts provide, that such child or children, shall be entitled to such purparts, shares, and dividends of the estate, real and personal, of the deceased, as if he or she had actually died without will. I cannot believe that if the legislature had intended that marriage or birth of a child should amount to a total revocation, they would have used this language. It was the persons only, who were not included in the will, that they intended to protect; leaving the will, in all other respects, as it had been made by the testator. It is not to be disguised, that this will sometimes lead to difficult and perplexing questions; and whether a total revocation would not have been a better provision may admit of doubt; but the legislature not having thought proper to do so, it is not for us, on a presumed inconvenience, to dispense with words which so clearly indicate their intention. And this would appear to be the opinion of this court, in <em>Coates </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>3 Bin. 498.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">In that case, it was ruled, that a subsequent marriage and birth of a child, did not amount to a total revocation of a will. The appointment of an executor, with power to sell, was held good, notwithstanding; upon the principle that it amount to a revocation, <em>pro tanto </em>only.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">.The next inquiry will be, in what manner is Alexander\u2019s share of the estate to be deducted. Alexander is entitled to one-half of two-thirds of the estate, as in case of intestacy, that is to say, taking the estate to be worth $36,000, the widow would be entitled to one-third, viz. $12,000, and the remaining two-thirds, viz. $24,000, must be divided by three, the number of children, which would make the share of Alexander $8,000. This $8,000, we are of opinion, should in the first place, be deducted from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>[-*999-1 whole amount of the estate; *and the remainder, viz. L J $28,000, should be divided into three equal portions; one-third to the widow, one-third to the two children, Isabella, and James, and the remaining third, to the collateral relatives named in the will. We conceive that the portion allotted by the act to Alexander, must like a debt, be first paid, and the residue only remains, to answer the exigencies of the will. We are sensible that this will sometimes interfere with the intention of the testator, but this is a consequence which cannot be avoided, without dispensing with what the legislature have thought of paramount importance; to prevent the disinherison of after born children.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">From the case stated, it will appear that there will be a deficiency of assets to pay the legacies contemplated in the third class. I see nothing in the will to prevent the operation of the rule, that the abatement must be in equal proportions. The general rule is, that among legatees, who are volunteers, in their nature general, there is no preference of payment; they shall all abate together, and porportionably, in case of a deficiency of assets, to pay them all.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">Since the argument of the cause, it has been stated to us by the counsel, that it has been ascertained that the testator was aware of the pregnancy of his wife. This circumstance makes no alteration in the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-9\">Cited by Counsel, 6 Casey, 174; 11 Wright, 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-10\">Cited by the Court, 10 Casey, 487.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-11\">Followed, 3 Wright, 119.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
