I made application to Thomas Yoight, and obtained a promise from him, to let Mr. Sims have four thousand dollars, upon the office certificates proving satisfactory. I made the usual application to the different offices <em>f v </em>certificates, and upon obtaining them, there appeared upon ' from the District Court, a judgment obtained by Alexane Henry against Joseph Sims, for ten thousand six hundred do. lars. I showed the certificates to Joseph Sims, the defendant in that action and plaintiff in this, who told me it was paid, and thought there must be some mistake, and that satisfaction was surely entered. He sent me to his assignees for evidence of r*1891 *Paymenb and I got from Mr. B. Jones a statement to *- J that effect. I then stated the circumstances to Yoight, but he refused to lend the money, alleging that both Mr. Jones and Mr. Sims were to. be considered as defendants, and he Avanted something from the plaintiff, Alexander Henry. I then went with the certificate in my hand to Alexander Henry\u2019s counting-house, and exhibiting the certificate and the statement of Mr. Jones, I stated the difficulties which had taken place in obtaining the loan and the impossibility of getting the money. He read the certificate, and he then said, that the statement of debt, interest, and costs, having been paid, was all perfectly correct; that he did not know why it was not entered: that the whole business was committed to the care of his counsel, William H. Tod, and that he (W. H. T.) must still attend to do what was necessary. I told him, that my object Avas to get satisfaction now, and that it would take him hut a few minutes to go round to the office and enter satisfaction, if he knew the facts to be as represented, that the debt, interest, and costs were paid. He said he knew the business was all settled, but he would not meddle with it himself; I must go to Mr. Tod. I think there was a conversation took place on the subject of the satisfaction fee, in Avhich I told him if it was not paid, I would pay it. Of this, however, I am not so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number>certain as of the other parts of my deposition. I represented to him the circumstances in which Mr. Sims was then placed, in regard to his assignees, telling him there was a balance which the assignees insisted upon having, before they would execute a reassignment. After considerable further effort with Alexander Henry, I went to W. H. Tod, and stated what had taken place, and that I had been sent to him by Alexander Henry, and made the same representation to him and wished him to do what was requisite in that case. He said Mr. Henry must enter satisfaction ; took down his docket or receipt book and showed me that not only was the judgment paid, but that he had also paid it over to Alexander Henry. ' He then told me to go to Henry and tell him to enter satisfaction. I went back the same day to Voight, and stated their representations to him, but he positively refused to let Joseph Sims have the money. He said, he thought they could have no difficulty in entering satisfaction, if it was as it was represented. The next day, I think, I took Voight with me to the prothonotary\u2019s office, and showed him that it was a judgment on a <em>scire facias. </em>He was still uneasy and unwilling; and said he could not understand why they would not enter satisfaction. I then went again to Alexander Henry\u2019s counting-house and missed seeing him, but saw his clerk, who took down the ledger, and showed me that the account was balanced. I went a third time to Alexander Henry. I saw him, and the same kind of conversation took place as before. I also told him what W. H. Tod said, and what Voight said. Alexander Henry said in reply, that he would not have any thing to do with it, and that Mr. Tod must do it himself. *1 then left the counting-house and pign-i haye never seen him since upon that subject. With very *- -* great difficulty, I at length finally succeeded in getting the money.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-7\">On his cross-examination the witness said:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b203-8\">\u201c That at his first interview with Alexander Henry, as stated in his deposition in chief, he thinks George Williams was in the counting-house of Alexander Henry. He speaks with confidence when he says so. He sat reading a newspaper. He does not recollect any other person then to have been present with Mr. Henry, but his clerk. It was the same man who afterwards took down the ledger and showed the' deponent Mr. Sims\u2019 account, as stated above. He is under the impression, that on his interview with Mr. William H. Tod, Mr. Tod stated that John Wharton was the purchaser, but cannot say what reasons he gave for not having entered satisfaction. On the deponent\u2019s second interview with Mr. Henry, he did not state what W. H. Tod assigned as his reason for not entering satisfaction on the docket, of the judgment in the case of <em>Henry </em>v. <em>Sims. </em>At the second interview <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>with Mr. Henry, the deponent does not believe that there was any body there but Mr. Henry. He is under the impression that at the first interview, there was' another person passing in and out of Mr. Henry\u2019s counting-house, but cannot speak positively. But at the second, he does not think there was any person passed in or out of the counting-house. The deponent cannot say whether Mr. Tod did or did not certify on the face of the certificate of judgments, that the one in question was satisfied. But the certificate is in the hands of Mr. Yoight'. The deponent does not know that Mr. Sims sustained any actual loss from the circumstances he has detailed in evidence, and Mr. Henry\u2019s declining to enter satisfaction on the record of the judgment, but a little delay, as the deponent afterwards procured the money from Mr. Yoight, without any alteration of the circumstances of the case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-6\">The delay, the deponent should think, was hardly a week. He thinks he told Mr. Tod, that Mr. Henry said, that he, <em>W. </em>H. Tod, should enter satisfaction, but he never went but once to <em>W. </em>H. Tod\u2019s office on the subject. The mortgage on which the judgment was entered, was satisfied on the record at the recorder\u2019s office; but the judgment thereon in the prothonotary\u2019s office was not satisfied on record. The deponent is positive, that he never tendered to Mr. Henry any money for the fee for entering satisfaction.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-7\">The plaintiff then read a certificate from the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas for the county of Philadelphia, certifying that he found no unsatisfied judgment against Joseph Sims; which was dated 21st February, 1828, also a certificate from the prothonotary of the District Court, for the city and county of Philadelphia, in which he certified that on examination of the judgment docket of the said court, from December Term, r*19Tl one thousand eight hundred *and twenty-two, to the L J nineteenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-eight, he found the following judgments entered within that period against Joseph Sims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b204-8\">\u201cAlexander Henry <em>v. </em>Jos.

I cannot recollect the date of the application, nor the date of the mortgage. It was in the fall; there was considerable difficulty as concerned the searches, more particularly as regarded a judgment by Mr. Henry. There had been no satisfaction entered on the judgment for $10,600; Mr. Carmalt was acting as agent for me also, he was the person I always employed \u2014 I refused to lend the money until I was satisfied. Mr. Sims called and Mr. Carmalt called together occasionally on me. The certificate from the District Court of Philadelphia county, is the certificate I refer to; on that certificate I let him have the money. The delay might probably be ten days or two weeks; the date of the mortgage must have been r*1 Q31 about *the date of the searches in the District Court. *- -\u2022 The date of the mortgage was 19th February, 1828.

The act of 1791, was not intended to provide for such a case as the present. It is obviously and properly confined to judgment for the recovery of money. The penalty, which is to be not more than half the \u201cdebt or damages,\u201d for which the judgment was given, proves this. There are several species of judgments which could not have been within the contemplation of the legislature. A judgment in partition, in dower, and other real actions, certainly cannot be <em>satisfied, </em>in the legal sense, yet \u2022such judgments are docketted, and appear on the certificates. A <em>scire facias </em>upon a mortgage is a proceeding peculiar to Pennsylvania. It was given by the act of 1705, and supplies the place of the Rill in Equity. It is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>merely. The 6th section of the act of 1705, directs what judgment shall be entered. It is a judgment specifically <em>de terris. </em>The practice is to enter judgment merely. It is true, that in this case, the agreement was, that judgment should be entered for 10,600 dollars, as on an award of arbitrators; but this must be taken with reference to the <em>scire facias, </em>and the act of 1705; and the short minutes of our dockets are only the materials from which the record is constructed, <em>Mercer </em>v. <em>Watson, </em>(1 Watts, 358.) It is said that this judgment appeared from the certificate to be a general judgment. So would other judgments which are clearly not within the act. A slight examination of the record would show that it was not a lien beyond the mortgaged premises. Here, PI 951 *there was the return of the sheriff, showing that the property mortgaged had been sold and the plaintiff satisfied. The act of 28th March, 1715, requires the mortgagee to enter satisfaction of his mortgage in the Recorder\u2019s Office, within three months after notice, under a penalty not exceeding the mortgage money. In this case, satisfaction had been entered on the mortgage. The certificates produced by the plaintiff, show the practice and understanding of scriveners on this point.</p>\n<p data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b208-10\">2. The plaintiff, in this case, was not within the act of 1791. He had made an assignment of all his estate; and there had been a sale by the sheriff, under a <em>levari facias. </em>If any one had a right to complain, it was the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale. There <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>ought to have been some evidence to show that the plaintiff was damnified. The act of 31st March, 1823, \u00a7 2, which is in <em>pari materia, </em>speaks of the person damnified.</p>\n<p data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-6\">3. The judgment ought to have been entered for nominal damages only. The evidence shows that it was not a case for more. [Rogers, J. \u2014 How can we go into the evidence before the jury of inquiry? May they not have had other evidence than that set forth in the demurrer?] I apprehend not. The only way to correct mistakes of the inquest, is by application to the court from which the writ of inquiry issues; and a party is entitled to a revision of the opinion of that court, by writ of error.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"86\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-7\">Mr. <em>D. P. Brown, </em>and Mr. <em>Tilghman, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"87\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-8\">The only question for the court upon this writ of error is, whether the judgment in the case of <em>Senry </em>v. <em>Sims, </em>was a judgment for debt or damages, within the act of 1791. The verdicts of two juries in the court below, have settled the question of inconvenience, and show that the plaintiff has sustained damages. This court cannot enter into the consideration of inferences from matters of fact, which may be drawn by a jury. The record shows that there was a judgment for money against Mr. Sims. The plaintiff treated it as a judgment for money, and by means of so considering it, obtained compound interest according to the practice in computing interest upon a <em>scire facias. </em>If Mr. Sims had appealed from an award of arbitrators in this <em>scire facias, </em>he would have been required to give security in double the amount of the judgment. This shows that it was a judgment for money. And such has been from the earliest times, the practice in entering judgments upon a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage. A mortgage is commonly given to secure payment of a bond. If judgment be entered upon the bond, does the entry of satisfaction of such judgment relieve the mortgagee from the penalty for not entering satisfaction on the mortgage ? The circumstance that the mortgage in this case, was satisfied, is of no importance, since the act of 1791 was intended to protect defendants from \u201cvexation and inconvenience;\u201d which they experience *from the existence of unsatisfied liens; and r*-|qc-i strangers camnot be expected to look into the considera- *- tion of judgments.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b209-9\">Mr. <em>Chauncey, </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"89\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b209-10\">The act of 1791, was intended to relieve against.real inconvenience and prevent substantial injury, not to authorize a suit for an imaginary or trifling evil. The preamble shows the intention, when it speaks of the \u201csubsequent purchasers of real property.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>[Huston, J. \u2014 Suppose a man have no real estate; would he not be within the act ?] I presume he would, but it must be such a judgment as would import a debt and affect his credit.</p>\n<p data-order=\"90\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-6\">1. A judgment in a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, is not to be considered any thing more than an order of sale of the mortgaged premises. If it were a judgment for \u201cdebt or damages\u201d within the act of 1791, it would be a lien on other real estate of the defendant; which it certainly is not. It is not the basis of any subsequent proceeding. [Huston, J. \u2014 If the judgment upon this kind of <em>seire facias </em>is more than a year old, is it not the practice to issue a <em>scire facias .quare executio nonf\\ </em>It is the practice, but I do not admit it to be necessary. At all events, it cannot enlarge the sphere of the original judgment.</p>\n<p data-order=\"91\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-7\">2. The assignees of Mr. Sims were the real defendants in the <em>scire facias, </em>since they confessed the judgment. The penalty cannot be given to two or more persons distinctly. Either the assignees or the purchaser at sheriff sale, must be considered as the party aggrieved, if any one was injured. The purchaser the sheriff\u2019s sale may have a right to keep the judgment alive, . a link in his chain of title. Suppose there are two persons of the same name, the index of judgments will not distinguish between them. This shows the necessity of looking into the record. The scruples of a lender of money, who did not choose to search the record, could not have been within the contemplation of the legislature. The record in this case shows, that the fee for entering satisfaction, was paid to the prothonotary.</p>\n<p data-order=\"92\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b210-9\">3. This is not an arbitrary penalty. ' <em>By </em>the words of the law it is to be proportioned to the injury sustained. Here, it appears, that Mr. Sims scarcely knew of the difficulty. All that is shown is, that the scrivener made two or three additional calls upon Mr. Henry. It is true, that generally, a court of error, will not look into the proceedings of a jury in the court below. Here, however, the evidence was all on paper. It was not like the case of a judgment by default. The inquest had no more authority to receive additional evidence, than the jury at the bar, if they had been required to assess the damages. The court below decided that the jury might give more than nominal damages; although the plaintiff had given no evidence of any damage; and this appears upon the record.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"93\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"AU6\">*The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"ALK\">Huston, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Agb\">Joseph Sims was plaintiff below, and brought a suit against Alexander Henry, on the 14th section of the act of 15th of April, 1791, which is in these words; \u201cWhereas, it frequently happens, that judgments long remain unsatisfied on record, although the moneys for which those judgments have been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>rendered, are justly discharged, whereby defendants, in such cases, as well as the subsequent purchasers of real property suffer much vexation and ineonveniepce; <em>Be it enacted, </em>that each and every person having received satisfaction for his or their debt or damages, recovered by judgment in any court of record within this commonwealth, shall at the request of the defendant or defendants in the action, or of his, her, or their legal representatives, or other persons concerned in interest therein, on payment of the costs of suit, and on tender of his reasonable charges and the costs of office for entering satisfaction, within eighty days after such request made, enter satisfaction of the judgment in the office of the prothonotary of the court, where such judgment was or shall be entered; which shall for ever thereafter discharge, defeat, and release the same: and if such person having received such satisfaction as aforesaid, by himself or his attorney, shall not within eighty days after request and payment of the costs of suit, and tender of charges as aforesaid, repair to the said office, and there enter satisfaction as aforesaid, he, she, or they, neglecting or refusing so to do, shall forfeit and pay unto the party or parties aggrieved any sum of money not exceeding one half of the debt or damages so adjudged and recovered, to be sued for and demanded, by the defendant or persons damnified, in like manner as other debts are now recoverable by law in this commonwealth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">Joseph Sims had given to Alexander Henry, .a mortgage to secure the payment of 10,000 dollars and interest. Alexander Henry had sued out a <em>scire facias </em>on this mortgage, and on the 23d of June, 1823, the defendant agreed to a judgment, as if on a report of arbitrators, for 10,600 dollars, and judgment thereon was on that day entered on the docket; but entered, as usual in this state, by setting down the date, and writing the word <em>judgment. </em>The defendant below gave no evidence; the jury gave a verdict for 2500 dollars; a former jury had given 3,000 dollars, which the court had set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">Mr. Henry had issued a <em>levari facias, </em>and sold the property mortgaged, or a part of it, (and it did not appear which,) and had received the whole of his debt and interest; and the costs of all the offices, including the prothonotary\u2019s fee on entering satisfaction, had been paid out of the proceeds of the sale. Both parties lived in this'city.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-8\">Two matters of defence were relied on. 1. That the judgment which was plainly entered in the usual form on the' docket, was not *such a judgment as is contemplated by the act p*-, qo-. above cited; and a distinction was shown to exist in -J England, betw\u00e9en a judgment in a common adversary suit for debt or damages, which is that the plaintiff shall recover, &amp;c. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number><em>(quod </em>recuperet) and a judgment on a <em>scire facias, </em>which is, that plaintiff shall have execution, &amp;c. Admit this to be so in England, where, perhaps, no <em>scire facias </em>ever issues except on a judgment or recognizance of record in the court which issues the <em>scire facias. </em>But here, we issue in the Common Pleas, a <em>scire facias </em>on a recognizance taken in the Quarter' Sessions or other criminal court; on a recognizance taken in the Orphans\u2019 Court; on the recognizance of a sheriff or coroner, and sureties taken and recorded in the recorder\u2019s office, and on a mortgage and many other matters. And long and uninterrupted usage has sanctioned, or perhaps the nature of the proceeding required, that the judgment on the <em>scire facias </em>should be <em>quod recuperet. </em>An old act of Assembly gives interest on a judgment in this state, from the time of entering judgment; and, perhaps, from that reason, on a <em>scire facias </em>to show cause why an execution should not issue on a judgment a year old, the judgment here is, that plaintiff recovers his debt and interest; and the year having elapsed, a second <em>scire facias </em>issues, to show cause why execution should not issue on the judgment obtained on the first <em>scire facias, </em>and so on; the principal and interest being joined to make the amount of each new judgment. I brought this matter before the Supreme Court, in the case of <em>Fries </em>against <em>Watson, </em>(5 Binn. 226,) Avhere the plaintiff by issuing a <em>scire facis </em>every .year, for a long time, had, in fact, been getting interest on interest. Judge Tilghman was so struck with the oppression of that case, that it Avas held under advisement; but the result was that the practice, though directly contrary to the law and practice in England, was too old, and too well established to be altered, except by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-6\">But the 6th section of the act of 1705, was read and relied on. That act prescribes the mode of proceeding to collect the money due on a mortgage; a <em>scire facias </em>is to issue, summoning the defendant to appear and show cause, if any he hath, why the mortgaged premises should not be seized and taken in execution, to pay the mortgage money with interest. It then proceeds to allow of defence by the mortgagor and pleas, and that he may show that the whole or part of the debt is paid, &amp;c. &amp;c.; or if he does not appear, an inquest in certain cases is to ascertain the amount due, \u201c and the definitive judgment, as well as all other judgments to be given upon such <em>scire facias, </em>shall be entered, that the plaintiff, in such <em>scire facias </em>shall have execution by <em>levari facias, </em>directed to the proper officer;\u201d by virtue of which the mortgaged premises are to be sold, &amp;c.; and it was strenuously contended, that this act was express, that the judgment should be only that execution should issue. I do not admit this construction, and if I did, the consequence contended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>Nor would not follow. The act does not purport to give 99-1 the terms of the judgment, except in one particular; it L -* designates the kind of execution, viz. a <em>levari facias. </em>It does not say it shall be for the sum found by the jury; it does not even state that the judgment or the execution shall effect the lands alone which were mortgaged. The officer is directed to take and expose to sale the mortgaged premises; and the judgment must be to levy the debt of those lands; but this arises from the nature of the proceedings ; it is not directed by the act. The words <em>\u201c </em>definitive judgment, as well as all other judgments,\u201d refer, I suppose, to the judgment first had in court, and to judgment on a <em>scire facias </em>to revive that judgment, if no execution has issued on it within a year. It is admitted that the constant practice has been to issue a <em>scire facias </em>to revive the first judgment, where execution has not issued within a year; and that the amount of the first judgment and interest from its date, added together, make the amount of a second judgment, and so on as often as a <em>scire facias </em>issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">A judgment may be <em>quod </em>recuperet, and yet be, that it. be levied from particular lands; as a judgment against a devisee of lands devised, subject to the payment of a particular sum. So one of several heirs takes land at a valuation in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and enters into recognizance to pay money to another heir, and then sells the lands; and debt is brought or <em>scire facias, </em>on the recognizance, with notice to the terre tenant; on such suit, the judgment is, as to.the terre tenant, to be levied of the lands bound by the recognizance. Yet, in both these cases, there is a judgment within the letter and spirit, too, of the act first cited; if the amount due on such judgment is paid, and after request the plaintiff does not enter satisfaction on such judgment, I can find no reason why he is not liable to the penalty. \u201cEach and every person having received satisfaction for his or their debt or damages recovered by <em>any judgment </em>in <em>any court of record,\u201d </em>would seem to take in every judgment on which any execution could issue or which bound any land; and if it does not include every judgment in every court of record, which can be satisfied, and has been satisfied by payment of money, I do not see how it can include any judgment. It is not left to this or any other court to discriminate. There may be a definitive judgment on a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage; and the act in question has no restriction to the peculiar process by which the judgment was brought into court: nor to whether it binds all lands of the defendant, or only part of his lands; or whether he has any lands to be bound by it, or not. I then suppose, that the practice, as far back as we have information of the mode of entering judgment on a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, though questionable at first, is like the judgment on a <em>scire facias </em>to show cause why an execution should not issue, too old and too well established to be now altered; and that a judgment that r*2001 execution issue, is *as much within the letter and spirit L -* of the act first cited, as a judgment <em>quod recuperet: </em>It is a judgment which binds lands, on which an execution may issue for debts or damages; and if the debt or damages are paid, and satisfaction is not entered on request, the party may incur the penalty of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">The other objection urged, was to the damages. It is so well settled, that a court of error cannot reverse on that account, that it might seem enough to say that the only remedy for this was by a motion for a new trial; but it was insisted that there may be cases where the court are bound to' tell a jury that only nominal damages can be given, and that this is one of those cases. I will observe that the court here were not asked to tell the jury so. There would be no end of reversing judgments, if we should reverse because the court did not, in every case lay down the law on every point which can be made in a cause, although the point was not brought to their consideration. But I doubt whether there is any general rule, which, under all circumstances, will authorize a court to tell a jury they must find only nominal damages. When an act is done which really injures no one, and is done for the purpose of trying a right, nominal damages, are generally directed; but if, from the evidence, the jury believe, that though\" nominally, to try a right, yet in fact it was done maliciously, or vexatiously, or insolently, with intention to injure at least the feelings of the other party; they may go beyond nominal damages; and if the court set aside one verdict and a second jury find in the same manner, I would not advise a judge to set it aside, on the same account; for it is the legitimate province of a jury to find not only that a fact was done, but- what were really the motives and manner of doing it. There is nothing in the act in question from which it can be even inferred that the amount of the verdict should depend on the damages actually sustained. The object is to compel a man to do a plain act of justice, the omission to do which may be vexatious or injurious to another. There is a description of those who may sue, in three several clauses of the act; first, the the defendant or his respresentatives; next, the party grieved; and then, the defendant in the judgment, or the party damnified, and they all mean the same thing; the defendant, or party damnified, cannot, in this place, be tortured to mean that no person can sue and recover unless he has sustained actual damage. I do not say, that if actual damage has been sustained, it may not form a proper subject of consideration with a jury; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>an insolvent person may sue and recover; a man who never owned any lands may sue and recover; and the obstinacy of the plaintiff in the judgment in refusing to enter satisfaction; the manner of refusing; the hardship of the refusal; in short, every thing which can and does make acts the subject of praise or censure; as of honesty or dishonesty, of kindness or cruelty, may enter into the consideration of the jury; and *1 doubt whether there is any case under this act, where the money and costs are admitted to be paid, and where the plaintiff repeatedly refuses to enter satisfaction without excuse, in which a court could tell \u00e1 jury, they must find only nominal damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Wharton, 324; 4 Id. 415; 7 Casey, 108; 8 Id. 429.</p>\n<p id=\"AFG\">Cited by the Court, 1 P.
