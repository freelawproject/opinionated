The court below erred in deciding that the judgment obtained by the commissioners of the District of Spring Garden against Catharine Bull, administratrix <em>cum testamento annexo </em>of John .Bull, under which the premises in question were sold, was void, and that the sheriff\u2019s sale possessed no title.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b255-12\">2. They erred in deciding that, upon the evidence, the title to the premises was with the defendant in error, and not with the plaintiffs.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b255-13\">Mr. Kittera, for the plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9-\">The District Court gave judgment for the plaintiffs, on the ground that the debt for which judgment in the original suit was confessed by the administratrix, arose six years after the death of the testator, and that the judgment was on that ground invalid against the heirs. Now, the act of the 3d of March, 1818, (7 Sm. L. 60,) gives a lien to the commissioners of Spring Garden, for the cost of paving in front of vacant lots. The commissioners had power to sell at public sale, and their authority being <em>in rem, </em>it is of no consequence that the form of action may have been misconceived. The plaintiff in error is a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from one who bought at sheriff\u2019s sale, and would be entitled to the protection of the ninth section of the act of 1705, if the judgment were reversed. Here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>however, the judgment is in full force. The inconveniences would be very great, if purchasers at sheriff\u2019s sale are to be affected Avith matters that do not appear on the record. <em>Young </em>v. Taylor, (2 Binn. 218); <em>Wright </em>v. Deklyne, (1 Peters\u2019 C. C. Rep. 202); <em>Hartshorne </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>(2 Halsted, 108.) Th\u00e9 administratrix had a right to confess a judgment; and to support it,, the court will presume that the contract for this paving was made in the life time of the testator, or that he Avas living in 1820. The <em>statement </em>may be rejected as surplusage, since tbe judgment would have been good Avithout it. The plaintiff in error, in the belief of his having a good title, paid off the ground rent.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b256-6\">[In answer to an inquiry by the Ch. Justice, it was stated that the court beloAV imposed a condition upon the plaintiffs, that they should refund the amount paid by the defendant to extinguish the ground rent, and that the plaintiffs had entered into a stipulation accordingly.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b256-7\">Mr. <em>Hopkins,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A_7\">(with whom was Mr. <em>Tilghman,) </em>was stopped by the court.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b256-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Asc\">As the judgment was confessed by the administratrix, for a debt incurred after the death of the decedent, it r*24n was *suffered by her clearly in her oivn right'; her being *- -I named as administratrix being but description or surplus-age ; and a sale under it of the decedent\u2019s land, therefore, passed no title. But even if viewed as a judgment against her in auter droit, a sale under it would have no greater consequence, as the judgment, not being founded on a true demand against the- decedent, would be collusive; and the nature of the claim appearing on the face of the declaration, would affect the purchaser with notice. Still further, the lien of the decedent\u2019s creditors had expired, and a judgment suffered by his personal representative could not affect his land. On all these grounds judgment Avas properly given for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
