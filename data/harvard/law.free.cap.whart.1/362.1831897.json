To the best of my recollection, the company consisted of Dr. Elkinton. First time I saw him. Mr. Stevenson. The other company I can\u2019t recollect. Think Mr. Dunton was present and Ann Delamater. I think Mr. Dunton had the paper in his possession down stairs. It was signed up stairs in the back parlour. Dr. Elkinton, Mr. Stevenson and three or four friends from Princeton were present. I can\u2019t particularly mention the conversation. It was down in the kitchen that I first saw them. As respects any particular conversation I can\u2019t speak positively. Previous to the paper being signed the circumstances were not very agreeable. I can\u2019t say particularly what the circumstances were. There was no threatening language. He told Mrs. Dunton something like he did not think it right the house should be kept open, though the house was her own. He signified about paying attention to company, when she should be attending to the business he came after. I can\u2019t say particularly whether he read the paper to her. He did not tell her she must sign it. I did not see the paper before it was P3681 **hat night. I don\u2019t think I did. If I recolL J lect right I went past my house to Ann\u2019s with Mr. and Mrs. Dunton. A little misunderstanding took place. I won\u2019t say for certain if Mr. Dunton read the paper that night. Unpleasant situation. Two children disputing. I viewed the visit of Mr. and Mrs. Dunton to be for the transfer of stock. I went down with Mr. Dunton to Mr. Ingersoll, as respects a correct way of doing business according to the will. I don\u2019t know who drew up the instrument. A few weeks ago I called on Mr. Dunton; he said he could prove by Mr. Ingersoll that I knew all about it, when I was at her house. Then he said they were pumping me. If I was ever consulted about the paper it must have been through the influence of Mr. Ingersoll,' as connected with other business.. It may have been. I stood as it were a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>thorn between the two. I never approved of the paper before or since. Always thought what was left out of the will was to be equally divided between the children. I see plainly as circumstances have occurred, how things stand. It was thought after the transfer took place they would be a harmonious family. Instead of that, they are not friends, and I among the rest of them as I find. It was about light in the evening when we first went there. They went in the down door stairs. She came down. A little argument arose, unpleasantly for me. I can\u2019t say what was first said. The conversation was on the transfer of the stock. Mrs. Dunton reflected on Mr. Dunton, that it was not executed down stairs. She said she would not put her foot in the house again. At that moment Ann D. came out and said she would sign it. I asked Ann D. Mr. Elkinton not present previous to her signing it. This question was down in the kitchen. I stand here disinterested, with a clear conscience. There was a little broiling down stairs. I told Ann this. I said I had one question. Well, said she, Marinus, what is it. Said I, if you sign that instrument, you will never reflect on me. No, says she, I never will. These are the words to the best of my recollection, for I was always opposed to it. This was down below. She signed it up stairs in the back room. If she had staid a moment longer it would not have been signed, for they were going away. Mrs. Dunton said she would never enter the house again. Mrs. Dunton blamed Mr. Dunton for not having it signed down stairs. Dr. Elkinton and Mr. Stevenson were not below. None below but the family. They went up from the kitchen to go away. Ann came out. I can\u2019t say if she had a pen in her hand. The gentlemen witnessed it. A short time afterwards Mr. and Mrs. D. went away. The contents of the paper were not communicated to the gentlemen who signed. I don\u2019t think it was. It was done in a moment. I know they did not read it. I suppose she was more than 21. She was more than 25. Ann is the oldest sister; I called upon you (Mr. Ingersoll) once or twice with Mr. Dunton as executor; I remember coming to consult you about transfer of stocks; Mr. Dunton came; *1 did not recollect your drawing the r*qeq-i paper; I recollect his coming in harmony and good will *- -* to me, and your drawing the instrument; I don\u2019t recollect that I intimated- any objection to your drawing this instrument; at the time it was executed I did not state my objections to Miss Delamater; I don\u2019t know that I told her any thing more than what I said before as to the question. I told her about not reflecting upon me; I don\u2019t know if it was the same evening I was at your office. In conversation with Ann, I have stated my objections to the instrument; she was an orphan; no stock in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>New Yord that I know of, was undisposed of by will; Mr. Dun-ton asked Mr. Ingersoll as to all proper proceedings under the will; I recollect Mr. Dunton having this instrument-at my house. There was some argument down stairs. She partially opposed signing it on account of the dispute. The will was the subject of conversation; I heard her say that she thought her papa meant that Caroline should have an equal proportion of the estate with her; she spoke of her father having more stock than in the will; she viewed it in that way, that her father meant an equal division between them. There was jangling about the instrument; then she made up her mind about the paper. It was a family quarrel among them; I can\u2019t say she did positively object to signing the paper down stairs. Mrs. Dunton said that in case the transfer was made, and it was not right, it should be amicably settled between them; I supposed she meant she would give back half of it. The marriage took place ten months after-wards. Nothing was said about a seal to the paper.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-5\">Ann Kremer testified as follows:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b390-6\">\u201cI heard a conversation last Tuesday week at Mr. Elkinton\u2019s, between those persons. I went there with Mr. Dunton with a view of questioning Mrs. Elkinton on account of the money signed over. She said she believed it to be an act of justice at the time. Dr. Elkinton was present. She said there was no force used when she signed the paper. She said she went to a grocery store opposite for a pen and ink. Dr. Elkinton said that as far as he knew, there Avas no force used. She said she knew perfectly well the contents of the paper when she signed it. Don\u2019t remember any thing else that he said. Don\u2019t recollect Mrs. E. saying that she signed on condition that it (the property) should be returned to her if she objected to it. Mrs. Dunton said she Avould be willing to restore it to Ann Delamater, not as Mrs. Elkinton. The conversation was long, and there was a great deal that I could not reeollect. Mrs. Elkinton said something, I do not recollect, (about a condition to the paper.) I do not recollect if she said any thing about a condition. I think Mrs. E. said something about signing on condition to restore it, and Mrs. Dunton said in ansAver that she would be Avilling to restore to her as Ann Delamater, and not as Mrs. Elkinton. I recollect hearing something of the kind about Mr. Dunton insulting her, but not as to r*370I ^at ^e^n\u00a7 *^er m\u00b0tive for signing it. Don\u2019t recollect L -* at what time she said Mr. Dunton insulted her. Can\u2019t say whether Dr. E. or Mrs. E. made the remark about the condition. No one said there was a condition <em>at the time it was signed, </em>that it should be returned if objected to. I understood it was said in conversation betAveen themselves. I think before the paper was signed. They did not say that she even had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>manded it again. I live with Mr. Dunton\u2019s father. Do not pay board there. I make my home there. I am from Wilmington, Delaware; I was born there 20 years next August. I am a niece of Mr. Dunton, Sen. Nothing particular talked over with Mr. and Mrs. Dunton. Mr. Dunton, Jr. was at the house when we went there. The object of our visit was not talked of before him. Mr. Dunton was sick when we went there. It was for the purpose of knowing whether she signed it as an act of justice. She-said she signed it believing it at the time to be an act of justice. No one else present.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-6\">Nancy McNeil testified as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b391-7\">\u201cI lived in the family of old Mr. Delamater nearly twelve years. Immediately before and up to his death. Staid there four or five weeks after his death. Up .to the time Miss Delamater gave up house-keeping. I lived there at the time Mrs. Dunton was married. He always seemed to be very attentive to his business. I have frequently seen him writing. He had a very good memory. Always seemed as if he had a most excellent memory. Always kept his faculties to the very last. I have heard him say, after Mrs. Dunton was married and settled, that he had provided well for her, and got her many good things. I have often heard him say, he would take good care of Ann. That she was not as well protected as Caroline. She had not a husband then. Caroline got bureau, carpets, &amp;c. She had a house furnished by Mr. Delamater. It was a three story brick house. Never saw Dr. Elkinton. Believe it was after Mr. Delamater died. He came there to visit a lady from New York. About three weeks after D.\u2019s death. It was in January. He died 7th of December. Had some furniture. There were some words between Mr. Dunton and Mr. Delamater. Mr. Dunton had not been to the house for some time, and Mrs. Dunton too. I think nearly a year that they abstained from coming. Mr. Delamater had a spell of sickness, and she came to see him. Mr. Dunton and Caroline were married in private, i. e. unknown to the family. The family and all of them did not like it, but they did not seem to be dissatisfied. Never saw Dr. Elkinton but once at the house.\" He had been there but one evening, and I was not at home. It was in the early part of January that he was there. I attended to the household concerns there. Kitchen below. House in Eighth street above Arch. Cellar kitchen. My general place in the house was in the kitchen. This dispute between Mr. Delamater and Mr. Dunton took place several years ago. The brother and Mr. *Dunton had the dispute at first, r^ov-i-i The brother was Mr. Caldwell. Mrs. Dunton took part with L -* her husband against Mr. Caldwell who lived there then. I can\u2019t say what he had been writing, when I saw him. It was said Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>E. came there to see a lady from New York. , I live at corner of Second and Mary streets. I keep house. Am not married. Keep store there. I left there on the 11th of January, 1830. Ann Delamater kept house for her father, after her mother\u2019s death, which was about seven years.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-5\">Ellen Pike testified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-6\">\u201c I was\u2019on a visit to Miss Delamater at the time this paper was signed. Mr. and Mrs. Dunton entered the room. Mr. Dunton laid the paper on a stand. I think it was Mr. Dunton. Ann signed it. Previously to the gentlemen witnessing the paper, she asked if it was necessary the paper should be read, and Mr. Dunton said, oh no. Mr. Stevenson and Dr. Elkinton witnessed it. This was after she signed it, but before the gentlemen witnessed it. I did not see the contents of the paper. Only saw it lying on the table. Dr. Elkinton was in the house about half an hour before the paper was signed. I was intimate with Miss Delamater. The acquaintance between her and Dr. Elkinton commenced either the 4th or 5th of January. I think the 8th. He met her at Dr. Burr\u2019s On the 8th January. Called one morning afterwards, and then was there that evening, which made the third time he had seen her. I don\u2019t think he had any knowledge of the contents of the paper when he signed it. I have every reason to believe he had not. He was in the room with me all that half hour. There was not any engagement between them of marriage at that time, I think. About three or four minutes after the paper was signed Mr. Dunton retired. He put it in his pocket directly after it was witnessed. My father, Mr. and Mrs. Dunton and Ann came into the room at the same time. The paper was signed by the door. I did not see her read it. I don\u2019t think she did read it in the room. They were down stairs together. She did not say any thing about the contents of the paper. She was out of the room, when I came in, and was out until she came in in search of an inkstand. It was about half an hour after I came, that she came in for the inkstand. She was in and out at the time. The inkstand was got in the neighbourhood somewhere. I think Mr. Dunton called on the gentlemen to witness her signature.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b392-7\">Dr. Burr proved that the acquaintance of Dr. Elkinton with Miss Delamater, commenced on the 9th of January, 1830.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-8\">Mr. <em>T.

The recitals are erroneous. Mr. Delamater is not to be considered as having died intestate with regard to this stock, since the words in the residuary clause are broad enough to carry it. But if it were otherwise, it would by no means follow that it was an accidental omission, and that he intended to place both sisters on the same footing. \u25a0 The will shows that he entertained a preference for his unmarried daughter, and if he gives her a greater proportion of his property, it will be seen that he has provided liberally for Mrs. Dunton\u2019s children. It appears that besides the 40 shares in the Bank of the United States, and 8 shares in the Bank of Pennsylvania, omitted in the will, he owned 22 shares in the Manhattan Bank of New York, and 6 shares of turnpike stock, which are not mentioned. This fact was not communicated to Miss D. at the time she was required to sign the paper.</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-6\">2. As between these parties the release was void. Miss D. stood in the relation of <em>cestui que trust </em>to Mr. Dunton; and the policy of the law wisely forbids all dealings between persons so circumstanced, whether they be in the nature of sales or gifts. It is only after the parties, being <em>sui juris, </em>have deliberately-dissolved the relation of trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>that the law permits them to enter into contracts with each other. It is true that the gift in this case is to the wife of the trustee, but the objections are as strong, and the rule equally applicable, as if the gift were directly to the husband. It is true, that Miss D. was appointed a co-executor by the will, but she never received letters testamentary, and was ignorant of her rights and powers. She was a young woman, dependent upon her sister\u2019s husband for information and counsel. The evidence shows that the paper was signed under circumstances calculated to alarm her, and to deprive her of suitable deliberation. The paper was drawn by the professional adviser of Mr. Dunton, and it does not appear that it was ever read over to her. The authorities show that it lies upon the party setting up a paper like this, to prove that the party executing it was made acquainted with all material facts and conusant of his rights. Mr. <em>Subbell </em>cited the following cases: <em>Davoue v. Fanning, </em>(2 Johns. C. R. 252); <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Mackreth, </em>(2 Br. C. C. 400); <em>Osmond </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>(3 P.

Ingersoll </em>and Mr. <em>Qhauncey, </em>for the appellees:-</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-6\">There is nothing in the circumstances of this transaction, calling upon the Court to interfere. Miss Delamater was 29 years old, a co-executor, conversant with the situation and amount of her father.\u2019s property, and better acquainted than any one else, with his intentions as to the disposition of it. The evidence taken by the auditor, shows that no improper influence was exercised. She had full time for deliberation, since the paper was not signed until more than a month after her father\u2019s will was proved. The recital of the intestacy of Mr. D. iii respect to the 43 shares, is certainly correct. To argue that bank stock will pass under a clause like that in the will, is to go further than any case has yet done. The words, \u201cthe remainder of my worldly substance,\u201d ar\u00e9 explained and controlled by what follows, viz. \u201cconsisting of furniture, bedding,\u201d &amp;c. enumerating them; and the words, \u201cclaims and demands,\u201d obviously refer to debts due to him by individuals. Then if the transaction be such that it would be supported in an ordinary case, is there any thing in the relative situation of the parties to invalidate it. There is no such rule as that a trustee cannot, under any circumstances, deal with the <em>cestui que trust. </em>It is true that contracts between them are looked upon with suspicion; but if it be shown that the parties dealt as strangers, that no undue influence was exerted, and no important information withheld, there is no reason why such contracts should not stand. <em>Morse </em>v. <em>Royal, </em>(12 Ves. 272, 3); <em>Gribson </em>v. <em>Jayer, </em>(6 Ves. 277); <em>Exparte Lacy, </em>(6 Ves. 627); 1 Cruise Dig. 538, 9, tit. 12, c. 4, \u00a7 57; <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Walker, </em>(5 Ves. 673, 13 Ves. 60); <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Tremenheere, </em>(13 Ves. 136.) At all events contracts between trustee and <em>cestui que trust </em>are not void, but voidable at the election of the latter, who will be taken to have confirmed the transaction, if he suffer any considerable time to elapse. <em>Shotwell </em>v. <em>Murray, </em>(1 Johns. C. R. 516); <em>Prevost </em>v. <em>Gratz, </em>(1 Peters\u2019 C. C. R. 364); <em>Bruch </em>v. <em>Lantz, </em>(2 Rawle, 416, 418); <em>Lister </em>v. <em>Lister, </em>(6 Ves. 231.) Here there was an acquiescence of 10 months and more. But in truth the parties did not at any time stand towards each other in the position of trustee and <em>cestui que trust. </em>Miss D. was <em>sui juris, </em>under no restraints, and possessed equal knowledge and power with Mr. Dunton. She might have taken letters testamentary at any time, and have prevented the transfer of the stock. In this case, there are none of the features which have induced the Courts to set aside conveyances or gifts. The legatee here, never was in the power or under the influence of the executor. Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Pike, the co-executor, joined in the transfer, and was competent and willing to protect her interests if they required it. Besides this was the case of an agreement between members of the same family for the quieting of controversies. And in such cases, Lord Elden said, in <em>Stockley </em>v. <em>Stockley, </em>(1 Ves. &amp; Beames, 30,) \u201cthe Court administers an equity which is not applied to agreements *generally.\u201d <em>Stapylton </em>v. <em>Stapylton, </em>(1 Atkyns, 2); <em>Cary </em>v. <em>Cary, </em>(1 Ves. 19.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b395-6\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"A0Y\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Arz\">We are called upon, not to withhold our assistance from the execution of an agreement, but to cancel a contract executed; and it is to be -noticed that there is a material difference between circumstances which require a chancellor to forbear, and those which require him to act. On a question of specific performance he may choose to be silent; and his action, being of grace and not of right, is to be directed by a sound though legal discretion. But circumstances proper for recision, involving, as they do, the control of a legal right, are necessarily of a more positive and definite cast. The consequence of the distinction is, that though equity will refuse to interfere for purposes of execution wherever it would revoke, it may refuse to revoke where it would decline to execute. A chancellor lends not assistance to an unconscionable bargain, accompanied with circumstances of suspicion though not positively unfair, as in <em>Campbell </em>v. <em>Spencer, (2 </em>Binney, 129); but hardship or suspicion of unfairness is certainly not ground .of recision. Had the title been conveyed in the case quoted, no interference of the jury or the court would have prevented a recovery. These are elementary principles about which there is no dispute. Now the grounds on which equity interferes for recision, are distinctly marked, and every case proper for this branch of its jurisdiction, is reducible to a particular head. They are principally fraud, mistake, turpitude of consideration, and circumstances entitling to relief on the principle of <em>quia timet. </em>The case at bar, cannot, consistently with its nature, be brought under either of the two last; and as there is small allegation of mistake, and still less proof of it, the contract can be successfully assailed, if at all, but for fraud proved or inferrible from want of consideration and the relation in which the parties stood.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">I have searched the proofs, without success, for anything like a suggestion of falsehood or suppression of truth. Miss Delamater had long attained the age of discretion, was conscious that the title was vested in her, and was aware that she could not be divested of it without her consent. In executing the act of trans<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>fer, she thought she was but carrying out the plan of her father; and there is nothing to show that her belief, whether well or ill founded, was generated by the arguments or suggestions of the donees: neither was she moved towards the consummation of her purpose by threats or intimidation. Mrs. Dunton had declared that she would not again enter the house if her expectations were disappointed; but, surely such a declaration is not an engine of duress, proper for the consideration of a chancellor. It is certainly not a proof of legal duress; and it has been determined in <em>Stouffer </em>v. <em>Latshaw, </em>(2 Watts, 165,) that there is *no such thing as equitable duress. The only inducement to the act not made good to the letter, is Mrs. Dunton\u2019s promise to have the matter amicably arranged, if found not to be right. Mr. Pike supposes this to have been an engagement to restore, and Ann Kremer, the other witness, speaks of it very indistinctly. It seems to have meant no more than the parties were expected to deal with each other on honour; and that is certainly not a cause for relief. In dealing with a person of weak intellect, such a promise might be a circumstantial proof of imposition; but Miss Delamater, is not alleged to have been such. We discern nothing in her conduct evincive of it. She appears to have acted on a settled conviction that her father\u2019s partial intestacy was the effect of accident, and that she was required by duty to repair it.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">If her belief in this particular were correct, and it has not been shown that it was not, the moral obligation cast upon her by the discovery of her father\u2019s intent, would be a consideration to support even an executory agreement. But to a contract executed and requiring not the interposition of a chancellor, a consideration is unnecessary. A gift cannot be retracted; and even a voluntary specialty may be enforced at law without hindrance from equity, which does not recognize the want of an actual consideration as a ground of injunction. But, without even the pretence of a consideration, the executed transfer was an irrevocable gift of the stock, though the donor may have been mistaken in the existence of some fact which was the collateral inducement to the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Did the parties stand in a relation to forbid the transaction ? The residuary bequest of \u201cfurniture, bedding, carpets, china, kitchen furniture, looking-glasses, crockery, &amp;c.,\u201d certainly did not carry the stock; nor was it embraced by the supplementary description of \u201cmoney in bank,\u201d or \u201call claims and demands of whatever nature.\u201d These, as justly remarked by the auditor, are not such as, in the ordinary sense of the words, denote bank stock. The subject of the contest, then, did not pass by the will, and the parties stood, as regards it, in no fiduciary relation whatever What then was there to prevent them from dealing for it on a footing of ordinary equality ? A trustee has been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>suffered to acquire even the trust fund, the <em>cestui que trust </em>acting with full knowledge of the circumstances and having the management of the sale. The rule was perhaps never carried so far as to prevent the parties from dealing with each other in the attitude of strangers, and at arms length; and it seems to be mitigated by recent decisions. In the English chancery it seems to be no more than this. Where the parties stood in a very confidential relation, such as guardian and ward, attorney and client, or <em>cestui que trust </em>and trustee, the party seeking to set aside the deed shall not be called on to show direct fraud; yet the burthen of proving that advantage was taken of the confidence incident to the relation will nevertheless rest on him, subject, however, to rebuttal by proof from the other *side, that the dealing r*q7fi-i was, in fact, guarded as between strangers, and without *- -\u25a0 advantage taken of influence or superior knowledge. The subject is, to say the least, eloquently discussed in <em>Hunter </em>v. Atkins, (1 Cooper\u2019s Rep. of Ld. Brougham\u2019s Decisions, 464,) to which those who choose to pursue it further, are referred. But it is proper to remark that the relation of trustee, including that of guardian and executor, is the one in respect to which the Court is the least vigilant, being most especially awake to the transactions of an attorney with his client. Now in reference to the transaction here, the relation could not be put off, for it never existed; nor did the parties treat under an impression that the stock was involved in it. Miss Delamater knew that it was not peculiarly in the control of Mr. Dunton and his wife, and that, as to ownership and everything besides, she was on a footing with them. She was in her thirtieth year, and she seems to have been every way competent to deal Avith them in this or any other transaction. But what was her relation to them even in respect to the trusts in the will ? She was joined with them in the execution of it; and though she had not acted, yet being officially and intellectually competent, she was their equal and at liberty to assume the active duties of the office Avhen she might please to do so. She was exactly informed of her position; no circumvention was practiced on her, and though she was strongly \u2014 perhaps indelicately \u2014 pressed by considerations that might operate on the sensibilities of a sister, these are referrible to the relation of blood and not of office. Even as a relative she was put on her guard by her kinsman, Mr. Pike; and the act of transfer thus performed under a sense of moral obligation \u2014 possibly a mistaken one \u2014 by a person not disqualified by imposition or any particular relation, is conclusive.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Report and decree affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Wharton, 62; 5 Id. 582; 6 Barr, 105; 3 Casey, 56; 6 Id. 93; 4 P.
