James Baxter, in the said will mentioned, returned to Philadelphia from the voyage to South America, spoken of in the will, before the death of the testator, and was resident in Philadelphia at the period of her death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b13-7\">The question was, what estate he took under the will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A3\"><em>Saly </em>and <em>F. Subbell </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AN\">contended that he took a fee. They argued that by the true construction of the will, the estate in fee simple, which was undoubtedly given to James Baxter in the first part of the will, was to be divested only in the event of his dying while absent on the contemplated voyage, without leaving issue: and that the words, \u201c <em>but depart this life without laioful issue,\u201d </em>were to be understood with reference to his absence abroad, and not as a distinct case. And James Baxter having returned home in the life time of the testator, th\u00e9 estate became absolute in him. They cited 6 Cruise\u2019s Dig. 193.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b13-9\">(7. <em>Ingersoll, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3G\">argued that the words,' <em>\u201c depart this life without lawful issue,\u201d </em>were general in their application, and *not confined to the case of absence on the voyage contemplated, and consequently, that James Baxter had *- -* only an estate in tail. He cited <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Dunwoody, </em>(17 S. &amp; R. 61); <em>Caskey v. Brewer, </em>(17 S. &amp; R. 441); <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Gerrish, </em>(5 Rawle, ); 1 Powel on Devises, 361, 363, 364, <em>n., </em>(ed. 1827.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"At\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"AR\">Gibson, C. J. \u2014</author>\n<p id=\"ANI\">The argument is, that however else the devise to the first taker may have limited the estate, he could in no event have had a fee simple, the provision for his death without issue having limited it as a fee tail by implication; and that there being a particular estate of freehold to support the limitation over as a remainder, it is not to be construed an executory devise. It is obvious, however, that a general failure of issue was not the contingency that was uppermost in the mind of the testatrix; and that it was contemplated by her but in connexion with a failure to return in a reasonable time from the voyage to South America. The devisee was a bachelor, about to proceed on a long sea-voyage, in which, should he perish, it was scarce possible that he could leave lawful issue; and the contingency of his death, would therefore present to the testatrix the idea of a dying necessarily without issue. It was therefore, of a dying without issue on that voyage, of which she spoke. She viewed the contingency for which she was going to provide, but in two aspects \u2014 of a return to Philadelphia in a reasonable time, or, as the only other alternative, death without issue abroad. \u201c Provided always, and it is my will and intention,\u201d are her words, \u201cthat in case the said James Baxter doth not return to Philadelphia from his present intended voyage to South America, or in case he doth not return to Philadelphia in a reasonable time after my death, but depart this life without lawful issue;\u201d then over. To avoid the.preceding conclusion, we are asked to put \u201cor\u201d in the place of \u201cbut,\u201d and thus make the dying without issue a distinct and independent contigency. The word \u201cor\u201d has doubtless been construed \u201c and;\u201d not, however, where it was not indispensable to some plain point of intention; and what object which the testatrix may be thought to have in vieAV, is there to be answered by the mutation desired here ? She evidently thought, that Captain Baxter would return without issue, or perish on his voyage without issue; the requirement of his presence' at home in a reasonable time after her death, being to let the estate go over on a reasonable presumption of his death. The leaving of issue abroad was a contingency not contemplated; or if contemplated, the object was to bring him back to enjoy the estate at home, instead of suffering it to go, at perhaps an indefinite time, to his offspring by a stranger, for whom she felt no affection. That being accomplished, it is evident she meant no restricted gift. It r*\u00bb-! is of weight that the devise is in fee by express *words; L -* and though the generality of such words may be restrained by implication, it never has been done but to effect some clear purpose, palpably in the testator\u2019s view. No such purpose is perceptible here, for the estate is given pretty much in the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>words and with the same encumbrances, as it is given to the devisees over, who were certainly intended to have a fee. On the face of the will, then, there is a manifest intent to give the estate absolutely if at all, and to limit a fee to the first taker, provided he returned to take possession of it in a reasonable time from the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b15-6\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">Cited by Counsel, 7 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 97.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
