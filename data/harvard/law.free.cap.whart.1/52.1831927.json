Neely, setting forth, that John Beaumont, of the County of Bucks, had, \u201cby reason of old age and long continued sickness, become so far deprived of reason and understanding, as to be wholly unfit and unable to manage his estate,\u201d and was wasting and destroying the same, the Court of Common Pleas of that County issued a commission in nature of a writ <em>de lun\u00e1tico inquirendo ; </em>upon which the commissioners and jury returned, that \u201cthe said John Beaumont, at the time of taking this inquisition, by reason of old age and long continued sickness, has become so far deprived of reason and understanding, as to be wholly unfit to manage his estate, and hath been so for the last eighteen months and upwards.\u201d The jury also found that he was of the age of 75 years. On the return of the inquest, several exceptions were filed on the part of John Beaumont. The material exception was, that the finding was defec- \u2022 tive, and insufficient to give the court jurisdiction. The Court of Court of Common Pleas being of this opinion, after argument, quashed the inquisition; and the proceedings being removed to this Court, the decision of the Court below upon this point, was assigned for error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b61-7\"><em>Mr. Ross, </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ah\">argued that under the sixth section of the fifth article of the constitution of this Commonwealth, which declares that \u201cthe Supreme Court, and the several Courts of Common Pleas, shall, besides the powers heretofore usually exercised by them, have the power of a Court of Chancery, so far as relates .to the care of the persons and estates of those who are <em>non compotes mentis,\u201d </em>the finding in this case was sufficient.

He cited Schoales &amp; Leroy\u2019s Rep. 439; Shelford on Lunacy, 22, 86, 108, 797; 1 Collinson, 148; 12 Petersdorff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>Abr. 394; 1 Ruffin\u2019s Rep. 11; 5 Halsted, 217. To show the sense in which the words, <em>\u201cnon compos mentis\" </em>were used by the legislature, the acts of 14th April, 1794, (3 Sm. L. 129,) and 7th Reb. 1814, (6 Sm. L. 104,) were cited. <em>Mr. Randall </em>also referred to the acts of 25th Feb. 1819, (7 Sm. L. 155,) and 2d April, 1822, (7 Sm.

Blackstone has been vouched; where, in the second volume of his Commentaries, 304, he says, \u201ca lunatic, or <em>non compos mentis </em>is one who hath had understanding, but by disease, grief, or other accident, hath <em>lost </em>the use of his reason. A lunatic, indeed, is properly one that hath lucid intervals: sometimes enjoying his senses, and sometimes not; and that frequently depending on the change of the moon. But under the general name of <em>non compos mentis, </em>(which Sir Edward Coke says is the most legal name,) are comprised not only lunatics, but persons under frenzies, or who <em>lose </em>their intellects by disease; those that <em>grow </em>deaf, dumb, and blind, not being <em>horn </em>so; or <em>such, in short, as are judged- by the Court of Chancery incapable of conducting their own affairs.\u201d </em>It is this latter sentence that is relied on; for which, it may be observed, the learned commentator cites no authority. Mr. Eonblanque, in his Treatise on Equity, vol. I. page 63, note, <em>p., </em>has transcribed the above passage, and observes that he was induced to do so \u201cin order to obviate *the error into which the learned commentator seems to L J have fallen, in the concluding sentence.\u201d He then proceeds by saying, that \u201cthe rules of judging upon the point of insanity being the same at law and in equity, <em>(Osmond </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>3 P. Williams, 130; <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Vade, </em>2 Atk. 327,) the Courts of Chancery cannot assume any kind of discretion upon the subject; and, therefore, in <em>Ex parte Barnsley, </em>3 Atk. 168, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>the return of the inquest, stating \u2018that W. B. was at the time of taking the inquisition, from the weakness of his mind, incapable of governing himself, and his lands and tenements,\u2019 was held illegal and void; and many adjudged cases being cited to the same effect, Lord Hardwicke congratulated himself that, except in two or three instances, the return had been that he is <em>limaticus, </em>or <em>non compos mentis, </em>or <em>insance mentis, </em>or, since the proceedings have been in English, of <em>unsound mind; </em>which amounts to the same thing.\u201d And afterwards, in 1751, Lord Hardwicke, in <em>Lord Donegal\u2019s case, </em>2 Ves. 407, according to the same principle, refused a commission of lunacy; though there appeared to be an extreme degree of weakness of understanding and imbecility of mind on the part of Lord Donegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">In order, however, to come to a correct conclusion on the present question, it is proper to inquire and to ascertain first, whether the term <em>non compos mentis, </em>had not acquired a legal and technical meaning at, and anterior to the formation of the constitution of this state, in 1791; because, if it had, I take it, that we are bound to interpret it accordingly; and this, or any other.Court in the state, has no power or authority to change it, so as to include any other description of persons in a proceeding of lunacy, than such as shall appear to come fairly within the meaning so affixed to it. Seeing we have derived the most of our legal terms and phrases, as well as principles from the English Common Law, a reference to it, and the decisions of the Courts of England in relation thereto, may not be amiss, in order to obtain some light upon the subject. Littleton, section 405, speaks of a man of <em>non sane memory, </em>as one who is <em>'non compos mentis; </em>upon which Lord Coke, in his Commentary, (Co. Lit. 246, <em>b, </em>246, <em>a,) </em>says, \u201chere Littleton explaineth a man of <em>no sound memory </em>to be <em>non compos mentis. </em>.Many times (as here it appeareth) the Latin word explaineth the <em>true sense, </em>and calleth him <em>not, amens, demens, furiosus, lunaticus, fatuus, stultus, </em>or the like; for <em>non compos mentis </em>is the most <em>sure </em>and <em>legal.\" </em>.Now, it is obvious that Lord Coke considered <em>non compos mentis </em>not only the <em>legal, </em>but the <em>sure </em>term, and <em>not, amens, demens, </em>&amp;c. He also divides <em>non compos mentis </em>into four sorts \u2014 ist. An idiot, who, from his nativity, by a perpetual infirmity, is <em>non compos mentis ; </em>2d. He that by sickness, grief, or other accident, <em>ivholly </em>loseth his memory and understanding; 3d. A lunatic, who hath sometimes his understanding and sometimes not, <em>aliquando gaudet lucidis intervaTlis ; </em>and therefore is called <em>non compos mentis, </em>so long as he <em>hath not </em>understanding. *Lastly, he that, by r*gg-| his own vicious act, for a time depriveth himself of his L memory and understanding, as he that is drunken. And this last kind of <em>non compos mentis </em>shall give no privilege or benefit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to him or his heirs.\u201d And in <em>Beverly\u2019s case, 4 </em>Co. 124, a <em>non compos mentis </em>of the second sort, is described to be \u201che who was of good and sound memory, and by the visitation of Grod <em>lost </em>it.\u201d Now, it must be admitted, that there are various degrees of memory and understanding, from that of the most powerful and vigorous, down to that of the most abject and imbecile, yet it is perfectly manifest that Littleton and Lord Coke did not consider a <em>non compos mentis </em>as embraced within any of the several grades of mind, but as one <em>wholly </em>destitute of it, at least occasionally, that is, of both memory and understanding. And such, I apprehend, was the prevailing sentiment down to the time of Lord Hardwieke, who, in 1745, decided the case of Barnsley, already mentioned, in conformity to it. In 3 Atk. 173, he says, \u201c being <em>non compos mentis, </em>of <em>unsound mind, </em>are certain terms in law, and import a <em>total deprivation of sense; </em>now weakness does not carry this idea along with it; but courts of law understand what is meant by <em>non compos, </em>or <em>insane, </em>as they are words of a determinate signification.\u201d Then he gives Lord Coke for authority, \u201cthat they are persons of <em>non sane </em>memoryand adds, \u201c <em>non compos mentis </em>is used in the statute of limitations, so that it is legitimated now, under several acts of parliament.\u201d Hence it would appear, that <em>non compos mentis </em>had become a technical term in the English law, of fixed and determinate import, denoting a person entirely destitute or bereft of his memory and understanding. And as conveying this idea, it was clearly introduced into acts of legislation in Pennsylvania, while an English province; for instance, in the \u201c act for the limitation of actions,\u201d passed the 27th of March, 1713. And since we became an independent state, it has been uniformly used by our legislature in all their acts, wherever it has been employed, in the same sense. This being the case, it cannot be doubted for a moment, but the words, <em>non compotes mentis, </em>were used by the framers of the constitution, for the purpose of giving the courts power to appoint committees, to take care of the persons and estates of such persons only, as should be found to be wholly void of memory and understanding, or in other words, of <em>unsound mind, </em>and not of such, as had, according to the finding of the inquest in this case \u201c by reason of old age and long continued sickness, become <em>so far </em>deprived of reason and understanding, as to be wholly unfit and unable to manage his estate.\u201d The reasonable inference to be drawn from the finding of the jury here is, that Beaumont was not wholly deprived of his reason and understanding ; that, on the contrary, he still retained a portion of it, but not sufficient, in their estimation, for the management of his estate, though enough, it would seem for the care of his person; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>because *they have said nothing of his incompetency for r*gg-i that purpose; and of course, the court would not have *- -* been warranted in appointing a committee to care of his person, as he was not found to be of <em>unsound </em>mind, or incapable himself of taking care of it. The finding of the jury is somewhat similar to that in <em>Cranmer\u2019s case, </em>12 Ves. 445, where they found that \u201c he was <em>so far </em>debilitated in his mind, as to be incapable of the general management of his affairs;\u201d and Lord Chancellor Erskine said, in observing upon it, \u201c how can I tell what is <em>so far </em>debilitated in his mind, as not to be equal to the general management of his affairs.\u201d He considered the finding too ambiguous, and therefore quashed the inquisition; though he was of opinion, that the evidence would have justified the jury in finding that the party was of <em>unsound mind; \u201c </em>so that he was not sufficient for the government of himself, Ids manors, &amp;c.,\u201d all of which was found by a subsequent jury and held good. It is true, however, that the Court of Chancery in England, has of late gone beyond what Lord Ilardwicke, sitting as Chancellor, thought was his proper limits; and has applied commissions, not <em>de lun\u00e1tico enquirendo, </em>however, which are uniformly applied to the case of all such as are considered <em>non compos mentis, </em>but commissions in <em>the nature of those of lunacy, </em>to cases where there is such an imbecility of mind as renders a person incompetent to the management of his affairs, or liable to be imposed on. See 1 Wooddes. 411; <em>Ridgway </em>v. <em>Darwin, </em>8 Ves. 65, 66; <em>Ex parte Cranmer, </em>12 Ves. 447, and Mr. Belt\u2019s note to Lord Donegal\u2019s case, 2 Ves. 407, 408. But this latter description of persons must not be confounded with those who are <em>non compotes mentis ; </em>whose voluntary deeds will be set aside at once upon its being shown that they were such at the time of executing them; but in regard to the like deeds of the former, it is only when connected with circumstances tending. to show that they were obtained by fraud, that they will be set aside, <em>Osmond </em>v. <em>Fitzroy, </em>3 P. Williams, 130, 131; <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>De Veulle, </em>3 Wooddes. App. 16. So in <em>Wightman </em>v. <em>Wightman, </em>4 Johns. Ch. Rep. 343, Chancellor Kent said, that idiots and lunatics are incapable of entering into the matrimonial contract; and that such marriges are <em>ipso facto </em>void, is a proposition too plain to be questioned. In short, the distinction between those who are styled <em>non compotes mentis </em>in law, and those who labour under extreme imbecility of mind is very clearly maintained throughout every part of it: and in order to prevent confusion it may be important, perhaps, that this distinction should continue to be observed. And until the legislature shall authorize the courts of this state to entertain a proceeding, with a view to deprive the latter description of persons of all control and power over their estates, they cannot take cognizance of it. The exercise of such authority over the rights of the citizens, is of too r-^cv-i much moment to be claimed by courts, unless * given *- -* expressly by the constitution or some act of the legislature, which has not been done as yet.
