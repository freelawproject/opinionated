To entitle a party to the costs of his witnesses and of the service of subpoenas upon them, it is not necessary that their names should have been inserted in the subpoenas by the Prothonotary, before delivering them to the party.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b293-18\">4. It is not necessary that witnesses should attend before the Prothonotary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>on the taxation of costs, to prove their attendance on the trial of the cause. The fact may be proved <em>aliunde.</em></headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b294-7\">5. Witnesses who attended before the Prothonotary on the taxation of costs, to prove their attendance at the trial, <em>held </em>not to be entitled to fees for such attendance before the Prothonotary.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-10\">The costs of the plaintiff in this case having been taxed by the Prothonotary, \u00a1an appeal was taken from his decision. The material exception's were as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-11\">1. To the'alio Avance of the costs of a Bill to perpetuate testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-12\">2. To the allowance of \u201cAvitness fees\u201d to members of the bar practising in the Supreme Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-13\">3. To the allowance of \u201c Avitness fees\u201d for persons whose names were placed in the subpoenas after they had issued, and without the knoAvledge of the prothonotary; such persons not haring been examined on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-14\">T*2771 *4. To the allowance of fees for serving subpoenas on *- J persons whose names were so placed on subpoenas.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-16\">5. To the allowance of \u201cwitness fees\u201d for persons who resided in the City of Philadelphia, and Avho did not attend at the taxation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b294-17\">6. To the allowance of fees to witnesses for attending before the Prothonotary on the taxation of costs.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b294-18\">Mr. <em>Randall </em>for the Defendant :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-19\">1. The costs of a Bill to perpetuate testimony cannot be charged against this defendant. 1 Maddock\u2019s Chan. 195. Act of 28 March, 1814, \u00a7 26.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-20\">2. A person who is attending Court as a juror, is not entitled to fees as a witness. Nor is a Justice of the Peace when officially attending, 6 Binn. 397. The rule must be the same with respect to a member of the bar practising in the Court in which he is called upon to testify.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-21\">3. 4. In this case the names of several persons were introduced into the subpoenas by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, after they were taken out of the office. This is a fraud upon the Prothonotary; and the plaintiff ought not to recover any costs for the witnesses in such cases, or for the service of the subpoenas upon them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-22\">[H\u00fcSTOH, J. \u2014 It is the constant practice to add names; and the Prothonotary cannot be injured if the legal fee is paid for every witness.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-23\">Rogers, J. \u2014 The practice prevails throughout the State. Blank subpoenas are frequently taken out.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b294-24\">Gtbson, C. J. \u2014 There can be no doubt of the propriety of these charges.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACca\">5. If a Avitness does not attend the taxation of costs, after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>notice, the presumption is that he relinquishes his fees. A party ought not to be allowed to prove the attendance of witnesses; since he receives their costs in the first instance.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-6\">[Huston, J. \u2014 It is certainly not necessary to produce the witnesses. If their attendance is proved by any competent person, it is sufficient. Even if the witness should be unable to state the number of days he attended, I think the fact might be proved aliunde.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-7\">6. The act of Assembly which gives 'fees to witnesses, speaks of \u201ceach day\u2019s attendance in Court.\u201d I understand that it is the practice in the District Court not to allow for attendance on taxation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b295-8\">*Mr. <em>Earle, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avm\">was requested by the Court, to r*o78I confine himself to the 1st, 2d, and 6th exceptions. -*</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-9\">1. The record shows that the testimony was taken, to be used in this case. The defendant came in, and made himself a party.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-10\">[Huston, J. \u2014 It is settled in England, that a demurrer will lie to a bill of this kind, if there is no impediment to the plaintiff trying his right at law, unless the witnesses are old and infirm. There was a case of <em>Blaine </em>v. <em>Chambers, </em>before the late Judge Smith on the Circuit, in which the rule was declared to be the same here; and his opinion was afterwards confirmed by the whole Court.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-11\">2. There is no sound reason for excluding members of the bar from fees as witnesses. They are not required to be in attendance upon the Court, excepting when their causes are on trial; and the fiction of their perpetual presence ought not to be allowed to operate against them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b295-12\">6. The witnesses attended the taxation in consequence of notice from the opposite party. This may be called \u201c attendance in Court,\u201d within the act of Assembly; since the Prothonotary is an officer of the Court, and supposed to' be in their presence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b295-13\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AHB\">The costs of the bill to perpetuate testimony must be struck out, as not having been incurred in the cause, but in a distinct proceeding. The plaintiff may yet have the benefit of the evidence against some one else, as amply as she has had it, against the defendant; and it is unfair that he alone should bear the expense of it. The charge for the attendance, as witnesses, of gentlemen of the profession, who are in contemplation of law, always present in courts, where they actually practice, must also go out. So, also, the charge for the attendance of witnesses before the Prothonotary, at the time of taxation. The practice is to take the affidavit of the party at the foot of the bill, for <em>prima facie </em>evidence of its accuracy; and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>witnesses therefore need not have been produced. The rest of the Bill is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">Taxation confirmed, subject to the preceding exceptions.</p>\n<judges id=\"b296-7\">Sergeant, J. having been of counsel with one of the parties in the case of <em>M} Williams </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>did not sit in this case.</judges>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">See 3 Wharton, 356.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
