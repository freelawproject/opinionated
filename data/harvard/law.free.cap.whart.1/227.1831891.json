The defendant relied upon a deed expressed to be for a valuable consideration; which, however, was clearly shown to be inadequate. The issue was upon the consideration, and the question of the motives or intentions of the grantor was irrelevant. The will was never proved; but, if proved, it would have been inoperative, since it was revoked by the deed set up on the other side. It was, at best, only a declaration of the grantor, which was not admissible. In support of these positions, they cited <em>Rife </em>v. <em>Galbreath, </em>(1 Penn. Rep. 204); <em>Innes </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>(1 Rawle, 374); <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Downing, </em>(4 Serg. &amp; R. 498); <em>Wolverton </em>v. <em>Hart, </em>(7 Serg. &amp; R. 273); <em>Edgar </em>v. <em>Boies, </em>11 Serg. &amp; R. 445); <em>Kendall </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>(2 Penn.

At the date of the will, and at the date of the deed, the parties stood in the relation of mortgagor and mortgagee; and it is said in the cases, that conveyances shall not be admitted ber tween such parties. <em>Webb </em>v. <em>Rourke, </em>(2 Sch. &amp; Lefroy, 661); <em>Davoue </em>v. <em>Fanning, </em>(2 Johns.

Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AOX\">The imputation of fraud rested mainly on the ground of inadequacy of consideration. Was not the will, not only competent, but powerful evidence to repel it, by showing that the grantor meant to stipulate, not for an outside price, but a living; and that, at a preceding period, when there was no imputation of imbecility on the one side, or artifice on the other, he avowed an intention to give the estate at his death to the defendant, as a gratuity ? In this aspect, the competency of the will, whether revoked or not, or otherwise avoided, as a conveyance, was unquestionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-7\">See 11 Harris, 119.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
