A release dated the 4th of August, 1829, was executed by several creditors, but not by the plaintiff in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b405-10\">It was proved by a clerk in the employ of Worley &amp; Welsh, that there was no book kept by them in the name of \u201c John Connell,\u201d and he testified that he never knew a debt contracted in that name by Worley &amp; Welsh, or any debt which had been contracted by John Connell, paid by them, and never knew of any purchase made, or act done, that indicated the existence of a partnership between Connell and Worley &amp; Welsh. After the assignment he was sent to Pittsburgh to attend to the business arising under it, where he obtained possession of the books of Connell, and from them made out a statement of Connell\u2019s debts and assets, by which it appeared, that there was a deficiency of $25407,09, which according to the representations made to him by Connell, arose between the 1st of September, 1828, and the time of the assignment in July 1829. On his cross-examination, the witness stated that Worley was not a partner in the concern at Baltimore; Welsh was engaged in a different line of business. There was no evidence on the books of Connell showing how the deficiency arose. The books were balanced to the 1st of September, 1828, when the balance in favour of Worley &amp; Welsh was $4104,29. On the 1st of January, 1829, the balance in favour of Worley &amp; Welsh on their books was $13265,32.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b406-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>\u25a0 Judge Rogers charged the jury in substance as follows :\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AcR\">\u201cThis suit is founded on an alleged partnership between Francis Worley, Thomas Welsh and John Connell, and a sale of goods to them during the existence of the partnership. To entitle the plaintiffs to recover, it is necessai-y for them to show the existence of the debt; that there was a partnership; and that the goods were furnished during the existence of the partnership. This the plaintiffs have done, 1st, by proof, that the goods were sold to John Connell at several times, viz. the 23d April, the 2d and 18th May, 1829. 2. By the articles of co-partnership of the 1st September, 1829: and this is what lawyers term a <em>prima facie </em>case, or in other words, in the absence of all proof on the part of the defendants, it is such evidence as will entitle the plaintiffs to gain a verdict. All that is necessary for a stranger to do, is to show the articles themselves. That is such \u2022 a proof of partnership as throws the burthen of proof on the other side. It is incumbent on them to show, that no act has been done in pursuance of the articles, or that the partnership has been dissolved. I do not mean here to touch.upon a point in the cause, r*38bl *which will be noticed hererafter. The agreement is limi- *- ted in point of time to three years, from the 1st of September, 1828. The goods were furnished between the 1st September, 1828, and the 18th May, 1829. And the presumption is, that the articles of copartnership were not a dead letter; but the inference is, that they were acted on by the parties according to their stipulations. So, also, the presumption is, that the goods went to the use of the firm and not to the separate use of Connell. In default, then, of any proof to the contrary, always supposing that Worley signed the articles with .the consent of Welsh, such evidence has been produced as would make it your duty to find a verdict in favour of the plaintiffs. And this brings me to the defence. If Bunderstand the defendants\u2019 counsel, it may be considered under two heads : 1. They allege fraud practised by John Connell on Worley &amp; Welsh, which, as they say, avoids the contract; and that this being the case of a dormant partnership, the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover: that the parties never acted <em>on </em>these articles, that this was not an actual, but a contemplated partnership; and that, even if a partnership once existed, there was a virtual dissolution of it before the debt was contracted. Partnership is a contract of two or more persons to place their money, effects, labour, and skill, or some, or all of them, in lawful commerce or business, and to divide the profits, and to bear the loss, in certain proportions. It is not the actual perception of profits, that constitutes a partnership, but a capability of receiving them, if made. A contract of partnership may be made, either by deed, which you know is an instrument under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>seal, or by an agreement, not under seal, as was done here. There are, you well know, several kinds of partners. An ostensible, actual or known partner, a dormant or sleeping partner, and a nominal partner. This is the case of a dormant partner; for it has been held, that where two persons were concerned together as partners, but the business was done in the name of one, and it was not generally known that they were partners, the other was a dormant partner, (5 Cowen, 534). It seems to have been the intention of all' parties, that Worley &amp; Welsh should be dormant partners. The business was to be carried on in the name of John Connell, nor was it known that any partnership existed. The plaintiffs certainly had no knowledge off any other person than John Connell at the time of the sales. This then, being the case of dormant partners, the defendants contend, that John Connell, on the 1st September, 1828, committed a fraud on Worley &amp; Welsh, and that the contract of copartnership was void, and being void, a dormant partner is not liable to suit. This brings into view a principle which is new. At least I recollect no decided case, and none has been produced. I take this to be the law. Fraud avoids all contracts, and if you should be of the opinion, that there was a fraud in the concoction or original formation of the partnership, this contract of copartnership was void; and if the ^contract was wholly void, the defendants being dormant, . and not ostensible partners, are not in general liable. The distinction is this. Whatever fraud or imposition there may be between the parties where they are known partners, cannot affect third persons, who are presumed to contract on the faith, and with a knowledge of the partnership. But that is not the ease of a dormant partner. There third persons do not credit the firm, but the individual with whom they deal. They then receive no injury. The reason why a person becomes, by implication and operation of law, clothed with the character of a partner, and as such, liable to third persons, is, that by the effect of the agreement for a participation, the .party participant takes from the creditors a part of that fund, which is the proper security to them for the satisfaction of their debts, and upon which they rely for payment. Another reason assigned for subjecting a dormant partner to responsibility is, that if he were exempted, he would receive usurious interest for his capital without its being attended with any risk. The rule, then, must be taken with this qualification, that if the dormant partnei has actually received part of the profits, or any. part of the capital, then he is liable to third persons, although there may have been fraud in the contract of partnership. He is liable, because he actually takes from the creditors a part of that fund, which is the proper security to them for satisfaction of the debts, and on which they rely for payment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>But where there is such a fraud as to avoid the contract of co-partnership between the parties, and where no part of the funds have been received by the dormant partner, in such a case, it is the opinion of the Court, that dormant partners are not liable to creditors, who give credit, not on the faith of the partnership, but of that of the individual with whom they contract. Third persons would be in no better situations than the fraudulent partner, who clearly would have no right of action against the innocent partner. If such should be your opinion of the facts, your verdict should be in favour of the defendants. And this leads to the inquiry, what facts have been proved; and this will be your duty, under some few directions which I shall give you, as to the manner in which this cause should be viewed. You will recollect that I told you, that the plaintiffs, by proof of the debt, and by the production of the articles of partnership, had exhibited a <em>prima facie </em>case; that they had shown a cause of action. This, then, shifts the proof from the plaintiffs to the defendants. As the defence consists in an allegation of fraud, it is necessary for them to prove it. The burthen of proof is thrown upon them. And here let me observe to you, that fraud is not to be <em>presumed; </em>as in the case of the imputation of every other criminal action, every man is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is made to appear. It is incumbent on the defendants to satisfy you of the fact of fraud, either by positive testimony or the proof of such circumstances as usually attend fraud. It is not left 1*3871 to *G0I1jecl;ure, but such evidence must be given as to *- -I satisfy you, that there has been a fraud or imposition practised upon the defendants by Connell, of such a nature as to avoid the contract. It is not by arguments, but by facts, that this must be made to appear. The circumstance on which the defendants mainly rely on this part of their case is, the great deficit, upwards of $28,000 which appears in the account of John Connell, from the 1st September, 1828, until his assignment in July, 1829. From this the defendants wish you to infer, that at the time the partnership was made, viz. on the 1st September, 1828, Connell must have been largely indebted, and that that fact was not communicated by Connell to the defendants. All the evidence, we have, is derived from the articles of copartnership itself. We know not what took place at their execution, for the witnesses, if any were present, have not been produced. (His Honor here read the statements contained in the articles and asked) What proof have you that these representations were not true to the letter ? If Connell was largely indebted at the time, and Worley &amp; Welsh did not choose to inquire into his circumstances, this is as much a proof of folly on their part as fraud on his. They cannot now say, there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>fraud on the part of Connell, that the contract is void, and they are hot liable as partners. The nonfulfilment of the stipulations in the partnership alone would not be such a fraud as to avoid the contract, so as to free a dormant partner from a debt, contracted by the partners. To have this effect, it must be such a fraud, as to avoid the whole contract, to make it void from the beginning. In addition to this the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel have endeavored to show the manner in which these losses occurred. Whether his explanation has been satisfactory, is for you to say. It will be for you specially, to remember that the whole burthen of proof is thrown upon the defendants. But the defendants say, that although they executed the article of the 1st September, yet, that nothing further was done in pursuance of it; that in effect, as soon as the partnership was formed it was dissolved, or that at any rate it was dissolved before the 23d of April, 1829. If this be true they are not liable. If they merely executed the articles without more, then the plaintiffs have no right of action; that is to say, if John Connell continued to carry on business on his own account, after the copartnership, and this clearly appears, the defendants cannot be charged in this suit. In such a case the partnership has not commenced, or, if commenced, it is dissolved by the act or mutual consent of both parties. When a partnership is commenced by articles unsealed, as is the case here, it is nevertheless, in legal effect, a partnership formed by parol, and consequently may be dissolved by parol. And here again, it is necessary to advert to the distinction between an ostensible and a dormant partner. In the case of a dormant partner whose name has never been announced, *he may withdraw from the concern without making r^ooo-i the dissolution of the partnership publicly known; for L J his liability depends upon the mere fact of partnership and no credit has been given to him personally as a supposed member of the firm. Not so in the case of an ostensible partner, who, on his retirement from a partnership to protect himself from liability, must give notice of the dissolution of the partnership. I incline to the opinion that, although these parties formed a partnership by articles for a definite period, it may be dissolved by either, before the period arrives. I am aware that the doctrine of the English Courts is different, and that a contrary principle has been recognized by Lord Eldon in <em>Peacock </em>v. <em>Pea</em>cock, (16 Ves. 56,) and in <em>Crowshey </em>v. <em>Maule, </em>(1 Swan. 495,) yet I hold that the American decisions are founded in the better reason, and are more calculated to advance our commercial interests. There is no such thing as an indissoluble partnership. It is revocable in its own nature, and each party may, by giving due notice, dissolve the partnership as to all future capacity of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>the firm to bind him by contract; and he has the same legal power, even though the parties had covenanted with each other, that the partnership should continue for such a period of time. The only consequence of such a revocation of the partnership power in the intermediate time, would be, that the partner would subject himself to a claim of damages for a breach of the covenant. And this, with the fact that it would be contrary to their own interest to dissolve the connection without cause, will in most cases be an effectual security. It is for the public interest that no partner should be obliged to continue in a partnership against his will, inasmuch as a community of goods in such a case engenders discord and litigation. These views are supported in <em>Marquand </em>v. <em>The New York Manufacturing Company, </em>(17 Johns. R. 525,) and in <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Dayton, </em>(19 Johns. 538.) And this is also the doctrine of the civil law, which holds, that each partner has a power to dissolve the connection at any time, notwithstanding any agreement to the contrary, and that such a power results from the nature of the association.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b410-6\">If then you should be of the opinion that nothing more was done than the mere execution of the articles of copartnership, or that the partnership was dissolved by mutual consent or by the will of one of the parties before this debt was contracted, then your verdict should be in favour of the defendants. I say before the debt was contracted ; for if the partnership was subsisting at the time of the indebtedness of the defendants, then there is nothing in the defence; that is to say, if on the 23d of April, the 2d of May, and the 18th of May, 1829, the times the debt was contracted, the defendants were the partners of John Connell, the defendant fails in this part of his defence. The plaintiffs will have acquired a vested right, of which no subsequent' dissolution can deprive him. In your deliberations on this part of the case, you will recollect the observations I made to f*3891 *y\u00b0u ano^er Part of this charge: they are strictly *- -* applicable here. The plaintiff has shown a <em>prima facie </em>case. The burthen of proof is thrown upon the defendants. The presumption is, that John Connell was trading for the company under the name or firm of John Connell, as was agreed upon in the articles. It is for the defendants to prove that no act was done in pursuance of the partnership ; and if dissolved, he should give us something from which we might be able to ascertain, with some reasonable certainty, the manner of its dissolution, when and where, and how it was dissolved. This imposes no hardship on the defendant, when he seeks to avoid a liability arising from his own evils. If no act was done, but the articles were a mere dead letter, it has been asked, why were not the articles can-celled ? If dissolved, why have we not some proof of the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>more than mere conjecture, derived from circumstances, which to say the least of them are equivocal? It is, however, not for me to press this matter. You have heard the evidence, and the arguments of counsel and to you I commit this part of the cause.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-6\">It is true as has been contended by the defendants\u2019 counsel, that whatever may be the language of articles of copartnership, the dealings and transactions <em>among the partners </em>may be such, as to amount to distinct evidence, that some of the articles were waived by all the parties. But the evidence must be strong, and in the language of the books amounting to demonstration. So also, subsequent <em>inconsistent </em>transactions may show a total abandonment of the articles of partnership. But so far from their being inconsistent, the plaintiff contends that all the acts and transactions of the parties are consistent with a continuing and subsisting partnership. For this he has referred to the books themselves, of which you will judge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-7\">Both sides have referred to the instrument of writing, dated the first of June, 1829 ; and which, whether it be called a renunciation, nullification, revocation, dissolution or declaration of the parties, I am sorry was admitted in evidence. If it is considered 'as a dissolution of partnership, except as between the parties themselves, it can only take effect from its date, and this cannot effect the plaintiffs\u2019 claim which arose prior to the first of June. It is not competent for the parties to manufacture facts such as those stated in this instrument. If they could and they were to be effectual, there would be an end of all recoveries, in cases such as the present. If the instrument be effectual for any purpose, it rather goes to show a dissolution of partnership of that date, which would be some evidence that up to the 1st of June there was a continuing and subsisting partnership between Worley &amp; Welsh and John Connell. After the first day of June, 1829, the situation of Worley &amp; Welsh, may be entirely different from what it is -prior to that time.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-9\">In conclusion, I shall direct your attention to the only remaining point in the cause. The defendants contend that the articles of partnership were signed by Worley alone and not by Welsh. That *one partner cannot bind another in this way. That this is a joint suit, and that as Welsh is not liable, neither is Worley bound in this suit. This is said to be a technical objection ; it can hardly be called so, since, if this be the fact, then Welsh avoids the payment of $25,000 : the loss is thrown, and rightly too, on Worley and Connell.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b411-10\">The law, as regards this objection may thus be stated.\u2019 As one partner can in no instance, without the consent of his copartners, introduce a stranger into the concern as a partner; neither can he without such consent make him a member of another firm. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>is true lie may engage in a particular adventure; but this is an attempt to form a general partnership without his consent. If two of the jury were partners, and one was sent to China to attend to the concerns of the firm, it would, I think, surprise you to find yourself engaged in a general partnership with an inhabitant of China. It is out of the ordinary commercial transactions, and therefore presumed to be without the scope of his authority. A contrary principle would indeed be a dangerous one to admit into the law of partnership. It does not come within the scope of his authority so to bind his copartner. But although consent is absolutely necessary to constitute a partnership, yet such consent may be testified either in express terms or assent may be tacit, and to be implied from the acts and conduct of the parties. If then Worley signed the article of the 1st of September, 1828, and there is no previous or subsequent authority from Welsh, the defendants are not liable in this suit; for as has been very correctly observed, this is a joint suit, and he must recover against all or none. He must prove his contract as it is laid in his declaration. But if Welsh either knew of it before and authorized it, or he has subsequently assented to it, he is bound, as well as the other partner to the contract. And this will render it necessary for you to direct your attention to the facts which have been given you in evidence on this part of the case; for as you find them so should your verdict be. If you believe that Worley signed the article with a previous or subsequent assent of Welsh, before the debt was contracted, your verdict should be in favour of the plaintiffs; but, if you should be of opinion that it was signed without any previous or subsequent authority from Welsh, your verdict should be for the defendants. And' here, it is but justice to remark that the burthen of proof is thrown upon the plaintiffs. It is not only necessary for them to prove the debt and the articles of copartnership, but inasmuch as the articles were signed by. Worley alone, (and not so far as we know in the presence of Welsh,) it is equally necessary to satisfy you, that the act met the approbation of Welsh. It is not required that there should be direct and positive testimony of this; if you can reasonably infer it from all the circumstances which has been proved, that is sufiieient. Eor you will recollect I told you, that, although consent is absolutely necessary to *constitute a partnership, yet such consent may be testified either in express terms, or the assent may be tacit, and to be implied solely from the acts and conduct of the parties. If Welsh knew of it, he ought to have dissented from the arrangement; otherwise, he is bound. It will not do for him to take the benefit of the business if it proves successful, and to avoid loss, if it should be an unfortunate concern. This case must be tested by the principles of common sense, and if from the circumstances you be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>lieve, that Mr. Welsh assented to the arrangement of Mr. Worley, he is equally bound to Worley himself.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-6\">The jury having found for the defendants, a motion for a new trial was made on the following grounds:\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b413-7\">\u201c1st.

That question was left fairly to the jury, who have decided in favour of the defendants. And supposing the Court might have felt a difficulty in arriving at the same conclusion, that is not a sufficient reason for setting aside the verdict. The jury are the proper judges of facts; and the Court will not, in that respect, interfere with their verdict, unless it be against the weight of evidence. Should the Court do so, they would virtually take from the jury their peculiar *province. In r*qqoq the present case the evidence presents no circumstance, *- J by which the assent of Welsh is so satisfactorily established, that a conclusion might not be drawn of its non-existence. That conclusion the jury have come to, and there it must rest.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-12\">Motion for a new trial denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-13\">Cited by Counsel, 5 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Sergeant, 565; 1 Parsons, 521.</p>\n<p id=\"A4U\">Cited by the Court, <em>post </em>396; 1 Harris, 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">See also, 8 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 262.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
