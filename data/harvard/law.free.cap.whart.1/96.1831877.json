The Orphans\u2019 Court had no jurisdiction in the case. They had no power, until it was expressly given by the act of 1834, to compel payment of legacies. <em>M'Cullough </em>v. <em>Montgomery, </em>(7 Serg. &amp; R. 31.) As soon as the executors settled in their accounts in 1813, in the Orphans\u2019 Court, and those accounts were confirmed, their functions as <em>executors </em>ceased, and those of <em>trustees </em>commenced. Now, the Orphans\u2019 Court has never been supposed to possess jurisdiction over trustees, except in some special cases, where there are minors. (Act of 1713.) Here there was no minor, and the estate in their hands was not that of a <em>decedent. </em>The acts of 1818, 1823, 1825, &amp;c., which give the Common Pleas jurisdiction of trusts and over trustees, are general in their terms, and seem to include all cases of trust. These acts have been held to extend to executors. <em>Morrow </em>v. <em>Brenizer, </em>(2 Rawle, 183.) The act of 1832, relating to Orphans\u2019 Courts, did not go into operation until October, 1832, after the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas had attached \u2014 though it does not appear that that act has made any alteration in the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court, respecting trusts.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-10\">2. The court had no power to require a settlement by the appellant, after he had been discharged by the Court of Common Pleas from his trust. The act of the 14th April, 1828, authorizes that court to discharge a trustee, either on his own application, or on the application of the <em>cestui qui trust. </em>It provides for due notice to all persons interested, and gives an appeal to the party aggrieved. The proceeding, then, cannot be disturbed in this collateral way. Besides, it appears by the record, that Swartz actually participated in the proceedings in the Common Pleas, and ratified them by applying for a new trustee.</p>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-11\">3. 4. The Orphans\u2019 Court was wrong in charging Wimmer with any part of the trust fund. They ought to have exhausted the estate of the other trustee, before they came upon the appellant, who was not liable in the first instance.

The settlement of a joint account does not prove that both exe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>cutors received the money. In Brown\u2019s Appeal, (1 Dall. 312,) a distinction was taken between the creditors and legatees. One administrator cannt sue the other for money received by him. <em>Steinman </em>v. <em>Sanderson, </em>(14 Serg. &amp; R. 357); <em>Simon </em>v. <em>Albright, </em>(12 Serg. &amp; R. *429); 2 Bridgman\u2019s Digest, 650, s. 214; 12 Mod. 560; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Bray, </em>(Parker, 172.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-7\">5. The court erred in charging the appellant with the amount of the bond. It was conceded that Swartz, the obligor, was insolvent. There the loss ought to have been borne by all the children. But upon the true construction of the will, this bond ought to have been deducted from the wife\u2019s share. <em>Yohe </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>(1 Binn. 358,) shows the rule in case of an intestacy. This may be considered an advancement to the son-in-law, for the benefit of the daughter; who could not in law execute a bond. <em>Wentz </em>v. <em>Dehaven, </em>(1 Serg. &amp; R. 312,) shows that a loan to a son-in-law may be regarded as an advancement. There are many cases in which <em>\u201cgrand </em>children\u201d have been held to be included in the words <em>\u201cchildren.\u201d Pemberton </em>v. <em>Parke, </em>(5 Binn. 601;) <em>Gale </em>v. <em>Bennett, </em>(Ambler, 681;) 3 Vesey, 421; 4 Vesey, 437, 693; 10 Vesey, 195; 2 Eden, 194.

The jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court appears clearly from the acts of 1713 and 1832. The powers given by the act of 1713, are confirmed by the constitution. In <em>Richards v. Baker, </em>(6 Serg. &amp; R. 462,) the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is considered to go beyond the estates of decedents. <em>Guier </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>(2 Binn. 299;) <em>M'Coy </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>17 Serg. &amp; R. 60.) At all events the act of 1832 gave jurisdiction. This is a remedial act, and to be construed liberally; and although the Common Pleas undertook to discharge Wimmer, before the act went into operation, yet this does not remove his liability to account for money received previously. <em>M'Farland v. Commissioners, &amp;c., </em>(12 Serg. &amp; R. 298.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-10\">2, 3. This was a joint trust; and on the death of Detterly the duties and responsibilities survived to Wimmer. It is said that these trustees divided the duties between them, one taking care of the trust for the daughter Magdalena, and the other of the trust for Margaret. There is no evidence of this beyond their answers. They are bound by their account as settled. <em>M\u2018Coy </em>v. <em>Porter, </em>(15 Serg. &amp; R. 571.) [Gibson, C. J. \u2014 That case has been reconsidered.] It is true that the decision was modified at a subsequent term, (17 Serg. &amp; R. 59,) but the principle remains untouched. After the lapse of nineteen years the court will not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>permit the account to be reviewed. The distinction taken in the case of <em>Brown\u2019s Appeal, </em>(1 Dall. 312,) between creditors and legatees, is not supported by the authorities; as is shown by the note to Mr. Wharton\u2019s edition of Dallas.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\">m no-i *4. The court was right in charging Wimmer with the L -* amount of Swartz\u2019s bond. The receipt of the interest from 1813, relied upon, on the other side, cannot bind Mrs. Swartz, who was then, and is yet, a <em>feme covert. </em>It was manifestly the intention of the testator, that these legacies should be for the sole and separate use of his married daughters. The cases cited show, that it is of no importance what words are used, if the intention be apparent. Then, as to the suggestion that a <em>son-in-law </em>is to be included in the term <em>children, </em>it is going much further than any case has yet gone. There is no relationship as in the case of a grandchild. It has been held that a grandchild by marriage is not entitled to take, under the description of a <em>child. </em>2 Williams on Executors, 725, 6.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"A4P\">Sergeant, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AjC\">who, aftex stating the material facts, proceeded thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">By the appellant\u2019s fifth exception, a question has been made as to the right of the Orphans\u2019 Court to call trustees to account, which it is proper first to consider; for if that court had no jurisdiction in the matter, it would be unnecessary to discuss the other exceptions. It becomes important to decide this point, because proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court against trustees, merely as such, have not been very frequent, and must now depend on the construction of the recent act of the 29th March, 1832, relating to Orphans\u2019 Courts. A reference to our early laws, shows that the beginnings of the Orphans\u2019 Court were very feeble; but its powers have since been extended by the legislature, until they embrace a large and important sphere of jurisdiction. The first law of the province, which I have been able to discover, was passed in 1693. It enacted, that the justices of each respective County Court should sit twice in every year, to inspect and take care of the estates, usage, and employment of orphans; which should be called the Orphans\u2019 Court, that care might be taken for those that are not able to take care of themselves. Another law of the same year required all executors, and guardians to persons under age, to give bond to the Court of Orphans, faithfully to discharge their trust. It is probable, that both the name and jurisdiction of this court were borrowed from the Court of Orphans of the city of London, which had the care and guardianship of children of deceased citizens of London, in their minority, and could compel executors to file inventories, and give security for their estates. Priv. Lond. 324. It is from the same source that several of our other laws and usages derived their origin,\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>such as foreign <em>attachments, </em>\u2014 feme-sole traders, \u2014 married women privately examined, conveying their estates, with their husbands, by deed; which practice afterwards pervaded this country ^generally, and is lately established in England by statute. Priv. Lond. 70, 187; Hob. 225; 1 Cro. 699; 1 Prest. Abs. Tit. 336. None of-these wete known to the common law; but may be accounted for, when we recollect that many of the first colonists who accompanied William Penn, came from the city of London. In 1701, by the act for establishing courts.of jurisdiction in the province, the Orphans\u2019 Court had power to award process, and cause to come before them all and every such person and persons as were, or should be, entrusted with, or in any ways accountable for any lands, tenements, goods, chattels or estate, belonging, or which should belong to any orphans, or persons under age, either as guardians, <em>tutors, trustees, </em>executors or administrators, and cause them to make and exhibit within a reasonable time, true and perfect inventories and accounts of the said estate, and to require and take bonds and securities of such guardians, <em>trustees, tutors, </em>executors and administrators, for the legacies, portions, shares and dividends of estates, real and personal, belonging to orphans and minors, as occasion shall require, &amp;c. This act was repealed not long afterwards: but in 1713, the court was revived, and its jurisdiction more precisely marked out, as well as extended, by an act, which remained in force from that time till 1832. It was declared .a court of record; and power was given to it to cause 'to come before it all persons who, as guardians, <em>trustees, tutors, </em>executors, administrators, or otherwise, should be entrusted with, or in any wise accountable for any lands, tenements, goods, chattels or estate, <em>belonging to any orphan or person under age, </em>and to cause them to make and exhibit inventories and accounts of the estates. They were also empowered to oblige the register general, or his deputies, to bring in duplicates of all bonds, accounts, &amp;c., relating to such estate. By the third section, they could compel persons, having the care and trust of minor\u2019s estates, to give security, if like to prove insolvent, or neglecting to file inventories and accounts. By the fourth section, executors, guardians, or trustees might, by.leave of the court, put out their minors\u2019 money at interest; and in the eleventh section other powers over trustees for minors were given to the court. Various supplements to this act, and acts on other subjects, passed from time to time, greatly enlarged the power of the Orphans\u2019 Court. Most of the provisions of these acts have now been introduced into the several revised codes of laws, passed by the legislature since 1830.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">In the fourth section of the act of the 22d March, 1832, relating to Orphans\u2019 Courts, it is declared, that \u201c the jurisdiction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>of the several Orphans\u2019 Courts shall extend to, and embrace the appointment, control, removal and discharge of guardians, \u2014 the settlement of their accounts \u2014 the removal and discharge of executors and administrators, deriving their authority from the register of the respective county \u2014 the settlement of the accounts of such executors *and administrators, and the distribution of the assets, or surplusage of the estates of decedents after such settlement, among creditors or others interested; to the sale or partition of the real estate of decedents among heirs\u2014 <em>and, generally, to all cases within their respective counties, </em>wherein executors, administrators, guardians <em>or trustees </em>are, or may be possessed of, or undertake the care and management of, or are in any way accountable <em>for any real or personal estate of a decedent </em>\u2014 and such jurisdiction shall be exercised in the manner hereinafter provided.\u201d The fifty-seventh section points out the manner of proceeding in various clauses, adapted to the respective cases, against persons answerable to the jurisdiction of the court. Sections fourteen, sixteen, and twenty, speak of trustees, and other sections, of executors, administrators, guardians, <em>or other accountants.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">It will be observed, by a comparison of the acts of 1701 and 1713, with that of 1832, that the language of the latter is more extensive, in relation to the jurisdiction over trustees, than that of the former. The acts of 1701 and 1713, were confined to cases of trustees having property belonging to orphans or persons under age; but the act of 1832 comprehends, generally, all cases where trustees are accountable for the estate of a decedent. This change, in the words of the act, was evidently intended to enlarge the power of the court; and there are many instances in which such a power is salutary and useful; furnishing a more complete and speedy remedy against a trustee, than could otherwise be obtained. It is true that a remedy is here given to a <em>cestui que </em>trust of property, which had been the estate of a decedent, which other <em>cestui que </em>trusts might not enjoy. But it seems to have been, the policy of the legislature, to confer on the Orphans\u2019 Court the superintendance of the property of decedents, in almost every respect, and to make all persons accountable in that court, into whose hands such property came; and, indeed, to enable it to hear and determine, by proceedings different from those of courts of common law, almost all judicial transactions, immediately arising from the decease of testators or intestates. In the recent codes, further jurisdiction is vested in this court over many subjects never before possessed. I am of opinion that the Orphans\u2019 Court had power to call Wimmer to account, as trustee, under the will of M. Detterly, senior, by the provisions of the act of the 29th March, 1832.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>But in the case before us, the prior decree of the Court of Common Pleas, on the petition of Wimmer, dismissing him from his trust, was 'conclusive; and after that decree, the Orphans\u2019 Court could not proceed to compel him to appear there and settle his accounts. By the third section of the act of the 14th of April, 1828, where a trustee has executed the trust or powers delegated to him, he may file his accounts in the Court of Common Pleas, on oath or affirmation, exhibiting a particular statement of his receipts and * expenditures, and after approval by the court, may pray a discharge. Citation L J is then to issue to persons interested, and the court are to proceed to hear and determine, and if it appears that the trustee has\" executed the trust agreeably to his power, he is to be discharged for ever. By the fourth section, any trustee who <em>may not heme executed the trust </em>or power delegated to him, and who is desirous of being discharged from the further execution of the trust, may make application to the court, setting' forth the facts, and praying the leave of the court to make a settlement of his accounts, so far as he has proceeded in the execution of the trusts, and that on surrendering the residue of the estate under his care to such person or persons as the court may appoint, the court will make an order dismissing such trustee from the duties of his appointment \u2014 whereupon the court is to proceed to hear and determine the matter, and make such order as to them shall appear just and equitable; and if it shall appear that the trustee has executed the trust agreeably to his powers, he shall be discharged therefrom for ever.' The 5th section gives a right of appeal within one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">It was under the 4th section that the proceedings in the Common Pleas in this case were had. Wimmer stated in his petition the appointment of M. Detterly, Jr. and himself executors \u2014 that the portion of Margaret was to remain in their hands \u2014 that Detterly received Margaret\u2019s share, and acted as her trustee \u2014 his decease, and the devolution of the trust on Wimmer \u2014 that he was desirous of being discharged from the further execution of the trust, and had never received her share in trust for her use, and prayed the court to make an order dismissing him from the duties of his appointment and to appoint another. Atherholt\u2019s petition confirmed this statement, and both Avere accompanied by an affirmation. The court then decreed that Wimmer should be discharged from the trust for ever. In so doing, we must take it for granted it AYas after hearing and examination of the allegations and proof \u2014 that it appeared to them, in the words of the act, just and equitable they should do so \u2014 that it also appeared Wimmer had executed the trust agreeably to his poAvers, and that the contents of his petition Avere true, namely, that he had re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>ceived no trust money and had no account to settle. Otherwise the court would not have dismissed him, without first requiring him to settle his account. If, after being thus for ever dismissed, on the ground that he had executed his trust, and had received no moneys as trustee, he can again be called on in another court, to answer a charge that he had received money as trustee and had an account to settle, it is evidently a proceeding directly at variance with the former, and contradictory to the decree of the court. The principle is now so familiar as almost to render it superfluous to refer to it, that the decree of a court of competent P1Q61 jurisdiction, on a matter within that jurisdiction, cannot L J *be controverted by a proceeding in another court. Here the proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court brings directly in question, matters already heard and adjudicated in the Court of Common Pleas: and therefore the proceeding in the Orphans\u2019 Court was in this respect erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"AeA\">Decree reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Cited by Counsel, 4 Wharton, 181; 4 Barr, 302; 5 Harris, 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">Cited by the Court, 4 Watts <em>&amp; </em>Sergeant, 435; 9 Barr, 425; 2 Jones, 336; 5 Wright, 178; 2 Ashmead, 479.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
