Among the debts due to the testator, was a bond dated the 2d of April, 1814, for 2000 dollars, executed to him by his son-in-law, William Ayres, who had married his daughter Mary, one of the legatees named in the said will. To secure the payment of this bond, a mortgage was given by Ayres of the same date, upon a tract of land in Montgomery county. A <em>scire facias </em>had issued upon this mortgage, at the suit of Shelmire, in March, 1826, and judgment obtained for 2300 dollars, upon which a <em>levari facias </em>issued to August <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>term of that year, which was stayed by the plaintiff Shelmire; and no further proceedings were taken to collect the debt, during the life time of Shelmire. On the 30th of December, 1829, judgment was obtained by James Comly, administrator, &amp;c. of Deborah Ayres, against William Ayres, upon which a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to April term, 1831; and the tract of land mortgaged to Shelmire was sold by the sheriff. The money arising from the sale having been brought into court, auditors were appointed to ascertain the facts and make distribution thereof; who reported that the mortgage was not a subsisting lien upon the property, having been deducted from the legacy bequeathed to the wife of William Ayres by her father; consequently, that Derrick Hogeland, the next judgment creditor was entitled to the fund. Exceptions were filed to this report; and after argument, the court of Common Pleas set aside the report, and ordered the money to be paid to the executors of George Shelmire, .the mortgagee.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b99-6\">Derrick Hogeland appealed from the decree of the Common Pleas of this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b99-7\"><em>Mr. Sterigere, </em>for the appellant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahh\">cited 1 Roper on Legacies, 226; Gordon on Decedents, 50, 206; 2 Black.

In two clauses of the will he mentioned his outstanding debts as a fund for the payment of the legacies; and the proceedings for the recovery of the debt due by Ayres, showed .that he looked to it as part *of the future assets. This being the obvious r^qn-i general intent of the testator, he argued that the court -* would give effect to it, rather than rely upon a doubtful passage, to the prejudice of the testator\u2019s daughter and legatee; whose claims were certainly greater than those of mere strangers.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b99-10\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8N\">This is an exceedingly plain case. A testator directs his property to be equally divided among his children, but orders that debts owing to him by any of his sons or sons-in-law, except those <em>forgiven </em>in the will, be deducted from the share of such son or son-in-law; and that the residue only be paid to him, whether given immediately or in trust. The share allotted to the wife of a son-in-law indebted to him by mortgage, he gives to her separate use; and the question, is whether the mortgage was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>merged in her share and extinguished by it, or whether, though deducted from the share, it remains an unsatisfied incumbrance on the mortgagor\u2019s land. If the latter, it would follow that neither the daughter nor her husband got any thing like an equal share of her father\u2019s estate. The argument on the other side is, that as the mortgage was not forgiven, it necessarily remains a charge in favour of the executors, not for the benefit of creditors (for there were none) but for the separate benefit of the mortgagor\u2019s wife, and the other children. It follows not, however, that because not forgiven, it may not be satisfied out of the wife\u2019s share. It is better for her that it should be so, than that she should get a sixth of it to her separate use. If it had been forgiven, it would have ceased to be a debt, and it would have been absurd to' order it to be deducted. To do so would have been to forgive it to the husband, but to remember it to the wife. It was because it was not forgiven, that it was to be remembered in the general division. How else could the testator direct it to be satisfied by retaining it out of the wife\u2019s portion ? It is said, that would not benefit the wife, who is supposed to have been the principal object of the testator\u2019s bounty. Would it not benefit her to have her husband\u2019s debt paid and his land disencumbered ? But there is no peculiar favour evinced to his married daughters; as his sons and sons-in-law are put exactly on a footing, and the share of the wife is said to be the husband\u2019s. This equality of consideration between daughters and their husbands is common to a particular class, with whom the most usual method of evidencing advancements, is to have recourse to notes, obligations, or book entries, to stand against the children when their shares come to be received.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">The mortgage is therefore declared not to be a lien on the moneys in court; and it is ordered that the decree of the court in this particular be reversed, and the report of the auditors affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
