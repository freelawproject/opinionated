Clearly not that part which she had, in any event, an indisputable right to dispose of; but all that was her\u2019s for life and enjoyed by her as such. It was still her own when she dictated her will. The direction is declared to be in furtherance of her husband\u2019s arrangement, and it is but a repetition of what he had said. She never meant that the representatives of Mr. Lister should have a moiety of the .part left at her disposal in addition to a moiety of the whole; and the only supplementary arrangement made by her, was to direct that the household furniture specially bequeathed by her should come out of the part over which she had an unqualified disposing power. The result of this construction is the same that would be produced by holding her to have been the absolute and unlimited owner of the whole estate; and according to the terms of the agreement the plaintiff below was entitled to the whole of his legacy.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
