Did not John Shields die intestate as to those two yearly rent charges, and did they not descend to his three brothers, Thomas Shields, Robert Shields, and David Shields, in fee simple, as tenants in common, subject to the life-estate of the widow in a moiety ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-10\">3. Did not the conveyance above stated, vest in the plaintiff two-thirds parts of the said two yearly rent charges in fee simple, and an estate for the life of Eliza Shields, in a moiety of the other third part ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-11\">4. Did John Shields, the testator, in and by the two several ground-rent deeds above specified, divest himself thereby of all estate whatever in so much of the said messuages, tenements and lots of ground, situated in the half square between Broad and Juniper streets and Spruce and Locust streets, with the appurtenances thereunto respectively belonging, devised <em>(inter </em>alia) to Mary Shields, in and by the said will, as were conveyed by the said two ground-rent deeds ? and did he die intestate of the two several rent charges, reserved in and by the said two ground-rent deeds respectively ? \u2014 Or, did such an interest and estate in the said premises, continue and remain in him, notwithstanding the execution of the said ground-rent deeds, as to be the subject of said devise, and upon which the same can in any manner operate ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-12\">If these questions should be determined in the affirmative by the Court, then judgment to be entered in favor of the plaintiff, for such sum as may be agreed upon by the parties or their counsel ; and, in case of any difference of opinion between them, the said sum shall be settled by the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b265-13\">If the Court should determine these questions in the negative, then judgment to be entered in favour of the defendant.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b265-14\">Mr. <em>J. M. Read, </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFH\">This is an amicable proceeding; the object of which is the determination.of a question of law. Mr. Burd is only a stakeholder. By a family arrangement between the widow and two of the brothers of the testator, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>conveyances have been executed to carry the will into effect. The interest of one of the brothers is outstanding.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-6\">1. The will was revoked by the marriage of the testator. (Act of 19th April, 1794, \u00a7 28.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b266-7\">2. The conveyance of the lot on ground-rent, after the date of the will, was a revocation <em>pro tanto. </em>An alteration of the estate produces this effect. 4 <em>Kent\u2019s Oom. </em>513, &amp;c. Even when a contract for the sale of land was rescinded, it was to be a revocation, *Wal<em>ton </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>(7 Johns. Ch. Rep. 258). That after-acquired real estate does not pass, is recognized in the recent case of <em>Girard </em>v. <em>The Mayor, &amp;c. of Philadelphia, </em>(4 Rawle, 323). There is, an exception of the case of <em>partition, </em>but this is believed to be the only exception, 1 Hovenden\u2019s notes to Vesey, 208, &amp;c.; <em>Attorney General </em>v. <em>Vigor, </em>(8 Ves. 281.) Here there was a sale of land in fee, and the creation of a rent charge, which was a new estate, 4 Black. Com. 42; Woodfall\u2019s Land. &amp; Ten. 29, note; Co. Litt. 47 (a), 142 <em>(b), </em>143 (b), 144, Mr. Hargrave\u2019s note; 19 Vin. Abr. 105, 107, title, Reservation; 6 Bac. Abr. 22.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b266-8\">Mr. <em>Binney, </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFg\">stated that the counsel on both sides were of opinion that the will was revoked. He referred in addition to the cases cited by Mr. <em>Read, </em>to <em>Livingston </em>v. <em>Livingston, </em>(3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 148).</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b266-9\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b266-10\">Sergeant, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Akl\">The general rule in relation to a will is, that the estate disposed of must remain in the same condition till the death of the devisor; if the estate be afterwards altered by the testator, so that it no longer exists as he devised it, the will is inoperative, and the act of alteration is construed a 'revocation. Parting with a portion of the estate, as by making a lease for life or years, or creating an incumbrance on it, as by mortgage, or conveyance for payment of debts, are only revocations <em>pro tanto. </em>2 Christ. Black. 373. So a conveyance for partition is no revocation. Ib. But, says Lord Hardwicke, in <em>Sparrow </em>v. <em>Hardcastle, </em>reported in the note to 7 T. R. 416, when there is a complete disposition of the land without leaving any part of it in the devisor, it is a revocation. If a man make a will devising land, and after execute a feoffment to his own use, it is a revocation of the will, notwithstanding it is in point of law the old use, and will descend <em>ex parte paterna </em>or <em>materna </em>as before. So a feoffment without livery, a bargain and sale not enrolled, or any other imperfect conveyance will be a revocation, because it imports an intention of altering the condition of the estate. So, where after the will, the testator executes any legal conveyance, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>it is a revocation, because the estate is gone, and the will has lost the subject of its operation. If a man seised of real estate devise it, and after convey the legal estate, though there be only a partial declaration of trust, yet as he has granted the whole estate, it is a revocation of the will. So if a man seised of a legal estate makes his will, and then conveys the legal estate to another in trust for himself, it is a revocation. <em>Parsons </em>v. Freeman, (7 Bac. Ab. 370). These are the legal principles, which have been determined, and they have been inflexibly maintained in analogous cases. 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 513.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">A conveyance by the testator in fee simple, of a lot of ground which he had devised, reserving a ground-rent in lieu of the lot. *itself, is a complete disposition of his estate in the lot. It r*9c-i-i is a substitution of an incorporeal hereditament issuing out *- -* 1 J of the ground, usually, as in this case, with clauses'of distress and condition of re-entry to enforce the payment of the rent. On the other hand there is a stipulation for redemption within a certain time, which when it happens, turns it into a sale, and renders the consideration money personal property to those who receive it. These reservations and clauses preserve to the grantor no residuary estate in the land; they create new services and rights instead of it. It somewhat resembles the case of an exchange of lands, which has been held to operate as a revocation, so as to exclude the land .taken in exchange, from the operation of a prior devise. Being then an entire transfer and disposal of the estate in the land, there is nothing left for the devise of the lots of ground to operate on,, and the will is so far revoked by the subsequent acts of the testator. That the ground rents thus created could not pass by the residuary bequest, as after-acquired property, under our act of Assembly, in force when the will was made, results from the decision in <em>The City of Philadelphia </em>v. <em>Girard, </em>(4 Rawle, 323.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-7\">It is, therefore, the opinion of the Court, that John Shields died intestate as to the two ground rents in question. That they descended to his three brothers, Thomas, Robert, and David, in fee simple, as tenants in common, subject to the widow\u2019s life estate in a moiety. That the conveyances of the widow and two of the brothers, Thomas and David, vested in the plaintiff two-third parts of the said ground rents in fee simple, and an estate for the widow\u2019s-life in a moiety of the other third part.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-8\">Judgment for the plaintiff according to case stated.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-9\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Barr, 169; 4 Id. 90; 1 Jones, 431; 7 Harris, 68; 4 Casey, 30; 7 P.
