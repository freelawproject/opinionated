In this account, Jacob was charged with Mrs. Michael Odenwelder\u2019s account against his wife and family for millenery work, &amp;c. done for them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b120-20\">The report of referees was filed on the 17th of October, 1833; and on the 19th of the same month, was read in open court, and judgment <em>nisi </em>thereon rendered, and leave given to file excep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>tions thereto, by the 2d day of November then next.

They have not stated what the partnership effects were;'they should have set them forth with their valuation, and ordered a sale. Grow on Partnership, p. 3 ; Collyer on Partnership, p. 167. <em>Segourney </em>v. Mann, (7 Conn. Rep. 324.) [Huston, J. It has never been held that our courts possess all the powers of a Court of Chancery. Has a sale ever been decreed by the Court of Common Pleas, in a case of <em>goods </em>held in partnership ?] In <em>Geary </em>v. Cunningham, (10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 302,) it was said by Gibson, J., that arbitrators in account-render, have powers as extensive as those of a chancellor, and may make a special award in the nature of a decree, adapted to the particular circumstances of the case. [Huston, J. Have you any authority to show that a sale may be ordered by auditors or arbitrators ?] I admit that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>there is no express authority; but the language of the court on' several occasions, seems to countenance the idea that they possess it. This award is not sufficiently final. Caldwell on Arbitrations, p. 214, referring to 16 East, 58; 7 Mod. 349; s. c. Willes, 268.\u20142d. The referees have adjudicated upon matters which were not the subject of an action of <em>account-render </em>and which were never intended to be submitted to them. [Rogers, J. The submission is of \u201c all matters in variance between the parties in this suit,\u201d which certainly gave the. referees cognizance of all subjects of difference.] This was not our intention. [Rogers, J. I take it that you are bound by the entry on the record, whatever your intentions may have been.] The court will look at the nature of the action and judge of the meaning and intention of the submission by that. Could referees in <em>account-render, </em>take cognizance of a question of title to real estate, or damages in slander ? 3. The referees ought to have stated a particular account of the profit or losses of the partnership. This is important for many purposes; but the award is silent in respect to it.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-7\">Mr. <em>Porter, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AO6\">cited <em>Kline </em>v. <em>Guthart, </em>(2 Penn. Rep. 490,) that the objections to the award could not be *taken in a Court of Error. The court declined hearing him on the exceptions to the award.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-8\">Mr. <em>Tilghman, </em>for the plaintiff in error contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHX\">that where the objections to the award appeared on the face of it, this court would not refuse to take cognizance of the case. In <em>Soxman </em>v. <em>Soxman, </em>(3 Penn. Rep. 44,) this court entertained a writ of error upon an award, and reversed the judgment. [Gibson, C. J. No doubt it may be so, for errors appearing on the face of the award.] Here, we say the errors are apparent. It is said, that we agreed to submit all matters in variance \u201cbetween the parties.\u201d The word <em>parties, </em>must be taken to refer to the action of <em>account-render, </em>and to be limited by the scope of that action. The act' of 30th March, 1821, requires an account to be stated. There can be but one action of account-render for the same period of time; yet this award leaves open matters for another action.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b122-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A5Q0\">There is no weight in any of the exceptions taken in this case. The parties selected their tribunal; and if the terms of the submission are larger than was contemplated by the plaintiff in error, he should have applied to the Court of Common Pleas to correct the supposed mistake. Certainly, we cannot enter into that question here. The report of the referees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>appear to be sufficiently certain and final. If they have not done with the partnership effects what the plaintiff in error desires, it is because the power to order a sale, is not possessed, at present, by any legal tribunal of this commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">Cited by Counsel, 7 Watts, 359.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
