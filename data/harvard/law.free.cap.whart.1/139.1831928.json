The common recovery was well suffered. The whole difficulty has arisen from the mistake of the scrivener, Avho, instead of drawing a re-conveyance from Guthrie to Newark, drew a second conveyance from Newark to Guthrie, which the parties executed in ignorance. This is a mistake of the kind which the courts always allow to be corrected. 2 Black. Com. 358; 5 Cruise. Dig. p. 440, tit. 36, c. 6, s. 22; Id. 437, 438. It is not necessary, however, to contend for an amendment. The intention of the parties is obvious, and the court will carry it into effect by disregarding the second deed, and treating it as a nullity. The first deed may then be considered as merely a declaration of the uses of the recovery, and not as divesting the estate of Newark. The record is <em>prima facie </em>evidence of there being a good tenant to the <em>praecipe ; </em>and it is no matter whether he is a tenant by right or wrong. Wilson on Fines, &amp;c., 275; Pigott on Ditto, 28, 40, 41. There was nothing to the contrary but the deeds, and no possession on the part of the plaintiff. <em>Lord Cromwell\u2019s </em>case, (2 Rep. 74); Pigott, 59, 60; 2 Black. Com. 362, 363; 5 Cruise. Dig. 450. In England, the Stat. of Geo. 2, renders all recoveries *good, after twenty years possession. Here, there has been possession for thirty-seven *- -* years; and the court will presume every thing in favour of it. It will be remarked, that all these instruments were acknowledged on the 24th of November, before the same-magistrates, and with the same witnesses. They may be considered as the same transaction. The case of <em>Doe ex. dem. Odiome </em>v. <em>Whitehead, </em>(2 Burr. Rep. 704,) shows how far the courts will go in supporting these species of assurance. If no deed to make a tenant to the <em>prcecipe </em>were produced, the court would presume one, or presume the tenant in, by <em>disseisin. </em>3 Rep. 59; 1 Mod.

No greater power or effect is given to them. Now, there are certain forms necessary to give validity to a common recovery; and these cannot be dispensed with. 2 Black. Com. 360; 5 Cruise. Dig. Tit. 36, c. 1, s. 9. In the case of a recovery with a single voucher, as here, the tenant in tail must be tenant to the <em>prcecipe, </em>and must be in possession of the premises. 5 Cruise. Dig. tit. 36, c. 2, s. 10; <em>Stump </em>v. <em>Findley, </em>(2 Rawle, 175.) Here it appears, that when the recovery was suffered; that is, at March term, 1798, the title was in Littler. If Thomas Newark, Jr., conveyed the estate by feoffment, it was a discontinuance. 3 Black. Com. 171. Our act of 1715 says, that deeds of bargain and sale shall have the effect of a feoffment. At all events, Newark conveyed all his own estate. There is no evidence of any intention that Guthrie should .reconvey to Newark, or of any mistake. There is nothing on the record to amend. The record is all right on its face; but we show the recovery to be wrong, by proving that Newark had neither title nor possession at the time. In <em>Bridges </em>v. <em>The Buke of Ghandos, </em>(2 Burr. Rep. 1073,) Lord Mansfield said, that if a person had <em>power </em>to suffer a recovery, and thereby bar an estate tail, <em>omnia preesumuntur rite et solemniter esse acta </em>until the contrary appears; but if the contrary appears, there is an end of the presumption. And he mentioned the case of the <em>Farl of Suffolk, </em>where blundering deeds were produced, which appeared clearly to be wrong, \u201c and it was manifest upon the evidence disclosed, that there was no good tenant to the prcecipe.\u201d That is the case here. The deed to lead the uses, forms no part of the record, and, consequently, could not be amended, even if there were any thing to amend, by which there is not.

Most of the authorities applicable to this point, will be found collected in the cases of <em>Haines </em>v. <em>Witmer, </em>(2 Yeates, 400,) and <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Baker, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; R. 470.)<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>doubtful point has been, whether the common recovery was duly suffered, so as to bar the issue in tail; and the court below held that it was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">The act of assembly of the 27th of January, 1749-50, gave to fines and common recoveries the same effect for the barring of estates tail within this province, as they had by the laws of England ; and many recoveries were suffered for this purpose, prior to the passage of the act of the 16th of January, 1799, which enables tenants in tail to convey by deed, as fully as they could by common recovery or otherwise. In the construction of common recoveries, suffered after the act of 1749-50, the same rules are applicable which governed them in England: and in that country, they had long been treated as common assurances; and it has become a settled rule, that, like other conveyances, such construction is to be made as will best support the agreement of the parties, and carry into effect their intentions. The main consideration is, whether there were parties competent to suffer the recovery. If there were, every interpretation of their acts is to be made with a view to sustain their conveyance, and not to permit mistakes or blunders in the use of the machinery employed, to overturn rights acquired and transmitted to purchasers for valuable consideration. Before the statute <em>de donis, </em>a grant to one and the heirs of his body was so interpreted by the\u2018courts, as to enable the donee to transfer a fee simple, as soon as issue Avas born. That statute forbade this construction, and created tenancy in tail, with the design of preserving the estate in one family, from generation'to generation. Perpetuities of this kind were found so inconvenient, and so hostile to the improvement of the country, that the device of a common recovery Avas alloAved, in order to unfetter the estate; and, the tenant in tail has since been treated as the potential owner of the fee simple, having an inherent right to destroy the entail, with all remainders and reversions, incapable of being -restrained or prevented by any clauses of limitation, condition, or prohibition, by custom, recognizance, or otherwise; and every support and encouragement have been given to common recoveries, as legitimate modes of conveyance of the fee simple. As early as Lord Coke\u2019s time, the language of the courts is quite as strong as any that has been since uttered. In <em>Jennings\u2019 case, </em>(10 Co. 44,) it is said, that where tenant in tail is, in the recovery, tenant in fact, or tenant in laAY, as vouchee, *the law, as incident to his estate, p*-. m has made the land and all remainders and reversions *- subject to his pleasure, and he has right and power to bar them all. In 3 Rep. 3, <em>(Winchester\u2019s case,) </em>it is said, that common recoveries, as much as <em>any </em>benign interpretation of the law will permit, ought to be maintained, because they are the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>assurances of the land. In Lord <em>Cromwell's case, </em>(2 Rep. 74,) it is said, that common recoveries are common assurances of the land; and such conveyances shall be expounded and construed according to common allowance, without prying into them with eagle\u2019s eyes. After an interval of two centuries, Blackstone says, that modern courts of justice consider them in no other light than as the formal modes of conveyance, by which tenant in tail is enabled to alien <em>Ms lands. </em>2 Black. Com. 360. This language has been often reiterated. 2 Black. Com. 358; 1 Wils. 73; 1 Burr. 115. I speak not now of a recovery suffered by a tenant for life, which is forbidden by the law, and is always strictly construed. It is far otherwise of a tenant in tail, conveying a fee simple by it; for he does no more than what he may rightfully do, and what public policy has encouraged him to do. Let us examine, then, whether the recovery in the present instance cannot be sustained; for if it can be so, by airy reasonable interpretation of the acts of the parties, it certainly ought to be in favour of persons holding under it as purchasers for valuable consideration, by titles transmitted from hand to hand, accompanied with possession for now about thirty-seven years.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">Thomas Newark was tenant in tail of the premises under the will of his father, and, as such, entitled to transfer a fee simple by suffering a common recovery. \u25a0 He was about to leave this city op a voyage to Amsterdam, as appears by the power of attorney; and had sold, or contracted to sell the premises to Guthrie and wife, or, if they acted as ,his friends, to Littler: for, on the 19th of December, 1797, soon after the deeds of the 24th November and the <em>teste </em>of the writ of entry, Littler took a deed from Guthrie and wife, in fee simple, in consideration of $2218 79; the same consideration stated in the deed from Newark to Guthrie and wife. Littler held until 1803, when he conveyed to Robert Smith, under whom the defendant holds. It is impossible not to perceive, from 'the whole transaction, that Littler stood in the light of a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser of the fee simple, for a valuable consideration, entitled, as such, to demand from Newark the suffering of a common recovery to transfer the title; and that the uses of the recovery were to be in Guthrie and wife, (or Guthrie himself, which leads to the same result,) for the purpose of conveying the fee to Littler; and that Littler bought on the faith of this arrangement, then actually made and in progress of completion.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">The first deed is dated on the 23d of November, 1797, but was acknowledged on the 24th: and by it Newark, in consideration 531 *$2218 79, bargains and sells the premises to Samuel -* Guthrie, and Hannah his wife, their heirs and assigns, to the use of Samuel Guthrie, and Hannah his wife, their heirs and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>assigns; with a covenant for further assurance. If this deed be considered by itself, as an instrument altogether distinct from the other acts and declarations of the parties, then it conveyed no more than Newark could rightfully convey by deed, namely, a base fee, which bound him during his life time; but which his issue might defeat by entry. This point was settled by Chief Justice Holt, in the case of <em>Machel </em>v. <em>Clark, 2 </em>Ld. Ray. 778; 3 Burr. 1703; Prest. Abs. Tit. 385. A conveyance, under our recording act, has the same effect: it passes no more than the grantor can lawfully convey. <em>M\u2018Kee\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Pfoutz, </em>3 Dall. 486. A common recovery, afterwards duly suffered by Newark, with double voucher, would have corroborated the base fee transferred by the bargain and sale to Gruthrie and wife, and passed a fee simple, to the same uses as those contained in the deed to them. But a common recovery, with single voucher, suffered by Newark, in which he was tenant to <em>\\hs\u00a1 \u2022prcecipe, </em>as he had parted with the freehold by his deed to Gruthrie and wife, would bar himself only, and not his issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">This, however, is not the true way of considering the transaction. It is obvious, from the dates of the deeds and power of attorney, and from the proceedings in the recovery, that they constituted, together, one assurance; of which the deed to Gruthrie and wife, was a deed to lead the uses, and was but part of the proceeding, and executpry until the recovery was suffered. .When suffered, it enured to the uses declared in that deed; more especially, as there is an immediate purchaser under it. Where no uses are declared of a recovery, either by a previous deed to lead the uses, or a subsequent one to declare them, it enures to the use and benefit of him who suffers it. If there be a purchaser, for a valuable consideration, the recovery, when suffered, enures to his use. Here were both a deed to lead the uses to Gruthrie and wife, and an immediate purchaser, for valuable consideration, from them. The deed of the 23d November, 1797, being but executory, its only operation, till the recovery should be completed, was to fix the uses of the recovery; and when the recovery. was completed, the freehold and seisin passed to the demandant, Gruthrie, to those uses, and those uses only. A deed to lead the uses of a fine or recovery, says Mr. Preston, in his Treatise on Conveyancing, vol. ii, page, 2, 3, is not a conveyance of itself. It has no individual or immediate operation on the seisin or estate.\u2019 It is merely a covenant or agreement to -levy a fine, or suffer a common recovery. This deed, and the fine when levied, or recovery when suffered, will operate as a part of the same assurance. No estate passes till the fine is levied, or recovery suffered ; and in the mean time, no uses can arise, for want of a seisin to supply or feed those uses. In the case of <em>Doe dem. Odiorne </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>*v. Whitehead, (2 Burr. 70,) the first instrument was a conveyance in January, 1735, from Timothy Staughton, the tenant in tail, by lease and release, to trustees, to uses, in strict settlement, with a covenant to levy a fine to the same uses. Afterwards, in Hilary term, 1735, Timothy Staughton did levy a fine according to the covenant. The argument of the plaintiff was, that the fine passed no freehold, the freehold having been, before levying of the fine, conveyed by lease and release, and that the fine was a distinct conveyance. But Lord Mansfield says, all was executory at the time of making the lease and release: the deeds and the fine were to be considered as one conveyance: the operation of the deeds was only to declare the uses of the fine: and the court condemn, in strong language, the attempt to divide the different parts of one conveyance, and declare that, in point of law, the whole transaction, and its general intention, ought to be taken into one view. So here, Newark had a right to suffer a common recovery, and sell the fee simple: it was his plain and obvious intent to do so, on the face of the whole transaction. The deed to Guthrie and wife is not to be severed from the rest, and treated as a distinct conveyance, but as a deed to lead the uses of a common recovery, to be suffered for the purposes of passing the fee simple to a purchaser. And this abundantly appears, although there is in the deed no covenant to suffer a recovery, or any mention of it. Under the covenant for further assurance, a purchaser has a right to demand that a recovery be suffered by the tenant in tail in his favour, as fully as if that covenant were particularly expressed. 1 Prest. Convey. 15; 1 Prest. Abs. Tit. 257. And from that covenant, from there being a purchaser, and from the cotemporaneous dates and proceedings, it is plain that the recovery was to be suffered to the uses expressed in the deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">The next step taken, was an attempt to make a tenant to the <em>praecipe. </em>For this purpose, Newark executes a deed to Guthrie, in fee simple; which, after reciting Newark\u2019s title, states that Newark, for barring all estates tail, and remainders in tail, in the premises, and for settling and assuring the same; in consideration of five shillings, bargains and sells to Guthrie, his heirs and assigns, to the intent and purpose that Guthrie shall and may become perfect tenant of the freehold, and stand and be seized thereof, until a common recovery, with single voucher, may be suffered of the same. So far the deed is intelligible; and if it had gone on to provide for a recovery in which Guthrie should be tenant, and some other person demandant, it would have had some consistency: although such recovery against Guthrie, with single voucher, would not have barred the issue in tail. The true way would have been with double voucher: namely, Guthrie to vouch Newark, and Newark the common vouchee. Instead of this, it goes on to provide that Guthrie should be the demandant, and Newark the tenant; the recovery *to enure to the use.of Guthrie in fee. When the granting part of the L J deed, and its declared and sole object and intent, are directly at variance with the mode pointed out of carrying that object into effect, it is impossible to give it any effect, unless we can reconcile contradictions. And this is more especially true, in regard to a deed to make a tenant to the <em>praecipe, </em>who is always considered a mere instrument to effectuate the intention of the parties. 1 Burr. 117. This deed, therefore, was an abortive effort, and in its effect and operation, a mere nullity. No recovery, according to its declared intent, was ever attempted to be suffered against Guthrie, as tenant; on the contrary, he, by his writ of entry and proceedings, subsequently admitted the freehold and seisin to be in Newark, and recovered them against Newark; and was thereby for ever estopped, as party to that recovery, to set up any adverse title by virtue of this deed, against those who purchased from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">That being the case, the recovery is duly suffered, so as to bar the issue in tail, by Newark, as tenant to the writ of entry, with single voucher, he being seized of an estate in tail in possession. 2 Black. Com. 356; 1 Prest. Convey. 31. And it operates according to the uses expressed in the deed to Guthrie and wife, who, by their deed of the 19th of December, 1797, lawfully sold and conveyed the fee simple in the premises to Littler, under whom the defendant holds.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">Cited by Counsel, 4 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 194; 7 Id. 98; 10 Barr, 499; 4 Harris, 379; 11 Id. 239; 12 Id. 170, 245; 2 Casey, 128; 6 Id. 167, 172; 13 Wright, 343; 1 Grant, 62.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Cited by the Court, 6 Watts, 21; 4 P.
