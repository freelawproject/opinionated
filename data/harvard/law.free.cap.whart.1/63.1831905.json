On the 26th of June, 1828, John Hellings presented his petition to the Court of Common Pleas for the city and county of Philadelphia, praying for the benefit of the insolvent laws. Hannah Amey was the only creditor returned by the petitioner, who Ayas discharged on the 8th of July folioAving. To February Term, 1834, of the Court of Common Pleas of Bucks county, Hannah Amey instituted an action of debt against the same John Hellings, in which a declaration was filed, setting forth the sentence of the Court of Quarter Sessions; and the plaintiff averred that she had maintained and supported the child from the time of its birth, until its arrival at the age of seven years, and that the said sum of fifteen dollars for lying-in expenses, and the alloAYance of seventy-five cents per Aveek, had not been paid to her by the defendant; whereby an action *had accrued, &amp;c. The defendant pleaded <em>nul tiel record </em>and payment, upon which *- J issue was joined. Upon the first plea the court gave judgment for the plaintiff; and the cause coming on for trial, on the plea of payment, at April Term, 1835, the plaintiff gave in evidence the record of the sentence of the Court of Quarter Sessions, and the petition of the defendant for the benefit of the Insolvent LaAvs. The counsel for the defendant then prayed the court to charge the jury that the action could not be sustained, and that if the action would lie, it was necessary for the plaintiff to prove the averments in the declaration respecting the maintenance of the child by her, during the term of seven years. The court, however, charged the jury upon these points in favour of the defendant, who excepted to the charge; and the jury having found for the plaintiff, the cause was removed to this court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b73-6\">Errors having been assigned upon these points, <em>Mr. Ross </em>for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aou\">contended,</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b73-7\">1.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AFt\">When it was determined in <em>Eby </em>v. <em>Burkholder, </em>that an order of maintenance could not be enforced by action, the allowance to the mother had acquired no quality of a debt. By subjecting a sentence for the payment of money to the operation of the insolvent laws, as an ordinary duty, the legislative have authorized the party convict to treat it otherwise. By the seventeenth section of the general insolvent act, it is directed, that \u201c any person who shall .be in confinement by order of any court, until he restore to the owner any stolen goods or chattels, or pay the value thereof; and any person who shall be confined for the payment of <em>axiyfine </em>or for the payment of the costs of prosecution and for no other cause, shall be entitled to the benefit of this act.\u201d In its largest sense, the word <em>fine </em>includes the mulct for the maintenance of a bastard; and the case is clearly within the equity of the act. By the succeeding section it is further directed, that persons confined for fines or forfeitures, not separately exceeding the sum of fifteen dollars exclusive of the costs, be absolutely discharged by the sheriff at the expiration of thirty days; and consequently, without cession of goods. This section seems to operate as a statutory commutation and pardon; but not so <em>rxf\u00edzi </em>the preceding one, which, by ^putting the case of the *- -* convict on the ordinary footing of insolvency, discharges but the person and leaves the duty still in force. By a discharge, then, under the insolvent laws, the remedy by commitment in execution is gone; and by what other remedy than an action, can the duty be enforced against property subsequently acquired ? That the legislature intended that it should be so enforced, is inferrible from their intent to exonerate no more than the person; and where the party convict procures such exoneration, the remedy by action results of necessity. In <em>Eby </em>v. <em>Burkholder, </em>the defendant had not been discharged; and the nature of the duty being' unchanged by the act of the defendant, there was no such necessity; consequently the mother was not allowed to use the extraordinary means for which necessity gives occasion. It is entirely consistent with that case, therefore, to say, that in the circumstances of the present, recourse to an action was entirely proper.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The question put to the court on the effect of the proof, was also properly ruled. The plaintiff averred that she had maintained the bastard at her own charge during the entire period; and to this the defendant pleaded payment; which, by every rule, was an admission of the whole declaration, except the particular part of it put in issue. It is true the fact of payment was pleaded, \u201cwith leave to give the special matters in evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>dence,\u201d which by our practice makes way but for an equity where there is one; but where there is none, the leave thus taken goes for nothing, and the plea has no mor\u00e9 than its common law effect. But even where it is properly pleaded, it has not the properties of a general issue plea; its office being to confess and avoid, by the introduction of the special matter relied upon. The burthen of proving the issue, therefore, lay on the defendant, and the jury were rightly instructed that the failure was on his part.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">Cited, by Counsel, 6 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 86.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">Cited by the Court, 1 Jones, 174; 12 Harris, 515.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b74-8\"> To the contrary, 6 Harris, 116.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
