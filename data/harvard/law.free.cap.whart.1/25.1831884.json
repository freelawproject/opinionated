In October, 1808, the court of Quarter Sessions of the county of Philadelphia, erected the western part of the Northern Liberties, into a new township called Penn; a part of which was, in the year 1813, incorporated as the district of Spring Garden, and the remainder is still known as the township of Penn; and by the 13th section of an act passed on the 1st rt-Qpl 1811, it was (inter *alia) enacted that the *- J township of Penn, should be, for all intents and purposes, separated from the Northern Liberties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-7\">Your respondents further represent, that on the 16th of March, 1819, the funds accruing under the provisions of the act of 1768, aforesaid, were invested in,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b40-8\">1.

they deny that the said landings in the said petition mentioned, or in the said answer referred to, or any of them were purchased with public monies, or that they or any of them were held by the county commissioners in trust for the public generally, or that they, or any of them, were subject to the absolute disposal of the general assembly of this commonwealth \u2014 but aver and declare that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>hay scale landing, and the landing south of Callowhill Street, were purchased with monies raised by virtue of the act of 1768, under a pledge, therein expressly set forth, that the same shall be exclusively appropriated to the purchase of landings in the townships of the Northern Liberties for the convenience of the inhabitants of the same and for the improvement of the landings so purchased, and of that at the foot of Callowhill Street; \u2014 and that all and every part of the said landings, and the rents, issues,, and profits thereof, and all the funds derived and obtained therefrom, with their interest and accumulation were always held and admitted to be held by the county commissioners, and ought now to be held by the respondents exclusively in trust for the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties, as the same existed and was laid out in the years 1768 and 1796.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-5\">Tour repliants admit that the legislature exercised, as well they might, the right to control the management, and the leasing of the said landings \u2014 and to authorize a sale of such part thereof as r*Qin they ^thought beneficial to those interested in the trust; L -I but they expressly deny that the legislature at any time exercised the power or claimed the right to dispose of the said landings, or any part thereof, or of the funds derived therefrom, or any part thereof, in any manner or way in the slightest degree affecting or interfering with the trusts of the same as herein-before stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-7\">And your repliants further say, that the respondents often have admitted and agreed, that before the said act of 1819, the said landings, and the funds derived therefrom, were held by the county commissioners in trust for the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties; and that since the said act of 1819, they the said respondents hold them subject to the same uses and trusts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b44-8\">And your repliants further replying, deny that the township of the Northern Liberties included, from the year 1768, to the year 1808, within its bounds the whole territory of which it had formerly been composed \u2014 and in fact say, as they have before said, that the said township of the Northern Liberties included the whole territory stated in the petition, from the year 1768, until the year 1803, when the inhabitants of that portion thereof, now included within the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, were constituted a corporation, by the name, style and title of \u201cthe commissioners and inhabitants of that part of the township of the Northern Liberties lying between the west side of Sixth Street and the Delaware River, and between Vine Street and the Oohoclcsinck Creek;\u201d and so continued until the year 1819, when the inhabitants of the said district obtained a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>act of incorporation, continuing for some time the former officers, and confirming all the rules, regulations, and ordinances by them heretofore made \u2014 by virtue of which said several acts of assembly, the said incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, was, and has continued to be, since the year 1803, totally and entirely separated from the township of the Northern Liberties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-4\">Your repliants admit, that in October, 1808, the court of Quarter Sessions of the county of Philadelphia, created the western part of the former township of the Northern Liberties into a new township called \u201cPenn,\u201d a part of which was in 1813, 'incorporated as the district of Spring Garden, and that the remainder is still known as the township of Penn \u2014 but they utterly deny that the said township of Penn was separated from the township of the Northern Liberties, by the act of 1811, for any purpose except in relation to the elections to be therein held, after the passage of the said act, or that the said district or townships represented by your repliants, were for any purposes affecting their rights to the landing or landing fund herein referred to, separated from the township of the Northern Liberties; and they aver that the said district of Spring Garden, and the township of Penn, and the present Northern Liberties, for all purposes necessary to support this application, have always ^continued ^*07-1 to be, and still are, a part of the township of the Northern ^ J Liberties as the same existed in 1768.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-5\">And your repliants further replying, in fact say, that they know nothing in relation to the landing or the funds derived and proceedings therefrom mentioned by the respondents, except what is stated in their petition \u2014 since the act of 1819, whereby the respondents were appointed trustees as before stated; they have never given, but have always refused to give, any account of the said landings, or of the rents and profits thereof, or of the sums received from the county commissioners, or of the interest and accumulation thereof, nor have they, although the funds have been amply sufficient, ever applied the same, or any part thereof, to any of the purposes for which they were to hold in trust, but have appropriated them to uses and purposes contrary to, and in violation of the provisions of the several acts of assembly, in the petition aforesaid, and in this replication, mentioned and referred to.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b45-6\">Your repliants admit, as they have before admitted, that by the act of March, 1819, the landings aforesaid in the said petition mentioned, were transferred to the respondents upon the trusts for which they were originally designed, and that a clause (which is undoubtedly usual under similar circumstances) is therein contained, saving nevertheless to all and every person and persons, bodies public and corporate, his, her, and their rights in all and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>every part (inter alia) of the estates above referred to \u2014 other than so far as it vests the trust thereof in the hands of the commissioners of the said incorporated district. Your repliants insist that the object of this clause was to prevent the assumption of the very rights now claimed by the respondents, to hold and enjoy the said landings as their absolute property \u2014 and that it is of the neglect and disregard of this provision, in the said act contained, that they, among other things, complain. They moreover deny, that the landing fund in the hands of the county commissioners in 1819, was paid over to the said respondents, in accordance with the directions of any act of assembly whatever, or that they have any title or right whatever to the same, or its interest or accumulation. This fund was transferred by the county commissioners to the said respondents, under a belief that they were authorized so to do by the said act of 1819, and this is all that was intended to be admitted by your repliants in their petition \u2014 but no such authority was by the said act given.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"74\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b46-5\">Your repliants know nothing of the landing at the end of Shackamaxon Street, nor of the allegations in relation thereto, in the said answer of the respondents contained, and can therefore neither admit nor deny them. If they shall be considered at all material to the present controversy, they pray that they may be proved and maintained according to law, and as this honourable court may award. r*qq-| *As to the landing at Coates Street on the Schuylkill, L J and that of the north referred to by the respondents\u2014 your repliants represent that they were laid out many years since as public landings by Tench Francis, then the owner of a large tract of land in that vicinity (since included within the boundaries of the district of Spring Garden,) for the common use of the owners and occupiers of that estate \u2014 no one had either the right, ability, or inclination to improve them so as to render them serviceable as landings, and they remained for many years useless to those for whom they were intended. The commissioners of the district of Spring Garden, were then requested by the owners and occupiers of the property aforesaid, to take these landings upder their charge, and as an evidence of their wishes, released to them all their interest therein. Upon these facts being laid before the legislature, they passed the act of twelfth of March, 1820, not by the procurement of your repliants, or of any one else, but as your repliants verily believe, because, as in their corporate capacity \u2014 the commissioners of the district of Spring Garden represented the very persons entitled to these landings; as they had been requested to accept releases of their rights and take them under their care, the legislature thought it just, equitable, and expedient \u2014 no saving clause was inserted, because there was no rights to save. Since the passage of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>act, the said commissioners, under the powers conferred on them, have erected wharves on one of these landings at a great expense, and paid them from their corporate funds, raised by taxes upon the district of Spring Garden. They have had no public landing fund from which to defray these expenses \u2014 no trust estates have been transferred to them, to be applied to these objects \u2014 all the public landings they possess, have been purchased and paid for from their corporate estates, or granted to them by individuals\u2014 and they have heard no charge by any one interested in them, that the act aforesaid was either contrary to their wishes or in violation of their rights. As no semblance or pretence of claim to any part of these landings has been suggested in the respondents, your repliants cannot perceive the relevancy or materiality of any reference thereto.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"75\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-4\">Your repliants assert that there are many landings at the ends of streets, within the limits of the district and townships they represent, which if purchased and improved, would be of great public accommodation and advantage \u2014 but the legislature has never in their cases, thought it expedient to give them these landings, unless with the consent of the individuals owning the soil, or after providing for a full and adequate compensation. The object of the landing fund, was to enable the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties to make this compensation, and a proper application of the monies belonging to it since 1819, would have procured for their use, the most valuable and important positions. Among other grievances occasioned by the breach of trust of which *your repliants complain, they r*on-i will now be under the necessity of paying double or treble *- -\u25a0 the amount, which in 1819, or soon after, would have made all the requisite purchases.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-6\">The respondents have, in the mean time, contrary to the conditions of the said trust, procured to be vested in them every landing at the end of the streets, within their corporate limits, and although thus so amply supplied, have never condescended to attend to the wants or wishes of any of the Oestuis que trust, whose property they have applied for their own private use and benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-7\">Wherefore, your repliants aver and will prove, that the said answer is uncertain, untrue, and insufficient to be replied unto by your repliants, without that any matter or thing whatever, in the said answer contained, material and effectual in the law to be replied unto, and confessed and avoided, traversed or denied, is true \u2014 all which matter and things these repliants are and will be ready to aver and prove, as this honourable court shall award\u2014 and humbly pray as they have already prayed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-8\">H.

M. Read </em>and <em>Mr. Williams, </em>for the several petitioners, and by <em>Mr. Goodman </em>and <em>Mr. W. M. Meredith, </em>(with whom was <em>Mr. -Naylor,) </em>for the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"95\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b49-6\">For the <em>petitioners,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"96\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ac8\">it was contended that upon the true construction of the several acts of assembly relating to the township of the Northern Liberties, which were cited and commented upon, the district and townships which once formed part of the old township of the Northern Liberties, though now divided for municipal purposes, were equally entitled, with the incorporated district, to the profits of the landing places. The legislature never could have intended that this large fund should be devoted exclusively to the comparatively small space occupied by the defendants, while the remaining fronts on the Delaware, and the whole front on the Schuylkill were unprovided for. It was clearly the intention that tolls should be taken at the respective wharves, and applied to the use of some part or whole of the township. Now, in 1768, the legislature sat in Philadelphia; and the framers of the act knew that the wharves in the city were rented by the corporation, and the rents and profits applied to the ease of the taxes throughout the city. Such was the intention with respect to the township. Spring Garden *and Kensington have r^^q-i both landing places, one on the Delaware, the other on -* the Schuylkill, to pay for which they are entitled to share in this fund. If the words of the acts are to be taken literally, the unincorporated part of the township of the Northern Liberties would be entitled to the whole. This was the case of a divided township, but the principle in respect to the common property is the same as in the case of the division of an empire; and there it is well settled that existing rights are not forfeited. 2 Rutherford\u2019s Inst., b. 2, c. 10, s 15 ; Grotius, b. 2, c. 9, s. 9; Puffendorf, b. 8, c. 12, s. 5; Domat, b. 1, tit. 15, s. 8; Vattel, b. 1, c. 20, s. 246; 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 245; 9 Cranch, 52; 4 Wheaton, 94, 95. The trust, therefore, was intended, for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the old township; and there is nothing in the act of 1819 to lead to the conclusion that the legislature intended to alter it. But even if they so intended, this court cannot admit the validity of an act which would divert the fund from its original and proper objects. To this point were cited <em>The Dartmouth College Case, </em>(4 Wheat. 518, 629, 663); <em>Turret </em>v. <em>Taylor, </em>(9 Cranch, 50, 332); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Jarret, </em>(7 Serg. &amp; R. 460); <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>Lex, </em>(17 Serg. &amp; Rawle. 88); <em>Estep </em>v. <em>Hinchman, </em>(14 Serg. &amp; R. 457).

That the money raised by the act of 1768, was public money, and as such, absolutely subject to the control of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"99\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-8\">2. That the landings originally purchased by the county commissioners, were expressly in trust for <em>thepublic </em>generally, and not for the inhabitants of any particular part of the commonwealth.</p>\n<p data-order=\"100\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-9\">3. That the landing subsequently purchased by the county commissioners out of the proceeds of the same fund, was, in like manner, held by them in trust for the <em>public.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"101\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-10\">4. That none of the acts of Assembly passed between 1768 and 1819, made any change in this respect.</p>\n<p data-order=\"102\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-11\">5. That by the act of 1819, the landings were rested in the commissioners of the Northern Liberties, and that the legislature had the right of so resting them.</p>\n<p data-order=\"103\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-12\">6. That the commissioners of the Northern Liberties held the landing, under the act of 1819, in trust for the public at large, so far as that all the inhabitants of the commonwealth were authorized to use the landings, paying the regular tolls for such r*4o-i nse; that *the commissioners of the Northern Liberties L -* had, under the act of 1819, the right to receire the income and manage the renting, &amp;c. of the landings. The direction as to the manner of inresting the surplus income, was a mere legislatire direction, and created no <em>trust </em>for any body.</p>\n<p data-order=\"104\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-13\">7. The complainants (nor any other part of the territory of the old Northern Liberties, not included in the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties) nerer were cestui que trusts of these landings. There nerer was any express trust declared for them. The landings were not bought with their money, and there was, therefore, no resulting trust for them. There was no trust by implication, for their benefit. They are absolutely without the shadow of a right. As to the township of Penn, and district of Spring Garden, they are not eren included within the bounds of the territory, within which, by the act of 1819, the commissioners of the Northern Liberties were directed to expend the surplus income. In 1819, Penn and Spring Garden were not within the township of the Northern Liberties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"105\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b50-14\">The legislature hare always been in the habit, in erecting municipal corporations, of resting in such corporations the public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>landings within their bounds. They gave to Spring Garden the valuable public landing at the foot of Coates street. They gave to Kensington the public -landings at the ends of streets within that district.

That the legal title to these wharves and landing places was vested, and still continues to be so, in the board of commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties by the thirty-sixth section of an act of assembly, passed the 16th of March, 1819, is admitted; *but the great question raised is, for whose [-*40-1 use was it so invested ? The complainants contend that L -* it was for the use and benefit of all those who were inhabitants within the geographical limits of what was called and known by the name of the Northern Liberties in 1768, or the township of the Northern Liberties in 1796, or should at any time become such, after the first of these dates. The commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties allege, on the other hand, that it was vested in them for the use of the public generally, and not particularly for the use of the inhabitants of what was then called the Northern Liberties, or the township of the Northern Liberties at any time, more than for the use of the inhabitants of any other part of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-8\">As to the claim of the complainants, notwithstanding their counsel have advocated it with great zeal and earnestness, and refer to many acts of assembly, as well as books on municipal and international law, in support of it, we still think that they have failed to sustain it.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">Among the acts of assembly referred to, none appeai to have any bearing upon the question to be solved, unless, perhaps, it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>may be those of the 20th of February, 1768, (1 Smith\u2019s L. 278;) the 4th of April, 1796, (3 Smith\u2019s L. 274;) the 28th of March, 1803, (4 Smith\u2019s L. 35;) the 1st of April, 1811, the 13th section, (5 Smith\u2019s L. 255;) the 22d of March, 1813, (6 Smith\u2019s L. 37;) the 16th of March, 1819, (7 Smith\u2019s L. 177;) and the 6th of March, 1820, (7 Smith\u2019s L. 260.) I do not, however, consider it necessary to notice them all; because the act of the 20th of February, 1768, which the complainants make the foundation of their claim, when construed according to the natural import of its terms, and what would seem to have been the intention of the legislature, does not bear them out. They have endeavored to show that by this act the wharves and public landing places in question, were declared and established to be for the <em>use of the inhabitants </em>of what was therein called the Northern Liberties, and afterwards, the township of the Northern Liberties, in the act of the 4th of April, 1796. For this they rely chiefly upon the title and preamble of the act. The title is, \u201cAn act- for raising, by way of lottery, the sum of five thousand two hundred and fifty pounds, for the purchasing a <em>public landing in the Northern 'Liberties, </em>and paving the streets of the city of Philadelphia;\u201d and the preamble thereof, so far as relied on, is in these words, \u201cWhereas it has been represented to the assembly of this province, by petition .from sundry <em>inhabitants </em>of the city of Philadelphia, and <em>Liberties thereto adjoining, </em>that the few public landings at the north end of the said city, and in the <em>said Liberties thereof, </em>are scarcely suflicient for the accommodation of <em>its present inhabitants </em>and the king\u2019s barracks, &amp;c., to provide for which, Be it enacted,\u201d &amp;c. Now, if the enacting part of the act had not, in express terms, declared that the landing therein men-r*44.-i tioned should be purchased *for a different use from that *- -* which, it is contended by the counsel for the complainants, the title and preamble thereof indicate, there might have been perhaps, some show of plausibility, at least, in drawing the conclusion which they have done. But the tenth section of the act, as originally published, or the second section thereof, as published in 1 Smith\u2019s L. 278, 279, enacts and declares, \u201cthat the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, in trust <em>for the public, </em>by and with the consent and approbation of the justices of the peace of the said county, in the court of Quarter Sessions, shall, and they are thereby required and enjoined to buy a landing nearly opposite the said barracks, and receive the <em>deed </em>thereof, in trust <em>for the public; </em>and further to build, or cause to be built thereon, a good <em>wharf </em>and a <em>pier, for the use of the public.\u201d </em>And by the next succeeding section, it is further made the duty of the shid commissioners, with the approbation of three <em>Justices </em>of the Peace of the <em>county, </em>to take care of the landing, by letting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>it out for the purpose of repairing and improving it for ever thereafter, as the said commissioners and justices, or a majority of them, for the time being, may judge most <em>for the public good.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">Now, although it may be, as rather seems to be indicated by the preamble of the act, that the legislature was induced or prompted to act upon this subject by a representation made in regard to it by some of the then inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia, and liberties thereto adjoining, stating that the few landings at the north end of the city and in the liberties thereto, were scarcely sufficient for the accommodation of its inhabitants at that time and the king\u2019s barracks, yet it is clear that the legislature did not view the matter as a private grievance, but as one which concerned the public at large; and therefore expressly declared and directed, that the <em>purchase </em>of the landing should not only be in trust <em>for the </em>public, but that the <em>deed of conveyance </em>from the vendor to the commissioners for it, should also be taken in trust <em>for the public ; </em>and, again, that the commissioners, after having purchased the landing, should not only build a wharf and pier thereon, for <em>the use of the public, </em>but should likewise for ever thereafter, repair and improve the same as they should judge best for <em>the public good. </em>Thus we see that the <em>public </em>is brought to view and designated as the only beneficiary of the landing as often as it is mentioned, or any thing said in relation to it, almost throughout the act, so that it is impossible to impute this repetition and uniformity of the declaration of the trust in favour of the public, to accident or inadvertence on the part of the legislature, or indeed to any thing but settled design. And so it was taken and considered by subsequent legislatures in their action on the subject. In the preamble to the act of the 4th of April, giving further powers to the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, in conjunction with three justices of the peace of the county, over the landings and wharves in dispute, it is stated \u201cthat the <em>public *landings </em>on the river Delaware, in the township of the [-*4c-i Northern Liberties, may be rendered more serviceable *- -* and productive by giving further powers to the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, in <em>whom, the same are vested by law for the use of the public.\u201d </em>And so throughout this act they are styled <em>public landings </em>and <em>wharves; </em>and are placed under the control and management of the commissioners of the county and three justices of the same, without regard to or even mention of the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties. And the 3d section enacts, \u201c that it shall be the duty of the said commissioners to keep the said landings, wharves, and hay scales, in good and perfect order and repair, and to improve the same from time to time- in such manner as will most conduce <em>to the public advantage; </em>and whenever the funds which have arisen, or shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>arise therefrom, shall over and above the said repairs and improvements, be sufficient to purchase other landings or wharves, it shall be the duty of the said commissioners, with the consent and approbation of three justices as aforesaid, to make such purchases <em>within the township of the Northern Liberties, </em>and to improve the same; and the landings or wharves so purchased or improved, shall be held under the <em>like trusts </em>and subject to the same rules and regulations as the <em>before mentioned public landings and wharves.\u201d </em>The circumstance of the commissioners being restrained by this section to the purchase of landings and wharves lying within the township of the Northern Liberties as it then stood, has been laid hold of also by the counsel of the complainants, to show that the legislature intended to appropriate not only the profits arising from all the public landings and wharves then within the' township of the Northern Liberties, to the use of the inhabitants thereof, but the profits likewise of all that should thereafter be purchased with the funds arising from those then in being. But, clearly, there is no ground whatever for this construction, because the township is not mentioned for the purpose of showing for whose use the purchases should be made; nor are there any terms of appropriation connected with it. It is introduced merely to designate the space or bounds within which the commissioners should make the purchases enjoined by the act; and it is also perfectly obvious, that if the township had been introduced as the object for whose use the purchase of the landings and wharves was to be made, the next clause declaring that they \u201cshould be held under the <em>like trusts,\u201d </em>would be worse than useless, because it does not enforce or even comport with such construction, and therefore ought not to have been inserted; but it having been declared in the preamble of the act that the public landings on the Delaware, then within the township of the Northern Liberties, were vested by law in the commissioners of the county <em>for the use of the public, </em>the words \u201clike trust,\u201d must be considered as having a direct relation thereto, which renders every part of the section perfectly perspir*4.fi-| cuous as well as consistent *with itself. Seeing, then, that L -* these landings and wharves were held for the use of the public, and not for the inhabitants of any particular township, or county, or section of the state, it cannot be questioned but the legislature had the right as often as they saw fit, to direct and change the appropriation of the funds or profits arising therefrom; and this was done in 1819, as to the public landings and wharves at the end of Coates street, and at the end of Callowhill street. By the 36th section of the act of the 16th of March, passed in that year, and referred to above, the title to these wharves and landing places last mentioned, was vested in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>the board of commissioners and their successors, of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, <em>\u201cfor the use and benefit of the inhabitants of the said- district. </em>\u201d The title to them had previously been vested in the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, <em>for the use of the public. </em>By this same section it is also declared and enacted as follows, that \u201cthe public wharf or landing place, commonly called the Hay scale landing, as also the public wharf or landing place, on the south side of and adjoining Callowhill street, (being the wharves and landing places 'now in controversy,) heretofore held in trust by the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, shall be and are hereby vested in the board of commissioners of said district, (meaning the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties,) who shall keep the said landings and wharves in good and perfect order and repair, and to improve the same from time to time in such manner, as will <em>most conduce to the public advantage ; </em>and whenever the funds which shall arise therefrom, shall, over and above the said repair and improvements, be sufficient to purchase other landings or wharves, it shall be the duty of the said commissioners to make such purchase <em>within the township of the Northern </em>Liberties, and to improve the same.\u201d Thus, although the title for these wharves and landing places, which are the subject of dispute here, is taken from the commissioners of the county of Philadelphia, and vested in the board of commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, yet we see that the legislature studiously avoided making any change whatever in the use of them; and the commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties were thereby expressly required to keep them in good and perfect order and repair, and to improve them from time to time in such manner as should most conduce to the <em>public </em>advantage, without even the slightest allusion to or mention of the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties; and wh\u00e1t renders the design of the legislature at that time to continue the use of these latter wharves and landing places to the <em>use of the public gener</em>ally, the more striking is, that in the preceding part of the section, they have declared that the wharves and public landings at the end of Coates and Callowhill streets respectively, should be held for the use and benefit of the <em>inhabitants </em>of the <em>incorporated *district of the Northern Liberties, </em>without any direction given to improve them, as should most <em>conduce to the public advantage, </em>as was done in respect to the wharves and landing places in question. There, was, however, a change made by this section of the act of 1819, as regarded the place, within which the surplus funds arising from these last mentioned wharves or landing places should be invested by the commissioners in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>purchase of other wharves or landing places, by restraining and confining them within the then existing bounds of the township of the Northern Liberties; which.clearly excluded the district of Spring Garden and the township of Penn, but included the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties and the district of Kensington; because the township mf Penn, which embraces the district of Spring Garden, having been erected and taken off from the township of the Northern Liberties, by a proceeding and order made for. that purpose in the Court of Quarter Sessions, of the county of Philadelphia in 1808, and afterwards confirmed and established by the 13th section of the act of Assembly of the 1st of April, 1811, already mentioned, could therefore form no part of the latter in 1819, as it had done previously. And as to the reason for introducing the township of the Northern Liberties in this part of the 36th section of the act of 1819, it is perfectly manifest, that it was done for no other purpose, than to designate and point out to the commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, the place or limits within which they should thereafter invest the surplus funds arising from the Hay-scale landing, and that south of and adjoining to Oallowhill street. This being the only reason for mentioning the township of the Northern Liberties, it would then seem to follow of necessity, that its limits at that time were made the measure of the space, within which the investiture of the surplus funds was intended as well as directed to be made. And here it may be further observed, that the legislature have shown, in this 36th section, as well as in the 35th, immediately preceding, that when they intended to appropriate the use of any wharves, public landings, or other property to the use of the <em>inhabitants </em>of any particular district, township, or part of the state, they did it in express terms and language, susceptible of but one construction; as Avhen they declare that the public wharves or landing places at the end of Coates and Oallowhill streets, shall be vested in the board of commissioners and their successors, of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties, \u201cfor the use and benefit of the <em>inhabitants </em>of the said <em>district;\u201d </em>and in the 35th section, that the building commonly called the town house, together with the market house and stalls erected in Second street, betAveen Coates street and Poplar lane, shall be vested in like manner in the same commissioners, \u201c for the use of the <em>inhabitants </em>of the said district.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"pAGq\">It has also been said, in the course of their argument, by the r*4Rl counsel *of the complainants, that the money with which *- -1 the wharves and landing places in controversy Avere obtained belonged to the inhabitants of the toAynship of the Northern Liberties, according to its limits in 1768; or at least was raised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>by them, and that they thereby acquired a resulting trust in these wharves or landing places: but this is a great mistake, for the money with which they were purchased, so far as any thing has been shown in relation to this point, was raised by a lottery under the authority given by the act of 1768, and therefore must be considered public money according to the principle laid down in <em>Ehrenzeller </em>v. <em>The Union Canal Company, </em>1 Rawle, 189. It was levied by a species of indirect voluntary assessment on the public, to which the inhabitants of the township of the Northern Liberties may or may not have contributed; and whether they did or not, is unknown and wholly immaterial. But, besides, it was expressly declared by the legislature, that the money should be raised for the purpose of being invested in a purchase, to be made for the benefit and <em>use of the public, </em>and not for the <em>inhabitants </em>of any particular township or district; and unless we disregard the plain meaning of all the acts of assembly bearing on this matter, which seem to be couched in terms so perfectly free from all ambiguity, that it is impossible to misapprehend their true import, we cannot avoid pronouncing a judgment against the complainants.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">We are therefore decidedly of opinion, that the public wharf or landing place, called the Hay-scale landing, and the public wharf or landing place on the south of and adjoining Callowhill street, were vested by the act of 1819, in the board of commissioners of the incorporated district of the Northern Liberties in trust for the <em>use of the public generally ; </em>and that the complainants, either collectively or separately, have no claims or rights to any part or portion of the value or income thereof- Whereupon it is ordered and adjudged by this court, that the petitions of the complainants be dismissed, and that they pay all the costs which have accrued in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">Cited, by Counsel, 5 Wharton, 334; 4 Harris, 86; 7 P.
