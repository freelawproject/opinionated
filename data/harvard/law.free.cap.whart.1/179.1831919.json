The payments of interest which accrued during the coverture, as made to Mrs. Colescott, were, in law, payments to the husband; they had been received, and were held to his use. The duty which George Woelpper undertook to perform, is a bald, naked, trust; not clothed with any direction, as to her sol\u00e9 and separate use, upon her own receipt, &amp;c. The point at which he is to be contemplated, is when dividends are received; immediately on which receipt, they are exposed to the implied assumpsit in law, which is in favour of the husband alone. In the case of <em>Buckley </em>v. Collier, (1 Salk. 114,) where the husband and wife declared for work done by the wife during coverture; the court in overruling the action <em>say </em>\u2014 \u201c here is no express promise laid to the wife; here is nothing but the promise in law, and that must be to the husband, who must have the fruits of the wife\u2019s labour. Also, the advantage of the wife\u2019s work shall not survive to the wife, but goes to the husband, for if the wife dies, her debts fall upon him, and therefore so shall the profits of the trade to the husband\u2019s executors.\u201d So, also, is the recent case referred to in Clancey on the Rights of Married Women, at page 3; <em>Glover </em>v. <em>The Proprietors of Drury Lane. </em>The husband is entitled absolutely to all sums of money which have been received by a third person on her account, during the marriage; and if he join her r*i\u00ab-n with him in actions for such causes, it *would be error. <em>Abbott and Wife </em>v. <em>Blofield, </em>(Croke James, 644); <em>Bridgood </em>v. <em>Way, </em>(2 Black. 1236); Coke Litt. 351, a.; <em>Fitch </em>v. <em>Ayer, </em>(2 Conn. Rep. 143,) where the interest on a legacy given to the wife, was held recoverable by the husband alone. <em>Griswold </em>v. <em>Penniman, </em>(Idem. 564,) where the husband\u2019s creditors were held entitled to the wife\u2019s distributive share, which accrued during the coverture. A legacy given to a married woman, must be paid to the husband. Toller\u2019s Executors, 320; Matthew\u2019s Guide to Executors, 79. In <em>Evans and Wife </em>v. <em>Norton\u2019s Executors, </em>(4 Rawle\u2019s Rep. 66,) the expression was, \u201cI also give and bequeath unto the said George Knorr, the sum of one thousand dollars, in trust, for the use of her, the said Sarah Evans;\u201d and it was held, that the husband was entitled to the legacy. The reasoning of the judge who pronounced the judgment of the court, is aside from the circumstance of the husband being joined in the suit. <em>Yohe </em>v. <em>Barnet, </em>(1 Binney, 358,) contrasted with <em>Jamison </em>v. <em>Brady, </em>(6 Serg. &amp; R. 466,) is a notable illustration of the general principle, that money accruing during the coverture, is the husband\u2019s: there, money belonging to the wife was applied at once to the payment of his debt. Precisely the same thing was done in <em>Krause, assignee of Moll </em>v. <em>Beitel, </em>(3 Rawle\u2019s Rep. 199.) This interest would be attachable in Massachusetts, for the husband\u2019s debt. <em>Shuttleworth </em>v. <em>Noy, (8 </em>Mass. Rep. 229.) There, the money due on a promissory note given to the wife, was attached by the creditor of the husband. It matters not that their process or remedies are different from ours; this circumstance does not affect the principle. The law is the same in reference to the rents' of the real estate, accruing during the coverture. Coke Litt. 162, <em>b. </em>8. <em>11A feme sole </em>is seized of a rent in fee, &amp;c., which is behind and unpaid, she taketh husband: the rent is behind again; the wife dieth; the husband, by the common law, should not have the arrearages grown due before the marriage; but for the arrearages become due during the coverture, the husband might have an action of debt by the common law.\u201d <em>Ognel\u2019s case, </em>(4 Coke\u2019s Rep. 61.) So also is the year book, 10 Henry, 6, 11; Chant, (counsel); \u201cin the case where the wife, before the coverture, had made a lease to a man for term of life, rendering to her certain rent, and during the marriage the rent was in arrear, after the death of the wife, the husband shall not have action of this rent.\u201d Babington, J. \u2014 \u201cThe baron shall have good action in this case that you have put.\u201d Rolle\u2019s Abr. Baron and feme, 352. To. the same effect is <em>Torbert </em>v. <em>Twining, </em>(1 Yeates, 132.) The case is clear of the doctrine connected with that of the wife\u2019s choses in action, because the right to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>dividends, in the hands of the garnishee, is in the husband. The law, on the subject of the wife\u2019s choses in action, is to be found in Claneey, from page 3 to 8. The dividends received and embraced in the special verdict, are credits of the husband, and are within the very words of *our attachment law, viz.: oo-? \u201cgoods, chattels, moneys, effects, and <em>credits </em>of the de- \u25a0- -* fendant, in the custody, possession, and charge, or due and owing from any garnishee or garnishees.\u201d (2 Sm. L. 502.) The object of the foreign attachment law, is to make responsible the effects of the absent debtor, to the same extent as those of the present debtor. If Colescott should be compelled to take the benefit of our insolvent law, his assignment would embrace these credits. (Ingraham on Insolvency, 2d ed. 223, 321.) The attachment may be dissolved by the entering of special bail. (1 Smith\u2019s L. 45, s. 2.) This case is different from that in 2 Watts. Rep. 90, <em>Dennison </em>v. <em>Nigh; </em>because the estate there is not settled. A trust for selling real estate was to be executed. The cases cited by the court, in ruling the point, are not applicable to our case: the one in 2 Ventris, 341, was clearly a case of a wife\u2019s chose in action: that in 1 Rolle\u2019s Abr. 551, was not an interest coming up to the point of assignability, according to <em>Sommer </em>v. <em>Wilt, </em>(4 Serg. &amp; R. 19.) It was an attempt to attach the interest of a dispossessed owner of goods, in the hands of a tort feasor. As to reduction into possession. The dividends, as received, had always been punctually paid to Mrs. Colescott, before her marriage, and after that event, till the time of the attachment, in a way satisfactory to the husband. There was as much reduction into possession as the nature of the thing admitted of. We are to be governed by our acts of assembly, and not by the customs of London. By th\u00e9 custom of London, it appears that a legacy is not the subject of foreign attachment; whilst this court holds it to be an open question under our law.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b195-8\">Mr. <em>.Arundel, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADG\">cited <em>Schuyler </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>(5 Johns.

Nay, the decisions are not always to be reconciled; and in more than one instance, what <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>was held to be law at one time, has been subsequently expressly overruled. I shall confine my remarks to the case before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">The cases cited do not, all of them, apply to the case before us. This is not the case of money earned by the labour of the wife, and sued for on the implied promise to pay; nor is it the case of money or goods devised to a married woman, or of a bond or note given to a married woman \u2014 it is a legacy devised to a r*i qqq woman before *she was married. I may admit that the L J husband could sue for it alone \u2014 could release it \u2014 assign it; that it would go to the assignees of her husband, if a bankrupt, or insolvent debtor.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Here he has not sued for it, nor released, nor assigned it, nor been declared a bankrupt, nor assigned and been discharged under the insolvent debtors\u2019 act.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">The position, that if a husband can sue for it alone, and recover, it is his, and goes to his executors, and does not survive, is not admissible. He may assign a term for years \u2014 bring ejectment, and recover it in his own name. It may in his lifetime be taken on execution for his debt; and yet every book says, that if he does not assign it \u2014 does not bring an ejectment for it, in his own name, but leaves it not sued for, or joins his wife with him, as plaintiff, in the ejectment, or it is not taken in execution for his debts, during his life, it survives to the wife; and he cannot prevent this, by devising it; though he could have sold or assigned it till the last moment of his life. In England, legacies are recoverable generally in chancery, and this has introduced a part of their law, as to husband making provision for his wife, where the gift is to her, before he can recover the bequest; and on this subject, also, all the decisions are not easily reconciled. We may say that, generally, where he has made a settlement on her at the marriage, he gets legacies, claiming as a purchaser, without any new settlement on recovering the legacy. But this is not universally so. For where the sum settled at the marriage is small, and the legacy large, he has been compelled to settle a further sum. In this case, the husband has made no settlement; and his creditors can\u2019t claim on that account. But this chancery power has not been exercised in this state. It would seem, then, that although the right of the husband is in many cases absolute, yet, if he does not exercise the right, it expires with his life. He is entitled to the property, to the term for years, the chose in action or legacy; but he is entitled to it, and owns it, in right of his wife; and when he dies without having exercised his right, her right is superior to, and exclusive of all others. Husband and wife are, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>in law, but one person. All rights to personal property which were in her, by this legal fiction, are in him, as identified with her, during his life; and though hey having the power to sue or dispose, may recover, and reduce to possession or dispose of the chose in action without - her, yet the right still remains in her so far, that if she survives, she has it precisely as she had it before marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">The act of the husband only, can divest this right of the wife. A creditor can imprison a man if he does not pay his debts, and has no property on which to levy it. But, although in prison, the creditor cannot compel him to assign his own bonds, given directly to himself; nor the bonds or legacies given to his wife beforte her marriage : and I think no case or dictum can be found to show, *that during .his life, or after his death, the bond or legacy to the wife, before marriage, can be taken for his debt. If he wishes to be discharged from prison under acts for relief of insolvent debtors, he must assign them ; and then, it is the act of assigning, which passes them to the creditors. The fact of his being indebted, and no other fund to pay creditors, will not pass them. The law seems to require some act of the husband, to take them from the wife. If no act is done by the husband, the chose in action, which was the wife\u2019s before marriage, must be hers after his death. In this case, the husband has done no act: has not sold, released, or assigned\u2014 either voluntarily or as a bankrupt. The result of this may be, that a husband may have a right to money which he could get, but which his creditors cannot reach. So a bond may be due to him, or a debt; his creditors cannot levy on either of these ; and if he will lie in jail, they cannot obtain them during his life. A bond to himself, or a debt to himself, may, after his death, be reached by his creditors; but a legacy or debt to the wife, before her marriage, if not collected by the husband, his creditors cannot obtain: for, as it was originally in the wife, and the husband\u2019s right arose from the fiction of the law, which, for many purposes, considers husband and wife but one person, the law remits to the wife her original right on the death of the husband; and neither the heirs nor creditors of the deceased husband have any right to it. The very point now before us, was decided by this court, in 2 Watts. 90; for this yearly sum is the legacy. The bequest is not of the principal to the wife, and the interest annually. If it were so, I am not aware that it would make any difference. If a bond is due to a woman before marriage, and neither principal nor interest disposed of by the husband during life, the whole, on his death, goes to the wife. So of a legacy bearing interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Whether any legacy can be attached for the debt of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>legatee,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> has not yet been decided in this state, and we say nothing about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">Cited by the Court below, 12 Casey, 178.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">Cited by Counsel, 3 Wharton, 417; 8 Watts, 11; 7 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 413; 1 Barr, 293<em>; </em>4 Id. 391; 9 Id. 502; 10 Id. 423, 433; 4 Harris, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">Cited by the Court, 6 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 299; 5 Barr, 263; 9 Wright, 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">See also, 2 Barr, 72; 6 Penn.
