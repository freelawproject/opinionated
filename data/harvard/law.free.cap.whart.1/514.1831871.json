Johnson, and Sophia Johnson, his wife, and Ludwick Shaffer, to recover damages for an alleged obstruction of the plaintiff\u2019s right of way. John M'\u2018Clure, one of the defendants, died shortly after the commencement of the action. On the trial, which took place on the 1st of November, 1827, the jury gave a verdict against Johnson and his wife for $1000, \u201c if the obstructions were not removed before the 1st day of January, 1828, but if removed by that time, then for 6 cents damages and 6 cents costs.\u201d The obstructions not having been removed, judgment was finally entered upon the verdict for $1000, and a writ of <em>fieri facias </em>issued, which was levied upon the premises in dispute in this action; and upon a writ of <em>venditioni </em>exponas, the sheriff sold the same to the defendant, James Rianhard. After obtaining the sheriff\u2019s deed, Rianhard proceeded to obtain possession of the premises. For this purpose he instituted proceedings before J. L. Woolf and P. F. Fritez, Esqrs. two justices of the peace, under the act of 6th April, 1802.

The defendant claims to hold this property as .a purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, of the interest of-Mrs. Johnson. This is the only ground for his claim. Johnson, the husband, had no interest in it, having conveyed it to Castor more than three years before the judgment against him. Fraud in the conveyance is negatived by the special verdict. The question then is-, whether, upon a judgment against a husband and wife in an action for a <em>tort, </em>the separate real estate of the wife ,can be taken in execution. There is no authority whatever to support the affirmative of this proposition. The English cases \u00e1re all collected in Clancy; and although it is difficult to collect from them a satisfactory rule with respect to the <em>contracts </em>of a married woman in regard to her separate estate, yet they afford no support to the doctrine on the other side. Whatever may be the state of the law there, and in New York, since the case of <em>The Methodist Church </em>v. <em>Jacques, </em>(3 Johns. C. R. 108,) the rule is placed on a safe and intelligible ground in Pennsylvania by the case of <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>(1 Rawle, 231,) where it was held by this Court, that a <em>feme covert, </em>in respect to her separate estate, is to be deemed a <em>feme sole </em>only to the extent of the power clearly given by the instrument, by which the estate is settled, and has no right of disposition beyond it. That case has sometimes been doubted in. other Courts, but certainly without reason. [Gibson, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>C. J. We have had occasion lately to reconsider the principle of that case, and it has been distinctly re-affirmed. We see no reason for deviating in any degree from the rule there laid down.} Taking that ease then to be the settled law, it must be decisive of this question. The deed under which the plaintiff claims to recover, gives the rents and profits merely to Mrs. Johnson for the term of her life, Avith a power to dispose of the estate during her life, \u201cfor the benefit of herself *and children,\u201d and *- -\u201cto appoint it by will. There is no authority to subject it to her husband\u2019s debts, or to make it liable for his torts or her own. Clearly then, if she had made a disposition of the estate to pay off this judgment, it would be invalid. <em>A fortiori </em>must an adversary proceeding be a nullity as respects this estate. If it could be made liable in any way, the trustee ought to have been made a defendant; yet, although M'Clure was joined at first, after his death the succeeding trustee Avas not substituted in the action. 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 93.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-5\">2. The submission and aAvard related merely to the question of <em>possession, </em>and are therefore not binding upon the title. The reference, if it was made in a judicial proceeding, Avas in the case before the justices, under the act of 1802; the object of which was to get possession. The referees had no power beyond that of the justices. <em>Lennox </em>v. <em>M'Call, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; R. 104); <em>Simpson </em>v. <em>Jack, </em>(13 Serg. &amp; R. 279); <em>Bachman </em>v. <em>Reigart, </em>(3 Penn. Rep. 207); <em>Gratz </em>v. <em>Gratz, </em>(4 Rawle, 437); <em>Bayne </em>v. <em>Gailor, </em>(3 Watts, 301). If the submission is to be considered at common laAv,- then not haAdng been entered into by the parties themselves, it is void. At all events the agreement cannot bind Mrs. Johnson. In <em>Gratz </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>(1 Penn. Rep. 333); two of the Judges were of opinion, that <em>a, feme covert </em>Avas not bound by her husband\u2019s agreement. [GJ-ibson, C. J. The Court Avas equally divided on that point, when the case first came up. Afterwards Judge Kennedy, who had come on the bench in the interval, joined in the opinion Avhich I expressed, and which is reported in 1 Penn. Rep. 357, that the agreement AYas not binding on the Avoman.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b548-6\">Mr. <em>Chew </em>and Mr. <em>Rawle, </em>for the defendants in error:\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b548-7\">1. If the law be as contended for on the other side, a married woman with separate property, is in this state, to be considered out of the reach of justice, and may commit torts Avith impunity. In England, it is true, her person may be taken in execution for a tort committed jointly AYith her husband; but here it Avould seem that her person is exempt. The act of 1819 declares, that no female shall .be arrested or imprisoned for any debt. [Kennedy, J. That act is expressly confined to <em>debts contracted, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>has never been supposed to extend to torts.] Then the act of 1807 forbids the issuing of a <em>ca. sa. </em>where the defendant has no real or personal estate. [Kennedy, J. That is, real or personal estate which may be taken in execution upon the judgment.] The law ought not to favour such trusts, if they are to go this length. The principle of all the cases is that a <em>feme </em>covert, with separate property, is to be considered <em>a feme sole. </em>Clancy, 282; and <em>Newlin </em>v. <em>Newlin, </em>(1 Serg. &amp; R. 275.) By this deed she has the power of sale, and a power of appointment by will. With these powers, she is to be considered *as possessed of the pg201 absolute estate. Why should not her estate \u2014 whether it L J be a life estate or fee simple \u2014 be bound by a judgment ? It is settled, that a judgment in Pennsylvania is a lien on an equitable interest, and indeed on every kind of interest in land. <em>Burd </em>v. <em>Dansdale, </em>(2 Binn. 91); <em>Read </em>v. <em>Morrison, </em>(12 Serg. &amp; R. 21). In <em>Savoy </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>(2 Rawle, 343); a lien for building, was held to exist as against <em>a feme covert </em>and remainder-man. [Gibson, C. J. That was a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>by the express direction of an act of assembly.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b549-6\">2. The submission was of the question of title, and the award ought to be binding and conclusive. It is true, that proceedings before two justices relate to the obtaining possession, but as soon as an affidavit is made, and the cause is-removed to the Common Pleas, it becomes an action of ejectment, and the question of title is involved. When the submission was made, the cause had been dismissed by the justices, on the ground that the title to the property was claimed by the trustee. The reference was to three gentlemen of the bar; and it is not to be supposed that the mere question of possession was referred to them. [Rogers, J. It appears to me that it lies on you to show affirmatively, that the title was in question. We have always assimilated the proceedings to the action of ejectment, when they have been transferred to the Common Pleas. Kennedy, J. The argument would give to these proceedings greater force and effect, than an award in action of ejectment, which, under the act of 1705, is equivalent to the verdict of a jury, but no more.] There was no action in Court at the time of the submission; which therefore is to be considered as at common law, and the award in such case is held to be conclusive. <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Harvard, </em>(15 Serg. &amp; R. 165); <em>Zeigler </em>v. <em>Zeigler, </em>(2 Serg. &amp; R. 289); Watson on Awards, 8; Kyd on Awards, 381; <em>Shepperd </em>v. <em>Ryan, </em>(15 Johns. Rep. 497); <em>Burton </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>(3 Johns. Rep. 368). It is true that the agreement was signed by the attorneys, but it was ratified by the parties after-wards ; and whatever may be the law as to the right of the husband to bind the wife, in this case the agreement was signed by her trustee, who was her legal representative. 3 Viner, 62, tit. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>Arbitration; 1 Com.

In that case, the conveyance to the trustees, was upon trust <em>\u201cto permit </em>the party, (who at the time was <em>a, feme sole, </em>but r*Wll contemplated *being married,) to use, improve, occupy, *- -* possess and enjoy; and to receive all and singular, the rents, issues and profits,\u201d and it was considered that the trustees took the estate with the use executed. The Chief Justice who delivered the opinion of the Court says, <em>\u201c </em>a use thus limited to any other than a married woman or <em>feme </em>in contemplation of marriage, would be executed; but it is immaterial whether the trust be to <em>pay </em>a married woman the profits, or to <em>permit </em>her to receive them, it being necessary to a separate provision, that the legal estate should remain in the trustees, to prevent the husband from taking the profits, and defeating the very object of the conveyance.\u201d It is certainly true, that a distinction has been made between a devise to a person to <em>pay </em>over the rents and profits to another, and a devise in trust to <em>permit </em>another to receive the rents and profits. In the first case it has been held that the legal estate should continue in the first devisee, so that he might perform the trust, because without having the control of the estate, he could not receive the rents and pay them over as directed; <em>Neville </em>v. <em>Saunders, </em>(1 Vern. 415.) But in the second case, it -has been adjudged that the legal estate is vested by the statute of uses, in the person who is to receive the rents. <em>Boughton </em>v. <em>Langley, </em>(2 Ld. Raym. 873.) This distinction, however, as the Chief Justice has said in <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Dolan, </em>does not exist in the case of a <em>feme covert, </em>where the estate is conveyed or devised to trustees for her separate use. The courts in such case will, if possible, construe the grant or devise, so as to vest the legal estate in the trustees, for the purpose of carrying into execution, in the most effectual manner practicable, the intention of the donor. <em>Harton </em>v. <em>Harton, </em>(7 Term. Rep. 648); 1 Cruise\u2019s Dig. tit. 12, Trust, ch. 1, pl. 15, page 456, and pl. 19, page 457. As to the intention of the donor in this case, there can be but one opinion respecting it. It is most unequivocally declared to be to give the wife the separate use and benefit of the estate during her natural life, without subjecting it to the control of her husband, or to liability in any way whatever, for the payment of his debts. This being the intention expressed in the deed, it is manifest that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>it would be entirely defeated, if it were to be held that the use was executed in the wife; for this would be putting the estate under the control and direction of her husband, so as to enable him to take the rents in despite of her, and to dispose of them as he pleased. The design, therefore, of the donor, can only be carried into effect, by considering the legal estate as vested under the deed in the trustee. That this was intended, is still further indicated by the' clause giving the wife the ppwer to dispose of it for the benefit of herself and children, which requires the trustees, in case of such disposition being made by her, to execute such writing as should be required by law to carry it into effect; which could be of no avail, and was unnecessary, unless he thought he was investing him with the legal estate. Seeing then that the legal estate became thus vested in the trustee and not in the wife or *her husband, how could it be taken in execution, and sold as their property, under a judgment against them ? To this, it has been answered, that the equitable estate, at least, was in the wife in the same manner as if she had been a <em>feme sole ; </em>and that any interest in land in Pennsylvania, whether of a legal or equitable nature, is liable to be taken in execution. That this latter branch of the proposition, when such interest is not restricted to a special use in a limited form, may be true generally, cannot perhaps be denied. But here, admitting the wife to have had an equitable interest, it was only to receive the rents or profits of the estate for her own private and separate support and maintenance; and in case she sold or rather contracted for a sale of the estate under the authority given her in the deed, then to receive the proceeds thereof, for the benefit of herself and children, without being subject to the control or authority of her husband in any respect whatever. The power of the trustee over the estate was interposed between it and the husband, so as to guard and protect it for her benefit against any act of his being made to affect it, either directly or consequentially. Now the judgment under which the sale was made, or the cause of action upon which it was founded, does not appear to have had any connection whatever, with the support, comfort, maintenance or benefit, of either the wife or her children ; but. on the contrary, it seems to have been for a <em>tort </em>committed by the husband and wife jointly; in which she may be fairly presumed to have joined under force of his authority; which would in effect be subjecting the estate to the will of the husband, contrary to the tenor of the deed creating the trust, and the intention of its author, if it were to be held liable to redress the party injured by such acts. Beside, as it is impossible to conceive that the wife could have derived any benefit from the transaction upon which the judgment was founded, it is difficult even in an equitable point of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>\u2022view, to discover any good ground upon which, the sale can be supported; because, I take it, that the right to take in execution a mere equitable interest in lands is rather founded upon principles of equity and natural justice; inasmuch as it cannot be done at law in England, whence we derived our principles of jurisprudence. I however, do not wish to be understood as saying that the wife was not liable to be sued with her husband, for their joint wrongful act; because by law, she undoubtedly may in many cases; see Com. Dig. tit. Baron &amp; Feme. (Y.); <em>Draper </em>v. <em>Fulkes, </em>(Yev. 166, in Mr. Metcalf\u2019s note); 2 Saund. on Pl. &amp; Evi. 572; but merely to say that in a moral and conscientious point of view, the blame chiefly rests with him; for if not committed in obedience to his authority, he could and ought to have restrained her as well as himself from doing it. It is clear, therefore, that to hold, that the sale made under the judgment in this case, divested the trustee of the estate, and extinguished the trust, would be to frustrate the sole and entire object of its author; and to permit proq-, the estate to be disposed of in a manner ^different, as *- J well as appropriated to uses altogether foreign from that authorised and prescribed by the deed of trust; which would be overruling what is laid down in <em>Lancaster </em>v. <em>Dolan; </em>that even the <em>cestui que trust </em>herself, cannot exercise an authority over the estate, so as to divert it from the defined object of the trust, further than she is expressly empowered to do so by the terms of the deed; and then only in the manner and form prescribed by it._</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">This brings us to the conclusion, that the plaintiff is entitled to recover, unless he be estopped by the award of the arbitrators.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-6\">The submission under which the award was made, has express reference to a summary proceeding commenced before two justices of the peace, therein named, by the defendant as a purchaser <em>at sheriff\u2019s sale </em>of the property in dispute; which could only have been instituted under the act of the 5th of April, 1802, entitled, \u201cAn act to enable purchasers at sheriff\u2019s and coroner\u2019s sales to obtain possession.\u201d According to the terms of the submission, the question was, \u201cwhether the plaintiff (that is the defendant, who was the plaintiff in that proceeding,) as <em>sheriff\u2019s vendee </em>is, or is not, entitled to the <em>possession </em>of the property in dispute.\u201d It is therefore fairly inferrible that the only question submitted to the decision of the arbitrators, was, whether agreeably to the provisions of the act, the plaintiff in the proceeding, commenced by him under it, was entitled, he having the sheriff\u2019s deed for it, duly acknowledged in, and certified under the seal of the proper court, to recover the possession. Now it is pretty obvious from the preamble of the act, that the great <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"523\">*523</page-number>object for passing it, was to put the purchaser at sheriff\u2019s sale, in possession of the land bought by him, without any unreasonable delay; and that too, whether the sale was valid or not, so he had a deed for it, acknowledged and certified as mentioned above; because from the inability generally of the owners of lands, so sold, to compensate the purchasers at sheriffs\u2019 sales, for the injury and loss arising from the great delay that attended the recovery of the possession in ejectment, which was the only remedy then in being, and one where the regularity and validity of the sales could be investigated and decided on; the latter had frequently sustained great damage, and been put to much expense without the possibility of remuneration; but still, leaving the owner of the land after he should be evicted from possession by this proceeding, to bring his action of ejectment without prejudice, and thus have the validity of the sale tested. This is demonstrated by the terms of the first section of the act, which makes the sheriff\u2019s deed, in such summary proceeding, if duly acknowledged in and certified under the seal of the proper court, <em>conclusive </em>evidence of the sale; and further provides, that no <em>certiorari, </em>which may be issued to remove such proceedings, shall be a <em>supersedeas, </em>or have any effect to \u25a0 prevent or delay the delivery of the possession. A judgment in a proceeding under this act, against the defendant, is not even equivalent in its effect to a judgment in ejectment, though it seemed to be doubted r^co^-i by the counsel for the defendant, whether it was not con- *- I elusive. The whole scope and design of the act, as may be plainly collected from the several parts of it, show clearly, that such judgment ought not to be any bar or impediment to the maintenance of as many actions of ejectment afterwards, between the parties, as if there never had been a proceeding under the act. Indeed, it would have been unjust, had it provided' otherwise; for the title to the land, or the validity of the sheriff\u2019s sale, cannot be brought in question or inquired into. Considering then, the arbitrators as substituted for the justices and the inquest,for the purpose of passing upon the defendant\u2019s right to the possession under his sheriff\u2019s deed, upon the same ground that the justices and the inquest should have done, which I am rather inclined to think, meets the design and intention of the parties best, the award ought not to have any other or greater effect than a judgment rendered by the justices and the inquest; which would have had, as I have shown, no effect in barring the plaintiff here of his right to recover.. But, even supposing the submission had been intended to embrace the title to the land between these parties, and that it is to be considered, as a submission and an award at common law, it does not appear that they all gave their assent to the submission. Without this, the award cannot be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"524\">*524</page-number>as possessing any binding effect whatever. Sophia Johnson, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>who had certainly a much greater interest in the matter than any other, never signed or assented to the submission. For although it appears to have the name of a gentleman of the bar to it, as attorney for the defendants, meaning Johnson and his wife, who are set down as the defendants in the caption to the submission, yet it does not appear, that he had any authority from the wife to do this. It may and most likely Avas done at the instance of the husband; which would not bind her in a common law submission in such case. But this form of signing the submission among other things, also tends to show that it Avas rather considered as a continuation of the same proceeding, and for the same end with that commenced before the two justices of the peace. Upon the whole, we are satisfied, that the judgment of the District Court ought to be reversed, and that judgment here ought to be rendered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">Judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Cited by Counsel, 3 Wharton, 312; 4 Id. 449; 5 Id. 122; 10 Watts, 224; 7 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 346; 7 Barr, 487; 5 Harris, 437; 11 Casey, 136; 8 Wright, 227; 7 P.
