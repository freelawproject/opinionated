It was not, however, taken away from the wharf; the plaintiffs refusing to ratify the contract; but, while there, part of it was sold to the defendant by one Trimmels, who alleged himself to be the agent of the consignors, and to whom the defendant paid the price agreed upon between them. It appeared, also, that the consignors of the lumber had recovered the value <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>against the present plaintiffs, in an action on the contract. \u2022 The plaintiff having proved the possession of the lumber by the defendant, and that the property was in the plaintiff, by reason of the recovery of the price or value of it from them by the owner; the defendant offered in evidence declarations of Inslee, made after the landing of the lumber on the wharf, and before the purchase by the defendant \u2014 that the lumber did not .belong to the plaintiffs. It was shown, that Inslee was employed in the lumber yard of the plaintiffs, and had charge of their planing machine. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of Inslee\u2019s declarations ; but the judge admitted.them, and the evidence having been gone through, charged the jury in substance as follows :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-6\">\u201c There being no dispute about the value of the lumber, the case depends upon a few plain principles. The only person known in the business, on the part of the plaintiffs, was Mr. Inslee, who had applied *to Davis &amp; Biddle for permis- p*-. o\u00bb-, sion to land the lumber, and throughout acted for the *- -* plaintiffs, who must take his acts throughout. Unless somebody else is answerable, one or other of these parties must lose their money. It appears that Inslee, after having been repeatedly sent to by Davis &amp; Biddle, declared that the concern had nothing to do with this lumber, and would not receive it, and left Davis &amp; Biddle to take their own course with regard to it; and in consequence of that, as a point of law, any person purchasing for, or with the knowledge and approbation of Davis &amp; Biddle, had a right to take the property: and if Davis &amp; Biddle chose to sell or allow a sale, by a person they honestly believed had a right to sell, after Inslee had disclaimed the ownership, the purchaser may hold the property, and the plaintiff may look to Davis &amp; Biddle, or to the person- actually selling, if they have any claim. But as a point of law, Murphy is protected, having purchased with the knowledge and approbation of Davis &amp; Biddle. Murphy used .due precaution, received the lumber from a responsible house, and he is protected. If he is responsible, then every one, who has a piece of this wood in a bureau, may also be made responsible, and may be sued on the same principle. There must be some limit to a man\u2019s following his property.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-8\">The plaintiffs\u2019 counsel excepted to the admission of Inslee\u2019s declarations, and to the charge of the court; and, having removed the record to this court, assigned the following errors:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b199-9\">\u201c 1. The judge who tried the cause, permitted the declarations of John Inslee to be given in evidence to the jury, to affect the rights of the plaintiffs, the said Inslee being no party to the record, and no authority shown to bind the plaintiffs by his declarations \u2014 the said evidence being objected to by the counsel for the plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>2. The judge charged the jury, that there being no dispute as to the value of certain lumber which was the subject in controversy, and the said Inslee having applied to land the said lumber, and being the only person known in the business, on the part of the, plain tiffs, his declarations and acts bound them throughout.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-6\">3. The judge charged the jury, that the plaintiffs were prevented from recovering by the declarations of Inslee, that the lumber in question did not belong to the concern, and that they would have nothing to do with it. That the owners of the wharf might sell it, or do as they pleased with it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b200-7\">4. The judge further charged the jury, that any person buying the said lumber, with the knowledge and consent of the owners of the wharf, after the said declarations, would have a right to hold it.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b200-8\">Mr. Ohew, for the plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_0\">cited <em>Hosack </em>v. <em>Weaver, </em>(1 Yeates, 478); <em>Easton </em>v. <em>Worthington, </em>(5 Serg. &amp; R. 130.)</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Avf\">*Mr. <em>Hirst, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYi\">cited <em>Shelhamer </em>v. <em>Thomas, </em>(7 Serg. &amp; R. 106.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b200-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AeK\">A disclaimer of title by the plaintiff in person, when the defendant bought, would have concluded him; whether it were made in fraud or in ignorance; for every man is bound to bear the consequences of his own mistakes. The matter, then was, whether Inslee, who appears to have had some sort of agency under the plaintiff, had power to represent him on the occasion; and that presented a question for the jury. There was at least some evidence to raise it; and as error is not to be presumed, we are bound to say the assignment of it has not been sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-12\">Cited by Counsel, 2 Wharton, 203, 343.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
