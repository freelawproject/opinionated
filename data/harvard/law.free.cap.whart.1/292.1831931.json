Abraham asked John to sign it; he looked round at it, said he had'nothing to sign, and then went out. I understood that it was an agreement that each of the heirs of Michael Walter deceased should hold the part of the estate which he had accepted, upon a division which had been made of the same. The witness identified the paper. That he was not at the valuation or partition nor does he know anything of his own knowledge in regard to it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b313-12\">.

That if the plaintiff ever had a cause of action against the defendant, it is barred by the statute of limitations.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-8\">Fourth. That there is no proof of an express promise by John *Walker to pay the difference between the value of the r*pqq-i part accepted by him and his share in the whole valu- *- -1 ation, nor any evidence from which a jury could be warranted in inferring such a promise; and <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>will not lie for owelty of partition in money, of lands held in common.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-10\">The demurrer was argued by counsel and held under advisement till the of 1834, when the Court rendered judgment for the plaintiffs on the demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-12\">Whereupon this writ of error was sued out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-13\">In this Court the following errors were assigned:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b317-14\">\u201c1.

The evidence did not support the declaration, and it is well settled that a variance in actions like the present is fatal. Archbald\u2019s Civil Pleadings, 122, 369; Selwyn\u2019s Nisi Prius, title Assumpsit; Stephen on Plead. 108; <em>Snell </em>v. <em>Moses, </em>(1 Johns.

There is a substantial difference between appointing persons to <em>make partition, </em>and appointing them to <em>make valuation, </em>after a partition has been effected.</p>\n<p data-order=\"88\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b317-19\">2. I am aware that the question involved in the second cause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>of demurrer may be supposed to have been settled by the case of <em>Rhoads's Appeal, </em>(3 Rawle, 420); but in that case the wife had signed the original agreement. Here the married women were not parties in any way to the partition. It is true that they were parties to the alleged ratification, and acknowledged the deed according to the act of Assembly; but I submit that the original agreement was absolutely void and incapable of confirmation. Co. Litt. 170, <em>(b); Jackson </em>v. <em>Vanderheyden, </em>(17 Johns. Rep. 167); <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Dwelly, </em>(6 Wendell, 13.)

This is an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>The declaration sets forth a contract dated the 2d of May, 1820.

In the calculation of interest made by the T*8001' plMntiff\u2019s ^counsel and which the jury adopted, the cause *- J of action is made to commence on the 2d of May, 1820 ; and this being the time stated in the declaration, the plaintiff is bound by it.

Money directed to be paid for owelty partakes of the character of land, and is subject to the same rules of descent. Brooke\u2019s Abr. title Partition, \u00a7 5; Co.

Why-should we be turned round, when there is no doubt we could recover in ejectment. In <em>Pidcock </em>v. <em>Bye, </em>(3 Rawle, 183,) <em>assumpsit </em>was held to lie against the assignee of land subject to the charge of the widow\u2019s thirds, to recover the principal amount after her death. Judge Huston in that case, expressed his dislike of the idea that the equitable powers of the Court are more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>extensive in one form of action than in another. If we had a Court of Chancery, a bill for specific performance might be brought which would not be barred by the statute. In <em>Higgs </em>v. <em>Stimmel, </em>(3 Penn.

The act of 1807, in relation to compulsory partitions, it is true, gives a lien in such cases; but the provision shows that no such lien exists at common law. The case of <em>Higgs </em>v. <em>Stimmel, </em>does not sustain the position. It is settled that a lien does not exist in this state for unpaid <em>purchase </em>money; and the reasons which have led to that conclusion apply to the case of money payable for owelty. The case of <em>Higgs </em>v. <em>Stimmel, </em>also shows that the title was sufficient by a parol partition. If such is the law, the right of action accrued in 1820.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"97\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b319-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b319-11\">Gibson, C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aqt\">Though usually dealing, for purposes of performance, with contracts but for the sale of lands, and compelling the vendor to fulfil his stipulations by a conveyance, equity entertains a bill also for payment of purchase money, on the ground of reciprocity of recourse, and not for failure of remedy at law. It seems formerly to have been thought in <em>Armiger </em>v. <em>Clark, </em>(Bunb. 111,) that, as the vendor wants but the purchase money, his remedy is exclusively at law. But in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Lechmere, </em>(10 Mod. 506,) it was conceded by the chancellor, that he may come into equity also for inadequacy of redress at law; since when, it has come to be a rudimental principle that he may file a bill, or bring an action at his option. Newl. Con. 89, 91; Sugd. Vend. 294, 5. Where he is unable to prove the terms of a special agreement, his effective remedy is in equity by the force of cir<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>cumstances. Rut though the common law may not imply a promise to pay in consideration of indebtedness for the price of land sold, why may not an action of <em>indebitatus </em>assumpsit, on the principle of <em>Lang </em>v. <em>Keppele, </em>be substituted for a bill in equity, where the vendor has entitled himself to specific performance of a parol contract of sale? There is, perhaps, no common law 'medium, through which the matter proper for such a bill, can be exhibited to a jury with more convenience or advantage. Had exception been taken to the count instead of the measure of proof, the late case of <em>Irvine </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>(Sunbury 1835, 4 Watts,) which requires an averment of circumstances to take the contract out of the statute of frauds, would have interposed a formidable difficulty. A count for the price of land sold and <em>conveyed, </em>would doubtless be sufficient; and where the contract had been partially executed, an averment of possession given, would be equally so. Here it is not pretended that a case of part performance was not made out by the evidence; which, being sufficient to support an unexceptionable count, is sufficient to entitle the plaintiff to recover. It is immaterial, therefore, that there is a substantial variance between the proof and the count on a special promise; and that there *is no proof at all of the <em>insimul </em>com<em>putassent. </em>As the plaintiff was entitled to recover on the evidence, it must be intended that the count to which alone it was applicable, is the foundation of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">The defence on the statute of limitations, could be maintained but by showing a cause of action originally complete by delivery of possession pursuant to the partition. A parol partition in part executed, is undoubtedly valid, but as vesting no more than equitable title in severalty. The difficulty in <em>Ebert </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>(1 Binney, 218,) was to get the statute of frauds out of the way of the contract; to effect which, the case was very properly treated as one of part performance; but no one dreamed of the title being vested at law. Such being the state of the case when the parties here took possession in severalty, on what ground was the difference to be paid for owelty, demandable before tender of the legal title? If there is any thing which equity scans with care, it is the title which is forced upon a purchaser by a decree of performance. A summary of the cases on this subject, is given by Mr. Sugden in his Law of Vendors, p. 310, by which it appears that a purchaser will not be compelled to pay for a doubtful or an <em>equitable </em>title; nor will a case to ascertain the solidity of the legal title be sent to the law judges without his consent.. Even where they have certified in favour of the legal title, performance will not be decreed if the chancellor is dissatisfied with the equitable title; and wherever the point certified is doubtful, the purchaser may require it to be sent to other judges. Thus, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>we see that every possible care is taken of him, by seeing that his title is not only .unimpeachable but above suspicion. There are undoubtedly exceptions to this, resting on express or implied terms of the contract, in which a purchaser acquainted with the nature of the title and treating for it without objection, will be compelled to fulfil his bargain, though circumstances might entitle him to subsequent relief, because he has got what he bargained for. But can it be supposed that a parol title is what 'these parties bargained for ? Such might be an effectual ground of recovery or defence before a jury, but not as conveniently so as a title vested by direct conveyance; and equity will not compel a purchaser to accept a title depending on facts collectable from circumstances by a jury, but attended with such doubt as to effect the value of the estate as a marketable commodity. Such is the rule in chancery; and it appears to be a just one. Can it be intended then, that these parties consented to be satisfied with a title which a purchaser of ordinary prudence would not have consented to take, when a better one could be had at the expense of a scrivener\u2019s fee? To suppose so, would be unreasonable. Now, a party seeking performance, instantly turns every thing to be done by him into a condition precedent; and as the legal title was not tendered till within six years before the impetration of the writ, the plaintiffs\u2019 testator had not entitled himself to an action in time to bar them by the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">Cited by Counsel, 5 Wharton, 115; 6 Id. 334; 8 Watts, 274; 9 Id. 107; 3 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 331; 7 Casey, 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Cited by the Court below, 4 Harris, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">See also 7 Harris, 31.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
