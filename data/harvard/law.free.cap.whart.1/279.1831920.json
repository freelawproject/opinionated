The act of 25th March, 1824, \u00a7 11, 12, makes it a felony to forge a check on a bank. That act is to be considered as abrogated by the act of 23d April, 1829, the 10th section of which repeals all inconsistent laws. The act of 1829 does not call the' offence a felony. It must, therefore, remain as it was at common law, merely a misdemeanor ; <em>The King </em>v. <em>Ward, (2 </em>Ld. Raymond, 1461); <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Searle, </em>(2 Binn. 380.) To show that an affirmative act repeals all preceding acts upon the same subject, were cited 6 Bac. Abr. 372, (Title Statutes, D.); 4 Inst. 43; <em>Foster\u2019s Ca</em>se, (11 Rep. 61); <em>Harbat </em>v. <em>Fox, </em>(1 Shower, 520); *1 Ld. Raymond, 161; 4 Burr. Rep. 2026. [Kennedy, J.\u2014 Does not the concluding section of the act of 1829 save all previous descriptions and definitions of offences ?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b298-8\">2d. There was error in the sentence, first, in the fine of $5 which is not authorized by the act of 1829, and, secondly, in the alternative punishment \u201cseparate <em>or </em>solitary confinement at labour,\u201d &amp;c. It is true that the act of 1829 directs that the punishment shall be \u201cseparate or solitary .confinement;\u201d but it means that the Court sh.all direct one or the other, not leave it to the construction of the officers of the prison. There is an obvious distinction between separate and solitary confinement. [Rogers, J. \u2014 Suppose you were right in this idea, it would avail your client little, since we would have him brought up and sentence him aright.] That has not been the practice heretofore. This Court in several eases, in which they reversed the sentence, ordered the party back to be tried again. [Rogers, J. \u2014 We decided a short time .ago, in a ease from Luzerne county, that where the indictment was good, and the trial good, but the sentence defective, we would do, what the Court below would do, after a new conviction, sentence him <em>de novo. </em>The subject was fully considered and all the authorities cited.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b298-9\">The Court declined hearing <em>The Attorney-G-eneral [Todd) </em>and Mr. <em>J. M. Read,</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvGi\">who were to argue in support of the judgment and sentence.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b298-10\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AeH\">By the eleventh section of the act of 1824, the forging of a bank check such as this, is declared to be a felony punishable with fine and imprisonment at solitary labour for not less than one year nor more than ten years. . How far has this been altered by tl\u00ede act of 1829 ? By the fourth section of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>act, it is declared that instead of the punishment theretofore prescribed, imprisonment at solitary labour for a period not less than one year, nor more than seven, shall be inflicted for the first offence, and the like imprisonment, not exceeding ten years, for the second. Did the question stand on this, it would be easy to show that the character and class of an offence is not altered by a modification of the punishment. But the sixth section declares, that \u201call <em>definitions </em>and <em>descriptions </em>of crimes; all fines, forfeitures, penalties, and incapacitiesthe restitution of property or payment of the value; and every other matter not particularly mentioned; shall remain as theretofore. Certainly the definition and description of a crime have respect to its essence and class, when it induces., as felony do'es, a civil disability, by incapacitating a party convict to be a witness. It is clear, therefore, that it was not the intention of the legislature to reduce the type of the offence to a misdemeanor; and it is needless to say that the fine is not abolished.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Cited by Counsel, 5 Barr, 65; 9 Harris, 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">Cited by the Court, 7 Barr, 375; 1 Casey, 22.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
