Heppard, and William B. Heppard, were indebted to the *defendant on a promissory n'ote, dated April 15, r*oo4.-1 1823, at six months, in the sum of $357 82; which *- -* note fell due on the 18th day of October, 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-8\">Nathaniel Richardson, of Pittsburg, was indebted to the said Joseph M. and William B. Heppard, in the sum of $295 92, on a book account; with which fact defendant was acquainted before the transfer of the note by him, as hereinafter stated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-9\">The said J. M. and W. B. Heppard, on the 23d day of August, 1823, became insolvent; and on the same day made an assignment of their estate to the plaintiff, in trust, for the benefit of their creditors. Notice of the assignment was given by publication in the Philadelphia Gazette, on the 25th day of August, 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-10\">The defendant had, previously to the 20th of August, 1823, obtained a discount of the note of the 15th April, at the banking-house of Stephen Girard, and received the money therefor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-11\">On the 20th of August, 1823, the defendant in Philadelphia, wrote to his agent, Mr. Dubarry, in Pittsburg, informing him that he held the note of the 15th April, and other notes of the Heppards, and expressing his fear lest they should become bankrupt, and instructing him to barter said note for goods. This letter Dubarry received on the 25th of August.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-12\">On the 26th of August, 1823, Dubarry, in Pittsburg, bartered the note to Richardson for goods, (bees-wax, &amp;c.) to the amount of $295 92, (the amount of Richardson\u2019s debt to the Heppards,) and by letter dated at Pittsburg, on the 27th day of August, 1823, informed the defendant of the transaction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-13\">The defendant on the 2d of September, 1823, took up the note from Girard\u2019s Bank, and transmitted it on the same day to Dubarry, who, after its receipt, delivered it to Richardson. Richardson had, previously, by letter dated at Pittsburg, about the 27th of August, informed the Heppards of the transfer of the note to him; and he received no notice from any source, of the assignment made by them, until some weeks after the barter with Dubarry, and the receipt of the note from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b239-14\">On the 8th of April, 1824, the plaintiff, as assignee of the Heppards, commenced a suit in the court of Common Pleas of Alleghany county, against Richardson, to recover the amount of the said book account. Richardson pleaded in that suit, among other things, a set-off; and on the trial, gave in evidence Heppard\u2019s note of the 15th of April, 1823, transferred to him; the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>transfer of which was antedated by Dubarry to correspond with the date of the letter, in which defendant had authorized him to barter it, viz.: August 20th, 1823.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-6\">A verdict was rendered in the said suit, in favour of Richardson, for the sum of $71 13; the set-off of the said note being allowed by the court and 'jury. Judgment was rendered on that verdict, and no proceedings to reverse it were taken by the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-7\">1\"*2251 *The plaintiff then brought this action against Bey-L -* lard, to recover the sum of money, (viz. the amount of the said note, $327 82 and interest), lost to them by the judgment in Pittsburg, through the proceedings of Beylard, which the plaintiff alleged to be fraudulent in law; and he claimed to recover either the whole amount, or at least the amount of Richardson\u2019s debt to the Heppards.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-8\">The judge below, charged upon the above facts, that the plaintiff could not recover; that the conduct of the defendant was perfectly fair and iegal; that he had the right to do what he did; that there was no principle of law to support the plaintiff\u2019s action ; and that these matters should have been relied upon in the suit between the plaintiff and Richardson.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-9\">A verdict and judgment were rendered for the defendant. The plaintiff took a bill of exceptions to the charge of the judge, and a writ of error, and assigned the following errors.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-10\">\u201c1. The court below erred, in charging the jury that there was no principle in law, upon which the action of the plaintiff could be supported.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-11\">2. The court erred, in saying that the defendant had a right to offer in the market the note of the 15th of April, 1823, before he took it up from Girard\u2019s Bank, and to sell it on the 20th or 26th of August, and that in so doing, he, the defendant, had nothing to do with Heppard, or with transactions between Richardson and the Heppards; and was not to be affected by them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-12\">3. The court erred in saying, that there was nothing in the defendant\u2019s conduct, from beginning to end, which the law prohibited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b240-13\">\u2022 4. The court erred, also, in saying, that all in this cause had been previously heard and tried at Pittsburg.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b240-14\">Mr. 6r. <em>M.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AWM\">The argument for the plaintiff, is founded on the fallacious assumption, that in gaining a legal advantage over the other creditors, the defendant was guilty of a fraud; which, in turn, is founded on an <em>obiter </em>dictum of the judge who delivered the opinion of the court in <em>Richter </em>v. <em>Selin. </em>I am unable to perceive how a measure to obtain such an advantage, when unattended with misrepresentation or an abuse of confidence, can be inconsistent with the strictest honour. The creditor may know, that the debtor intends to give a preference to others; and what can be the harm *of an attempt to prefer himself'? It is to be remembered, that the parties are deal- *- -* ing with legal rights, and not .principles of generosity in sharing a loss. Placed in a condition of common peril, which imposes on each the necessity of struggling for his own preservation, good faith requires no more of them than that each should not deceive the other to his prejudice. Whom did the defendant deceive ? Not the endorsee of the note ; for he recovered it, or, what is the same thing, obtained a credit for the amount by defalcation. Not the assignees or any of the creditors; for he had no transaction with them. By obtaining on the contract of endorsement, more for his note than he could have made of it in his own hands, he deceived no one who placed confidence in him, or had a right to prescribe to him any particular course of conduct ; and I am unable to understand how a creditor who has thus obtained more than his proportion from an insolvent fund, may be compelled to restore it. In all cases of the stamp, a legal advantage is .a conscionable advantage. Thus it was held by this court, in <em>Carson </em>v. <em>M\u2018Farland, </em>2 Rawle, 118, that a creditor who has been paid more than his proportion, by mistake of the executor, can not be compelled to refund it. Money can be followed only when it has been received <em>mala fide ; </em>whence results a clear and indisputable rule of law, that when paid by mistake in discharge of a just debt, it may not be recovered back. Now, to be successful, what would be the gist of an action here ? Not deceit; for the defendant deceived no one. Not the gain of a legal advantage; which, as the law allows it, surely.cannot be unlawful. It must necessarily be the receipt of money to the plaintiff\u2019s use, for the excess beyond what would have been the defendant\u2019s dividend. But the money had of the endorsee was not that which was coming to the estate of the insolvent; it was the price of a chose in action, parted with on terms which the law did not prohibit between the parties; and which did not create a trust for the plaintiff: and be the fancied equity of the ease what it may, there is not such privity between the parties as will support an action.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">Cited by Counsel, 6 Watts, 433.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
