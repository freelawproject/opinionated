Smith </em>and Mr. <em>Sergeant </em>contended,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AqnD\">that none but persons having a pecuniary interest in the corporation by holding stock, were to be considered as members. The rule is, that in monied institutions an interest in the stock is essential to membership. This rule is founded in good sense, which leads <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>men to trust the care of their property to persons having a common interest with themselves. In the case of literary, charitable or religious institutions a general interest is sufficient. Where the corporation is of a mixed character, the principles as to monied institutions ought to govern: since the control of the stock ought not to be in the hands of persons having no interest in it. Such are the turnpike and bridge companies and others, in which -there is a view to the public good and private advantage. These principles will be found in the text-writers and adjudications. Angel &amp; Ames on Corporations, 62, 77, 238, 240; <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Portland Bank, </em>(3 Mass. Rep. 364); <em>State </em>v. <em>Tudor, </em>(5 Day\u2019s Rep. 333); <em>Bond </em>v. <em>Appleton, </em>(8 Mass. Rep. 472). What then is the character of this corporation ? It is obvious, that r*4f'll *** *s not a charitable institution merely. It differs from L the saving banks of England, and the saving fund societies established here, in the essential feature of possessing a joint-stock fund created by the subscriptions of members not depositors, and upon which a dividend is annually made. The object of those societies is to take care of the money of depositors, and to pay them,the highest rate of interest that can be made, after deducting expenses. They are not allowed to discount notes; and their investments being upon real estate or public stocks, they require no collateral capital stock as security. The savings institutions, on the contrary, look to the interests of the stockholders, and endeavour to give as mpeh profit as possible to the latter. Whenever a capital is made up by contributions, and is to return a profit it is a joint stock, no matter what the public object may be. There are many passages of this charter, which seem to imply, that the legislature meant <em>stockholders </em>only Avhen \u201cmembers\u201d are spoken of, and if there are others, which seem to import a contrary intention, the principles stated with reference to joint-stock companies, ought to have Aveight in deciding betAveen them.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-5\">Mr. <em>W. M. Meredith </em>and Mr. <em>Broom, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b490-6\">The rules of law which have been referred to on the other side apply only Avhere the charter is silent. Here there is a distinction expressly taken between stockholders and members. The 1st, 4th, 5th and 7th sections afford evidences of this intention. There were necessarily <em>members, </em>before. there were any <em>stockholders. </em>The provision for future members is, that the directors may admit them; not that every stockholder might make as many members as he had shares to assign. The power to the directors to admit members is necessarily an exclusive one. The only mention of stockholders is in the 7th section, where a dividend is provided for. If the stockholders alone, were to be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>members, it might follow that the greater part of the profits would be appropriated to them, to the prejudice of the depositors. The legislature probably intended that a check should exist upon this power. This is not a monied corporation, in the sense in which that term is commonly used. The primary object is the security and benefit of the depositors. The creation of the capital stock is stated in the act to be for the security of the depositors. Upon the principle relied upon on the other side, the <em>depositors </em>ought to have the control of the institution. The by-law made by the directors, confining membership to stockholders, was beyond their power; besides it has been repealed by the members in the manner authorized by the act of assembly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b491-5\">The following cases were cited: <em>Sergeant </em>v. <em>The Franklin Ins. Co. </em>(8 Picker. 90); <em>Quiner </em>v. <em>Marblehead Ins. Co. </em>(10 Mass. Rep. 476); <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Durand, </em>(12 Mass. Rep. 57); 1 Blackst. Com. 392, 484, (note); 5 Mod. 259; Angel &amp; Ames, 244.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\">*The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b491-7\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkL\">The rules obtained in this case, involve two questions, which depend upon the construction of the act of the 5th of April, 1834, incorporating the Philadelphia Savings Institution.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">1. Is a stockholder, a member of the corporation, and as such entitled to participate in its business ?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">2. Does he cease to be a member when he ceases to be a stockholder ?</p>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">In relation to the power of admitting members of a corporation, as is said in Angel and Ames on Corporation, 62, reference must often be had to the provisions and spirit of the charter; and when the charter is silent, we must look to the provisions of the common law, and to the particular nature and purpose of the corporation. In certain corporations, (such for example as religious, charitable, and literary,) the number of members is often limited by charter; and whenever there is a vacancy, it is usually filled by a vote of the company. As regards trading and joint stock operations, no vote of admission is requisite; for any person who owns stock therein, either by original subscription or by conveyance, is in general entitled to, and cannot be refused the rights and privileges of a member. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Portland, </em>(3 Mass. R. 364); <em>King </em>v. <em>Bank of England, </em>(Doug. 524). In monied institutions, such as banks, insurance, canal, and turnpike companies, &amp;c. the mere owning of shares in the stock of the corporation, gives a right of voting; and a stockholder ceases to be a member by a transfer of stock. There is then this marked distinction arising from the nature of the corporation. In the one case, a pecuniary interest is the evidence of membership; whilst <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the affairs of religious, charitable or literary institutions, are committed to those who have no pecuniary interest whatever in their management. If this were a corporation of the former description, it would greatly strengthen the argument of the respondent\u2019s counsel, but I cannot view it in that light, but look upon' this and all institutions of a like kind, as partaking of the nature of a charity, where the professed object is to advance the interests of the poor and helpless. The object of this institution is declared to be, to receive from time to time, from all persons disposed to entrust them therewith, such funds as may be deposited with them, and for which they are to pay to the depositors such rates of interest, as may be from time to time agreed upon by the directors. These deposits, as is well known, are made in small sums by the poor; and the institution is professed to be more especially for their benefit. In aid of this object, and as subsidiary to it, the Legislature in the third section directs-, that for the security of the depositors, &amp;c., it shall be the duty of the persons'before named, and of-their associates, to raise a capital, &amp;c. of not less than $200,000, in shares of $25 each ; which capital is to be at *all times liable to depositors for the amount of their deposits and the interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">In other institutions of the like kind, the latter provisions are omitted: they were-manifestly introduced into this charter, not for the benefit of the stockholders, but as an additional security or pledge to the depositors. As an inducement to make this investment, in the sixth section, the corporation is authorized to invest its funds \u201cin public stocks of this State, or the United States, or real securities, or in the discount of notes and personal securitiesand in the seventh section, the directors are authorized to declare a dividend of the interest and profits of the corporation, after paying its expenses, and to pay it over to the <em>stockholders, </em>or their legal representatives. It seems to me, most clear, that the Legislature had no intention of establishing a joint stock company, but that there was a mere modification or change in the provisions usually inserted in the charters of savings fund institutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">But at any rate, these rules of construction only apply when the charter is silent. So that in this, as in every other case, we must look to the act itself, having regard to the particular nature and purpose of the corporation. In the charter there are antagonist .interests; the interest of the stockholders is in some measure in opposition to the' interest of the depositors. It is for the benefit of the one to decrease, and of the other to increase the rate of interest on deposits; and hence, there may be a peculiar propriety in the Legislature to entrust the control of the funds to persons who have no pecuniary interest in the corpora<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>tion. At least, I perceive nothing in this, of which the stockholders have any right to complain. If the stockholders have the exclusive management of the institution, for which the respondents contend, a temptation is held out to divert the institution from its original and primary object and convert it into a bank, differing only in the fact, that it is a bank of discount and deposit, and not of circulation. Besides, if a pecuniary interest is the only criterion of membership, it may with equal plausibility be said, that the depositors are members also, and as such entitled to participate in its management. In the first section it is enacted \u201c that the persons therein named, and all and every other person or persons, hereafter becoming members of the Philadelphia Savings Institution, in <em>the manner hereafter mentioned, </em>shall be and are hereby created and made a corporation by the name and style of the Philadelphia Savings Institution.\u201d The manner in Avhich they can become members, is pointed out in the fifth section. Among other matters, the directors have power to provide for <em>the admission of members and furnishing proofs of such admission. </em>This, Ave conceive, to be inconsistent with the idea, that a stockholder is <em>ipso facto </em>a member of the corporation ; for if so why confer the power to provide for the admission of members ? The Legislature do not confine the poAver to furnishing proofs of the admission *of members, but they in express words, grant the power to admit members of the corporation. This we conceive, to be an authority to elect such persons as members, as <em>they </em>may deem best fitted to carry into effect the objects of the charter. The respondent\u2019s case also derives additional strength from the seventh section. A distinction is there taken between a <em>member </em>of the corporation, and a <em>stockholder. </em>It is made the duty of the directors to appoint from the <em>members of the corporation, </em>five competent persons as a committee of examination to investigate the affairs of the corporation; and in the same section, to declare a dividend, &amp;c. and to pay the same over *to the <em>stockholders, </em>or their legal representatives. Why, it has been asked, this change of phraseology, if a stockholder, as such, is a member of the corporation ? It is also worthy of remark, that the Legislature wholly omit to regulate the right of voting; a regulation always introduced in all joint-stock incorporations. It is the uniform policy to limit the number of votes to which stockholders may be entitled, in all such companies; a limitation Avhich would not have been omitted, had the Legislature conceived this to be an institution of that description.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Reliance has been placed on the word \u201c associates,\u201d in the third section, which the counsel for the commonwealth says, must refer to stockholders. This is an argument not without plausibility. This section makes it the duty of the persons named in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the act, and of their associates, to raise a capital of not less than $200,000; but in what manner this is to be effected, is left to their discretion. It would seem to be the intention of the Legislature to give power to admit members <em>before, </em>as well as <em>after </em>the capital was raised; and indeed they might have required the aid of others than those named, to effect this result. I see nothing in the act which forbids this; but I think a fair construction of this part of the charter, shows that this power was intended to be given. If so, this is an argument to show that a monied interest, is not an indispensable condition of membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">It is said, that the directors have passed a by-law, that every member,' who shall cease to be a stockholder, shall cease to be a member. Whether this be so or not, is of little importance; for although the charter give authority to the directors to admit members, there is none given to disfranchise them. A by-law may modify and change the constitution of a corporation, but cannot alter it. It may regulate in a reasonable manner, the exercise of a right in the internal affairs of a corporation, in the conduct of its members, or the mode by which \u00e1 person is admitted to the exercise of a right to which he has an inchoate title; but it cannot take away a right, or impose any unreasonable restraint in the exercise of it. 2 Kyd on Corporations, 107, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">Rules discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">Cited by Counsel, 4 Casey, 350.</p>\n<p id=\"A8C\">Cited by the Court, 3 Wharton, 247.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
