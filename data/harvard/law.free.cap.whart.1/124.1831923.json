Christopher Taylor owning and occupying the land bounded by the river Delaware,dike all other holders of land on our principal rivers, had no exclusive privilege or right to fish below low water mark opposite to his banks: that right remained in the state, and unless restrained by its laws, was common to every citizen: he could neither grant nor devise any thing except within low water mark: Every devise should be intended for the benefit of the devisee; and we must ask ourselves what is *meant by this devise of his fishing place in fee simple ? It had nothing to act upon: and we think it could be nothing else, (for he had no more to give,) than the exclusive right, which every owner of land has on the shore or margin of the river, to use his own property, for drawing seines and using other devices, by fixing capstans, &amp;c. for catching fish: this is a valuable right and now-a-days is a species of property producing considerable rents. It is a right which may be conveyed or devised in fee simple, or for any lesser estate. The land itself, the strip between high and low water mark, which is the chief if not the only land, used for these purposes, may be granted or devised away, so that the owner of the adjoining fast land may not interfere with nor interrupt it by building wharves, walls or banks, or establishing ferries or otherwise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b139-6\">The testator devised to his cousin, David Sanderlin, his <em>\u201c </em>fishing place\u201d in fee simple; and whether he meant the <em>land </em>on which whatever he could devise, could be exercised, the land between high and low water mark; or only a right to be enjoyed upon and over the land devised to John Taylor, is the question.; his meaning may have been the one or the other; but judging from the will itself and its provisions applied to the actual con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>dition of the property; observing that the land given to John Taylor has no other boundary on this side than by the river, and in the same \"will giving to David Sanderlin a <em>fishing place </em>in fee simple, which could be situate, from the evidence, in no other place but on the shore between the land given to John Taylor and low water mark, the court are of opinion that the devise to David Sanderlin gave him an estate in fee simple to the space between high and low water mark, from the mouth of Darby creek, as high up the river as the evidence shall satisfy the jury the upper end of the fishing place extended; and thus passed an exclusive right to it, so that no one could build or encroach upon it, and thereby obstruct the right of Sanderlin and those claiming under him, in the fishing place in question. This also, from the evidence, seems to have been the understanding and construction adopted by John Taylor and those claiming under him in former times: Eor all the title deeds and drafts given in evidence, prior to the deed of Benjamin Rue and wife, to David Rose, dated 13th March, 1806, call for stones, posts, or land-marks by, at, or on the bank of the river; and the deed just referred to, is the first one which ventures to pass by those land-marks, on the bank, and extend out to low water-mark, although there is evidence of the carters using that strip, as a fishery, many years before.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-6\">4th and 5th. The two last propositions are immaterial, according to the preceding views of the court, and cannot be answered in the affirmative.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-7\">The length of the fishing place from the mouth of Darby creek upwards, or what is its upper boundary, is a subject for the inquiry of the jury upon the evidence.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Axd\">r*1301 *The plaintiff\u2019s counsel excepted to this charge; and L -* upon the removal of the record to this court, assigned several errors; of which the only one insisted upon, was in the construction of the will.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-9\">Mr. <em>Tick, </em>for the plaintiff in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9T\">The main question is, did Sanderlin by the will- of Christopher Taylor acquire a title to the <em>soil </em>on the bank of the river, or a mere easement. The will gave John Taylor, a tract of land running <em>\u201c </em>to Darby creek; thence down the creek to the river, and thence by the river to the place of beginning.\u201d Now, it can be shown by the cases, that the ownership of land on tide water, extends to low water-mark. [GrlBSO\u00edr, C. J. \u2014 You need not cite authorities for that position, it is well settled.] Our title then, being in the first instance complete, the devise to Sanderlin ought to be so construed as not to conflict with it. If the charge of the court below was right, the benefit to Taylor, whom the testator evidently regarded with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>favour, will be comparatively small; and the testator will be made to appear extremely inconsistent in the several clauses; whereas the construction contended for, on the part of the plaintiff in error, is in accordance with an established maxim of law, in regard to all instruments, of giving every part a reasonable and consistent meaning. Swinburne, 553. The words \u201cfishing place\u201d do not, either in common or technical, language imply any right in the soil. We contend that they are synonymous with \u201cfishery\u201d or \u201cfishing pool.\u201d In <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company, </em>(14 Serg. &amp; R., 81), C. J. Tilghman, cites the act of 9th March, 1796, (2 Sm. L. 370,) and 11th April, 1793, (3 Sm. L. 115,) as speaking of \u201cthe proprietors of <em>fisheries, </em>and the owners <em>o\u00ed fishing places </em>or <em>parts used as fisheries.\u201d </em>The act of 9th March, 1771, sec. 2, (1 Sm. L. 315,) defines \u201cwhat is to be deemed and held to be <em>a pool or fishing place.\u201d </em>So in the act of 16th March, 1807, (4 Sm. L. <em>380,) fishing place </em>and <em>pool </em>are used as convertible terms. The will in question was made in 1748; and the general opinion then was, that every one had an exclusive right of fishing opposite his own shore. This idea was not overthrown until the decision of <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Blazer, </em>in 1807, (2 Binn. 486,) and that was by a bare majority of the court. [Rogers, J. \u2014 In that case, the question was as to the right of fishing in the <em>Susquehanna, </em>where the tide did not ebb and flow; but was such an opinion ever entertained in respect to the <em>Delaware ?] </em>William Penn, in his concessions, when he declared that \u201call rivers\u201d should be <em>\u201cwholly </em>enjoyed by the purchasers into whose lot they may fall,\u201d made no distinction between rivers which are navigable, and those which are not. If we suppose the right given by this will to Sanderlin, to be the same as that which, according to O. J. Tilghman, in <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company, </em>was common on the <em>Schuylkill </em>and other rivers, viz. an \u201cexclusive right to use the margin of the river for the purpose of drawing a seine or practising any other device for the *catching of fish,\u201d but not a fee simple in the <em>land; </em>then all parts of the will may be made to \u25a0- -* harmonize. [Htjsto\u00ed\u00ed, J. \u2014 There are several acts of Assembly which recognize this kind of right in respect to the Delaware. The act of 8th February, 1804, (4 Sm. L. 119,) for example, applies to the <em>Delaware, </em>the definition of \u201cpool or fishing place,\u201d which the act of 1771 had enacted in reference to the Schuylkill.]</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b141-7\">Mr. <em>Tilghman, </em>on the same side,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdL\">cited 3 Kent\u2019s Comm. 329; <em>Seymour </em>v. <em>Lord Courtenay, </em>(5 Burr. 2814;) that a several fishery in England may exist independently of the right to the soil.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b142-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>Mr. <em>Bell </em>and Mr. <em>JEdwards </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AzQ\">The will shows that the testator entertained as much regard for his \u201c cousin David Sanderlin,\u201d as for John Taylor. We contend that his intention was to give him his whole interest and property in the fishing station or pla.ce along the bank of the river. The terms of the gift, \u201cto him and his heirs for ever,\u201d in the first place, furnish evidence of this intention. He would not so have granted a mere easement. It never was supposed that the owner of the land upon a navigable river had any right below low water mark. In 1748, the term <em>fishery </em>was understood to mean some' right in the soil adjacent to the river. The deeds of the parties under whom the plaintiff claimed, show that they so understood it, since they are bounded by \u201c stakes and stones on the bank of the river.\u201d [Kennedy, J. This is universal in the country. Surveyors never go into the water for the purpose.] [Huston, J. It has often been decided that the owners of land hold to low water mark, notwithstanding such boundaries.] Then as to the question of the original right. In England, some jurists have been of the opinion, that by the grant of a several fishery, the soil passes. We contend that by a grant of \u201ca fishing place,\u201d the right to the soil passes, unless it has been expressly reserved by the grantor. 3 Kent\u2019s Com. 410; 2 Black.

Fisheries for shad and herring have, however, existed from a very early period; and though we have no act of Assembly expressly creating the right, yet we have acts regulating, and in some respects, restraining it, of an early date. All those acts 1*132-, relating to *fisheries, seem to apply to fisheries for taking L 4 gfrad; or jn Delaware, perhaps, shad and herring. In fact, I do not know that the term <em>fishery, </em>either in any act of Assembly, or in common parlance in this state, is applied to any thing else than to a place where a seine or net is drawn, to take shad or herring; or to a right to fish with a net or seine in a particular part of a river, to take those fish; though, perhaps, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>who have the exclusive right to a certain fishery, to take those fish, may also have the same kind of right to fish in the same place at all seasons, with a net, for any kind of fish; but I have not heard of any contest as to this matter. The right in question, arises under a will dated in 1748, and in 1752 was recognized in the Orphans\u2019 Court, on a petition to divide the real estate of Sanderlin, the devisee; a well known kind of right, which being incapable of division, was allotted to one of five heirs, in fee, subject to a payment of an annual sum to each of the others; and by conveyance or descent, became again the sole property of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-6\">Instead of going into the black letter books, to learn what was a fishery, and a free fishery, and a several fishery, I shall first examine our own acts of Assembly, and see what they have considered it and regulated it; for those regulations may show and may determine its nature; and if so, I am disposed to regard them, even though differing from old opinions in old feudal times. Many acts on many subjects were passed and in force for a time, which being re-enacted in a larger and fuller form, the prior acts became obsolete, and are not easily found, and in some instances not worth looking for. That fisheries were important in early times, is among other things proved by an act in 1761, (1 Smith\u2019s Laws, 231,) which in its preamble recites that large quantities of fry or brood of fish, and young fish are destroyed by dams, wiers, baskets, &amp;c. &amp;c. in the Delaware, Schuylkill, and Susquehanna, whereby the great quantities of fish which were formerly to be taken in said rivers, are greatly diminished;. and then prescribes severe penalties against such as violate its provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">In 1771, (1 Sm. L. 314,) we find an act to regulate the fishery in the river Schuylkill. The first section relates to the practice which has grown up, of drawing several seines or nets in the same pool or fishing place, and prohibits it. The second section defines a pool; \u201c so much of said river as extends from one side or bank, to the other side or bank thereof; and from the place where seines or nets have been usually thrown in, to the place where they have been usually taken out, shall be deemed and held, and is hereby declared to be, a pool or fishing place.\u201d It is hardly necessary to remark, that it is so much of the river, &amp;c. which is the <em>fishing place, </em>and not so much of the <em>bank, </em>as was contended in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-8\">So far nothing is said about the owner; but in the third section it is provided, that when two or more persons residing opposite to each other, near the said river, on different sides thereof, may have *suitable landing places on their respective r*iooi shores, or on an island opposite thereto, for taking seines *- or nets out of the pool or fishing place; it shall be lawful for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>such persons to fish with their seines or nets alternately, and not otherwise; and the act then proceeds to define how this shall be done. This clearly points to the persons who have a suitable landing place on the shore, or on an island, as those who' have a right to fish. This act was to be in force five years, and was continued in 1776; and in 1785, (2 Sm. L. 308,) a more full and particular act is found. The 4th and 5th sections are transcripts of the 1st and 2d above. The 6th section provides that \u201c where two or more persons hold or occupy lands on the <em>same side </em>of the river, adjoining to any pool or fishing- place, nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent or deprive any such persons from enjoying the <em>privilege </em>of fishing in that part of the river, directly opposite their own land respectively, as a <em>separate pool </em>or <em>fishing place ; </em>the position of which pool is to be by continuing the course of the division line or lines of the persons next adjacent; and every such division to be subject to the same rules and regulations as other pools and fishing places are by this act subject.\u201d This act contains several other provisions; and fixes periods at which they shall cease to fish for shad below the Falls, and other places. In this act we find the phrase fishing for shad, first mentioned; and a day of the year when they shall cease to fish for shad.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">\u2022 Here, also, we first find the words, \u201c <em>privilege of fishing in that part of the river directly opposite their own land respectively, as a separate pool or fishing place,\u201d </em>and not as giving that right, but \u201c <em>nothing in this act </em>shall prevent or deprive any person of that privilege;\u201d recognising such rights as then existing, and declaring that it Avas not meant to impair it. Many other acts were passed for preserving the fish and regulating fisheries in, the Schuylkill. The precise nature and extent of the rights of Pennsylvania and New Jersey over the river Delaware, were not settled until 1783; and probably for this reason, we find no act regulating fisheries in the DelaAyare prior to that period; though the first act cited, was to preserve the fish in that and other rivers, and the preamble stated that they were not caught in such quantities as formerly.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">In (4 Dall. Acts of Assembly, 143,) we find the agreement between the commissioners of the two states, dated 26th April, 1783, ratified 20th September, 1783.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The first section of that instrument is thus \u2014 \u201c It is declared that the river Delaware, from the station point, or north-west corner of New Jersey, northerly; to the place on the said river Avhere the insular boundary of the state of Delaware toucheth the same, in the whole length or breadth thereof, is, and shall continue to be and remain a common highway, equally free and open to the use, benefit and advantage of the said contracting parties. Provided nevertheless, that each of the legislatures of the said states shall hold and *exercise the right of regulating r*q gq-i and guarding the fisheries on the said river Delaware, L <em>-1 </em>annexed to their respective shores, in such manner that the said fisheries may not be unnecessarily interrupted, during the season of catching shad, <em>by vessels riding at anchor on the fishing ground, or by persons fishing under a claim, of a common right on said river.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">On the 30th of March, 1784, (1 Dall. Acts, 195,) we find an act to regulate fisheries in the rivers Delaware and Lehigh. The 2d section prevents, under a penalty, more than one seine being drawn in the same pool. ' The 3d section enacts, that \u201cwithin so much of the river Delaware as extends from the north-west corner of New Jersey, to the place on said river, where the insular boundary of said river touches the same, and within all the islands belonging to this state, from the place where a seine has been usually or shall be usually thrown in, to the place where it has usually been, or shall be usually taken out, shall be, and hereby is declared to be, a pool or fishing place;\u201d and also contains many other regulations of the right of fishing. \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">On the 7th of April, 1786, (1 Dall. Acts, 446,) we have a supplement to this act, allowing to fish with two seines in one pool from the Falls at Trenton, to the line of Delaware state, and limiting the periods of fishing.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">On the 6th of March, 1793, (3 Sm. L. 93,) was passed, an act for the sale of islands in the Delaware, Susquehanna, and other navigable streams. They were to be appraised, in order to ascertain their value, having regard to the wood, distance from the main land, and to the <em>advantages which may be derived from the same in regard to fisheries.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">In 1804, (4 Sm. L. 118,) we find another law, re-enacting and modifying the provisions of the act of 1784; it again describes a pool or fishing place; and in the 4th section directs that \u201c wherever any fishery is occupied upon the river Delaware, within the limits aforesaid, (that is, as far as it has been declared a highway) either the land-holder, tenant in possession, or some respectable person appointed by the fishing company, shall give bond to satisfy and pay any fines, for disobeying the provisions of the law at his or their respective fishery; and also file with the prothonotary a description of his or their fishing place, and of the township in which it is situated.\u201d In this act we find, as before, \u25a0in the agreement with New Jersey, the word <em>fishery </em>used; it also supposes a fishery may be owned by a fishing company; and the owner or occupier of the shore, or some person for that company, must give bond to the prothonotary. This act proposes a joint law with Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>On the 26th November, 1808, such an act was passed in Jersey; and on the 23d of February, 1809, (5 Sm. L. 5, and following pages) it is recited and re-enacted in this state. This act contains the substance of all the former acts, and some additions in piwofn direction and ^penalties, and in section 10 provides, L J \u201c That if any person or persons whatever shall cast or lay out any seine or net into the river Delaware, within the jurisdiction of this state, beyond the right angle of the shore and where his line strikes the river at low water mark going out, or suffer it to swing beyond the right angle of the shore of the river, and where his line strikes it at the water mark coming in, (except by unavoidable accident) every such person shall forfeit and pay, on being legally convicted thereof, the sum of twenty-five dollars for each offence, and costs to be paid to the person, against whose land such offence shall be committed;\u201d and after reciting that part of the agreement between the two states) before copied, it proceeds in the 11th section to provide, \u201c That if any ship, vessel, or raft shall, during the season of catching shad in the Delaware, come to anchor at the same on any fishing ground, where shad are usually taken, and shall not immediately be removed from the said fishing ground, if such removal can be done with safety, on application for that purpose by the owner or occupier of said fishery, to the captain, pilot, or person having command of the said ship, vessel, or raft; or if any such vessel or raft be wilfully run on shore on any such fishing ground, then such captain, pilot, or person having the command as aforesaid, shall forfeit and pay sixty dollars to be recovered with costs by the said owner or occupier.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">In the seventh volume of Pennsylvania Laws, 295, 296, we find another law of NeAY Jersey, re-enacted in this state, defining and limiting the right of fishing on islands and sand bars in the Delaware, to be within lines drawn from the upper and lower points of said island, at right angles, to a base line from the upper to the lower point of said island; and permitting the net to swing below the lower line only, where there is no fishery below and adjoining.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">Before: proceeding to draw conclusions as to th'e nature and extent of the right of fishing with a seine in the Delaware, it will be proper to notice two cases in our own reports; <em>(Carson </em>v. <em>Blazer, </em>and <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation </em>Company,) and it will strike every one that there are several laws, and different provisions in those laws, as regards different rivers. When <em>Carson </em>v. <em>Blazer, </em>was tried before the Circuit Court, no law to regulate fisheries in the Susquehanna had been enacted. Several will be found since; the provisions in which have made the law in that river very different from the positions decided in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>that case ; and evidently, the enactments to the Schuylkill and Delaware were not considered as applicable to that'case, for they were not adverted to.</p>\n<p id=\"AMx\">The case of <em>Shrunk </em>v. <em>The Schuylkill Navigation Company, </em>decided a matter totally different from the point trying in the case before us. When the Delaware was declared a navigable stream and public highway, from the southern to the northern line of the state, such declaration gave certain rights and privileges to all persons *passing in ships, boats, or rafts; o\u00ab-i and left in the state the power to regulate such navigation, and to improve such navigation in any way, which would seem to the government of the state, to be for the interest of the state. Several laws had been enacted, forbidding, under severe penalties, any individuals from erecting dams, wiers, &amp;c. within the bed of the Schuylkill, which would injure the navigation or the passage of fish. At. length a law was passed to improve the navigation, and to render the water of that stream of general and permanent utility; but this was alleged as an injury to Shrunk\u2019s fishery. The decision was that the state had, though no unauthorized individual had, a right to improve the navigation and render it a public advantage and benefit, even though some of the privileges and conveniences of those on its .banks were impaired. The present is a different question; it is one between two citizens, in which the primary object, free navigation by all, or what the state may do, to improve that navigation, is not in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The right of one person to draw a seine in a particular part of the Delaware, is not inconsistent with the right which every person has to navigate his vessel in the same part of the river, in the course of his business. I shall not go farther back than is necessary to ascertain the origin or nature of a right of fishing in the Delaware, and confine my remarks to a fishery in that river. This case shows that the people and the courts, recognized, without dispute, a right of fishery in 1745 and 1752; Ave may say it was well known a century back. The act of 1761 states, that owing to the destruction of young shad in fish baskets, &amp;c. the quantity was greatly less than had been taken in former times.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">All the laws regulating fisheries in the Delaware, as well as the agreement between Pennsylvania and New Jersey, before cited, are predicated of the idea of separate fisheries existing; and the agreement expressly stipulates, that the states shall hold and exercise the right of regulating the fisheries in the river Delaware, annexed to their respective shores, in such manner that the fisheries shall not be unnecessarily interrupted during the season of catching shad, by vessels riding at anchor on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>fishing grounds, or by persons fishing under <em>a claim of common right in said river. </em>It is not easy to see how, after this solemn treaty between these two states, any person can allege that each fishery was not a separate fishery, and that any person had, or could have, a right to fish, under a claim of common right. Neither state could grant such common right to fish in any and every part of that river; neither where the tide flowed or did not flow. But if this was not explicit enough, the act passed by both states in 1808-9, removes all possibility of doubt. It expressly prohibits every person from throwing out a net above, or drawing it in, or even letting it swing below his own line on land. Fisheries, then, existed long ago ; by grant or sufferance, I care not which. The state had a right to regulate fish-T*1371 er^es&gt; *and has regulated them and bound itself by treaty to regulate them, and has complied with the treaty. No man can be interrupted in his fishery opposite his own land, with impunity; and he who does interrupt such fishery, is tried, convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine, and forfeits his seine or net. But further, this act recognizes, that a fishery may belong to the owner of the shore opposite to it, or to some other person, or to a company, who are, by a respectable person, to give bond to conform to the law, and to pay all penalties if they violate it. The plaintiff has shown such right of fishery; but still matters were disputed' at the trial of the cause, and here also. And first, a fishery is in the river, and is not the space between high and low water marie, though the use of that space may be necessary in the use of it, and may he included in the term fishery. The men employed in carrying the rope attached to one end of the seine, may walk on the space between high and low water mark; and on the same space may place logs, or boards, or stone, to make what is called a pound, into which to throw the fish when taken out of the net, and on that space do all that has been usual and is necessary to the use of a fishery; but the right to a fishery does not of itself imply a fee simple in such space, between high and low water opposite the fishery; nor does it lessen or impair the right of the owner of the land opposite, except so far as is necessary to the use of the privilege of the fishery.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The right of the owner of land opposite and adjoining a navigable river, down to the water\u2019s edge, has been too often and solemnly decided to be questioned ;* though this right is not in all respects the same as to the main land above the bank; for in high tide, or high floods, a vessel or raft may sail over it, or fasten to the shore in a storm, or any case of necessity; but <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>the owner has the right and sole right to quarry stones or take gravel above low water mark, and the sole right to use it and the river opposite as a fishery, unless the right of fishery has been separated from the land; in which case, the right of fishery gives it the use of it so far as is necessary, and has been used in the fishery, and no farther. The owner of the land may still, even in the fishing season, drive his cattle over it to water, or do any other act which does, not injure or impede the use of the fishery. But he must not, even out of fishery season, do any act which will injure or destroy the fishery. \u201cWhen,\u201d the court say, \u201cthe devise of David Sanderlin, is of the fishing place, to him, his heirs and assigns for ever; when we consider that the testator had no sort of dominion over any thing beyond low water mark, and that his fishing place, if he had one, must necessarily be within that line, and a part of the land that would otherwise be included within John Taylor\u2019s devise, it would be hazardous to say a fee simple did not pass to David Sanderlin, but merely an easement over the land of John Taylor. Christopher Taylor, owning and occupying land bounded by the river Delaware, like all other owners of *land on our m-, principal rivers, had no exclusive privilege or right to *- fish below low water mark opposite to his bank; that right remained in the state, and unless restrained by its laws, was common to every person in the state; he could neither grant nor devise any thing except within low water mark,\u201d &amp;c. We think this was said without a due examination of the treaty with New Jersey, and the acts of Assembly cited. A pool, or fishing place \u2014 a fishery is in the river ; rafts, boats, or vessels, are not to cast anchor in it; the seine or net is cast out in the river; it is drawn through the river; it swings in the river; and the owner of the shore has the right, and sole right, unless he has parted with it, to fish with\u2019nets opposite his land; the owner below cannot come a foot above the right angle from dividing point; the owner above cannot even let his net swing below the line from the dividing point, and no person can come there and fish under a claim of common right. Originally, it was a privilege, or franchise appurtenant to the shore ; but may be leased, sold, or devised to a person not owning the land on the shore; and such lessee, devisee, or purchaser, has no other right to the adjacent land than is necessary to the full use of the fishery. The fee simple, and all other rights not inconsistent with the use of fishery, may remain in the owner of the land adjoining the river, opposite to the fishery. <em>,</em></p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">Clearly, for a direct interruption while actually fishing, trespass may lie; there may be acts injurious to the fishery, for which care may be the proper remedy. The case, as exhibited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>to us, does not show what was done by the defendant, what acts are complained of, and we can only say that for a direct interruption, trespass is a proper action.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Let it be distinctly understood that this opinion relates only to the right of citizens, to interfere with a fishery. What right the state of Pennsylvania and New Jersey jointly have to change the channel of the river; to build dams in it; to draw off its waters, &amp;c., &amp;c., even though this should affect fisheries, I have said nothing about.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">Cited, by Counsel, 2 Wharton, 536; 9 Watts, 232; 10 Id. 65; 8 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 442; 1 Barr, 313; 7 Id. 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">Cited by the Court, 8 Watts, 476; 2 Harris, 518; 6 Wright, 228.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
