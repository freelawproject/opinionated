Gray.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-13\">The declaration contained counts for money had and received, work and labour, &amp;c. and on an account stated, and a special count *for mismanaging the trust estate, &amp;c. to the prejudice r*^ncn of the plaintiff. -\u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-14\">The case was tried before Mr. Justice Kennedy, at a Court of <em>Nisi Prius </em>held in Philadelphia, on the 10th of December, 1835.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b431-15\">It appeared in evidence, that the plaintiff was a creditor of Robert E. Gray, who, on the 20th of August, 1818, made an assignment of all his estate and effects to Samuel Richards and George Billington, upon the usual trusts, viz. to sell, or otherwise dispose of the assigned estate, and distribute the proceeds among such creditors as should execute a release to the assignor. The plaintiff complied with the condition by executing a release within the required time. On the 1st of March, 1824, Richards and Billington conveyed the estate to Samuel N. Gray. In 1825, a citation was issued from the Court of Common Pleas, at the instance of the plaintiff, Vanarsdale, to Billington, the assignee: in obedience to which he settled an account of his receipts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>payments as assignee. It did not appear, that Richards had settled any accounts.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AC3n\">Upon these facts, the learned Judge being of opinion, upon the'authority of a case decided at the last term at Pittsburgh,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> that the action could not be maintained, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel submitted to a nonsuit, with leave to move in bank to take it off.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-6\">A motion having accordingly been made: Mr. <em>Randall, </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOXX\">admitted that the recent decisions of the Court, in <em>Rush </em>v. <em>Good, </em>(14 Serg. &amp; R. 230,) and <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Bell, </em>settled the question, that <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received, &amp;c. would not lie against assignees, to recover a proportion of the fund, until a settlement of their accounts had been duly made in the proper office; but he endeavored to distinguish this case from those decided: the present action charging the defendants with tortious conduct in respect to the sale of the property, &amp;c. Mr. <em>Randall, </em>also cited a case of <em>M-Leod </em>v. <em>Latimer, (MS.) </em>decided by this Court in 1826, where an. action, by a creditor against assignees to recover a proportionate share of the fund, was sustained; although he admitted that the objection was not there taken. <footnotemark>\u2020</footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b432-7\">Mr. <em>Tilghman </em>and Mr. <em>Peters, </em>for the defendants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AhG\">relied on the two cases above stated.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b432-12\"><em> Gray </em>v. <em>Bell, (MS.) </em>This case will be reported by Mr. <em>Watts </em>in his 4th volume.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"\u2020\">\n<p id=\"b432-13\"> Having been favoured by Mr. <em>Randall </em>with a copy of the opinion of the Court in this case, I have inserted it, with some others, in an appendix to this volume. \u2014 Rep.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b432-8\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ADGT\">The trust involved in this assignment, is peculiarly a subject of equitable cognizance; and though an actual want of chancery powers might compel us to sustain an action at law in the first instance, it. does not follow, that a <em>cestui que trust </em>r*4ioi shall not *be thrown on his equitable resources, where such have been provided for him. We consider the point to have been already decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">Mr. <em>Randall </em>took nothing by his motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Cited by Counsel, 10 Watts, 62; 9 Harris, 294; 7 P.
