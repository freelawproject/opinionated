By three several deeds the land was partitioned between them ; but the deed to B. and his wife, recited, that on the death of her father, her share descended to B.; and conveyed one-third to <em>him, his </em>heirs and assigns. After the death of B., his widow borrowed money, and gave a sealed note for payment, upon which judgment was entered, and then she died. 0., the son of A. and B. became administrator; both of his father and mother, and applied to the Orphans\u2019 Court for the sale of the land, as the property of A., to pay her debts. The court refused the application, on the ground that it was the property of B. The land was afterwards sold by virtue of proceedings on a mortgage given by <em>A. and B.; </em>the suit on the mortgage being against C. as administrator <em>both </em>of A. and B. The balance of the purchase money, after paying the mortgage, was brought into court, where it was directed to be paid to C. \u201c administrator, &amp;c., <em>as aforesaid </em>and was received by him. In a <em>scire facias, </em>on the judgment above mentioned, brought against C., as administrator of A., it was <em>held, </em>that C. must be taken to have received the money as <em>administrator of A.; </em>and, consequently, that he was liable for the amount to the plaintiff in the <em>scire facias.</em></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b215-13\">Writ of error to the Court of Common Pleas of the County of Chester, to remove the record of a <em>scire facias </em>upon a judgment obtained in that court by Maria Wentz, and Arthur Armstrong, administrators, &amp;c., of Thomas Wentz, deceased, to the use of Mary H.

They divided it, and executed deeds of partition, duly acknowledged and recorded, (copies of which are annexed, marked A, B and 0.) On the 4th day of July, A.

Application, by petition to the said court, was accordingly made \u2014but the court being of opinion that the title to two-thirds of said property was in Isaac Wentz, and not in Mary, refused to grant an order of sale, and recommended a sale under the mortgage to Thomas Wistar. Accordingly, a <em>levari facias, </em>at the suit of Abraham W. Sharpless, assignee of Isaac W. Morris, who was assignee of John Price, executor, &amp;c., of Thomas Wistar, deceased, against John T.

There can be doubt of the intentions of the parties to the deeds of partition. The papers were drawn by a person ignorant of the laws regulating the descent of land in this state, and unskilful in conveyancing. The object was merely to make partition, not to alter the right of the married sister, Mrs. Wentz. This is obvious from the recital. Here is the case of a mistake, then, which this court has more than once allowed to be corrected on parol evidence. <em>Leek </em>v. <em>Cowley, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; R. 176,) is in point. <em>Thompson </em>v. <em>M\u2018Clenachan, </em>(17 Serg. &amp; R. 110.) Equity will, under these circumstances, consider Isaac Wentz as holding the fee in trust for his wife; and, on his death, his heir at law, would be held to have succeeded to the legal estate only, and a conveyance would be directed. In our courts, this conveyance would be presumed, and Mrs. Wentz could have recovered in ejectment. 2 Roper on Husband and Wife, ch. 18, 151; <em>Fogelsonger </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>(6 Serg. &amp; R. 267); <em>Stoolfoos </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>(8 Serg. <em>&amp; </em>R. 167); <em>M\u2018Culloh </em>v. <em>Wallace, </em>(8 Serg. &amp; R. 181.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b223-9\">2. The loan, by Miss Brinton to the estate of Mary Wentz, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>was made on the faith of her being the owner of this land, and on the application and representation of John T. Wentz, who acted in the double capacity of administrator of the goods, &amp;c., of his mother, and administrator, <em>de bonis non, </em>&amp;c., of his father. He was a witness to the assignment of the judgment; and applied to the Orphans\u2019 Court for authority to sell this land as the property of his <em>mother. </em>Then, when the land was sold under the mortgage given by his father and mother, it was his duty to apply the balance of the proceeds to the payment of Miss Brinton\u2019s judgment, or at least to have given her sufficient personal notice of the proceedings to have enabled her to make application for it. Instead of doing this, he applied, through his attorney, to the court, for leave to take it out. The docket entries show, that the application was made by him as \u201c <em>administrator,\u201d </em>&amp;c., yet the advertisement states him as <em>\u201cadministrator, de bonis non,\u201d </em>&amp;c. I contend that this notice was insufficient; and Miss Brinton being the only creditor, and living on the opposite side of the street, in the same town, the want of personal notice to her; implies a fraudulent intent, which vitiates the whole proceeding. We do not deny, that the decree of the court is conclusive; but we submit that the defendant received and holds the money as trustee for Miss Brinton.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b224-6\">Mr. <em>Bell, </em>for the defendant in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOe\">It is well settled, that the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction will not be overhauled *in a collateral proceeding. The act of 1827, f -* gave the Common Pleas plenary power in proceedings of this kind. Nothing but proof of fraud will countervail this. Fraud is never to be presumed. The defendant complied strictly with the orders of the court, who proceeded with great caution. It is said, that he should have claimed this money as administrator of <em>Mary Wentz. </em>The answer to this is, that the Orphans\u2019 Court had decided against him on this point, and declared the property not to be in Mary Wentz. Besides, there Avere judgment creditors of Mary Wentz, as against whom the administrator was not entitled to recover the money. He has distributed this money on the faith of the decree of the court, and if it be recovered in this proceeding, he has no remedy. <em>Clark </em>v. <em>Callaghan, </em>(2 Watts. 261.) It is said that Isaac Wentz was trustee for his Avife, and that equity will correct the mistake. There is no case showing that equity will interfere after a lapse of twenty years, in favour of a creditor of the alleged <em>cestui que trust, </em>whose lien accrued after the transaction. Sugden on Vendors, &amp;c. 107. The cases of <em>M\u2018Culloh v. Wallace, Fogelsonger </em>v. <em>Somerville, </em>and <em>Stoolfoos </em>v. <em>Jenkins, </em>go upon the ground that the Orphans\u2019 Court had not poAver to decree the wife\u2019s estate to her husband. Here <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>there is no evidence that the wife did not intend to give her estate to her husband. The deeds were all executed on the same day, and in the presence of the same witnesses. It is to be presumed, that Mrs. Wentz was fully conusant of the whole proceeding.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b225-6\">Mr. Sergeant, in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aos\">If there was not actual fraud in the receipt of this money, there is certainly <em>mala fides </em>in retaining it, against the creditor of the mother, whose estate they knew it to be. It is said that there has been an adjudication in this case, which cannot be got over. Now, in the first place, the money was adjudicated to \u201c <em>John T. Wentz, administrator,\u201d </em>&amp;c., upon a rule which spoke of him as \u201c <em>administrator as aforesaid;\u201d </em>that is, with reference to the title of the suit, in which he is named as administrator both of his father and mother. Then, who were the <em>parties </em>to this decree. The plaintiff in the execution was satisfied. The defendant was the only party. Why did he not make Miss Brinton a party ? There was not such notice as law and justice required. The defendant was trustee for her, and could not act for himself. In fact, he went before the court in two capacities, and asked the court to decide in which he was to retain the money. The act of 1827, applies to cases of dispute among creditors; not to a case like this. It is said, that equity will not correct mistakes, unless they are clearly proved. This does not mean proof <em>alinnde. </em>Here the proof is in the paper itself. The very first recital is a plain legal falsehood. The sole consideration for the conveyance, is the *idea that, p-\u00a1 on the death of the wife\u2019s father, her share of his real *- -* estate descended to her husband. Nothing but a partition was intended by the parties.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b225-8\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b225-9\">Gibson, G. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQH\">The vesting of the legal title in Isaac Wentz, was so palpably the effect of mismanagement in making partition among the sisters, and- not of an original purpose to convey to him, that a Chancellor would not have hesitated to compel him to convey to his wife. The deeds seem to have been prepared and executed under a common error, in believing him to be entitled to her land, as well as her chattels; and the case is, consequently, one which equity would have instantly set right.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Perhaps it would be found, that, as nothing moved from him, there was no consideration to raise a use to him by bargain and sale; and that he had not the estate even at law. But, in the one or the other of these aspects, the proceeds of it belonged to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>creditors of the wife, when, they were brought into court; and it is to be seen whether they passed by an adjudication adverse to her title, when they were taken out.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">It is not disputed, that, as to every thing adjudicated, a decree of distribution concludes the rights of all who were parties to it, either immediately or by representation. If, then, it be considered that the money ivas decreed to the son, as the administrator of his father, and not of his mother, the decree must be held adverse to the mother\u2019s creditors, and conclude their rights; but if it be considered as decreed to him, without discrimination of character, the law will refer the receipt of it to that character, in which alone it could, without a special decree, be legally received. Now, though an administrator may not be allowed to handle the proceeds of land in court, in order to pay it over to the lien creditors, whose recourse to the fund is immediate, he may undqubtedly demand for the general creditors, where there are any, whatever remains after satisfaction of thediens, in order to bring it into a course of administration.' Unless, then, the fund was explicitly awarded to the son, as the administrator of the father exclusively, we must say, that no more was adjudicated against the interests of the plaintiff in the present action, than that she was not entitled by virtue of her judgment <em>as a lien ; </em>that she was put upon the footing of a creditor whose debt had survived its lien, and whose right to receive, is to be postponed to that of the representative of her fellow creditors, with whom she is to come in <em>pari passu. </em>Nor are the consequences different, though she be the only remaining creditor; for her lien being put aside, the money goes into a course of administration on general principles, and she can receive payment but at his hands. Such may not have been the intended principle \u00a1-*0121 *\u00b0f the decree, but such is its legal effect. On the maxim, then, that co-existent rights, in the same individuals, are to be treated as if they existed separately in different individuals, the question is, how far does the decree of distribution purport to distinguish between the representative of the husband, and the representative of the wife ? The money being in court, the son in whom both characters were united, but not blended, procured a rule to show cause why the \u201c administrator, &amp;c., as aforesaid,\u201d should not have leave to take it out. These words, \u201cadministrator, &amp;c., as aforesaid,\u201d palpably refer to the title of the <em>levari facias, </em>on which the money was made; in the record of which the rule Avas entered, and in AYhich he is named a defendant, as the administrator, respectively of both his father and his mother. It is true that it is stated in the body of the case, that he was adjudged to be entitled as the administrator of his father, which, taking it to be conclusively established by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>agreement, would carry the cause against the plaintiff. But in the record, which is a part of the case by express reference, no more appears than that the rule was simply made absolute; and, consequently, that the money was ordered to him without distinction of character. That fact being established, the result is, that the fund, though actually distributed among the children of his father, potentially remains in his hands, for his mother\u2019s creditors; and that the plaintiff, being the only creditor, is entitled to have execution for the principal and interest of her judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">Judgment of the court below reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff, according to the terms of the case.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b225-10\"> See 3 Watts &amp; Sergeant, 230, 522; 12 Casey, 387; 10 Wright, 346; 8 P.
