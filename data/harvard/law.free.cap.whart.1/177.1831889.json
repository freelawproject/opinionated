Where it appears, by the record, of the court below, that a case was referred, under the act of 1705, to three persons, and that on a subsequent day, one of them having declined to serve, another person was appointed in his place, it will be presumed in the absence of contradiction by the record, that the substitution was made with the consent of both parties.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b190-8\">2. Exceptions to an award, under the act of 1705, arising from alleged want of notice to the party making the exception, and the like, must be made in the court in which the action was brought, and will not be considered in this court.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-9\">Error to the District Court for the City and County of Philadelphia, to remove the record of an action, wherein Catharine McManus was plaintiff, and William Browning was defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-10\">It appeared, by the record returned in this case, that on the 2d of January, 1835, the case was referred, under the act of 1705, to Messrs. Coleman Fisher, Mordecai D. Lewis, and William S. Torr.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-11\">The next entry on the record is as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-12\">\u201cMarch 6th. Coleman Fisher having declined to serve, Henry Manly was appointed referee; in whose place, he being unable to attend on account of indisposition, John Elliott was appointed.\u201d On the 9th of March, 1835, the report of the referees was filed, in the words following :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-13\">\u201cTwo previous meetings having been held in this case, and adjourned through the absence of one of the referees, on neither of which was the defendant present in person, or by counsel; the referees, at a meeting held March 6th, 1835, the plaintiff being present, with counsel and witnesses, after hearing the remarks of counsel, and receiving the testimony of the witnesses, find an award in favour of the plaintiff, in the sum of $684.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-14\">(Signed) Mordecai D.

The court erred in substituting referees for those originally appointed, without the' knowledge or consent of the defendant below.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-19\">2. The court erred in rendering judgment on the report of referees; because the same is erroneous:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b190-20\">1*178-1 *1. In that it does not appear that the referees *- -*\u25a0 were ever qualified.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>2. In that the proceedings, being <em>ex parte, </em>no notice to the defendant of any of the meetings of referees, appears to have been given. \u25a0</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b191-6\">3. In that the report is by referees, of whom two only appear to have been regularly appointed.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-7\">Mr. <em>Holy, </em>for the plaintiff in error, contended:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-8\">1. That the court below had no power to substitute a referee for one who had declined to serve; without the concurrence of both parties, <em>Shippen\u2019s Lessee </em>v. <em>Bush, </em>(1 Dall. 251); and that the consent ought to appear upon the record. <em>Russell </em>v. <em>Gray, </em>(6 Serg. &amp; R. 145.)</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-9\">2. That the award was defective; because it did not appear that the referees had been sworn or affirmed. [Kennedy, J. \u2014 This is not required by the act of 1705; and it is not usual in practice.]</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b191-10\">3. That the award was bad; because the proceedings were <em>ex parte, </em>and no notice appears to have been given to the defendant or his attorney. The substitution having been made on the same day, that the meeting of the referees took place, notice ought not to be presumed.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b191-11\">Mr. <em>Zantzinger </em>and Mr. <em>I). P. Brown, </em>for the defendant in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Amq\">argued that the proceedings were regular, and that, at all events, the remedy of the party was by application to the court below. They cited Kyd on Awards, 34 (d) (Amer. Ed.); <em>Oppenheimer </em>v. <em>Comly, </em>(3 Serg. &amp; R. 3); <em>Nagley </em>v. <em>Stewart, </em>(10 Serg. &amp; R. 207.)</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b191-12\">Pee Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ASU\">The exceptions are such as might be proper in the court below, on a motion to set aside the award; which is put, by the act of 1705, on the footing of a verdict; but they are not in place here. We are incompetent, for instance, to enquire whether the arbitrators were sworn, or the opposite party had notice; but these, being extrinsic to the record, were open to examination in the cqnrt below, by affidavit. The exception to the substitution has colour of foundation, but no more. The substituted arbitrator appears to have been appointed precisely as the others were. The minutes are unusually short and unsatisfactory ; but in a court of general jurisdiction, every thing is to be presumed in favour of the regularity of a proceeding. In the absence of contradiction by the record, then we are to presume that the defendant was present in person, or by counsel, and consented to the substitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">Cited by Counsel, 5 Casey, 253; 6 Id. 388; 1 Grant, 118.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-15\">Cited by the Court, 2 Jones, 184; 14 Wright, 534.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-16\">See also 9 Barr, 487; 5 Casey, 253.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
