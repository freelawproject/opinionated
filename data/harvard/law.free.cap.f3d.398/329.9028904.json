The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-19\">Procedural and Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b370-20\">The OCAHO is the administrative agency responsible for hearing complaints under the Immigration and Nationality Act which prohibits employers from discriminating against any protected individual with respect to hiring, recruiting, or discharging the individual from employment because of his or her citizenship status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1324b (a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-21\">On August 12, 2003, the Administrative Law Judge (hereinafter, \u201cALJ\u201d) granted the District\u2019s motion for summary decision, finding that Curuta had established only a subjective perception of discrimination that was insufficient to show pretext. On October 15, 2003, the clerk\u2019s office of this court received Curuta\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-22\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-23\">Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b370-24\">The petitioner in an OCAHO case has 60 days \u201cafter the entry of [a] final order\u201d to \u201cseek a review of such order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the violation is alleged to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>have occurred.\u201d 8 U.S.C. 1324b (i)(l). In an agency case such as this in which no docket exists, the entry date for limitations purposes occurs when the final order is signed, any necessary agency seal is affixed, and the order is served. <em>See Chem-Haulers, Inc. v. United States.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The ALJ\u2019s final order was signed and served to the parties on August 12, 2003. Sixty days after August 12, 2003 would be. Tuesday, October 14, 2003 because the 60th day, October 11, was a Saturday and the following Monday was a federal holiday. As Curuta\u2019s appeal was not received until October 15, 2003, it was arguably one day late.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">Curuta argues that he mailed the appeal within 60 days of the date of entry and that this court should adopt the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d by which an appeal is timely so long as it is mailed within the prescribed period. The District argues that the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure clearly state that a filing with this court is not complete unless the document to be filed is received by the clerk by the filing deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">Pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 15(a), an individual seeking review of an administrative agency order must file their petition for review with the appellate court clerk \u201cwithin the time prescribed by law.\u201d The filing is not timely \u201cunless the clerk receives the papers within the time fixed for filing.\u201d Fed R. App. P. 25(a)(2)(A). This court may not extend the time to file a request to review an order of an administrative agency unless some other legal provision permits an extension. Fed. R.App. P. 26(b)(2). The Rules make an exception for a brief or appendix that is mailed within the filing deadline, but Curuta\u2019s petition does not fall under this exception. Fed. R.App. P. 25(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">This Court has rejected the \u201cmailbox rule\u201d with respect to appeals challenging administrative proceedings when the statute in question requires the petition to be filed by a specific date. <em>See Guirguis v. INS.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In \u00a7 1324b (i)(l), however, the statute requires the aggrieved party to \u201cseek a review\u201d not later than 60 days after the entry of a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">In <em>Mesa Airlines v. United States,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the Tenth Circuit held that 1324b (i)(l) required the petition to be filed with the clerk\u2019s office within 60 days of the date of entry. The Ninth Circuit made a similar assumption in <em>Tovar v. United States Postal </em>Service.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree that the statute requires a petition for review of a final order to be filed and received within 60 days of the date of entry. The language in \u00a7 1324b (i)(l) requiring the petitioner to \u201cseek a review\u201d does not create an exception to the rule that appeals must be received, not mailed, by the filing deadline. Curuta\u2019s petition was not received within 60 days of the date of entry of the ALJ\u2019s final order, and it is therefore untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-12\">The District\u2019s Motion for Costs</p>\n<p id=\"b371-13\">In their original brief, the District requested that it be awarded costs related to the appeal. \u201cIf a court of appeals determines that an appeal is frivolous, it may, after a separately filed motion or notice from the court and reasonable opportunity to respond, award just damages and single or double costs to the appellee.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 38. The District failed to file a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>separate motion and does not justify the award. The request for costs is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Appeal Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b371-6\">. 536 F.2d 610, 614-16 (5th Cir.1976).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-7\">. 993 F.2d 508, 510 (5th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b371-14\">. 951 F.2d 1186, 1188 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b371-15\">. 3 F.3d 1271, 1273 n. 4 (9th Cir.1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
