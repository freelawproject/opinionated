Warden, </em>212 Md. 655. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number>The only additional allegation raised on this appeal is that there was not sufficient evidence presented during the trial of the petitioner to justify a conviction. It is well settled that <em>habeas corpus </em>proceedings are not intended to be, and cannot be used as, a substitute for a motion for a new trial or an appeal, and that the sufficiency of the evidence cannot be raised by a <em>habeas corpus </em>proceeding. <em>Langrehr v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 645; <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>214 Md. 666.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
