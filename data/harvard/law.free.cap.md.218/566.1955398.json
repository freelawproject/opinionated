The Railroad Company relied on two sections of Code, 1957, one of which, Art. 78, Sec. 32 (a), forbids transportation of persons for hire \u201con regular schedules and between fixed termini\u201d without a permit from the Public Service Commission; and the other of which, Art. 66^2, Sec. 2 (a) (42), provides: \u201c\u2018Regular schedule\u2019 shall be given a liberal construction and shall include the carriage of * * * passengers of at least one single trip per week for four consecutive weeks, or three single trips within a period of ten days * *</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">The Baltimore Motor Coach Company, in its answer, admitted that the transportation was proposed but said that it was a charter operation not subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission and not in violation of the provisions of Art. 78. A hearing was held on October 16, 1957, at which witnesses were produced for both sides, and argument heard. On October 17, 1957, the Commission filed its opinion and order, dismissing the complaint and denying the relief sought by The Baltimore and Annapolis Railroad Co.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">Almost two months later, on December 10, 1957, and more than a week after the last trip complained of had taken place, the Railroad Company filed in the Circuit Court of Baltimore City a petition for review of the order of the Public Service Commission. After a hearing, the Circuit Court, on April 7, 1958, affirmed the order of the Commission and dismissed the petition for review. The Railroad Company appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The Public Service Commission has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the case is moot, and we think the motion must be granted. The action which the Railroad Company sought to prevent took place and was fully accomplished over a year ago, in fact, before there was an appeal to the Circuit Court. What we said and held in <em>Lloyd, v. Super</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>visors of Elections, </em>206 Md. 36, 39, 43, controls the appeal at bar: \u201cThe chronology of the case makes it apparent that nothing this Court could do, by reversal or otherwise, could undo or remedy that which has already occurred. It is beyond our power to make a decision in the case which will bind any of the parties to it or accomplish any of the purposes for which it was brought or defended. The case was moot as to the parties when it reached us. Appellate courts do not sit to give opinions on abstract propositions or moot questions, and appeals which present nothing else for decision are dismissed as a matter of course.\u201d The appellant urges us to decide the matter because the same operations took place in 1958 and may take place again, and because, in their eyes, the matter is of public interest and concern. What was said in the <em>Lloyd </em>case, in answer to a similar argument, again is pertinent here: \u201cThe matter may be said to be of general public interest only in the sense that any statute is, which involves the whole state. Moreover, it does not seem likely that it will recur with any frequency, and if it does again present itself, there need be no difficulty in having it passed upon by this Court as a live issue.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> See also <em>Price v. Cohen, </em>206 Md. 45.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">Code, 1957, Art. 78, Sec. 93 (b), provides that every proceeding before the trial courts coming from the Public Service Commission \u201cshall be preferred over all other civil causes except election causes in all the courts of this State, irrespective of their position on the dockets * * *.\u201d Where there has been a necessity to do so, this Court has decided appeals within a few days of the judgment or decree appealed from. We have no doubt that an appeal from the Public Service Commission in a situation such as confronted the Railroad Company, if promptly initiated and vigorously prosecuted, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>could be heard and decided in the trial court and this Court before the case becomes moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">\n<em>Appeal dismissed, costs to be paid by appellant.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">.
