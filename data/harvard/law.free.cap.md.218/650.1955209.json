J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-15\">With regard to the other reasons assigned by the applicant for granting the writ, we have repeatedly held such reasons are not grounds for granting the writ sought, for instance: the illegality of arrest and initial detention raised after trial and conviction <em>[Howell v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 611, 139 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>A. 2d 270 (1958)]; a mere complaint of being held <em>incommunicado </em>before trial <em>[Hamilton v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 652, 140 A. 2d 891 (1958)] ; a question as to bail after conviction [see <em>Cook v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 628, 137 A. 2d 649 (1958), <em>certiorari </em>denied 356 U. S. 953 (1958)]; a claim of denial of a trial by jury (which in this instance is not true) <em>[Savoy v. Warden, </em>216 Md. 616, 139 A. 2d 257 (1958)]; and an allegation that evidence was insufficient to convict because the applicant has proof of an alibi [see <em>Murray v. Warden, </em>215 Md. 655, 139 A. 2d 268 (1958)]. Finally, the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>will not issue upon an allegation that the applicant was not allowed to move for a new trial or appeal to this Court in the absence of a showing that he sought such procedure and that it was improperly denied him by the State or a public official. <em>Person v. Warden, </em>217 Md. 650, 141 A. 2d 743 (1958).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
