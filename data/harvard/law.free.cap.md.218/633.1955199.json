His second contention is that two policemen unlawfully confiscated the sum of eight dollars and ninety-five cents ($8.95) of his money which was introduced as evidence against him at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-17\">Myers\u2019 complaints cannot avail him. We have held repeatedly that an allegation of perjury without supporting facts showing that State officials knowingly participated in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>its use, is insufficient to justify the issuance of the writ. <em>Whitley v.
