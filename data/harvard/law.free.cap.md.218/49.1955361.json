The indictment was, of course, before the judge at the time of the petitioner\u2019s trial, and a review of the averments of the petition does not show reliance on any material fact not known to the court at the time of trial. In order to issue the writ of error <em>coram nobis, </em>the alleged error must inhere in facts not actually in issue at the trial and unknown to the court when the judge entered his judgment, but which, if known, would have prevented the judgment. <em>Keane v. State, </em>164 Md. 685. Thus Myers has not alleged a ground upon which the writ should issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">In his reply brief the petitioner does contend that the entire case against him was fraudulent; however, these allegations are unsupported. It is not the purpose of the writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>to review evidence presented at the trial, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>nor is it its purpose to consider issues that may properly have been raised by appeal. <em>Bernard v. State, </em>193 Md. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Myers\u2019 final contention is that the trial judge did not abide by Art. IV, Sec. 23 of the Maryland Constitution, because he did not render his decision on the petition \u201cwithin two months\u201d after it was submitted. It has been held that Sec. 23 is not mandatory, but directory, and thus there was no loss o\u00a3 jurisdiction to pass upon the petition. <em>Suttleman v. Board of Liquor License Commissioners, </em>209 Md. 134, 140; <em>Snyder v. Cearfoss, </em>186 Md. 360.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-6\">For the reasons stated, we accordingly affirm the order of Judge Niles dismissing the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-7\">\n<em>Order affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
