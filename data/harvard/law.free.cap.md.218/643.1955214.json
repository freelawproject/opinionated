Petitioner was convicted in the People\u2019s Court of Wicomico County on two counts of unauthorized use of a motor vehicle and sentenced to 24 months in the House of Correction. He alleges that he should have been tried by the juvenile authorities, and that he was not represented by counsel. The petition is devoid of any facts that would tend to show a lack of jurisdiction in the magistrate, nor does it allege that he requested that counsel be appointed. <em>De Lisle v. Warden, </em>203 Md. 649. We have also noted in several cases that appointment of counsel by a magistrate is unheard of in Maryland, and that on appeal petitioner would have been entitled to a trial <em>de novo </em>and that counsel could then have been appointed for him, if necessary. <em>Gayles v. Warden, </em>212 Md. 641; <em>Smith v. Warden, </em>208 Md. 672; <em>Ridgeley v. Warden, </em>201 Md. 651. In any event, counsel need <em>not </em>be appointed except in serious cases, and there is no showing that for want of counsel \u201can ingredient of unfairness operated actively in the process that resulted in his confinement\u201d. <em>Channell v. Warden, 211 </em>Md. 615, 616, and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">\n<em>Application denied, with costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
