The declaration, in, two counts, alleged that Clarence Wilkerson had been fatally shot by the defendant, Louis DeManss, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>police officer, \u201cregularly employed as an agent, employee and servant of the Police Department of Baltimore County\u201d, and that the shooting was \u201cin reckless disregard of human life and discarding those precautions proper to the circumstances,\u201d and \u201cwithout justification or excuse\u201d. The trial court held that the County was not liable for the alleged tort of the police officer, because it was exercising a governmental function when it employed him.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-3\">We think the Maryland law on the point was settled in the case of <em>Wynkoop v. Hagerstown, </em>159 Md. 194. The rule there stated is supported by the great weight of authority. See Borchard, <em>Government Liability in Tori, </em>34 Yale Law Journ. 229, 240; Prosser, <em>Torts </em>(2d ed.) \u00a7 109; <em>Restatement of Torts, </em>sec. 887, comment (c) and sec. 888, comment (c) ; 18 McQuillin, <em>Municipal Corporations </em>(3d ed.) \u00a7\u00a7 53.79, 53.80. We find no merit in the appellants\u2019 argument that Baltimore County somehow stands in a different position because of the adoption of its present Charter under Article XI-A of the Maryland Constitution, and Code (1957), Art. 25A, sec. 1. If, as the appellants argue, the rule ought to be changed so as to enlarge the liability of municipal corporations, it must be done by the Legislature and not by this Court. <em>Baltimore v. State, </em>173 Md. 267, 273; <em>Cox v. Anne Arundel County, </em>181 Md. 428, 433. Cf. <em>Howard v. South Balto. Gen. Hosp., </em>191 Md. 617, 619; and <em>Thomas v. Prince George\u2019s County, </em>200 Md. 554, 559.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed, costs to be paid by the appellants.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
