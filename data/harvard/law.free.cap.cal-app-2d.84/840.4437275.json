J.</author>\n<p id=\"AlS\">Petition for a writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-9\">Petitioners seek in this proceeding to prevent the respondent superior court from further proceeding, except to dismiss, an action commenced by the respondent commission against petitioners. The record discloses the following chronology:</p>\n<p id=\"b858-10\"><em>November 2, </em>1943\u2014complaint filed and summons issued, but it was never served.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-11\"><em>April 14, </em>1944\u2014the original summons was returned unserved, an amended complaint was filed, and summons issued on the amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-12\"><em>April 18 or 20, </em>1944\u2014summons on the amended complaint was served on petitioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-13\"><em>April 27, </em>1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead to June 1, 1944, executed. This was not filed with the trial court until August 14, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-14\"><em>May 18, </em>1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead until July 1, 1944, executed. This was not filed with the trial court until August 14, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-15\"><em>June 23, </em>1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead until 10 days after receipt of written notice from plaintiff executed. This was not filed with the trial court until August 14, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number><em>December 23, </em>1946\u2014summons on first amended complaint returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-4\"><em>July 1, </em>1947\u2014notice to plead given defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\"><em>July 7, </em>1947\u2014motion to dismiss filed by defendants upon the ground, among others, that more than three years had elapsed from the date of service of summons on the amended complaint, that no answer or appearance had been filed or made within that time, and that no judgment had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-6\"><em>July </em>11,1947\u2014motion to dismiss argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-7\"><em>August </em>14,1947\u2014the three stipulations above mentioned were filed with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\"><em>August </em>18,1947\u2014motion to dismiss denied\u2014entered August 20,1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\"><em>October 14, </em>1947\u2014this proceeding in prohibition instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">It is quite apparent that, so far as the legal effect of the stipulations is concerned, the case is governed by the rules of law set forth in <em>Rio Del Mar Country Club </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Civ. 13631, this day filed <em>(ante, </em>p. 214 [190 P.2d 295]).</p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">On the authority and for the reasons there set forth in the opinion it is ordered that the peremptory writ of prohibition issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-12\">Ward, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
