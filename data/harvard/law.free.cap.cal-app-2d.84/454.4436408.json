J.</author>\n<p id=\"A7p\">The plaintiff herein, at the date of filing of the complaint an infant of the age of 9 months, is the son of Ann and Herbert Rudley, who were married in 1940. According to the complaint, \u201cUntil the 5'th day of May, 1946, the plaintiff\u2019s father was a devoted parent, faithfully and affectionately discharging the duties and obligations of a father.\u201d Commencing approximately on that date, the defendant Sarette Tobias is alleged to have \u201cmaliciously and for the purpose of breaking the family of which plaintiff was a member and for the purpose of depriving the plaintiff of the presence, comfort, society, guidance, affection and paternal care of Herbert Rudley, the plaintiff\u2019s father, persuaded the plaintiff\u2019s father to leave the marital household, to remove himself from the family of which both he and plaintiff were members, and to establish his permanent residence with the defendant. The defendant continued said persuasions and enticements until on or about the 3d day of June, 1946, she succeeded in persuading and enticing the plaintiff\u2019s father to leave the marital household and to take up his residence with her.\u201d The complaint further alleges that thereafter plaintiff\u2019s father did not return to the marital household, and as a consequence of the defendant\u2019s conduct, \u201cplaintiff has been and will continue to be deprived of the presence, comfort, society, guidance, affection and paternal care of his father and of the fruits and benefits of the integral family,\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s damage in the sum of $100,000. The trial court sustained a demurrer to the complaint without leave to amend, and judgment was thereafter rendered dismissing the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">In appellant\u2019s brief it is contended that a cause of action exists in favor of a child such as the plaintiff herein, against one who maliciously entices the child\u2019s father from the marital household, for the following reasons: (1) \u201cNo decision to the contrary having been rendered in California or elsewhere, the cause of action should be recognized\u201d; (2) \u201cWhen a responsible defendant seeks to escape from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>liability for an act which he had notice was likely to cause temporal damage to another, and which has caused such damage in fact, he must show a justification, \u2019 \u2019 quoted from Holmes, 4 Harvard Law Review 1; (3) \u201cOur Codes are not exhaustive. The courts retain the power to recognize causes of action not specified in the Codes\u201d; and (4) \u201cThe Legislature has not taken away the cause of action here sued upon. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">In considering the question here presented, conceded to be one of first impression in this state, it is imperative to note the statutory provisions existing before and after 1939, in which year the California Legislature enacted section 43.5 of the Civil Code outlawing so-called \u201cHeart Balm\u201d suits by providing that \u201cNo cause of action arises for; (a) <em>Alienation of affection.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) Prior to 1939, as set forth in respondent\u2019s brief, section 49 of the Civil Code declared that \u201cThe rights of personal relations forbid: (1) The abduction of a husband from his wife or <em>a parent from, his child.\u201d </em>(Italics added.) However, in the year 1939, section 49 was amended by entirely omitting the subsection above quoted, so that, as this section now reads, \"The rights of personal relations forbid\u201d only \u201cabduction or enticement of a child from a parent\u201d or guardian; the \u201cseduction of a person under the age of legal consent\u201d; and \u201cAny injury to a servant which affects his ability to serve his master other than seduction, abduction or criminal conversation.\u201d Obviously, none of the provisions of the amended section 49 cover the present situation. Moreover, the amendment of this section and the omission to reenact the previous provision forbidding \u201cThe abduction of a . . . parent from his child,\u201d must be read in connection with the contemporaneous statutory bar against actions for alienation of affection.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The appellant argues that the present action, brought on behalf of the child, is in no way analogous to the prohibited action for alienation of affections, but rather comparable to an action for the wrongful death of a parent. It is contended, in this behalf, that there is no statutory prohibition against the child\u2019s action; that the integrity of the family relation and social considerations demand judicial recognition of the defendant\u2019s liability for enticing plaintiff\u2019s father from the family home. Respondent\u2019s brief, on the other hand, takes the position that \u201cSection 49 of the Civil Code limits the causes of action which are based upon an interference with personal relations to those enumerated in that section\u201d; and that the omission to include in the reenactment, any recognition of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>right of action for abduction of \u201ca parent from his child,\u201d was equivalent to a repeal of that right.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">The trial court, as hereinbefore indicated, took the view that the California law as evidenced by the code sections now in effect, does not countenance such an action as is stated in the appellant\u2019s complaint. A consideration of those statutes, together with the legislative history connected with their enactment, the state of the law as it existed prior to the amendment of section 49 of the Civil Code, and the enactment of the new section 43.5 which prohibits actions of \u201calienation of affection,\u201d leads to the conclusion that appellant's position is untenable. Social considerations, and the alleged necessity or advisability of protecting the family relation by upholding the child\u2019s action here contended for, are arguments more properly addressed to the legislative branch. The existence or nonexistence of such a cause of action must be determined by the state of the law as it now exists, and the evident intention of the legislative body.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">Admittedly, the statutory law of this state contains no authorization for such an action, either directly or by way of implication. Moreover, any implication is obviously against the appellant\u2019s contention.  The rule as stated in <em>Shearer </em>v. <em>Flannery, </em>68 Cal.App. 91, 94 [228 P. 549], namely, that \u201cthe amendment of a statute or section operates as a repeal of those parts of the statute or section which are not reenacted, \u2019 \u2019 is here applicable. By the omission from the amended section 49 of the Civil Code of the provision which had previously forbidden abduction of \u201ca parent from his child,\u201d the Legislature must be deemed to have intended to do exactly what it did do, namely to remove from the law the right of action covered by the omitted subsection. No other reasonable conclusion is tenable. And in this connection it may be noted that the words \u201cabduction\u201d and \u201centicement,\u201d as used in section 49 prior to the year 1939, have been judicially interpreted as synonymous. See <em>Humphrey </em>v. <em>Pope, </em>122 Cal. 253, 256 [54 P. 847], and <em>Horowitz </em>v. <em>Sacks, </em>89 Cal.App. 336, 340 [265 P. 281]. \u201cAbduction,\u201d says the Humphrey opinion, may be accomplished by fraud, persuasion or violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">In dealing with another subsection of section 49 of the Civil Code, namely, subsection (c) thereof, the United States Circuit Court of Appeal in the case of <em>Standard Oil Co. of Cal. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>153 F.2d 958, 961, has declared that section 49 \u201cdefinitely limits the causes of action which are based upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>an interference with personal relationships to those enumerated in the section. For example, Section 49 might have given a cause of action for injuries to parties to other personal relationships similar to that of master and servant alone, i.e., for injuries to an agent, an independent contractor, a partner, a joint adventurer,' et cetera.\u201d Quoting from <em>Burlingame </em>v. <em>Traeger, </em>101 Cal.App.365, 371 [281 P. 1051], the court in the Standard Oil case further said: \u201cIt must also be borne in mind that \u2018our codes, of course, were intended as complete revisions of the existing laws upon the subjects embraced therein\u2019 <em>(Estate of Carraghar, </em>181 Cal. 15 [183 P. 161, 163]), and that their provisions establish the law of this state respecting the subjects to which they relate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">It is not contended that appellant\u2019s position is supported by any existing statutory law directly sanctioning the alleged cause of action. Such general provisions as that of section 43 of the Civil Code, guaranteeing \u201cthe right of protection from . . . injury to his personal relations,\u201d and the fundamental principles embodied in section 871 of the Restatement on Torts, are not helpful in dealing with the present problem. Likewise, the appellant\u2019s brief does not claim that there is any pronouncement of the California courts which recognizes child\u2019s right of action. The decisions of <em>Daily </em>v. <em>Parker, </em>(1945) 152 F.2d 174 and <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Luhman, </em>330 Ill.App. 598 [71 N.E.2d 810], holding that such an action is permissible, involve Illinois law, and obviously are not binding on the courts of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">Relying on the so-called doctrine of judicial empiricism, the appellant insists that the appellate court should \u201cfill in the gaps\u201d in the law, and, for reasons of public policy and in \u201cthe interest of society as a whole,\u201d sanction the action contended for. But judicial process is concerned with the interpretation and application of legislative intent, not with usurpation of the lawmaking function. The dangers of attempted interference by any one governmental division with matters committed to the jurisdiction of another division, whether executive, judicial, or legislative, are too obvious to require discussion. In view of the evident legislative intent hereinbefore commented upon, neither public policy nor any other concept can here justify a creation of personal rights by so-called \u201cjudicial process.\u201d Whether \u201creasonable interpretation inclines one to a view that the abduction or enticement of a father from a child sounds as much in the field of alienation of affection as its kindred suit abduction or entice<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>ment of a husband from his wife, \u2019 \u2019 as contended in respondent\u2019s brief, and whatever the law may be in Illinois or elsewhere, there appears to be no justification for the bringing of this action in the State of California.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">White, J., and Bartlett, J. pro tern., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for a hearing by the Supreme Court was denied May 17, 1948. Carter, J., voted for a hearing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
