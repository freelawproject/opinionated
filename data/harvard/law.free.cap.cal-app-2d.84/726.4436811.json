The decedent died testate leaving an estate which has been appraised at $78,000. He bequeathed $10,000 to appellant, the principal beneficiary of his will being an adult son by a prior marriage. The only real property in the estate is improved with a building consisting of five apartments and was appraised at $25,000. From the rental of these apartments at a gross per year of $3,090 the net annual profit is $2,100 or $2,200. This real property was the separate property of decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-8\">Appellant petitioned the probate court to set this property aside to her as a probate homestead. In addition to the facts above recited it developed on the hearing of this petition that appellant owns a home of her own and that she is employed at a salary of $4,400 per year.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">The court ordered the real property set aside as a homestead for the period of six months. Appellant appeals from this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">Section 661 Probate Code provides as to a homestead on the decedent\u2019s separate property:</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">\u201cIf the property set apart is the separate property of the decedent, the court can set it apart only for a limited period, to be designated in the order, and in no case beyond the lifetime of the surviving spouse ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b745-12\">\u201cThe time during which the separate property of the decedent shall be held as a homestead is a matter resting in the sound discretion of the court.\u201d (11a Cal.Jur. 638.)</p>\n<p id=\"b745-13\">The court was entitled in exercising this discretion to consider the fact that only a small part (one apartment out of five) of the building could be occupied as a home by appellant and that from the rest she would receive a substantial income, that the real property was almost one-third of the entire estate, and that appellant already had a substantial income of her own and her separate home. The most important factor in determining the length of a limited probate homestead should be the necessity of the widow or other family to be secured in a home. Here that necessity is slight if not nonexistent. Weighing these factors we cannot say that the probate court abused its discretion. In <em>Estate of Barkley, </em>91 Cal.App. 388 [267 P. 148], an order setting aside a probate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>homestead in the deceased spouse\u2019s separate property for one year was affirmed. In <em>Estate of Levy, </em>141 Cal. 646 [75 P. 301, 99 Am.St.Rep. 92], the probate court set apart a three-flat building as a homestead during the period of administration only. In <em>Estate of Ettlinger, </em>56 Cal.App.2d 603 [132P.2d 895], the homestead was limited to five months.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\">Nourse, P. J., and Goodell, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
