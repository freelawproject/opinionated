The record discloses the following chronology:</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\"><em>April </em>7,1944\u2014complaint filed and summons issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-12\"><em>April </em>18,1944\u2014complaint and summons served.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-13\"><em>April </em>27,1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead to June 1, 1944, executed\u2014not filed with the trial court until August 14, 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-14\"><em>May 18, </em>1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead to July 1, 1944, executed\u2014not filed with the trial court until August 14,1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-15\"><em>June </em>23,1944\u2014stipulation extending time to defendants to plead until 10 days after receipt of written notice from plaintiff\u2014not filed with the trial court until August 14,1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-16\"><em>December </em>23,1946\u2014summons returned.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-17\"><em>July </em>1,1947\u2014notice to plead given defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-18\"><em>July </em>7,1947\u2014motion to dismiss filed by defendants upon the ground, among others, that more than three years had elapsed from the date of service of summons, that no answer or appearance had been filed or made within that time, and that no judgment had been entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-19\"><em>July </em>11,1947\u2014motion to dismiss argued.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-20\"><em>August 14, </em>1947\u2014the three stipulations above mentioned were filed with the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"844\">*844</page-number><em>August </em>18,1947\u2014motion to dismiss denied\u2014entered August 20,1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-4\"><em>August </em>30,1947\u2014petitioners filed a demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\"><em>October </em>14,1947\u2014this proceeding in prohibition instituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The facts of this ease are substantially similar to those in <em>Aptos Building Co. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Civ. 13632 <em>(ante, </em>p. 840 [190 P.2d 303]), and to <em>James Monroe, etc. </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Civ. 13634 <em>(ante, </em>p. 841 [190 P.2d 304]). So far as the legal effect of the stipulations is concerned, the ease is governed by the rules of law set forth in <em>Rio Del Mar Country Club </em>v. <em>Superior Court, </em>1 Civ. 13631, this day filed <em>(ante, </em>p. 214 [190 P.2d 295]).</p>\n<p id=\"b862-7\">On the authority and for the reasons set forth in the opinions in those eases it is ordered that the peremptory writ of prohibition issue as prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-8\">Ward, J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
