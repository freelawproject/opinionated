It was at this time that Gertrude Burrows appeared as a witness. The trial court\u2019s order states: \u201cThat Gertrude Burrows, having appeared in Court, and being found to be a fit and proper person to be the Guardian of the Person of the said Cora Stone Peterson ... is hereby appointed Guardian of the Person of Cora Stone Peterson ...\u201d Appellant\u2019s parents and spouse being dead, section 1404 of the Probate Code is not involved. The selection of a guardian of the person rested in the trial court\u2019s discretion, and no abuse of discretion is seen in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>present case. <em>(Matter of Coburn, </em>165 Cal. 202, 218 [131 P. 352].)</p>\n<p id=\"b566-5\"><em>For </em>the reasons stated in the main opinion, the order from which the present appeal is taken is amended by the insertion of the date, \u201cJanuary 29, 1947,\u201d following the words \u201cregularly to be heard on,\u201d and, as amended, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">Peters, P. J., and Bray, J., concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
