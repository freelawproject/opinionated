Memorandum: Supreme Court properly dismissed petitioner\u2019s CPLR article 78 proceeding, which sought to annul respondents\u2019 determination denying petitioner\u2019s application for a use variance. Petitioner failed to establish that no reasonable return could be achieved under a permitted use of the property and thus failed to meet the requisite showing of unnecessary hardship <em>(Matter of Village Bd. v Jarrold, </em>53 NY2d 254, 257; <em>Matter of Otto v Steinhilber, </em>282 NY 71, 76). The bare conclusory testimony of witnesses that the property could not yield a reasonable return was insufficient to justify the grant of a use variance <em>(Matter of Village Bd. v Jarrold, supra, </em>at 259). We conclude that respondents\u2019 determination was supported by substantial evidence. (Appeal from Judgment of Supreme Court, Erie County, Whelan, J.\u2014Article 78.) Present\u2014Callahan, J. P., Lawton, Fallon, Doerr and Boehm, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
