On appeal, defendant contends that the consecutive prison sentences of <em>lYa </em>to 4 years and <em>3Ys </em>to 10 years that he received upon his guilty pleas are harsh and excessive. We disagree. Defendant was allowed to plead to a lesser offense in satisfaction of the superior court information and to one of two counts in satisfaction of the indictment. In addition, the sentences defendant received were less than the harshest possible. Further, defendant knew that he would receive the sentences ultimately imposed at the time of his plea in satisfaction of the indictment and declined to withdraw his guilty plea in satisfaction of the information at that time. In light of these facts, we find no basis to disturb the sentence imposed by County Court <em>(see, People v Gonzalez, </em>178 AD2d 850, <em>lv denied </em>79 NY2d 948; <em>People v Mackey, </em>136 AD2d 780, <em>lv denied </em>71 NY2d 899).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-4\">Weiss, P. J., Mikoll, Yesawich Jr., Crew III and White, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
