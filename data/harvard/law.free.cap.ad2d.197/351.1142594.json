Defendant and his accomplices were arrested moments later, and identifications were confirmed by the undercover officer. Defendant failed to object to the court\u2019s instructions, failed to submit his own proposed instructions, despite an opportunity to do so, and failed to except to the court\u2019s instructions to the jury. Defendant\u2019s present challenges are unpreserved for review as a matter of law <em>(see, People v Whalen, </em>59 NY2d 273, 280), and we decline to review them in the interest of justice. We do, however, find the sentence excessive to the extent indicated. Concur\u2014Murphy, P. J., Ellerin, Wallach, Kassal and Nardelli, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
