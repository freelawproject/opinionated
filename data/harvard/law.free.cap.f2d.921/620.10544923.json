The district court granted the state officials\u2019 motion for summary judgment for the reasons set forth in a magistrate\u2019s report dated July 12, 1989. Appellant claims that the district court erred, <em>inter alia, </em>by 1) failing to make a de novo review of the magistrate\u2019s report; 2) granting defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment when there are material factual issues in dispute; 3) finding that La.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 15:875 (West Supp.1990) is constitutional on its face and as applied to appellant; 4) failing to appoint counsel; and 5) declining to rule on appellant\u2019s state claims. Finding that the district court erred in granting summary judgment, we reverse and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-16\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-17\">Appellant Nolan Longmire (Longmire), a prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary, filed this suit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, alleging that his rights to due process and equal protection were violated by requiring him to pay, in part, restitution for the value of state property damaged and for the cost of medical attention required following Longmire\u2019s act of self-mu-tiliation. Longmire contended that the statute authorizing the restitution, La.Rev. Stat.Ann. \u00a7 15:875 (West Supp.1990), is unconstitutional on its face and as applied to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-18\">Longmire names as defendants (1) William J. Guste, Jr., the Attorney General for the State of Louisiana; (2) Bruce N. Lynn, the Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (LDPSC); (3) John P. Whitley, the Warden of the Louisiana State Penitentiary (LSP); and (4) Annette Viator, the Chief Legal Counsel.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>The district court stayed the proceedings pending exhaustion of administrative remedies. Following purported exhaustion, the district court reinstated the suit and assigned it to a U.S. Magistrate.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Longmire filed a motion for summary judgment, as did the defendants. Oral argument was held to consider these requests. The U.S. Magistrate recommended that the defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment be granted and Longmire\u2019s motion be denied. The magistrate concluded that the statute did not deprive Longmire of due process and refused to entertain the pendent claim that the statute violated the Louisiana Constitution. Longmire then filed objections to the report. The district court, for the reasons set forth in the magistrate\u2019s report, ordered that the action be dismissed with prejudice as to the federal claims and dismissed without prejudice as to the state law claims. The district court failed to make separate findings on any part of the challenged report. Longmire filed a timely notice of appeal. He also requested that counsel be appointed for the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The district court found that the action was frivolous and denied leave to appeal as a pauper. This court granted Longmire\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis, </em>but denied Longmire\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">As a threshold matter, we address the appellees\u2019 jurisdictional challenge. Appellees, the Louisiana state officials, allege that Longmire failed to perfect an appeal as to three of the officials because Long-mire\u2019s notice of appeal specifically named only Attorney General William Guste, Jr. The notice of appeal used the words \u201cet al.\u201d to include the other three officials. It is the appellees\u2019 view that this court lacks jurisdiction over the appeal as to these three appellees. In support of this contention, appellees cite Fed.R.App.Proc. 3(c), <em>Torres v. Oakland Scavenger Company, </em>487 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct. 2405, 101 L.Ed.2d 285 (1988), and <em>Pope v. Mississippi Real Estate Commission, </em>872 F.2d 127 (5th Cir.1989). This contention has no merit because appellees misinterpret each of these cited materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">Fed.R.App.Proc. 3(c) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b708-12\">The notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal; shall designate the judgment, order or part thereof appealed from; and shall name the court to which the appeal is taken.... An appeal shall not be dismissed for informality of form or title of the notice of appeal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The Supreme Court in <em>Torres </em>held that this was a jurisdictional rule, deviation from which would deny a court of appeals jurisdiction over that part of petitioner\u2019s appeal not covered by the notice of appeal. In <em>Torres, </em>the Court specifically found that the use of \u201cet al.\u201d to describe the appellants taking appeal was insufficient to indicate an unnamed appellant\u2019s intention to appeal. 108 S.Ct. at 2409. In doing so, the court noted that \u201cconstruing Rule 3(c) as a jurisdictional prerequisite leads to a harsh result in this case, but we are convinced that the harshness of our construction is \u2018imposed by the legislature and not by the judicial process.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). No such harshness is required in the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">The Court in <em>Torres </em>construed the phrase \u201c[t]he notice of appeal shall specify the party or parties taking the appeal ...\u201d to be a jurisdictional prerequisite.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jurisdictional prerequisite of Fed.R.App. Proc. 3(c) only requires naming with specificity the appellants taking the appeal and not the appellees against whom the appeal is being taken. <em>See Streetman v. Jordan, </em>918 F.2d 555 (5th Cir.1990); <em>Chathas v. Smith, </em>848 F.2d 93, 94 (7th Cir.1988) (omission of appellee\u2019s name harmless error); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number><em>Battle v. District of Columbia, </em>854 F.2d 1448, 1450 (D.C.Cir.1988) (\u201cWhile Rule 3(c) requires that appellants be identified it does not require that appellees be identified ... therefore, when an appellee is not identified .... the Court has jurisdiction over the appeal\u201d) (dicta)</p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Having determined that the use of \u201cet al.\u201d is not a jurisdictional infirmity in a notice of appeal, we turn to the secondary concern in Torres\u2014notice to the opposition and to the court of the identity of the parties on appeal. 108 S.Ct. at 2409. This concern is satisfied by Fed.R.App.Proc. 3(d) which states: \u201cThe clerk of the district court shall serve notice of the filing of a notice of appeal by mailing a copy thereof to counsel of record of each party other than the appellant....\u201d By sending notice to each of the parties in a suit other than the party taking the appeal, each of these parties becomes aware of the appellant\u2019s intent to appeal. If the rules anticipated that only those appellees named would be included in the appeal, only those appellees would require notice. In this case, all four of the defendants were represented by staff attorneys in the Louisiana Department of Justice. The notice of appeal was sent to these attorneys. There can be no contention that any of the appellees was not on notice as to Longmire\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">Based upon the foregoing analysis, we hold that the jurisdictional requirement of <em>Torres </em>does not require that appellees\u2019 names be specified in a notice of appeal. Rather, this requirement only applies to the names of appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-7\">We now turn to Longmire\u2019s challenges to the district court\u2019s order granting the ap-pellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-8\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-9\">Longmire contends that the district court erred by not making a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate\u2019s report and a determination of the merit of Longmire\u2019s specific objections to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-11\">A party is entitled to a de novo review of a magistrate\u2019s finding and recommendations only if objections are made to the findings. <em>Nettles v. Wainwright, </em>677 F.2d 404, 409-10 (5th Cir.1982) (en banc) (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B)). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), \u201c[a] judge of the court shall make a de novo determination of those portions of the report or specified proposed findings or recommendations to which objection was made.\u201d Longmire filed written objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and was entitled to a <em>de novo </em>review by an Article III judge as to those issues to which an objection is made. <em>See U.S. v. Wilson, </em>864 F.2d 1219, 1221-22 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 109 S.Ct. 3243, 106 L.Ed.2d 590 (1989). Longmire alleges that the district court erred in the present action by failing to conduct a <em>de novo </em>review of the magistrate\u2019s findings to which objections were timely made.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-14\">The district court\u2019s order stated that \u201c[f]or the reasons set forth in the Magistrate\u2019s Report to which an objection was filed; IT IS ORDERED that ... the defendant\u2019s motion for summary judgment be granted.\u201d We cannot say that this language indicates a failure to make a de novo review of the magistrate\u2019s report, the record, and plaintiff\u2019s objections. In granting a motion for summary judgment, the district court would be required to engage in exactly the same method of analysis as employed by the magistrate. We assume that the district court did its statutorily commanded duty in the absence of evidence to the contrary. Therefore, we decline to reverse the district court on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Longmire next challenges the holding that La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 15:875 is facially constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">The 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution protects against deprivations of life, liberty and property without due process of law. There is no doubt that Longmire was deprived of property\u2014funds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>in his prison account.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The statutory scheme of \u00a7 15:875 provides that \u201c[t]he [deprivation] determination by the department shall be by disciplinary proceedings in accordance with the rules and regulations of the department.\u201d La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 15:875.C. (West Supp.1990). These procedures are outlined in the Disciplinary Rules and Procedures for Adult Prisoners which provides the prisoner with a hearing and certain enumerated rights. Disciplinary Rules and Procedures for Adult Prisoners, LDPSC, Corrections Services, Dep\u2019t Reg. No. 30-41 (\u201cPrisoner Rule Book\u201d). This procedure has been determined to satisfy the procedural due process requirements of the 14th Amendment for property deprivation that results from established state procedure. <em>McCrae v. Hankins, </em>720 F.2d 863, 867-68 (5th Cir.1983). In light of this decision, we affirm the district court\u2019s implicit determination that \u00a7 15:825 is facially constitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">Longmire asserts that the district court, by reference to the magistrate\u2019s report, erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment regarding the constitutionality of \u00a7 15:875 as applied to him.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Affirmance of a summary judgment ruling requires that the appellate court be \u201cconvinced, after an independent review of the record, that \u2018there is no genuine issue as to any material fact\u2019 and the movant is \u2018entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Brooks, Tarlton, Gilbert, Douglas &amp; Kressler v. United States Fire Ins. Co., </em>832 F.2d 1358, 1364 (5th Cir.1987) (quoting Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c)). All reasonable inferences must be drawn in favor of the party opposing the motion. <em>Reid v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., </em>784 F.2d 577, 578 (5th Cir.1986). \u201cAlthough inferences favorable to the non-movant must be accepted in a motion for summary judgment, summary judgment is nonetheless appropriate against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish an element essential to the party\u2019s case.\u201d <em>Moore v. Mississippi Valley State Univ., </em>871 F.2d 545, 549 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b710-10\">On four occasions, three of which are documented in the record, Longmire received the sanction of restitution under the prison disciplinary process. Longmire was charged with: 1) attempting to cause injury to himself on March 31, 1987, for which, based on a guilty plea, he was assessed restitution costs in the amount of $25 for emergency room treatment; 2) tearing the light cover and bulb out of his cell and throwing them on the tier on April 29, 1987, for which, after a disciplinary hearing, he was assessed restitution costs in the amount of $60.06; and 3) throwing his glass and tray of food on to the tier on May 13, 1987, for which, after a disciplinary hearing, he was assessed restitution costs in the amount of $1. A fourth incident is alluded to; however, there is no documentation in the record as to the amount and purpose of restitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-11\">The magistrate held oral argument on the opposing motions for summary judgment. However, no affidavits were attached to the motions. There is an inadequate record for this court to determine whether Longmire received a meaningful hearing during the prison disciplinary process. The appellees state that Longmire received an adequate hearing. Longmire, on the other hand, seems to indicate that the procedure was a sham and that it did not comply with the rules and regulations which allow for such rights as the right to cross-examine his accuser and the right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>present evidence and witnesses. No evi-dentiary hearing was held on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-4\">Appellees, citing <em>Armistead v. Phelps, </em>365 So.2d 468 (La.1978) and <em>Collins v. King, </em>743 F.2d 248, 253-54 (5th Cir.1984), would have us dismiss Longmire\u2019s \u00a7 1983 action because Louisiana will provide Long-mire adequate pre- and post-deprivation review to satisfy the due process clause. We decline to do so because the record is unclear as to the posture of this case within the state review process and as to the proper procedure for a prisoner to pursue. We note that the Prisoner Rule Book, included in the record, allows appeal to the Secretary of the LDPSC in only certain enumerated cases. Sentences that include restitution do not appear to be included in this group of cases. The Rules seem to require appeal to the warden, which Long-mire contends he has done. Thus, there seems to be a dispute as to precisely what process is available to the prisoner in the Louisiana prison\u2019s pre-deprivation review. In addition, the Prisoner Rule Book, cited by appellees as part of their \u201cprocedural safeguards,\u201d only discusses appeals to the Secretary of LDPSC and does not include any mention of judicial review in the Louisiana courts as addressed in <em>Armistead v. Phelps, </em>365 So.2d 468 (La.1978) (referring to La.Rev.Stat.Ann. \u00a7 49:951 et seq., the Louisiana Administrative Procedures Act). The district court, on remand, should review and clarify these procedures, clarify Longmire\u2019s present legal standing, the notice that prisoners have of these procedures, and address any other material facts in dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">Because there is insufficient evidence in the record for this court to review as to what type of hearing Longmire received or what type of hearing he is entitled to under Louisiana statutes and regulations, we reverse the granting of summary judgment. See <em>Murrell v. Bennett, </em>615 F.2d 306, 309-11 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cBecause [summary judgment\u2019s] consequences are so severe ... we must always guard against premature truncation of [potentially] legitimate lawsuits merely because of unskilled presentations.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">D.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">Lastly, appellees contend that Longmire has failed to state a claim against Attorney General Guste. Longmire is suing Guste \u201cin his official and individual capacity pursuant to Art. 4, Section 8, of the [Louisiana Constitution] in which he is legal [sic] responsible to defend actions against state officers.\u201d The magistrate\u2019s report did not address this issue and the record is incomplete as to whether Longmire alleged that the attorney general had any further role in Longmire\u2019s deprivation. If not, upon remand the action as to Attorney General Guste should be dismissed. <em>Thompkins v. Belt, </em>828 F.2d 298, 303-05 (5th Cir.1987). The court should also decide whether to dismiss from this action any other official against whom Longmire makes insufficient allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">E.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Longmire has made several other challenges to the magistrate\u2019s report, including those dealing with the denial of counsel and the failure to address Longmire\u2019s state law claims. Finding no merit to these allegations, we affirm the district court\u2019s disposition of these matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-11\">Based on the foregoing determination, we AFFIRM IN PART and REVERSE and REMAND the remainder for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b707-12\">. Longmire\u2019s complaint originally named C. Paul Phelps, the former Secretary of the LDPSC, Milton Butler, the former Warden of the LSP and Joseph Erwin Kopsa, the former Chief Legal Counsel as defendants. The officeholders\u2019 names were updated pursuant to Fed.R.App.P. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>43(c) after Longmire filed this appeal to reflect changes in the Louisiana State Administration.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b708-9\">. This court\u2019s decision in <em>Pope </em>involved a notice of appeal by two plaintiffs that used the term \"et al.\u201d to include the second appellant. The <em>Pope </em>court carved out an exception to <em>Torres </em>when there are only 2 possible appellants and one is named, followed by et al. 872 F.2d at 129. <em>Pope </em>did not address <em>Torres </em>as applied to the failure to specify appellees.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b710-6\">. Appellees\u2019 reliance on <em>Rochon v. La. State Penitentiary Inmate Account, </em>880 F.2d 845 (5th Cir.1989), ce<em>rt. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 110 S.Ct. 742, 107 L.Ed.2d 759 (1990), is misplaced. That case determined the narrow proposition that a prisoner does not have a constitutional right to be paid for work performed in prison and therefore, if paid, the state could determine the uses for which the prisoner could withdraw the funds. The present case involves the reasons for which the state can deprive the prisoner of monetary property by withdrawing funds which have already been set aside as payment for his services. Thus a property right is implicated in the present action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b710-13\">. We read Longmire\u2019s prisoner pro se \u00a7 1983 claim liberally, as \"we are required to do.\u201d <em>McCrae v. Hankins, </em>720 F.2d 863 (1983).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
