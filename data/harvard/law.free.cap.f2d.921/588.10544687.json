We find the Tax Court\u2019s failure to accommodate her objections inconsistent with both Fed.R.Evid. 603 and the First Amendment and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-26\">This First Amendment case ironically arose out of a hearing in Tax Court. Although the government\u2019s brief is replete with references to income, exemptions, and taxable years, the only real issue is Betty Ann Ferguson\u2019s refusal to \u201cswear\u201d or \u201caffirm\u201d before testifying at the hearing. Her objection to oaths and affirmations is rooted in two Biblical passages, Matthew 5:33-37 and James 5:12. The passages refer only to oaths and swearing, but Ms. Ferguson explains her objection to affirmations in her brief to this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b674-27\">Appellant is forbidden to swear as evidenced by the Bible directive from her God, and since the word \u201coath\u201d has become synonymous and interchangeable with the word \u201caffirmation,\u201d and the word \u201cswear\u201d [has] become synonymous and interchangeable with the word \u201caffirm,\u201d as is evidenced in 1 U.S.C. 1 and many other authorities, it is appellant\u2019s sincere belief that \u201caffirmation\u201d is just an \u201cother oath\u201d and \u201caffirm\u201d falls with \u201cswear not <em>at all\u201d </em>Also, \u201caffirmation\u201d is the chosen form of those who denounce the very existence of God. Because of these things, \u201cswear\u201d and \u201caffirm\u201d are very repugnant to appellant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AG7\">Ms. Ferguson, proceeding pro se, requested that Judge Korner consider the following statement set forth by the Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>preme Court of Louisiana in <em>Staton v. Fought, </em>486 So.2d 745 (La.1986), as an alternative to an oath or affirmation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-4\">I, [Betty Ann Ferguson], do hereby declare that the facts I am about to give are, to the best of my knowledge and belief, accurate, correct, and complete.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AZaY\">Judge Korner abruptly denied her request, commenting that \u201c[a]sking you to affirm that you will give true testimony does not violate any religious conviction that I have ever heard anybody had\u201d and that he did not think affirming \u201cviolates any recognizable religious scruple.\u201d Because Ms. Ferguson could only introduce the relevant evidence through her own testimony, Judge Korner then dismissed her petition for lack of prosecution. She now appeals to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">The right to free exercise of religion, guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, is one of our most protected constitutional rights. The Supreme Court has stated that \u201conly those interests of the highest order and those not otherwise served can overbalance legitimate claims to the free exercise of religion.\u201d <em>Wisconsin v. Yoder, </em>406 U.S. 205, 215, 92 S.Ct. 1526, 1533, 32 L.Ed.2d 15 (1972). <em>Accord Hobbie v. Unemployment Appeals Comm\u2019n of Florida, </em>480 U.S. 136, 141, 107 S.Ct. 1046, 1049, 94 L.Ed.2d 190 (1987); and <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 403, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1793, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963). The protection of the free exercise clause extends to all sincere religious beliefs; courts may not evaluate religious truth. <em>United States v. Lee, </em>455 U.S. 252, 257, 102 S.Ct. 1051, 1055, 71 L.Ed.2d 127 (1982); and <em>United States v. Ballard, </em>322 U.S. 78, 86-87, 64 S.Ct. 882, 886-887, 88 L.Ed. 1148 (1944).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-7\">Fed.R.Evid. 603, applicable in Tax Court under the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7453, requires only that a witness \u201cdeclare that [she] will testify truthfully, by oath or affirmation administered in a form calculated to awaken the witness\u2019 conscience and impress the witness\u2019 mind with the duty to do so.\u201d As evidenced in the advisory ' committee notes accompanying Rule 603, Congress clearly intended to minimize any intrusion on the free exercise of religion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b675-10\">The rule is designed to afford the flexibility required in dealing with religious adults, atheists, conscientious objectors, mental defectives, and children. Affirmation is simply a solemn undertaking to tell the truth; no special verbal formula is required.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b675-11\"><em>Accord </em>Wright and Gold, <em>Federal Practice and Procedure </em>\u00a7 6044 (West 1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b675-12\">The courts that have considered oath and affirmation issues have similarly attempted to accommodate free exercise objections. In <em>Moore v. United States, </em>348 U.S. 966, 75 S.Ct. 530, 99 L.Ed. 753 (1955) (per curiam), for example, the Supreme Court held that a trial judge erred in refusing the testimony of witnesses who would not use the word \u201csolemnly\u201d in their affirmations for religious reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-13\">In <em>United States v. Looper, </em>419 F.2d 1405, 1407 (4th Cir.1969), the Fourth Circuit held that the trial judge erred in refusing the testimony of a defendant who would not take an oath that referred to God. Specifically, Looper had told the trial judge, \u201cI can\u2019t [take the oath] if it has God\u2019s name in it. If you ask me if I\u2019ll tell the truth, I can say that.\u201d The Fourth Circuit concluded that any form or statement that impressed on the mind and conscious of the witness the necessity for telling the truth would suffice as an oath, citing proposed Rule 603. The opinion closed by advising trial judges faced with religious objections to an oath or affirmation \u201cto make inquiry as to what form of oath or affirmation would not offend defendant\u2019s religious beliefs but would give rise to a duty to speak the truth.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b675-14\">In <em>Gordon v. State of Idaho, </em>778 F.2d 1397, 1400 (9th Cir.1985), the Ninth Circuit cited both <em>Moore </em>and <em>Looper </em>in reaching a similar conclusion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(d), a provision parallel to Rule 603. Like Ms. Ferguson, Gordon objected to using either the word \u201cswear\u201d or \u201caffirm\u201d and offered an alternative statement. The Ninth Circuit held that the trial judge abused his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>discretion by refusing to even consider Gordon\u2019s proposed alternative. <em>Id. </em>at 1401.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">The cases cited by the government, <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>605 F.2d 181 (5th Cir.1979), and <em>Kaltenbach v. Breaux, </em>690 F.Supp. 1551 (W.D.La.1988), are not contrary. In both cases, the witnesses completely refused to cooperate. Fowler would not accept even the simple statement, \u201cI state that I will tell the truth in my testimony.\u201d <em>Fowler, </em>605 F.2d at 185. And Kaltenbach\u2019s witness refused the very alternative proposed by Ms. Ferguson, the statement set forth in <em>Staton, </em>486 So.2d at 745. <em>Kaltenbach, </em>690 F.Supp. at 1556.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">The government offers only two justifications for Judge Korner\u2019s refusal to consider the <em>Staton </em>statement. First, the government contends that the Tax Court was not bound by a Louisiana decision. This argument misses the point entirely; Ms. Ferguson offered <em>Staton </em>as an alternative to an oath or affirmation and not as a precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">The government also claims that the <em>Sta-ton </em>statement is insufficient because it does not acknowledge that the government may prosecute false statements for perjury. The federal perjury statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1621, makes the taking of \u201can oath\u201d an element of the crime of perjury. <em>Accord Smith v. United States, </em>363 F.2d 143 (5th Cir.1966). However, Ms. Ferguson has expressed her willingness to add a sentence to the <em>Staton </em>statement acknowledging that she is subject to penalties for perjury. The government has cited a number of cases invalidating perjury convictions where no oath was given, but none of the cases suggest that Ms. Ferguson\u2019s proposal would not suffice as \u201can oath\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1621. <em>See Gordon, </em>778 F.2d at 1401 n. 3 (statement by defendant that he understands he must accurately state the facts combined with acknowledgement that he is testifying under penalty of perjury would satisfy Fed.R.Civ.P. 43(d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">The parties\u2019 briefs to this court suggest that the disagreement between Ms. Ferguson and Judge Korner might have been nothing more than an unfortunate misunderstanding. The relevant portion of their dialogue was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-9\">MS. FERGUS ON: I have religious objections to taking an oath.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-10\">THE COURT: All right. You may affirm. Then in lieu of taking an oath, you may affirm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-11\">MS. FERGUSON: Sir, may I present this to you? I do not\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-12\">THE COURT: Just a minute. The Clerk will ask you.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-13\">THE CLERK: You are going to have to stand up and raise your right hand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-14\">MS. FERGUSON: I do not affirm either. I have with me a certified copy of a case from the Louisiana Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXi\">THE COURT: I don\u2019t care about a case from the Louisiana Supreme Court, Ms. Ferguson. You will either swear or you will affirm under penalties of perjury that the testimony you are about to give is true and correct, to the best of your knowledge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-15\">MS. FERGUSON: In that case, Your Honor, please let the record show that I was willing to go under what has been acceptable by the State of Louisiana Supreme Court, the State versus\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-16\">THE COURT: We are not in the state of Louisiana, Ms. Ferguson. You are in a Federal court and you will do as I have instructed, or you will not testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b676-17\">MS. FERGUSON: Then let the record show that because of my religious objections, I will not be allowed to testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ada\">Ms. Ferguson contends that Judge Korner insisted that she use either the word \u201cswear\u201d or the word \u201caffirm\u201d; the government suggests instead that Judge Korner only required an affirmation which the government defines as \u201can alternative that encompasses all remaining forms of truth assertion that would satisfy [Rule 603].\u201d Even Ms. Ferguson\u2019s proposed alternative would be an \u201caffirmation\u201d under the government\u2019s definition.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-18\">If Judge Korner had attempted to accommodate Ms. Ferguson by inquiring into her objections and considering her proposed alternative, the entire matter might have been resolved without an appeal to this court. Instead, however, Judge Korner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>erred not only in evaluating Ms. Ferguson\u2019s religious belief, and concluding that it did not violate any \u201crecognizable religious scruple,\u201d but also in conditioning her right to testify and present evidence on what she perceived as a violation of that belief. His error is. all the more apparent in light of the fact that Ms. Ferguson was proceeding pro se at the hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">We therefore REVERSE the decision of the Tax Court and REMAND this case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
