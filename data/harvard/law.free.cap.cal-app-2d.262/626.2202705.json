J.</author>\n<p id=\"AEa\">This is an appeal following a jury trial from a judgment of conviction of burglary which the jury found to be of the first degree. The grounds of appeal are: (1) prejudicial error was committed in admitting in evidence two pieces of paraffin and testimony respecting a screwdriver allegedly products of an illegal search and seizure ; (2) the evidence in support of the conviction was insubstantial ; (3) the court refused appellant\u2019s prepared jury instruction that if a burglary had been committed it could only be of the second degree; and (4) the court, in giving an instruction based on CALJIC 235, improperly commented on appellant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional privilege against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>compulsory self-incriminatiou. Only the last mentioned ground has merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">At about 10:15 p.m. on April 27, 1966, Mrs. Marguerite Sadler returned to her second-floor apartment in the Hollywood area of Los Angeles. She was surprised to find the door of her apartment open and some lights on inside.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> She entered, inquired nervously as to who was there and what he wanted and then stepped a little further into the living room to see down the inner hall. She saw appellant, a stranger to her, standing in the doorway to her dressing room. She asked him what he was doing there and he replied that he was looking for the apartment house manager. Appellant left the apartment immediately. Mrs. Sadler followed him out and saw him go into the manager\u2019s apartment which was on the other side of the building on the first floor. She immediately called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-6\">The police arrived about 10:30 p.m. and after Mrs. Sadler had told them what had happened they went to the manager\u2019s apartment. They knocked on the door, rattled it, asked that it be opened and finally two of them went around to the side of the apartment where one of them removed a screen from a living room window and raised the lower part of the window. These two policemen then shined their flashlights through the window and discovered appellant inside. One of them yelled to him to open the door. Appellant opened the door and was thereupon arrested, handcuffed and searched. Two pieces of paraffin wrapped in a portion of a paper bag were found in one of his pants \u2019 pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-7\">Mrs. Sadler was then called down to the manager\u2019s apartment by the police. She identified appellant as the intruder in her apartment and the two pieces of paraffin which bore her handwriting on the paper around them. She testified that the paraffin had been on the sink in her apartment under the kitchen window. The police, accompanied by Mrs. Sadler, took a screwdriver which one of the officers had found in the easy chair in which they had seated appellant in the manager\u2019s apartment and went to Mrs. Sadler\u2019s apartment to examine its front door and lock. They found that the lock of the door had evidently been jimmied and that the screwdriver fitted perfectly the damaged portion of the door jamb. Mrs. Sadler then found that the contents of the dresser drawers in her dressing room had been rumpled and looked like they had been ransacked. The next day Mrs. Sadler discovered that an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>inexpensive pair of binoculars she used to watch birds, as well' as two bottles of shaving cologne her late husband had used, were both missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-6\">Appellant claims that neither the paraffin nor the testimony regarding the screwdriver should have been admitted in evidence because these items were obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure made without probable cause. We do not agree.  The police had probable cause to make a warrantless arrest of appellant for burglary on the basis of what Mrs. Sadler had told them and appellant\u2019s failure to come to the door of the manager\u2019s apartment until his presence, in the dark, was discovered by the police. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 836, subd. 3); <em>People </em>v. <em>Talley, </em>65 Cal.2d 830, 835-837 [56 Cal.Rptr. 492, 423 P.2d 564]<em>; People </em>v. <em>Lewis, </em>240 Cal.App.2d 546, 549-551 [49 Cal.Rptr. 579].)  A search of the person of an arrestee and of the immediate premises upon which he is arrested is a lawful search. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Ruiz, </em>196 Cal.App.2d 695, 701 [16 Cal.Rptr. 855], cert. den. 370 U.S. 954 [8 L.Ed.2d 819, 82 S.Ct. 1604].)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-8\">Appellant next contends that the evidence in support of his conviction of burglary was insubstantial. Among other things, burglary is the entry of any apartment with the intent to commit grand or petit larceny. (Pen. Code, \u00a7 459.) Without repeating all the relevant evidence summarized above, we note that appellant was found in Mrs. Sadler's apartment which had been left locked. The' drawers of Mrs. Sadler\u2019s dresser had been ransacked and appellant was first seen in the doorway of the' dressing room; two pieces of paraffin from the apartment were found on appellant\u2019s person at the time of his arrest. The evidence in support of appellant\u2019s conviction of burglary was substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">With respect to the instructions, appellant\u2019s first claim is without merit. He contends that the jury should have been instructed, as requested by defense counsel, that if he committed any burglary at all it had to be of the second degree. But it was sufficiently established that the burglary of Mrs. Sadler\u2019s apartment occurred in the nighttime and any such\u2019 burglary is expressly one of first degree. (Pen. Code, \u00a7460.)</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Appellant\u2019s second objection to the instructions presents more difficulty. The trial court gave a modified versi\u00f3n of CALJIC 235 reading as follows: \u201cThe mere fact.that a\", person was'in possession of stolen\".property-soon' after it was' taken is not enough to justify his. conviction of theft. It is, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>however, a circumstance to be considered in connection with other evidence. To warrant a finding of guilty there must be proof of other circumstances tending of themselves to establish guilt. [If a defendant has a reasonable opportunity to show that his possession of stolen property was honestly acquired but refuses or fails to do so, this is a circumstance that tends to show his guilt.]\u201d Defense counsel strenuously and repeatedly objected to the last sentence of this instruction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-5\">In including this sentence the trial court relied upon <em>People </em>v. <em>De Leon, </em>236 Cal.App.2d 530, 533-534, 539-540 [46 Cal.Rptr. 241], which held that the sentence did not violate the rule announced in <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, </em>380 U.S. 609 [14 L.Ed.2d 106, 85 S.Ct. 1229]. However in <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore, </em>239 Cal.App.2d 70, 72-74 [48 Cal.Rptr. 475], the exact contrary was held without reference to the prior <em>Be Leon </em>holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-6\">The Attorney General argues that the <em>Be Leon </em>interpretation of the effect of <em>Griffin </em>upon this instruction is the correct one because at least three different federal Courts of Appeals have upheld, since <em>Griffin, </em>an analogous instruction in federal narcotics cases.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b652-7\">These federal eases have chosen to rely upon <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gainey, </em>380 U.S. 63 [13 L.Ed.2d 658, 85 S.Ct. 754] decided some two months prior to <em>Griffin. </em>In <em>Gainey </em>the United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of a federal statute making the <em>unexplained </em>presence of the defendant at the site of an illegal still sufficient evidence of his guilt of carrying on the enterprise of illegal distillation. The court stated that it did not consider that the single phrase in the instructions \u201c \u2018unless the defendant by the evidence in the case and by proven facts and circumstances explains such presence to the satisfaction of the jury\u2019 \u201d could be fairly understood as a comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify although the better practice would have been to eliminate any direct reference to the defendant\u2019s failure to explain, (see 380 U.S. at pp. 70-71, 13 L.Ed.2d at p. 664, fn. 7.) It further noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>that \u201cthe judge\u2019s overall reference was carefully directed to <em>the evidence as a whole, </em>with neither allusion nor innuendo based on the defendant\u2019s decision not to take the stand.\u201d (Italics added.) (380 U.S. at p. 71, 13 L.Ed.2d at pp. 664-665.) The unanimous position of these federal courts would seem to be based essentially upon the circumstance that the federal narcotics statutes involved in these cases parallel the federal liquor statute in <em>Gainey </em>in making the <em>unexplained </em>possession of the illegal narcotic by the defendant sufficient evidence of his guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">Likewise in reliance upon <em>Gainey, De Leon </em>took the view that the sentence under attack is not a comment upon the defendant\u2019s failure to testify since the defendant may show that his possession of the stolen property was honestly acquired by means other than his own testimony, such as the testimony of the person from whom he received it, or by other explanatory evidence. The word \u201cshow\u201d in our instruction was likened to the word \u201cexplain\u201d in the charge approved in <em>Gainey. </em>(236 Cal.App.2d at pp. 533-534.) But <em>Moore </em>expressly refused to follow <em>Gainey </em>as inapplicable to its facts. (239 Cal.App.2d at pp. 72-73.)</p>\n<p id=\"b653-7\">On the basis of <em>Moore </em>and the rationale of <em>People </em>v. <em>Cockrell, </em>63 Cal.2d 659, 669-670 [47 Cal.Rptr. 788, 408 P.2d 116], the CALJIC Committee of the Superior Court of Los Angeles County has revised CALJIC Nos. 203 and 235 by deleting the sentence under attack. (CALJIC 1967 Cumulative Pocket Part, pp. 91, 102.) We believe that in so doing the committee interpreted <em>Griffin </em>correctly and that the direction to the jury in the sentence involved constitutes an <em>indirect </em>and proscribed comment on a defendant\u2019s exercise of his constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. The sentence violates this privilege by improperly drawing attention both to the defendant\u2019s failure to take the stand and to the absence of any explanation by defendant outside of the courtroom and in each situation suggests to the jury that it may take the defendant\u2019s silence as a circumstance tending to show guilt. <em>Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>and <em>People </em>v. <em>Moore, supra, </em>proscribe the former and <em>People v. Cockrell, supra, </em>proscribes the latter.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>It is true that, on its facts, <em>Griffin </em>prohibits only <em>direct </em>comment focused upon a defendant\u2019s failure to testify and, as suggested in part in <em>De Leon, </em>a defendant may show his honest acquisition of stolen property by means other than.his own words, whether they be offered in or out of the courtroom. But in reality, we believe that upon hearing the sentence in question the attention of the average juror will be drawn thereby to the defendant\u2019s silence upon this point, both in and out of the courtroom, and the juror will conclude that he has been directed to consider such silence as a circumstance tending to show the defendant\u2019s guilt. Solemnizing in an instruction by the court what the jurors may nevertheless consider spontaneously penalizes a defendant\u2019s exercise of his privilege against compulsory self-incrimination and is therefore prohibited. <em>(Griffin </em>v. <em>California, supra, </em>380 U.S. 609, 614-615, 14 L.Ed.2d 106, 109-110; <em>People </em>v. <em>Cockrell, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d 659, 669-670.)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b654-5\">Under <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>California, </em>368 U.S. 18, 24 [17 L.Ed.2d 705, 710-711, 87 S.Ct. 824], we must reverse because of this federal constitutional error unless we conclude that the People have proven to us beyond a reasonable doubt that this error did not contribute to the verdict against appellant. It is contended that the trial court\u2019s instruction to the jury \u201cthat appellant had the constitutional right not to take the stand\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> alleviated any prejudicial effect of the improper comment. To the contrary, since the trial court failed to instruct the jury that it must neither consider nor draw any inference of appellant\u2019s guilt from his exercise of his consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"633\">*633</page-number>tutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the instruction merely drew further attention to appellant\u2019s exercise of this privilege and, coupled with the prior, improper comment, further invited the jury to draw an adverse inference from appellant\u2019s conduct in this respect. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Molano, </em>253 Cal.App.2d 841, 846-847 [61 Cal.Rptr. 821, 18 A.L.R.3d 1328], hear den.; <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>253 <em>Cal.</em>App.2d 820, 830 [61 Cal.Rptr. 368]; hear. den.; People v. <em>Mason, </em>259 Cal.App.2d 30, 39-41 [66 Cal.Rptr. 601], hear. den.
