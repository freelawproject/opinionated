Code, \u00a7 245) by a court, sitting without a jury. Sentenced to state prison, he appeals from the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-10\">Appellant\u2019s Contentions</p>\n<p id=\"b813-11\">The crux of the defendant\u2019s contentions of error is that by erroneous exclusion of relevant evidence, the trial court thwarted his counsel\u2019s attempt to put on an adequate defense. The theory of the defense was that defendant was warding off a homosexual advance by the alleged victim and prosecution witness, Leon Frieke, and that the gun was accidentally discharged by Frieke\u2019s grabbing it. The line of questioning stopped by the trial court consisted of attempts to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>elicit testimony from a defense witness.that Fricke was an aggressive homosexual as relevant to a claim of acting in self-defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">The Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">Leon Fricke, the prosecuting witness, testified to the following : He lived in Altadena and worked as a barber at People\u2019s Barber Shop, located at 2279 North Lake in Altadena. He was married and the father of three children. On the evening in question, August 23, 1966, he had not been drinking. Shortly after midnight, he drove down to a pizza parlor located next door to and approximately 15 feet away from the Honey Bunny nightclub on Woodbury Road in Altadena. He went for the purpose of getting some pizza. He parked his car in a gas station located across the street from the pizza parlor. He crossed the street and found the pizza parlor closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-7\">At the time, four men were standing in front of the Honey Bunny club. They approached him. Defendant Rowland asked which way Fricke was going. Fricke replied, \u201cToward Fair Oaks.\u201d Rowland then asked for a ride. After walking across the street and getting into Fricke\u2019s car, the two drove off towards Fair Oaks.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-8\">When they reached the corner of Fair Oaks and Woodbury, Fricke told Rowland that that was as far as he was going, that he was going home. Rowland wanted Fricke to take him downtown towards Washington Boulevard. When Fricke refused, Rowland became upset, pulled a gun from his belt, and said, \u201cNow, you are going to take me downtown.\u201d Fricke refused and pulled his car into a service station located on the northeast corner of Woodbury and Fair Oaks. \u201c[T]hat is when he [defendant] shot me, in front of the service station.\u201d A bullet passed through Fricke\u2019s right calf. At the time of the shooting, defendant told Fricke, \u201cI told you so.\u201d \u201cIt was because I [Fricke] didn\u2019t take him downtown.\u201d Fricke was not armed. He did not hit the defendant. He denied upon cross-examination that he had ever propositioned Rowland during the ride or that he had put his hand on Rowland\u2019s leg.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-9\">According to Fricke, defendant jumped out of the car following the shooting, ran about 50 feet, and fired another shot. This shot did not hit Fricke. The defendant ran easterly down Woodbury. Fricke identified a gun as looking like the weapon with which he had been shot.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">By stipulation of counsel, a transcript of the testimony of an absent witness, Raymond Johnson, given at the prelimi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>nary hearing was received into evidence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Johnson had testified that he was employed at Bill\u2019s Self-Service gasoline station at the corner of Woodbury and Fair Oaks around midnight on August 23, 1966. He first saw Fricke in a car. Then he saw another person leave the vehicle and \u201chead\" easterly. He heard a loud explosion which he assumed to be a firecracker. He did not hear any such explosion while the two persons were still in the vehicle. He was not sure of the identity of the person who exited from the car, but the defendant appeared similar to such person. He saw the defendant Rowland in a police car within 10 to 15 minutes after the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Bonn Berrier was called as the People\u2019s next witness and he testified: He was on duty the night of August 23, 1966 as a deputy sheriff of Los Angeles County. He first noted Fricke, when Fricke whistled and waved to the patrol car in which Berrier was riding. Fricke was at Bill\u2019s service station, 2186 North Fair Oaks. He observed that Fricke had a \u201chole\" about 4 inches below his right knee, which was bleeding, and another \u201chole\" above his ankle bone on the inside portion of the leg. He called for another sheriff\u2019s unit for assistance, obtained a description of his assailant from Fricke, and then went in search of the person described.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\">About 12:20 or 12:30 a.m., he spotted the defendant walking south on Summit Avenue. Defendant then appeared to observe Berrier and his partner officer, started running, and later turned into 2121 North Summit Avenue and ran up the driveway. Shortly thereafter, defendant was found hiding in the ivy on the north side of the premises. The gun introduced into evidence was found in an adjacent vacant lot about 20 feet north of where defendant was hiding. Berrier was able to see live ammunition and an empty shell which had been fired in the gun. The gun and \u201cbullets\" were turned over to the detectives assigned to the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-8\">After Berrier had advised defendant of his constitutional rights, defendant denied the shooting. \u201cHe denied any shooting . . . He denied the gun. He . . . told us that a colored fellow had picked him up at Washington and Fair Oaks, and traveled a short ways and proceeded to hit him in and about his head and that is the last thing he remembered until we got <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>him.\u201d Berrier was unable to see any signs of injury on the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-5\">Defendant testified: He had just come out from the Honey Bunny nightclub and was waiting for a ride. He wanted to get down to Washington and Pair Oaks. Frieke asked him if he wanted a ride. Defendant replied, \u201cyes,\u201d indicating that he intended going down Fair Oaks towards Washington Boulevard.</p>\n<p id=\"b816-6\">As they drove down Woodbury and approached Fair Oaks, Frieke was driving in the lane to the right. Defendant told Frieke to get over to the center lane to turn down Fair Oaks. Frieke pinched the inside of defendant\u2019s thigh about halfway between the knee and the hip, and then said, \u201c \u2018Oh, let\u2019s ride a little bit,\u2019 just like that, and I didn\u2019t say anything to him. When we got to the lights, I said, \u2018Wait a minute. Just let me out,\u2019 just like that. We had completely stopped . . . He played like he didn\u2019t hear me, so I pulled the gun out, and the only reason that he got shot is because he grabbed the gun. He grabbed it with one hand and he was driving with the other hand, and he went up in the gas station and the gun went off. He didn\u2019t know he was shot. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b816-7\">The defendant did not intend to shoot Frieke or to harm him. Asked, \u201cWhat was your intention when you pulled the gun?\u201d, defendant replied, \u201cJust let me out of the car, nothing else. I didn\u2019t know what he was going to do.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b816-8\">Defendant got out of the car and started running. He stumbled and the gun went off accidentally again. He didn\u2019t know that the car following him was a police ear, but he was running, threw the gun away, and went behind some bushes to hide. He admitted on cross-examination that he had-not been truthful with the officers because they had not advised him of his right to remain silent, \u201calmost snapped [his] head out of the car,\u201d grabbed him by the hair of his head, and were \u2018 \u2018 trying to trick him. \u2019 \u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b816-9\">The defense then called a Carl Petway as a witness. He testified that he was the manager of the Honey Bunny nightclub on East Woodbury in Altadena and vaguely recalled having seen Frieke once or twice in the club, remembering just his face. Then the following transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-10\">1 \u2018 [Defense Counsel] : Did you observe his actions at the time that he was in your bar ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-11\">\u2018 \u2018 [Prosecutor] : That is objected to upon the ground that it would be immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b816-12\">\u2018 \u2018 The Court : Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\u20181 [Defense Counsel] : Do you know Mr. Pricke\u2019s reputation in the area of that bar as to whether or not he is a homosexual or appears to be one ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-6\">11 [Prosecutor] : That is objected to upon the ground that he is not competent to so testify.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-7\">1 \u2018 The Court : Sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-8\">\u201c [Defense Counsel] : Did you observe Mr.\u2014this may have been objected to\u2014Did you observe Mr. Pricke's actions and appearance on the times that he was in the bar, as far as whether or not he approached other males in the bar ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-9\">\u20181 [Prosecutor] : That is objected to upon the ground that it is immaterial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-10\">\u201c [Defense Counsel] : It is for the purpose of showing, your Honor, this witness\u2019 knowledge of the appearance of the victim as to whether or not he appeared to be a homosexual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-11\">\u201c [Prosecutor] : I don\u2019t know how you can tell by appearance.

That would be the only testimony that we might have as to the attitude or appearance of Mr. Pricke.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-21\">\u201cThe Court: Having been evicted from a bar, what does that have to do with whether he is a homosexual or not ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-22\">II [Defense Counsel] : I think the reasons for the eviction might have some value.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-23\">\u201cThe Court: You might think the reasons are, but I can\u2019t assume those reasons or that it even happened. Objection sustained.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b817-24\">\u201c [Defense Counsel] : Nothing further, your Honor. \u2019 \u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b817-25\">The People\u2019s counsel did not cross-examine and the defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>rested its ease in chief. No rebuttal or sur-rebuttal evidence was offered. The clerk\u2019s transcript also reflects that on October 31, 1966 (almost three months before the trial on January-26, 1967), the court upon defendant\u2019s motion ordered the sheriff to deliver a \u201cmake sheet\u201d on the victim Frieke to defense counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Evidence Regarding Homosexuality Improperly Excluded</p>\n<p id=\"b818-6\">We have a situation where the testimony of the only persons who are percipient witnesses to the happenings in the vehicle is in direct conflict as to the cause of the differences between them. Their credibility is therefore a critical issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">Whether or not Frieke was a homosexual, particularly an aggressive one, bears not only on establishing defendant\u2019s claim of self-defense but also on his credibility. We do not say that a person\u2019s being a homosexual per se makes his testimony suspect. For such purpose, the evidence would have been inadmissible. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 786.)  However, homosexuality or a homosexual relationship is admissible when it goes to prove bias, interest, or motive of a witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 780, subd. (f); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dukes </em>(1966) 241 Cal.App.2d 488, 492-493 [50 Cal.Rptr. 609]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Mullen </em>(1953) 115 Cal.App.2d 340, 342 [252 P.2d 19].)  If Frieke was a homosexual and if he was trying to pickup a male partner, there would be a strong motive or interest to camouflage his deviate personality disorder and possibly a criminal act (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subds. (a), (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dudley </em>(1967) 250 Cal.App.2d Supp. 955 [58 Cal.Rptr. 557]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Belanger </em>(1966) 243 Cal.App.2d 654, 658 [52 Cal.Rptr. 660]) by giving testimony which would remove a possible complaining witness by causing the witness to be first convicted and incarcerated.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-9\">On the other hand, if the defendant were able to establish through the witness Petway either by way of his opinion or knowledge of Frieke\u2019s reputation that Frieke was a homosexual and by way of specific instances to prove that Frieke solicited other males in the bar and that it was necessary to evict him because of his solicitations or engaging in homosexual promiscuity (Pen. Code, \u00a7 647, subds. (a), (b); <em>People </em>v. <em>Dudley </em>(1967) <em>supra), </em>then the evidence would tend to prove that defendant was not making up a story out of whole cloth. Greater credence could then be given to defendant\u2019s testimony that Frieke was pinching the inside of defendant\u2019s thigh and soliciting him for homosexual purposes and that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>was Fricke\u2019s grabbing of the gun which caused it to discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b819-6\">Apart from the issue of defendant\u2019s credibility, such evidence would bear more directly upon establishing that Fricke was engaged in aggressive homosexual conduct at the time the gun discharged. Section 1103 of the Evidence Code provides in part which is pertinent to this ease: \u201cIna criminal action, evidence of the character or a trait of character (in the form of an opinion, evidence of reputation, or evidence of specific instances of conduct) of the victim of the crime for which the defendant is being prosecuted is not made inadmissible by Section 1101<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> if such evidence is: (a) Offered by the defendant to prove conduct of the victim in conformity with such character or trait of character ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b819-7\">It has long been recognized that where self-defense is raised in a homicide case, evidence of the aggressive and violent character of the victim is admissible. Before the Evidence Code, the character trait could be shown by reputation evidence, but not by evidence of specific acts of the victim on third persons. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Davis </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 648, 656 [47 Cal.Rptr. 801, 408 P.2d 129]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Yokum </em>(1956) 145 Cal.App.2d 245, 259 [302 P.2d 406].) It is now permissible under section 1103 of the Evidence Code to prove the aggressive and violent character by specific acts of the victim on third persons. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Smith </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 395, 404-405 [57 Cal.Rptr. 508].)</p>\n<p id=\"b819-8\">Here the evidence of character was sought to establish that Fricke was of an aggressive homosexual character and from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>that fact to infer that he was making an aggressive homosexual advance towards defendant, which defendant had to ward off. Establishment of this fact is also interrelated with proving the credibility of defendant as a witness. (Evid. Code, \u00a7 780, subd. (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-5\">Although trial defense counsel\u2019s offer of proof is no paragon, there is enough in the record to show that he did make known to the court what he sought to prove by the witness Petway. In <em>People </em>v. <em>McGee </em>(1947) 31 Cal.2d 229, 242 [187 P.2d 706], the court stated: \u201cDefendant made no formal offer of proof, but such offer was not necessary because the questions themselves, together with colloquies with the trial judge, in the light of previously introduced testimony, clearly disclose their purpose, and since they were directed to defendant\u2019s own witness they indicate that the answers were expected to be favorable to defendant.\u201d (See also Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966), p. 1212.) The trial court sustained in most instances objections made upon untenable grounds. It is true that the trial court could not assume the happenings which defense counsel sought to adduce or the reasons for them. But it was prejudicial error to prevent defense counsel from proving those matters by the testimony which he sought to elicit from his witness Petway.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-6\">Exclusion of evidence bearing on the credibility of a prosecution witness where only he and the defendant are percipient witnesses has been held to be prejudicial error. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Mizer </em>(1961) 195 Cal.App.2d 261 [15 Cal.Rptr. 272].) There exists here also \u20181 at least such an equal balance of reasonable probabilities as to leave the court in serious doubt as to whether the error has affected the result. But the fact that there exists at least such an equal balance of reasonable probabilities necessarily means that the court is of the opinion \u2018that it is reasonably probable that a result more favorable to the appealing party would have been reached in the absence of the error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 837 [299 P.2d 243].)</p>\n<p id=\"b820-7\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b820-8\">Kaus, P.
