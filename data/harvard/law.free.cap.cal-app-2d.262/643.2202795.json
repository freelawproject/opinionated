The action was commenced on March 11, 1963, in the names of respondent and the child (who was then unborn) as plaintiffs. Respondent appeared under her given name and the decedent\u2019s surname, which she bore as his widow. The child was born on May 14, 1963, and thereafter appeared, as a co-plaintiff with respondent, under his own name. Appellant admitted liability in the pleadings, 11 conditioned upon proof\u201d that the child was decedent\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-4\">Answering appellant\u2019s interrogatories in 1965, respondent disclosed among other things (1) that she had remarried on June 30, 1964, and (2) that she had become pregnant with the child in August 1962, four months before she married the decedent. At a conference held in chambers immediately before the trial commenced in 1966, respondent\u2019s counsel asked the trial court to exclude evidence of either fact, and to prohibit any mention of either, at the trial. Appellant\u2019s counsel, rejoining in part, formally moved for an order that respondent be required to amend her complaint to show her appearing as a plaintiff under her remarried surname.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In a written declaration filed in support of the motion, appellant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>both alleged and offered to prove the fact of respondent\u2019s remarriage, its date, and other related facts.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b669-4\">The trial court denied appellant\u2019s motion. Ruling on respondent\u2019s request, the court ordered that evidence of her remarriage would be inadmissible and directed the attorneys and the parties, under pain of a mistrial being ordered, \u201cnot to indicate directly or indirectly the remarriage or to refer to the widow by her [re]married name.\u201d The court expressly reserved its proscription as to such matters in question which might arise by way of impeachment. The trial judge also specified that prospective jurors could be asked on <em>voir dire </em>whether any of them knew respondent\u2019s husband, but made it clear that he was to be identified by his name only and not as her husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Respondent\u2019s counsel then requested that evidence of the date of the child\u2019s birth be excluded, because of possible prejudice to respondent from the obvious import that she had been premaritally pregnant. Counsel pointed out that the paternity of the child had been adjudicated without reference to the date of its birth (see fn. <em>2, supra), </em>and that the only relevant life expectancy in the action was the father\u2019s. not the child\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">Appellant\u2019s counsel argued that evidence of premarital pregnancy was a relevant factor in assessing the predictable stability of the parents\u2019 subsequent marriage, and that such assessment\u2014of whether the marriage would have \u201clasted,\u201d had the decedent lived\u2014was in turn relevant on the issue of damages in a wrongful death action by a surviving spouse. The court ruled that the child\u2019s age could be shown as \u201ctwo years, \u2019 \u2019 but that the date of its birth would not be permitted in evidence. Whether the \u201cstability\u201d of respondent\u2019s marriage to the decedent was \u201ca proper question to be before the jury,\u201d was discussed briefly, but no definitive ruling on the point was requested and none was made at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">At the trial which followed, appellant\u2019s counsel meticulously complied with the trial court\u2019s ruling as to evidence of respondent\u2019s remarriage. On <em>voir dire, </em>the court and counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>interrogated some prospective jurors as to whether they knew respondent\u2019s present husband or his parents (referring to all of them by name alone) and asked some general questions concerning his military organization and station, but respondent was not associated with the persons or places named; no evidence was offered concerning the fact of remarriage; and the remarriage, as such, was not mentioned and did not reach the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-3\">Concerning her marital situation with the decedent, respondent testified as follows: They were married on December 15, 1962. She was then 19 years of age, the decedent was 20. They had met in June 1962. They were married in a Catholic church in Petaluma. Respondent was a member of the Catholic faith, the decedent was an Episcopalian. Both Avere then residents of Marin County. Despite minor arguments, their marriage was happy.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-4\">On cross-examination of respondent, the trial court sustained objections to appellant\u2019s questions directed to the date upon which respondent and the decedent had become engaged to marry, and to her acquaintance with his parents. The jury did learn of her premarital pregnancy, after respondent brought about the disclosure in her own testimony.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The premarital pregnancy was not otherwise mentioned in the evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>dence, and appellant\u2019s counsel did not refer to it in his argument to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-4\">At another conference in chambers held upon the conclusion of respondent\u2019s testimony, her counsel requested an offer of proof as an indication of appellant\u2019s intent relative to the fact of her premarital pregnancy. Appellant\u2019s counsel stated that he would show through an expert witness \u201cthat there are certain factors known to research indicating instability in marriage, and . . . [the expert] . . . will tell what those factors are, and one of them will be premarital pregnancy.\u201d Respondent\u2019s counsel indicated his objection to such evidence. Stating that it would be admissible, the court in effect overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Upon resumption of the trial, the defense called and qualified Dr. Judson T. Landis, a professional sociologist, as an expert witness. Dr. Landis, answering a hypothetical question, testified that the facts in evidence concerning respondent\u2019s marriage to the decdent were \u201cpredictive\u201d of its failure.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This opinion, according to the witness, was based upon his education, studies and experience with \u201cwhat the factors are that are predictive of whether a marriage will last or whether it will not last.\u201d Pie testified that \u201cfactors that lead to instability in marriages\u201d included youthful spouses, their short acquaintance and short engagement prior to marriage, the fact of the parties\u2019 premarital sexual relations or premarital pregnancy, disparity of religious faiths (\u201cespeeally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>the Catholie-Protestant type of marriage\u201d), the stability of the marriages of the parties\u2019 parents, a combination of such factors, and the statistical facts that, whereas the national rate of marriage failure was \u20181 probably 25 divorces and annulments per 100 marriages for the United States as a whole,\u201d the rate was 50 per 100 in California and 70 per 100 in Marin County.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-3\">At respondent\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury that it was not to consider the subject of remarriage in its deliberations. The court refused to give a series of instructions, proposed by appellant, which were generally related to the same subject but were explicitly addressed to the issue of damages. The substance of these instructions is hereinafter discussed.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-4\">The jury returned a verdict for respondents in the amount of $145,000. Appellant\u2019s motion for new trial was denied. On the appeal, it is contended that the trial court erred (we here quote appellant in part) : (1) in ruling evidence of respondent\u2019s \u20181 quick remarriage\u201d inadmissable; (2) in refusing to require respondent to amend her complaint to show her remarried surname; (3) \u201cin ruling out any mention of . . . [the name] . . . during the trial even to test her credibility in being sworn in otherwise, and in the <em>voir dire </em>examination of the prospective jurors\u201d; (4) in giving and refusing the instructions mentioned; and (5) in \u201cunduly restricting cross-examination on premarital pregnancy and other factors relevantly predictive of instability in the marriage.\u201d These contentions cannot be sustained; we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-5\">Appellant\u2019s first contention rests upon the asserted premise that, in a wrongful death action by a surviving spouse, evidence of the plaintiff\u2019s remarriage should be admitted for consideration by the trier of fact in mitigation of damages. Such evidence is inadmissible, however, under the rule followed in California <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean </em>(1967) 249 Cal.App.2d 345, 355-356 [57 Cal.Rptr. 394]; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Alves Service Transp., Inc. </em>(1961) 191 Cal.App.2d 723, 727-729 [13 Cal.Rptr. 114] [hearing denied]; <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co. </em>(1941) 43 Cal.App.2d 339, 346-347 [110 P.2d 1062] [hearing-denied] ), and in the majority of American jurisdictions. <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra; </em>Annotation, 87 A.L.R.2d 252, 253, 255, 260-263.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>Appellant attempts to distinguish \u2018 \u2018 the pertinent cases\u201d upon the ground that the evidence excluded in each of them involved the speculative \u201cpossibility\u201d of remarriage by a surviving spouse<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> whereas in the present case respondent\u2019s remarriage had admittedly occurred in fact. Two of the decisions cited above dealt only with the \u201cpossibility\u201d (or \u201cprobability\u201d or \u201ccontemplation\u201d) of remarriage by a widowed plaintiff. <em>(Wood </em>v. <em>Alves Service Transp., Inc., supra, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 723 at pp. 726, 727; <em>Gallo </em>v. <em>Southern Pac. Co., supra, </em>43 Cal.App.2d 339 at pp. 340, 346.) But in the most recent decision cited (which appeared in the reports after the present case had been briefed), the exclusionary rule was held to have been properly applied where the plaintiff had apparently remarried in fact. <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 345 at p. 355 [\u201cDefendant was denied the right to cross-examine plaintiff as to whether she had remarried and as to her new married name. \u201d ].)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-4\">Virtually all the authorities refer to the exclusionary rule as applying to evidence of the fact \u201cor\u201d the possibility of a widowed plaintiff's remarriage. (E.g., <em>Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 345 at pp. 355, 356; 87 A.L.R.2d, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 252 [title of annotation], 253 [text, \u00a7 2, at fns. 8 and 9], 255 [\u00a7 4, subd. (a)], 260 [\u00a7 5]). See comparative discussion in <em>Reynolds </em>v. <em>Willis </em>(Del. 1965) 209 A.2d 760, 762-763.) A principal reason for the rule is the speculative nature of such evidence as proof in mitigation of damages <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra, </em>at pp. 355-356) : and evidence of actual remarriage eliminates speculation only as to the event itself, not as to its mitigating consequences. Another reason for the rule is the prospect of undue profit to the defendant <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra, </em>at p. 356), which exists whether the plaintiff\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>remarriage is a fact or a possibility. We conclude that appellant\u2019s attempted distinction fails, and that the exclusionary rule applies in a wrongful death action whether or not the plaintiff has remarried in fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-3\">Appellant further contends that the evidence of respondent\u2019s remarriage was admissible by legislative mandate, as assertedly expressed in the language of Code of Civil Procedure section 377 (applicable to wrongful death actions and damages therein)<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and of Civil Code section 3359 (relative to damages generally).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The exclusionary rule under attack, however, is an application of the broader doctrine that evidence of conditions occurring after a wrongful death is inadmissible on the issue of damages because the latter are to be determined only by conditions which existed at the time the death occurred. <em>(Benwell </em>v. <em>Dean, supra, </em>249 Cal.App.2d 345 at pp. 355-356; <em>Wood </em>v. <em>Alves Service Transp., Inc., supra, </em>191 Cal.App.2d 723 at p. 728; <em>Cervantes </em>v. <em>Maco Gas Co. </em>(1960) 177 Cal.App.2d 246, 251-252 [2 Cal.Rptr. 75]; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Western Air Express Corp. </em>(1941) 45 Cal.App.2d 614, 622 [114 P.2d 688]; <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>United Railroads </em>(1915) 169 Cal. 494, 495-499 [147 P. 149, Ann.Cas. 1916D 337, L.R.A. 1915E 1205]; 87 A.L.R.2d, <em>supra, </em>at p. 253.) In <em>McLaughlin </em>the Supreme Court, after weighing the broad exclusionary (\u201cAmerican\u201d) rule against the English rule which admits evidence of subsequent conditions, adopted the former upon the stated ground that it was \u201cmore in consonance with justice\u201d than the English rule. (169 Cal. 494 at p. 499.) In both statutes relied upon by appellant (see fns. 8 and 9, <em>supra), </em>the Legislature expressly defined \u201cjustice\u201d as the essential standard of damages, in a wrongful death action and otherwise. We are not persuaded, therefore, that the exclusionary rule is at variance with legislative policy as appellant contends; and we hold that it was properly applied in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">A reference at the trial to the surname respondent bore as remarried, or a reference to her by that name, would obviously have prompted the inference that she had remarried although direct evidence of the fact was inadmissible. Aecord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>ingly, the trial court properly refused to require amendment of her complaint to show her \u201ctrue\u201d name as remarried.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-4\">Arguing to the contrary, appellant relies upon sections 426<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and 473<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> of the Code of Civil Procedure. But section 426 was complied with: respondent\u2019s complaint showed a name. Appellant cites no authority for an inflexible requirement that a pleading by a married woman identify her by her husband\u2019s surname, and we are aware of none. Section 473 authorizes a trial court to allow a party to amend his or her own pleadings, but we do not read it as requiring a compulsory amendment moved by an opposing party. In any event, the allowance of amendments under section 473 rests in a trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>(Landis </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1965) 232 Cal.App.2d 548, 554 [42 Cal.Rptr. 893]; <em>Duffey </em>v. <em>General Petroleum Corp. </em>(1949) 93 Cal.App.2d 757, 759 [209 P.2d 986].) Under the circumstances of the present ease, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying appellant\u2019s motion to require respondent to amend her complaint relative to her name.</p>\n<p id=\"b675-5\">By the same reasoning, and also within its discretion, the trial court properly prohibited any reference to respondent\u2019s remarried name at the trial, or any questioning directed to her on the subject of her name. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a71868. See Evid. Code, \u00a7352.) In short, the rule excluding evidence of respondent\u2019s marriage either applied or it did not. Since it did apply, as we have held, respondent was entitled to its full benefit. The trial court\u2019s actions concerning references to her name were therefore correct.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b675-6\">At respondent\u2019s request, the trial court instructed the jury not to consider the subject of remarriage by a surviving spouse in its deliberations.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The instruction was wholly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>sistent with the previous\u2014and, as we have seen, correct\u2014 exclusion of evidence of her remarriage as an accomplished fact; and, absent such evidence the instruction precluded jury-speculation as to the theoretical possibility that respondent had remarried or would remarry in the future. The instruction was properly given.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-3\">The first instruction proposed by appellant (No. 12) and refused by the trial court would have told the jury that, if it found \"that the surviving widow has voluntarily made personal adjustments in her life which tend to lessen the degree and extent of her alleged loss,\u201d such could properly be considered in mitigation of damages. The second (Nos. 16 and 16-A offered in the alternative) would have instructed the jury in effect that damages must be reasonable and\u2014citing and quoting Civil Code section 3359\u2014not \"unconscionable and grossly oppressive.\u201d The third (No. 13) spoke to the element of \"pecuniary loss\u201d as damages, in connection with loss of the decedent\u2019s society.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-4\">Appellant\u2019s proposed instruction No. 12 would unmistakably have suggested to the jury the fact of respondent\u2019s remarriage. Since the trial court had correctly excluded evidence of the fact and there was no proof of other \"voluntary adjustments in her life,\u201d the instruction was not supported by the evidence.  The subject matter of appellant\u2019s proposed instructions Nos. 16, 16-A and 13 was adequately and correctly covered in other instructions given by the trial court. Refusal of all three proposed instructions, therefore, was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-5\">Appellant further complains that the trial court unduly restricted cross-examination on \"premarital pregnancy and other factors relevantly predictive of instability in the marriage\u201d (of respondent to the decedent). To the extent that it challenges the court\u2019s pretrial ruling which prohibited reference to the pregnancy, this contention is untenable: the fact was not relevant when the ruling was made. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1868. See Evid. Code, \u00a7 352.)</p>\n<p id=\"b676-6\">Appellant now cites the relevance of the premarital pregnancy as derived from the subsequent testimony by Dr. Landis to the effect that the premarital pregnancy and \"other factors\u201d were \"predictive of failure\u201d of the marriage. But after the fact of the pregnancy had fortuitously emerged in respondent\u2019s testimony under proper rulings by the trial court, appellant abruptly terminated the interrogation (see fn. 4, <em>supra), </em>and respondent was not thereafter recalled for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>any purpose. Cross-examination concerning the pregnancy at any point was restricted by choice, not by any ruling of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-4\">As to any \u201cother factor\u201d pertaining to the instability of the marriage, the only restriction of cross-examination by the trial court occurred when the judge sustained respondent\u2019s objections to questions directed to (1) her acquaintance with the decedent\u2019s parents, and (2) the duration of her engagement. The ruling was correct at the time because neither subject became relevant, if at all, until Dr. Landis testified later. After that, questions concerning the decedent\u2019s parents or respondent\u2019s engagement would have conceivably been relevant only as they might have led to establishment of the \u201cinstability\u201d of a prior-generation marriage, or of a short engagement before respondent\u2019s, as \u201cpredictive of instability\u201d in the latter. But such relevance\u2014if any<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>\u2014would be heavily counterweighted, at any point in the trial, by remoteness or prejudicial character, or both. This being so, the court\u2019s rulings were proper exercises of discretion upon any view of the record. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 1868; Witkin, Cal. Evidence (2d ed. 1966) \u00a7\u00a7 308, 373, pp. 272, 331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">We have not previously mentioned appellant\u2019s final contention, which involves an instruction given by the trial court relative to the discounting of \u201clost future benefits\u201d according to their \u201cpresent value.\u201d Appellant does not complain of the instruction, but urges that the trial court should have granted a new trial because the jury disregarded it. To show the latter fact on the motion for new trial, appellant produced an affidavit by a juror which stated, in substance and among other things, that the jury, having calculated $145,000 as aggregate damages, made no \u201cpresent value\u201d computation to produce a lower figure in the verdict. A verdict, however, may not be impeached in such manner <em>(Kollert </em>v. <em>Cundiff </em>(1958) 50 Cal.2d 768, 772-774 [329 P.2d 897]; <em>Gonsalves </em>v. <em>Petaluma Bldg. Materials Co. </em>(1960) 181 Cal.App.2d 320, 336 [5 Cal.Rptr. 332]), and the trial court properly disregarded the affidavit. The granting or denial of a new trial otherwise rested in the court\u2019s discretion. (Gon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number><em>salves </em>v. <em>Petaluma Bldg.

Based on your study, education, research, experience on the subject of stability and instability of marriages, do you have an opinion, doctor, as to whether these factors that I have mentioned would be predictive of success or failure in such a marriage? A. Well, there is no doubt in my mind. Q. Just answer \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019 first; just \u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no.\u2019 A.
