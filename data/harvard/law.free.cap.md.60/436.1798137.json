The plaintiif stated in evidence, as the reason of the transfer of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the note of the father of the defendants, and the giving of theirs, that the defendants said if he would give them no trouble, they would be responsible for the money.

That there is no evidence in this cause of a sufficient consideration, to support the promise sued on in this case, and the verdict must therefore be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-5\">6. That if the jury believe from the evidence, that the agreement between the parties was, that if the plaintiff would not give defendants any trouble, they would pay the debt of their father, then their verdict must, under the pleadings in the cause, be for the defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b456-6\">The Court (Brown, J.) granted the prayer of the plaintiff, and rejected the foregoing prayers of the defendants. The defendants excepted, and the verdict and judgment being for the plaintiff, they appealed.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b456-7\">The cause was argued before Miller, Stone, Alvey, Irving, and Ritchie, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-8\"><em>M. R. Walter, </em>for the appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b456-9\"><em>J. B. Wentz, </em>for the appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b456-10\">Ritchie, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqj\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-11\">The defendants\u2019 tenth prayer, asking the Court to instruct th\u2019e jury that there was no evidence legally sufficient to enable the plaintiff to recover under the first or third count of the declaration, having been conceded, only the second count remains for our consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-12\">As set out in this second count, the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action is, that the father of the defendants in his life-time was indebted to the plaintiff, for money lent, on his promissory note for $500, and that after his death, the defendants agreed that if the plaintiff would deliver up to them the ' said promissory note, then due and unpaid, they would pay him $500; in consideration of which promise the said plaintiff did deliver up to said defendants the said note of their father; but the defendants did not pay the said sum of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Whilst those are the averments of the count, the testimony of Fink, the plaintiff himself, relied on to sustain them, states, however, as the reason of the transfer of their father\u2019s note and the giving of theirs, that the defendants \u201csaid to me if I would give them no trouble they would be responsible for the money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Such being the statement of the cause of action and of the proof adduced to sustain it, we do not deem it necessary in our view of the case to dwell upon any question presented but that of whether a sufficient consideration' appears to hold the defendants liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">There was no legal obligation whatever on the defendants to assume the payment of their deceased father\u2019s note, and consequently \u201ctro trouble\u201d the plaintiff could have caused them; and the undisputed evidence shows there were no assets of the deceased\u2019s estate from which his note could have been realized. It, moreover, does not appear from the declaration, nor from the evidence, that at the time the plaintiff relinquished the note, that any administrator of the personal estate of the deceased, the only proper legal representative against whom the plaintiff could have brought suit, or could be the subject of a \u201cforbearance to sue,\u201d had been appointed.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">The question then arises, whether under these circumstances any benefit to the defendants or any loss to the plaintiff, in contemplation of law, resulted in the parting by the latter with the original note ? It is apparent this question must be answered in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">There being, therefore, no legal consideration whatever upon which the defendants could be held liable to pay the plaintiff\u2019s demand, their undertaking was simply <em>nudum pacium; </em>and it follows from this that the defendants\u2019 second, fifth and sixth prayers should have been granted instead of rejected, and on the other hand the plaintiff\u2019s prayer should have been refused. Among the authorities that might be cited in support of the view we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>have taken of this case are <em>Jones vs. Ashburnham, </em>4 <em>East, </em>455; <em>Kaye vs. Dutton, </em>7 <em>M. &amp; G., </em>807; <em>Edwards vs. Baugh, </em>11 <em>M. &amp; W., </em>641; <em>Seaman vs. Seaman, </em>12 <em>Wend., </em>381; 1 <em>Chitty on Con., </em>39, 46, and <em>note m, </em>and the following cases decided by this Court: <em>Busby vs. Conoway, </em>8 <em>Md., </em>60; <em>Smith vs. Easton, </em>54 <em>Md., </em>147; <em>Ecker vs. Bohn, </em>45 <em>Md., </em>278, and <em>Hartle vs. Stahl, </em>27 <em>Md., </em>173.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AxF\">(Decided 21st June, 1883.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">As no verdict should have been rendered against the defendants, the judgment will he reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and new trial refused.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
