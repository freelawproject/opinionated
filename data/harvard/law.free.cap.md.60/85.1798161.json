On demurrer, for want of jurisdiction, to a bill filed by a Dispensary in the City of Baltimore against a former sheriff, for a discovery and payment into Court of the sums collected by him from fines imposed under said Act, in order that the same might be distributed among the several Dispensaries entitled to the fund, it was Held :</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b103-11\">That the complainant was entitled to the relief prayed for, and the demurrer to the bill was properly overruled by the Court below.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>Appeal from the Circuit Court of Baltimore pity.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b104-5\">The case is stated in the opinion of the Court.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b104-6\">.

Besides, in one case it may appear that a certain number of Dispensaries are entitled to the benefit of the Act, and in another that a greater or less number are entitled. The result would be a multiplicity of actions, and expensive and vexatious litigations, with different judgments, each varying in amount, and this too in the face of the Act of 1853, which provides that the fund shall be distributed equally among the several Dispensaries entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In an action at law the amount of fines imposed may, it is true, be ascertained from the records of the Criminal Court, but this would entail upon the litigants heavy, and it may be, unnecessary costs; and besides, the inquiry would be still open as to the solvency or insolvency of the parties fined, and the actual amount which defendant has, or ought to have, collected.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">By a bill in equity, with a prayer for discovery, all this may be avoided, and the rights of all concerned may be finally settled in one litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">There is no difficulty, under the Act of 1853, in regard to the collection and distribution of the money arising from the fines imposed by the Court. The law makes it the duty of the sheriff to collect all fines, and if he has any doubts in regard to the number of beneficiaries entitled, a Court of equity is always open to aid and protect him in the distribution of the fund.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>(Decided 29th March, 1883.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b106-4\">We are of opinion that the appellee is entitled to the relief prayed, and the demurrer to the bill was, therefore,, properly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">\n<em>Order affirmed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
