On the 22nd of October, 1881, a rule, \u201c security for costs,\u201d was laid upon the plaintiff. The case was brought forward by regular continuances to the January Term, 1883, and was marked for trial on the docket, at the call of the docket on the first day of the Term ; and afterwards the defendant\u2019s attorney asked the plaintiff\u2019s attorneys for a continuance of the case, which was agreed to by them, hut it was not then called to the attention of the Court, and was not entered \u201c continued \u201d on the docket; and it was also agreed, at the same time, that the case might he tried on the original records from the Orphans\u2019 Court, as evidence, instead of copies. On the 2nd of January, 1883, the defendant\u2019s attorney asked for a judgment of <em>nonpros. </em>for want of security for costs. The judgment was entered. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>On the 9th of February, 1883, the plaintiff filed her petition and affidavits, praying the Court to strike out the judgment of <em>non pros., </em>and to grant leave to defend the motion for the same, because the rule, security for costs, had been duly and regularly complied with. It was testified by D. 'J. Blackiston, Esq., in his affidavit that he was one of the attorneys for the plaintiff, and had a clear and distinct recollection that the plaintiff' complied with the rule, \u201c security for costs,\u201d laid upon her; that he remembered distinctly that the security was given in open Court, and that James W. Wilson was offered and accepted as the security. James E. Ellegood, Esq., also of counsel for the plaintiff, by his affidavit, testified that he remembered calling on Mr. James W. Wilson in open Court, to enter security for costs for the plaintiff, and that, according to his recollection and positive belief, the said James W. Wilson did then and there enter and become security for the costs. On the 10th of February, 1883, the Court overruled the motion\u2019to strike out the judgment of <em>non pros., </em>and judgment was entered for the defendant for costs. The plaintiff appealed from the judgment of <em>non pros., </em>and from the order of the Court ovenmling the motion to strike out the judgment.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b392-5\">The cause was argued before Miller, Yellott, Robinson, and Irving, J.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b392-6\"><em>D.

The case was then brought for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>ward by regular continuances to the January Term, 1883, and at this term, on the call of the docket, it was <em>marked for trial. </em>Subsequently, at the request of the <em>defendant, </em>it was agreed the case should be <em>continued. </em>This agreement it is true was not entered on the docket, but it is admitted that both sides understood the case was to be continued.</p>\n<decisiondate id=\"AsQ\">(Decided 20th June, 1883.)</decisiondate>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The right to insist on a compliance with the rule, <em>\u201csecurity for costs,\u201d </em>is one which a party may waive; and when the defendant agreed the case should be continued, he must be considered as having waived this <em>right for that Term. </em>As the case stood upon the docket for trial, the plaintiff might have complied \"with the rule at any time before judgment of <em>non pros., </em>and to permit the defendant to insist upon a compliance witli the rule, after he had agreed to a continuance, would in many cases work a surprise to the plaintiff. Relying upon the agreement to continue the case, he may not have made the effort to comply with the rule at that Term, and which he otherwise might have done, if the case stood for trial. The defendant had no right therefore to insist upon a compliance with the rule at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The parol evidence offered by the plaintiff, is not sufficient to show a compliance with the rule. This could only be done by the payment into Court of a sum of money sufficient to meet the probable costs of the case, or by giving bond with surety, by a docket entry, showing an \u25a0acknowledgment or obligation of some kind on the part of the <em>surety, </em>which could be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed, and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
