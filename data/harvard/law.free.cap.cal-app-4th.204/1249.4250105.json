J.</author>\n<p id=\"AmJ\">\u2014In this fraud in the inducement action against the general partners of a limited partnership, a jury found in favor of respondent George J. Miske, as assignee of a limited partner\u2019s fraud claim, and the court entered judgment for $1,408,212.07, including compound prejudgment interest. Following the denial of posttrial motions, the court awarded Miske substantial attorney fees, based on the attorney fee provision in the underlying limited partnership agreement (LPA). Now appellant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Coxeter challenges the judgment against him because the jury found that he did not participate in or ratify the fraud perpetrated on a limited partner by his cogeneral partner, appellant Bisno. He relies principally on <em>Kazanjian v. Rancho Estates, Ltd. </em>(1991) 235 Cal.App.3d 1621 [1 Cal.Rptr.2d 534] (Kazanjian), in which the reviewing court held that an innocent general partner is not personally liable to a limited partner for the wrongdoing of a cogeneral partner. We affirm the judgment against Coxeter, concluding that for purposes of ascertaining his liability for Bisno\u2019s wrongdoing under the rule of <em>Kazanjian, </em>we treat the defrauded limited partner in question as an innocent third party.</p>\n<p id=\"b1060-10\">All appellants challenge the award of attorney fees to Miske and the compounding of prejudgment interest. We reverse the attorney fee award <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1253\">*1253</page-number>because the limited partner\u2019s assignment to Miske of its fraud claim did not pass to him any rights under the LPA. And finally, we affirm the compound prejudgment interest award on grounds of estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-5\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-6\">A. <em>Formation of and Investment in Limited Partnerships</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1061-7\">In 1985, appellants James Coxeter, Robert Bisno and TAFC formed two California limited partnerships for the purpose of redeveloping certain property in downtown Berkeley: appellant TACI and Trans-Action Commercial Mortgage Investors, Ltd. (TACMI). Both companies were private placement limited partnerships. Coxeter, Bisno and TAFC were the general partners of the two limited partnerships.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-8\">Bisno was responsible for managing the Berkeley project; Coxeter managed projects in Southern California and other parts of the state. Bisno approved the promotional work for the Berkeley project, handled the advertising, flyers and brochures on behalf of the partnerships, and approved and oversaw distribution of a private placement memorandum. As well, Bisno solicited potential investors, took them to the site, gave tours of the property, and made presentations encouraging them to invest.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-9\">In early 1986, Bisno transferred $470,000 from TACMI for his personal use to purchase a personal residence, without the knowledge or consent of the other partners.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-10\">Then in February and April 1987, Bisno met with Makoto Moriwaki, the president and owner of the Hong Kong company Haldir, Ltd. (Haldir), to discuss the partnerships. Moriwaki traveled each time to Berkeley, and visited the property. Haldir ultimately purchased 44 TACMI limited partnership units for $1,924,560. On April 11, 1987, its managing director executed a subscription agreement. Thereafter, Moriwaki tendered the purchase money. And finally, on April 13, 1987, Bisno, on behalf of the partnership, countersigned the subscription agreement accepting Haldir\u2019s subscription and making the company a limited partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-11\">For a short period of time thereafter, Haldir received distributions totaling $183,389.37 from TACMI, and then the payments stopped. Haldir received new cash flow projections from TACMI that were significantly less than the original projections.</p>\n<p id=\"b1061-12\">In March 1998, Haldir sold its TACMI limited partnership interest for $198,000 to Berkeley Commercial Center, LLC (Berkeley Center).</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1254\">*1254</page-number>In 1996, Dolores Staudenraus, another TACMI limited partner, sued TACMI, Bisno, Coxeter and others for fraud. The general partners of TACMI cross-complained.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-4\">Respondent Miske, another TACMI investor, had been instrumental in introducing Moriwaki to the Berkeley project. In 2005 he traveled to Japan to meet with Moriwaki. Miske discussed the misconduct and \u201cbad things that had happened\u201d in the partnership before Haldir invested in the company. After learning of the wrongdoing, Moriwaki, on behalf of Haldir, assigned to Miske all of Haldir\u2019s \u201cright, title, and interest in any and all of our claims and causes of action for the monetary losses sustained as a result of the fraud and deceit\u201d of Bisno, Coxeter, TACMI, TACI and TAFC \u201cthat induced Haldir . . . to purchase and me to facilitate the purchase by Haldir\u201d of the limited partnership units in TACMI. According to the terms of the assignment, Haldir would receive 75 percent of any net recovery Miske obtained on the assigned claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-5\">Prior to investing in TACMI, Moriwaki had not been advised of multiple material facts concerning the project, including that (1) the purchase price of a key asset was $1.7 million above its appraised value; (2) contrary to a statement in the promotional materials that the property was acquired with no markup, in fact a $900,000 markup had been added to the price of the property before the seller sold it to TACI and TACMI; and (3) Bisno embezzled $470,000 from TACMI to buy a home.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-6\">B. <em>Litigation and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1062-7\">In late 2005 and early 2006, Miske, on his own behalf and as assignee of Haldir\u2019s claim, and other TACMI limited partners separately filed actions against TACMI, TACI, and three of the limited partnerships\u2019 general partners: Bisno, Coxeter and TAFC. Each action alleged that plaintiffs had been fraudulently induced to purchase units in TACMI. The court consolidated the three actions, but thereafter ordered that those plaintiffs entitled to trial preference because of age and health issues (the Preference Plaintiffs) would have their claims tried separately, before the claims of the non-Preference Plaintiffs. Miske was not a member of the preferential group.</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-8\">The jury returned a special verdict in the Preference Plaintiffs\u2019 case against all defendants, awarding damages of $251,325 and compound prejudgment interest of more than $1.15 million as of the date of judgment. This court affirmed the judgment in an unpublished opinion. <em>(Emanuele v. Bisno </em>(Mar. 13, 2008, A117913).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1062-9\">After the remittitur issued on the Preference Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, defendants settled with all remaining plaintiffs except Miske, as Haldir\u2019s assignee. Prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1255\">*1255</page-number>to trial, Miske asked the court to bar relitigation of certain issues, namely relating to proof of defendants\u2019 fraudulent conduct and the propriety of the compound interest award. Ultimately the court ruled in Haldir\u2019s favor, and instructed the jury as follows: \u201cYou must accept as proven that all defendants made knowing, intentional, and deceptive misrepresentations and concealment in 1986 and 1987 that were material and important; were made with the intent to deceive and induce persons to purchase TACMI limited partnership units; and were made with the intent to have purchasers rely on the misrepresentations.\u201d The court also instructed the jury on the liability of a partner: \u201cA limited partnership and each of its general partners] is responsible for the harm caused by the wrongful conduct of a general partner while acting within the scope of his authority [, ejven if the other general partners were not aware of it or did not participate in the wrongful conduct, [f] Robert Bisno\u2019s conduct was within the scope of his authority . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-5\">On the issue of compound interest, the court ruled that \u201c[djefendants are barred from relitigating the plaintiff\u2019s entitlement to prejudgment compound interest if plaintiff prevails on his fraud claim at trial. The \u2018positive misconduct\u2019 of the defendants is the same in the present case and in the case of the preference plaintiffs whose claims have already been tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-6\">The jury in the present case returned a special verdict finding that (1) Haldir reasonably relied on a concealment by Bisno that was a substantial factor in causing harm to it; (2) Bisno was acting within the scope of his authority when he concealed a material fact from Haldir; (3) Coxeter did not ratify Bisno\u2019s harmful conduct; and (4) the amount of compensatory damages, including compound interest, was $1,408,212.07. The court entered judgment stating the jury returned a special verdict \u201cagainst all Defendants\u201d and decreed that Miske recover from defendants \u201cjointly and severally.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-7\">Thereafter Coxeter moved unsuccessfully for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or, alternatively, to set aside and vacate the judgment and enter a new judgment. Coxeter argued he was an innocent general partner and could not be liable to limited partner Haldir for his cogeneral partner\u2019s tortious conduct, citing <em>Kazanjian. </em>The trial court disagreed, finding <em>Kazanjian </em>distinguishable because \u201cHaldir was an innocent third party for purposes of determining defendant Coxeter\u2019s liability for the actions of defendant Robert Bisno.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1063-8\">Miske moved for an award of attorney fees, relying on a provision in the TACMI LPA. Responding to Coxeter\u2019s argument that Haldir was not entitled to a fee award because the company prevailed against him based on its status as an \u201cinnocent third party\u201d and not as a limited partner, the court ruled that \u201c[ojnce the purchase [of its limited partnership interest] had been made, . . . Haldir was entitled to the benefit of the attorney\u2019s fees clause in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1256\">*1256</page-number>partnership agreement.\u201d The court awarded $1,339,025.31 in attorney fees, exclusive of costs. These consolidated appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-4\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-5\">A. <em>Coxeter\u2019s Liability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1064-6\">Coxeter first protests that Miske cannot recover from him because he was found innocent of any wrongdoing. We start with the general proposition that all partners in a partnership are bound by the fraud of a copartner acting within the scope of his or her authority in a partnership transaction with an <em>innocent third party, </em>and thus all are responsible for the injury occasioned thereby. <em>(Stout v. Turney </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 718, 723, fn. 6 [150 Cal.Rptr. 637, 586 P.2d 1228].) Coxeter, however, maintains that because the jury found that <em>only Bisno </em>concealed material information from Haldir, Coxeter is an <em>innocent general partner </em>and thus cannot be liable to Haldir, a limited partner, for Bisno\u2019s tortious acts. From this Coxeter asserts that the court erred in entering a joint and several judgment against him based on the premise that Haldir\u2019s fraud claim, asserted by Miske as assignee, was brought in the capacity of a third party rather than a limited partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-7\">Coxeter centers his argument on <em>Kazanjian. </em>There, limited partner Kazanjian sued two general partners for one partner\u2019s misappropriation of partnership funds. The other partner was innocent of any wrongdoing, and the wrongdoing occurred well after the limited partner joined the partnership. The matter was referred to a referee for an accounting, and the trial court rendered judgment in accord with the referee\u2019s findings. Denying Kazanjian\u2019s claim against the innocent general partner, the court ruled that such a partner was not personally liable to a limited partner for damages suffered by acts of the cogeneral partner. <em>(Kazanjian, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at pp. 1624-1625.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1064-8\">Not surprisingly, the question on appeal was whether the innocent general partner was jointly liable to the limited partner for the loss he suffered because of the other partner\u2019s malfeasance. The reviewing court concluded he was not, turning to provisions of the Corporations Code law to determine the rights of a limited partner. The court noted that in general, the liability of a general partner to a limited partner is the same as his or her liability to another general partner. <em>(Kazanjian, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1626.) At the time, the obligations of a misappropriating partner were spelled out in Corporations Code former section 15021, subdivision (1), as follows: \u201cEvery partner must account to the partnership for any benefit, and hold as trustee for it any profits derived by him without the consent of the other partners ....\u201d (Corp. Code, former \u00a7 15021, as added by Stats. 1949, ch. 383, \u00a7 1, pp. 674, 680, repealed by Stats. 1996, ch. 1003, \u00a7 1.2, p. 5906, eff. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1257\">*1257</page-number>Jan. 1, 1999.) Observing that the misappropriating partner holds profits improperly derived \u201c \u2018as trustee,\u2019 \u201d the court concluded that partnership law thus incorporated the fiduciary concepts of our trust law. <em>(Kazanjian, supra, </em>at p. 1626.) Further, at the time of the transactions in question, Civil Code former section 2239 provided: \u201cA trustee is responsible for the wrongful acts of a co-trustee to which he consented, or which, by his negligence, he enabled the latter to commit, but for no others.\u201d (Enacted in 1872, repealed by Stats. 1986, ch. 820, \u00a7 7, p. 2730.) From this the court concluded that cotrustees and copartners \u201care not liable for loss caused by misdeeds of their cofiduciaries unless they are personally in some way at fault\u2014either by participating in the tort through consent or otherwise, or by negligence in permitting it to occur.\u201d <em>(Kazanjian, supra, </em>at p. 1627.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-5\">As well, the <em>Kazanjian </em>court underscored that a general partner\u2019s exposure to liability to a limited partner is not as extensive as a general partner\u2019s potential liability to partnership creditors. <em>(Kazanjian, supra, </em>235 Cal.App.3d at p. 1625.) While stressing that a limited partner in the capacity of limited partner is not a creditor, the court was clear that <em>all </em>general partners, including innocent general partners, are <em>jointly and severally liable </em>to creditors for the tortious acts of a copartner done in connection with, or in the process of, the partnership business. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1626, 1629.) Further, although like a creditor, a limited partner has no control of the partnership business, the limited partner has made a business decision to relinquish control over business management in return for limiting her liability to her investment. Historically, our limited partnership law was based on two assumptions: First, that public policy did not require limited partners to be responsible for partnership obligations. Second, \u201c \u2018persons in business should be able, while remaining themselves hable without limit for the obligations contracted in its conduct, to associate with . . . others who contribute to the capital and acquire rights of ownership, provided that such contributors do not compete with creditors for the assets of the partnership.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1629, italics omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1065-6\">The legal question we must resolve is whether to treat Haldir as an innocent third party or an innocent limited partner, for purposes of its assigned fraud in the inducement claim. Haldir\u2019s complaint is that it pm-chased the limited partnership in reasonable reliance on Bisno\u2019s representations, which in fact were false and Bisno knew they were false. Had it known the truth about the concealed facts, it would not have purchased the units or become a limited partner. Further, Haldir would not have paid what it did for the units since the units, under the circumstances, had no value. The jury specifically found that Haldir reasonably relied \u201con a concealment\u201d of Bisno, Haldir\u2019s reliance on the concealment was a substantial factor in causing harm to it, and Bisno was acting within the scope of his authority when he made the concealment</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1258\">*1258</page-number>Bisno\u2019s tortious concealment occurred <em>before </em>Haldir paid money for the units, and induced Haldir to purchase units it later deemed were worthless once it discovered the fraud. The diminishment in value occurred at the moment of purchase, notwithstanding that it was discovered later, after Haldir had become a limited partner. At the moment of purchase, Haldir is in the same shoes as any defrauded innocent third party purchasing a partnership asset. It had not yet retained any benefits from the partnership and had not yet begun operating under the LPA. The only difference at that moment between Haldir and a generic innocent third party who pays more for a partnership asset than it is worth in a transaction wherein material information was concealed, is that Haldir purchased limited partnership units and thereafter became a limited partner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-4\">Coxeter\u2019s argument that we must view this through the lens of the innocent general partner analysis is based on the hypertechnical argument that the cause of action for fraud in the inducement did not accrue until Haldir acted in reliance on Bisno\u2019s concealment and sustained damages as a result. (See <em>Blickman Turkus, LP v. MF Downtown Sunnyvale, LLC </em>(2008) 162 Cal.App.4th 858, 868 [76 Cal.Rptr.3d 325]: elements of action for fraud and deceit based on concealment are (1) the defendant concealed a material fact; (2) the defendant had a duty to disclose the fact to the plaintiff; (3) the defendant intentionally concealed the fact with intent to defraud; (4) the plaintiff was unaware of the fact and would not have acted had she or he had knowledge of the concealed fact; and (5) the plaintiff sustained damages as a result of the concealment.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1066-5\">Haldir relied on the flawed representations when it made the decision to purchase the partnership units. That reliance of course continued through the signing of the partnership agreement and payment of money at which precise moment Haldir suffered damages, i.e., the units were worth less than the purchase price (or perhaps nothing). Coxeter\u2019s position\u2014that the elements of reliance and injury did not occur until Haldir became a limited partner\u2014exalts form over substance and may be technically true. However, Haldir did not become an innocent limited partner within the meaning of <em>Kazanjian </em>at that precise moment. Recall, Kazanjian was not fraudulently induced to buy into the partnership. Rather, he had already purchased his partnership units and had been operating under the LPA for some time when the misappropriation that reduced the assets available at distribution and dissolution occurred. Here, the concealment occurred prior to Haldir\u2019s becoming a limited partner, and the value of its units was substantially reduced <em>at the instant </em>of going into the partnership. Although it is a fairly close call, we conclude that for purposes of applying the rule of <em>Kazanjian, </em>Haldir was an innocent third party, not an innocent limited partner. Therefore, Coxeter was jointly liable for Bisno\u2019s concealment of material facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1259\">*1259</page-number>B. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-5\">1. <em>Introduction, Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1067-6\">Respondent Miske, as assignee of Haldir, received a substantial attorney fee award which appellants now attack. The lower court grounded the fee award in the attorney fee provision of the LPA, which states: \u201cIf any dispute arises between the Partners, whether or not resulting in litigation, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover from the other party all reasonable costs, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees.\u201d Specifically, the court held that Haldir\u2019s right to recover attorney fees under the LPA was an incident of the company\u2019s fraud claims which it passed to Miske by way of assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-7\">Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 establishes the basic right to a nonstatutory award of attorney fees, providing that \u201cthe measure and mode of compensation of attorneys and counselors at law is left to the agreement . . . of the parties . . . .\u201d This statute allows the parties to agree that the prevailing party in litigation may recover attorney fees, whether the litigation sounds in contract or in tort. <em>(Xuereb </em>v. <em>Marcus &amp; Millichap, Inc. </em>(1992) 3 Cal.App.4th 1338, 1341 [5 Cal.Rptr.2d 154].) And, where the language of the agreement broadly applies to \u201c \u2018any dispute\u2019 \u201d under it, the attorney fee clause encompasses any conflict concerning the effect of the agreement, including a tort claim. <em>(Thompson v. Miller </em>(2003) 112 Cal.App.4th 327, 337 [4 Cal.Rptr.3d 905].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-8\">The language of the above attorney fee provision is broad enough to cover the type of fraud in inducement claims brought against appellants. Indeed, the Preference Plaintiffs pursued attorney fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 and the partnership agreement, and the court granted the motion in substantial part. Appellants appealed that order but then abandoned the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-9\">Miske argues that the availability of fees under Code of Civil Procedure section 1021 and the partnership agreement \u201cshould be deemed established for purposes of Haldir\u2019s claims,\u201d maintaining that this case involves the identical agreement and identical claims arising under identical circumstances. Appellants correctly point out that Miske did not assert collateral estoppel in connection with the attorney fees motion. Moreover, his assertion of identical circumstances is incorrect. The identical issue requirement underlying the collateral estoppel doctrine addresses whether identical factual allegations are at stake in the two proceedings, not whether the ultimate issues or dispositions are identical. <em>(Lucido v. Superior Court </em>(1990) 51 Cal.3d 335, 341-342 [272 Cal.Rptr. 767, 795 P.2d 1223].) Here the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1260\">*1260</page-number>Preference Plaintiffs sued in their own names, whereas respondent Miske sued as assignee of Haldir\u2019s fraud claims; hence, the issues are not identical and therefore collateral estoppel is not available.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Civil Code section 1084 declares the law of this state with respect to what passes with an assignment: \u201cThe transfer of a thing transfers also all its incidents, unless expressly excepted; but the transfer of an incident to a thing does not transfer the thing itself.\u201d Civil Code section 3540 elaborates: \u201cThe incident follows the principal, and not the principal the incident.\u201d The term \u201cincident\u201d has been defined as a \u201cdependent, subordinate, or consequential part (of something else)\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and as \u201csomething dependent on or subordinate to something else of greater or principal importance.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">What precisely did Haldir assign to Miske? Haldir assigned all \u201cright, title, and interest in any and all of [its] claims and causes of action for the monetary losses sustained as a result of the fraud and deceit\u201d of appellants that induced Haldir to purchase 44 limited partnership units in TACMI. Haldir <em>did not </em>assign to Miske the LPA containing the attorney fee clause. Nor did the assignment or the agreement for assignment make any reference to Haldir as a limited partner of TACMI or to the LPA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1068-7\">And finally, Miske was never made a substituted limited partner of TACMI. The LPA defines \u201cLimited Partnerfs]\u201d as \u201cpersons listed on the signature page as Limited Partners, and any person who becomes a Limited Partner by substitution after receiving an assignment from a Limited Partner with the consent of the General Partners.\u201d As well, the LPA specifically prohibited any partner from assigning or selling <em>any interest </em>in the partnership or its assets, except upon the approval of lite general partners and compliance with other provisions set forth therein. On the other hand, under the LPA a mere \u201cassignee\u201d was someone \u201cwho has acquired a beneficial interest in this Partnership from a Limited Partner but who is not a substituted Limited Partner.\u201d These definitions are consistent with the former governing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1261\">*1261</page-number>law, in effect at the operative times. In particular, Corporations Code former section 15672 provided that although a limited partnership interest was generally assignable, the assignment of such interest <em>did not </em>entitle the assignee to become a partner or exercise the rights of a partner; rather, it entitled the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, the distributions and allocations to which the assignor would be entitled. (Corp. Code, former \u00a7 15672, subd. (a), as amended by Stats. 1994, ch. 1010, \u00a7 88, pp. 6068-6069, repealed by Corp. Code, former \u00a7 15724, which was repealed by <em>its own </em>terms and repealed the entire chapter eff. Jan. 1, 2010 [Stats. 2006, ch. 495, \u00a7 18, pp. 3543-3544].) The limited partner remained a limited partner upon assignment of all or part of his or her interest, with the rights the assignee did not acquire or possess, subject to the assignee becoming a limited partner if and to the extent the partnership agreement so provided, or all general partners and a majority in interest of the limited partners consented. (Corp. Code, former \u00a7\u00a7 15672, subd. (a), 15674, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-5\">Here, the attorney fee provision itself entitles a prevailing partner to reasonable fees in the event a dispute \u201carises between the Partners.\u201d Written in the present tense, the clause requires a dispute between partners arising during the course of the agreement, which itself is between the general partners and the initial and listed limited partners. From the above chronology and analysis, it is apparent that Miske never stepped into Haldir\u2019s shoes as a limited partner with rights under the LPA, including the right to attorney fees in the event of a dispute with a partner. This is so based on one of two possibilities. First, if Berkeley Center became a substituted limited partner as anticipated by the assignment from Haldir of all of its units to the center, then of course Haldir\u2019s assignment to Miske of its fraud claims did not confer rights under the LPA because Haldir was no longer a limited partner and could not assign something it no longer owned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1069-6\">On the other hand, if Haldir maintained its limited partner status after assignment of all its partnership units to Berkeley Center, its assignment to Miske was limited solely to its fraud claims and causes of action. The assignment did not include a separate assignment of the LPA with its attorney fee clause, nor did it mention the LPA or refer to Haldir as a TACMI limited partner, and no action was taken by the TACMI general partners to convert Miske\u2019s status from that of assignee to a substituted limited partner entitled to fees under the LPA. Under the terms of the LPA and the governing law at the time, Haldir could not assign any interest in TACMI or TACMI\u2019s assets without the consent of the general partners and compliance with other procedures, and thus Miske could not become a substituted limited partner who could then step into Haldir\u2019s shoes as a partner and enjoy the benefit of the attorney fee provision in the event of a dispute between partners. Miske would always be only an assignee of Haldir\u2019s fraud claims, nothing more.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1262\">*1262</page-number>Citing Civil Code section 1084 and other authority, Miske counters that where an underlying claim has been assigned and the assignor was entitled to recover attorney fees if he or she brought the action directly, the assignee stands in the shoes of the assignor and benefits from the attorney fee provision. This logic is premised on a faulty assumption that the attorney fee provision of the LPA is an incident to Haldir\u2019s fraud claims. As we explain, it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1070-4\">First, we do recognize that an assignment of a cause of action ordinarily transfers all its incidents. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1084.) Thus, for example, the statutory right to costs passes to an assignee with the assignment of a cause of action. <em>(Vons Cos., Inc. v. Lyle Parks Jr., Inc. </em>(2009) 177 Cal.App.4th 823, 833 [99 Cal.Rptr.3d 562].) And, where an assignor transfers rights to receive and collect moneys due under a settlement agreement that provides for reasonable attorney fees in the event proceedings are undertaken to enforce rights thereunder, the right to such fees is conveyed with the assignment. (A. <em>J. Industries, Inc. v. Ver Halen </em>(1977) 75 Cal.App.3d 751, 754, 762 [142 Cal.Rptr. 383] <em>(Ver Halen).) </em>Similarly, the assignment from lessors of a claim for four months\u2019 rent of certain leased premises carried with it the right to attorney fees where the underlying lease provided for attorney fees in the event of a suit to enforce any rights of lessors. <em>(Adjustment Corp. v. Marco </em>(1929) 100 Cal.App. 338, 340-341 [279 P. 1006] <em>(Marco).) </em>In both <em>Ver Halen </em>and <em>Marco, </em>the rights assigned\u2014to receive money due under a settlement agreement and lease respectively\u2014stemmed directly from the underlying agreement affording a right to attorney fees in pursuit of recovery of such moneys. In contrast, the right assigned in this case\u2014Haldir\u2019s fraud in the inducement claim against <em>appellants\u2014did not </em>stem directly from the LPA and hence the assignment did not confer on Miske the right to attorney fees under the LPA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1070-5\">Moreover, here the LPA is the \u201cthing\u201d or the \u201cprincipal\u201d within the meaning of Civil Code sections 1084 and 3540, without which there would be no fraud claims. Stated a little differently, the LPA is not dependent on, or subordinate to, or a consequential part of Haldir\u2019s claims for fraud and deceit. Rather, these claims are dependent on, subordinate to and a consequential part of the LPA and the limited partnership units. Since the principal (LPA) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1263\">*1263</page-number>does not follow the incident (fraud claims), the transfer of the fraud claims does not transfer the LPA. Haldir\u2019s rights in that agreement, including rights to attorney fees, had to be separately or specifically assigned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-5\">For all these reasons, we conclude that Haldir\u2019s assignment of fraud claims to Miske did not confer any rights under the LPA, and therefore Miske had no claim to attorney fees in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b1071-6\">C. <em>Prejudgment </em>Interest<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1071-7\">III.

Pursuant to the operative assignment agreement, Haldir agreed to sell and transfer to Berkeley Center \u201call right, title and interest in and to\u201d the units, <em>requested substitution of Berkeley Center as a limited partner of </em>TACMI, and appointed the purchaser as its proxy and attorney in fact with full power to vote or exercise the powers afforded by the partnership units \u201cin any matter subject to limited partner action.\u201d The record does not reveal whether in fact Berkeley Center was made a substituted limited partner of TACMI.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1070-6\"> Conversely, had Haldir, in its own right as a TACMI limited partner, successfully sued appellants for fraud in the inducement, there is no question that it would have been entitled to attorney fees under the LPA because the triggering prerequisite of a dispute between partners would have been met.

Ward </em>(1993) 13 Cal.App.4th 155, 157, 160-161 [16 Cal.Rptr.2d 486]: fraud in the inducement cause of action arose out of a real estate purchase agreement that contained an attorney fee clause providing for attorney fees to the prevailing party in any proceeding or action arising out of the agreement; the party prevailing on the tort claim was therefore entitled to reasonable attorney fees pursuant to the agreement; see also <em>Xuereb v.
