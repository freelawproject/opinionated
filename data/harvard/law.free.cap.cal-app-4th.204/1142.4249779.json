He contends the trial court erred in denying his pretrial motion to represent himself, his convictions for battery causing serious bodily injury and grand theft are unlawful, and the court improperly denied him presentence conduct credits. In the published portion of this opinion, we address two issues. First, we reject defendant\u2019s argument that Penal Code section 243, subdivision (f)(5)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> helps define the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d in section 243, subdivision (d); that phrase is defined solely by section 243, subdivision (f)(4). Second, we agree with defendant\u2019s contention that a recent amendment to the definition of grand theft should be applied retroactively, reducing his conviction of that offense to petty theft. We remand for resentencing, including recalculation of defendant\u2019s presentence conduct credits.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-9\">PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">In March 2008, the Contra Costa County District Attorney filed an information charging defendant with robbery (\u00a7\u00a7 211, 212.5, subd. (c); count 1); battery causing serious bodily injury (\u00a7\u00a7 242, 243, subd. (d); count 2); inflicting corporal injury on a cohabitant (\u00a7 273.5, subd. (a); counts 3 and 13); criminal threats (\u00a7 422; counts 4, 8, 12, and 21-23); assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2); counts 5 and 14); false imprisonment by violence (\u00a7\u00a7 236, 237, subd. (a); counts 6 and 15); being a felon in possession of a firearm (former \u00a7 12021, subd. (a)(1); count 7); residential burglary (\u00a7\u00a7 459, 460, subd. (a); count 9); assault by force likely to cause great bodily injury (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(1); count 10); forcible sexual penetration (\u00a7 289, subd. (a)(1); count 11); forcible oral copulation (\u00a7 288a, subd. (c)(2); counts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1146\">*1146</page-number>16 and 18); and forcible rape (\u00a7 261, subd. (a)(2); counts 17, 19, and 20). Jane Doe II was the alleged victim in counts 1, 2, and 8, and Jane Doe I was the alleged victim in the remaining counts, except the firearm possession charge. The information also alleged various enhancements, prior strike convictions, serious felony convictions, and prison terms.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-5\">The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss counts 21 through 23. After trial, a jury found defendant guilty of the lesser included offense of grand theft (\u00a7 487) from Jane Doe II on count 1, battery causing serious bodily injury to Jane Doe n on count 2, criminal threats against Jane Doe II on count 8, assault by force likely to produce great bodily injury to Jane Doe I on count 10, and false imprisonment by violence of Jane Doe I on count 15. The jury found defendant not guilty on the remaining counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-6\">The trial court found true the allegations regarding defendant\u2019s prior strike convictions, serious felony convictions, and prison terms. The court imposed a term of 25 years to life on count 15, concurrent terms of 25 years to life on counts 2 and 8, a concurrent term of three years on count 10, and a consecutive term of eight months on count 1. The court also imposed a total of eight additional years on four enhancements. The total prison sentence was 33 years eight months to life. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-7\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b954-8\">Because the facts underlying the counts involving Jane Doe I are not relevant to the issues on appeal, we need not summarize them, other than to point out that they involve several alleged episodes of threats and physical and sexual violence against Jane Doe I, a woman with whom defendant had resided in a romantic relationship. Because the facts underlying the counts involving Jane Doe II <em>are </em>relevant to the issues on appeal, we do summarize them.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-9\">Jane Doe II testified she had a brief relationship with defendant in August 2006. He arrived at her house in the early morning hours of August 26th. He was slurring his words and being very loud, and she told him to leave. He got on top of her on her bed and refused to leave. They argued and he began to choke her with his arm. She managed to get his arm off her neck and they struggled. Defendant threatened to kill her and began to choke her again, this time with his two hands. Defendant put so much pressure on her throat that she could not breathe, and she blacked out. She did not know for how long she was unconscious.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-10\">Jane Doe II\u2019s daughter came to Jane Doe II\u2019s room and they yelled at defendant until he exited through the front door. Jane Doe II saw that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1147\">*1147</page-number>defendant was holding her purse. Jane Doe II\u2019s daughter tried to retrieve the purse, but defendant hit her with the purse and pushed her. The purse fell on the ground during the struggle; Jane Doe II tried to pick it up, but defendant managed to get it.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Defendant left with the purse, which contained about $700.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">Jane Doe II testified she had bruises on her neck from the choking; the bruises remained for about a week. The mobility of her neck was not impaired by the choking. She did not seek medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-6\">About two weeks after the incident, defendant left Jane Doe II a voice mail message stating, \u201cI see you are not home and this is O\u2019fear. I wouldn\u2019t come home tonight because you are gonna die.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b955-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b955-8\">I. <em>The Trial Court Did Not Err in Denying Defendant\u2019s </em>Faretta Motion<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b955-9\">II. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Instruction on Battery with Serious Bodily Injury Was Proper</em></p>\n<p id=\"b955-10\">Defendant contends the evidence does not support the finding that the battery committed against Jane Doe II resulted in serious bodily injury, because there was no evidence that the injury required medical treatment. Although defendant presents his claim as a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence, we construe it as one of instructional error, and conclude the trial court\u2019s instruction on serious bodily injury was proper. (See <em>People v. Gaio </em>(2000) 81 Cal.App.4th 919, 922 [97 Cal.Rptr.2d 392] [rejecting claims of instructional error and insufficiency of the evidence based on same misinterpretation of statutory requirements].)</p>\n<p id=\"b955-11\">A battery is \u201cany willful and unlawful use of force or violence upon the person of another.\u201d (\u00a7 242.) \u201cIf, however, the batterer not only uses unlawful force upon the victim but causes injury of sufficient seriousness, then a <em>felony </em>battery is committed. For this second category of battery, \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 is required. (\u00a7 243, subd. (d).)\u201d <em>(People v. Longoria </em>(1995) 34 Cal.App.4th 12, 16 [40 Cal.Rptr.2d 213] <em>(Longoria).) </em>The statute provides that \u201c \u2018Serious bodily injury\u2019 means a serious impairment of physical condition, including, but not limited to, the following: loss of consciousness; concussion; bone fracture; protracted loss or impairment of function of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1148\">*1148</page-number>any bodily member or organ; a wound requiring extensive suturing; and serious disfigurement.\u201d (\u00a7 243, subd. (f)(4).) Section 243 also prescribes enhanced punishment for batteries against peace officers and other specified persons. \u201cIf what would otherwise be a <em>simple </em>battery (any unlawful touching, even without causing pain or injury) is committed against, e.g., a peace officer engaged in the performance of his/her duties, then the offense is punishable by <em>one year </em>in county jail and a $2,000 fine.\u201d (Longoria, at p. 16; see \u00a7 243, subd. (b).) \u201cSimilarly, a distinction is made when it is a peace officer . . .\u201d or another specified person \u201cwho is <em>injured </em>by a batterer. Unlike the ordinary victim, for enhanced punishment to be imposed \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 is <em>not </em>required. Section 243, subdivision (c) provides that a battery against a peace officer engaged in the performance of his/her duties is punishable by a $2,000 fine and three years in state prison when \u2018an injury is inflicted on that victim.\u2019 \u201d (Longoria, at pp. 16-17, first italics added; see <em>People v. Wilkinson </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 821, 831 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 420, 94 P.3d 551].) The statute provides that \u201c \u2018Injury\u2019 means any physical injury which requires professional medical treatment.\u201d (\u00a7 243, subd. (f)(5).)</p>\n<p id=\"b956-5\">In the present case, defendant argues that both the section 243, subdivision (f)(4) <em>and </em>(5) definitions must be satisfied in order to show the \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d required to sustain a conviction for felony battery under section 243, subdivision (d). That is, he argues that, because the word \u201cinjury\u201d is part of the phrase \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d the injury suffered by the victim must both require medical treatment (\u00a7 243, subd. (f)(5)) and also constitute serious impairment of \"physical condition (\u00a7 243, subd. (f)(4)). The instruction given by the trial court, CALCRIM No. 925, did <em>not </em>require a finding of necessity of medical treatment: \u201cWhether a particular injury qualifies as a \u2018serious bodily injury\u2019 is a matter for the jury to determine. You must evaluate the nature, extent, and seriousness of any injury when considering this question. To find an injury to be a \u2018serious bodily injury,\u2019 you must find that the injury caused a serious impairment of physical condition. Such an injury may include, but is not limited to, loss of consciousness. While a loss of consciousness may qualify as serious bodily injury, whether it so qualifies in this case is a matter for the jury to determine.\u201d If defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute is correct, the trial court\u2019s instruction was erroneous, because \u201cThe trial court must instruct even without request on the general principles of law relevant to and governing the case. [Citation.] That obligation includes instructions on all of the elements of a charged offense. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cummings </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1233, 1311 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 796, 850 P.2d 1].) Under defendant\u2019s interpretation of the statute, an injury requiring medical treatment is an element of the offense of battery with serious bodily injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-6\">To resolve whether defendant\u2019s interpretation of section 243 is correct, we are guided by familiar canons of statutory construction. \u201c \u2018[I]n <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1149\">*1149</page-number>construing a statute, a court [must] ascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u2019 [Citation.] In determining that intent, we first examine the words of the respective statutes: \u2018If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u201cthen the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u201d [Citation.] \u201cWhere the statute is clear, courts will not \u2018interpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] If, however, the terms of a statute provide no definitive answer, then courts may resort to extrinsic sources, including the ostensible objects to be achieved and the legislative history. [Citation.] \u2018We must select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People v. Coronado </em>(1995) 12 Cal.4th 145, 151 [48 Cal.Rptr.2d 77, 906 P.2d 1232].)</p>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">We conclude that the plain language of section 243, subdivision (f)(4) controls. That is, a loss of consciousness that constitutes a \u201cserious impairment of physical condition\u201d is a \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d without any showing that the injury required medical treatment. If the Legislature had intended that \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d means a \u201cserious impairment of physical condition\u201d that <em>also </em>required medical treatment, it could have so provided. The separate definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in section 243, subdivision (f)(5) does not render ambiguous the clear language of subdivision (f)(4), because subdivision (f)(5) clearly applies to section 243, subdivision (c), for batteries against peace officers or other specified persons causing \u201cinjury.\u201d Accordingly, applying the plain language of subdivision (f)(4) does not, contrary to defendant\u2019s assertion, make the definition of \u201cinjury\u201d in subdivision (f)(5) surplusage. (See <em>In re Jerry R. </em>(1994) 29 Cal.App.4th 1432, 1437 [35 Cal.Rptr.2d 155] [\u201cWhenever possible, we must give effect to every word in a statute and avoid a construction making a statutory term surplusage or meaningless. [Citations.]\u201d].)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Moreover, \u201cserious bodily injury,\u201d as used in section 243, is \u201c \u2018essentially equivalent\u2019 \u201d to \u201c \u2018great bodily injury,\u2019 \u201d as used, for example, in the section 12022.7 enhancement for the infliction of such injury on a person during the commission of a felony. <em>(People v. Burroughs </em>(1984) 35 Cal.3d 824, 831 [201 Cal.Rptr. 319, 678 P.2d 894], overruled on another ground in <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakeley </em>(2000) 23 Cal.4th 82, 89 [96 Cal.Rptr.2d 451, 999 P.2d 675]; accord, <em>People v. Moore </em>(1992) 10 Cal.App.4th 1868, 1871 [13 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1150\">*1150</page-number>Cal.Rptr.2d 713]; <em>People v. Villarreal </em>(1985) 173 Cal.App.3d 1136, 1141 [219 Cal.Rptr. 371]; see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Hawkins </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 1373, 1375 [19 Cal.Rptr.2d 434] [\u201csubstantially the same meaning\u201d]; but see <em>People v. Taylor </em>(2004) 118 Cal.App.4th 11, 26 [12 Cal.Rptr.3d 693] [although the \u201cusual assumption\u201d is that the phrases have the \u201csame meaning,\u201d the statutory definitions differ].) \u201c \u2018[G]reat bodily injury\u2019 means a significant or substantial physical injury.\u201d (\u00a7 12022.7, subd. (f).) Although any medical treatment obtained by the victim is relevant to determining the existence of \u201cgreat bodily injury\u201d <em>(People v. Cross </em>(2008) 45 Cal.4th 58, 66 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 373, 190 P.3d 706]), the statutory definition and relevant CALCRIM instruction (No. 3160) do not <em>require </em>a showing of necessity of medical treatment. Nor are we aware of any case authority imposing such a requirement. Accordingly, our construction of \u201cserious bodily injury\u201d is consistent with the definition of \u201cgreat bodily injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b958-5\">Because the prosecution was not required to show that Jane Doe IPs injury required medical treatment in order to prove defendant committed a battery causing serious bodily injury, the trial court\u2019s instruction properly omitted that element. We will affirm the conviction for felony battery against Jane Doe II.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b958-6\">III. <em>The Conviction for Grand Theft Must Be Reduced to Petty Theft</em></p>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">The jury found defendant guilty of grand theft (\u00a7 487), a lesser included offense of robbery, which was alleged in count 1 of the information. The jury was instructed that defendant committed grand theft \u201cif he stole property worth more than $400\u201d or if he stole property from the victim\u2019s person. The instruction explained that \u201cTheft is from the person if the property taken was in the clothing of, on the body of, or in a container held or carried by, that person.\u201d Jane Doe II testified that defendant took her purse, which contained $700 in cash. After defendant filed his notice of appeal, the Legislature amended section 487, subdivision (a) to define grand theft as the taking of property worth more than $950. (Stats. 2010, ch. 693, \u00a7 1.) Because defendant\u2019s conviction for grand theft is not yet final, he contends he is entitled to the benefit of the amendment and his conviction should be reduced to petty theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">In <em>People v. Vinson </em>(2011) 193 Cal.App.4th 1190 [123 Cal.Rptr.3d 625], the court considered the issue of retroactivity in the context of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1151\">*1151</page-number>legislative amendment that, like the amendment in the present case, redefined the elements of a criminal offense. In <em>Vinson, </em>prior to finality of the defendant\u2019s conviction for petty theft with a prior (\u00a7 666), the Legislature amended the statute to require proof of at least three prior convictions, not just one, for individuals like the defendant. <em>(Vinson, </em>at p. 1194.) In the absence of any express directive from the Legislature <em>(id. </em>at p. 1196), the court concluded that the statute was retroactive <em>(id. </em>at p. 1199). The court followed <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740, 748 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948], which held, \u201cwhere the amendatory statute mitigates punishment and there is no saving clause, the rule is that the amendment will operate retroactively so that the lighter punishment is imposed.\u201d The <em>Vinson </em>court reasoned that the amendment to section 666 \u201chad the effect of mitigating punishment by raising the level of recidivism required before a defendant can be sentenced to state prison.\u201d <em>(Vinson, </em>at p. 1199.) Applying the amendment retroactively also was consistent with the legislative intent \u201cto save money and space in order to partially offset the higher costs and inmate population occasioned by increasing sentences for sexual predators.\u201d <em>(Ibid.) </em>The court explained: \u201cIn light of the concerns expressed in the legislative history about prison overcrowding and the costs associated with the act, and the fact the cost avoidance achieved by shifting some nonviolent, non-sex-offender recidivists to the county correctional level will not completely offset the new costs [citation], it would make no sense to conclude the section 666 amendment should apply only concurrently with the remaining provisions of the act, i.e., prospectively.\u201d <em>(Vinson, </em>at p. 1199.)</p>\n<p id=\"b959-5\">The same reasoning applies in the present case. An August 3, 2010, Senate Rules Committee analysis provided the following argument in support of the amendment to section 487: \u201cAccording to the author\u2019s office . . . \u2018existing law sets the minimum threshold for grand theft at $400. This amount has not been indexed for inflation and has not been adjusted since 1982. Last year, we adjusted the threshold for 39 property crimes but did not adjust grand theft. ...[]\u25a1... AB 2372 adjusts the threshold amount for the first time in a generation, taking into consideration these inflationary factors, and sets the amount at $950. ... In 2009, the Department of Corrections estimated savings of $68.4 million dollars for the 2010/11 Budget if all property crimes were adjusted for inflation. Leaving the grand theft threshold unchanged undermines these savings. The Department estimates there will be 2,152 fewer defendants sent to state prison for these property crimes by December 2011 if AB [2372] is enacted into law.\u2019 \u201d (Sen. Rules Com., Off. of Sen. Floor Analyses, 3d reading analysis of Assem. Bill No. 2372 (2009-2010 Reg. Sess.) as amended Mar. 11, 2010, pp. 2-3.) Similar to the circumstances in <em>Vinson, </em>the 2010 amendment to section 487 mitigated punishment by raising the value of the stolen property required to establish the crime of grand theft, and the Legislature was motivated by a desire to save money by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1152\">*1152</page-number>avoiding sentencing certain defendants to prison. In the absence of an express statement to the contrary, we conclude the Legislature intended that the amendment to section 487 be applied retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">In their brief on appeal, the People do not address the merits of defendant\u2019s argument that the amendment to section 487 applies retroactively. Instead, the People argue that, even if the theft of $700 is no longer a legal basis for the conviction for grand theft, the conviction need not be reversed because the evidence showed that defendant took the purse from Jane Doe II\u2019s person, which is an alternate basis to sustain the grand theft conviction. However, the evidence on that issue was equivocal. After some difficulty remembering and after reviewing the police report, Jane Doe II testified on direct examination that she grabbed the purse while it was on the ground and defendant pulled it away from her. On cross-examination, she testified that she \u201chad it,\u201d but she admitted she did not remember how she got it.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">The circumstances in the present case are analogous to those in <em>People v. Green </em>(1980) 27 Cal.3d 1 [164 Cal.Rptr. 1, 609 P.2d 468], where the court stated, \u201cwhen the prosecution presents its case to the jury on alternate theories, some of which are legally correct and others legally incorrect, and the reviewing court cannot determine from the record on which theory the ensuing general verdict of guilt rested, the conviction cannot stand.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 69, overruled on other grounds in <em>People v. Martinez </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 225, 239 [83 Cal.Rptr.2d 533, 973 P.2d 512] and <em>People </em>v. <em>Hall </em>(1986) 41 Cal.3d 826, 834 &amp; fn. 3 [226 Cal.Rptr. 112, 718 P.2d 99]; accord, <em>People v. Guiton </em>(1993) 4 Cal.4th 1116, 1122 [17 Cal.Rptr.2d 365, 847 P.2d 45] <em>(Guiton); People v. Gutierrez </em>(2009) 174 Cal.App.4th 515, 523 [94 Cal.Rptr.3d 228].) In <em>People </em>v. <em>Chun </em>(2009) 45 Cal.4th 1172, 1203 [91 Cal.Rptr.3d 106, 203 P.3d 425], the court clarified that, to affirm a conviction where a jury has been presented both valid and invalid theories, \u201ca reviewing court must conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury based its verdict on a legally valid theory . . . .\u201d (See also <em>Guiton, </em>at p. 1129 [where the jury has been presented with a legally incorrect theory, reversal is required \u201cabsent a basis in the record to find that the verdict was actually based on a valid ground\u201d].) Here, the jury was presented with two theories of grand theft\u2014the taking of property worth over $400 and the taking of property from the person of the victim. The conviction can be sustained on appeal only if the verdict rested on the theory that the purse was taken from the person of Jane Doe II. Because we cannot conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury relied on that valid theory in finding defendant guilty, the conviction for grand theft must be reversed. We will modify the judgment to reflect a conviction of the lesser included offense of petty theft (\u00a7\u00a7 484, 488) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1153\">*1153</page-number>and remand to the trial court for resentencing.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> (See \u00a7\u00a7 1181, subd. 6, 1260; <em>People </em>v. <em>Navarro </em>(2007) 40 Cal.4th 668, 675-678 [54 Cal.Rptr.3d 766, 151 P.3d 1177].)</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">IV. <em>Remand Is Appropriate on the Issue of Presentence Conduct Credits</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">The judgment on count 1 is reversed with directions as follows: If the People do not bring the defendant to trial within 60 days after the filing of the remittitur in the trial court pursuant to section 1382, the trial court shall proceed as if the remittitur constituted a modification of the judgment to reflect a conviction of petty theft (\u00a7\u00a7 484, 488) and shall resentence the defendant accordingly, including the determination of presentence conduct credits. (See <em>People v. Edwards, supra, </em>39 Cal.3d at p. 118.) Following resentencing, the trial court is directed to send an amended abstract of judgment to the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation.
