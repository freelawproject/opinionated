J. </em>and <em>Smith J.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b484-13\">The declaration stated that the plaintiff on the <em>1st </em>of <em>October </em>1793, was seized and possessed of a newly erected sawmill with its appurtenances, in the township of <em>Northampton </em>situated on tbe soil and freehold of the plaintiff, adjoining to a certain stream or rivulet running and flowing to this sawmill, of which stream of water he was entitled to, and ought to have the use for the purpose of turning his mill: \u2014 that the defendant on the <em>1st </em>of <em>October </em>aforesaid, and at divers times between that day and the lsf of <em>August </em>1794 byfmeans of dams &amp;c. stopped a great part of the water from running in this its accustomed course, so as to prevent the'working of the saw-mill by which the plaintiff was deprived of the use of it &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b484-14\">To this declaration the defendant pleaded <em>not guilty.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b484-15\">On the trial it appeared by the evidence, in addition to what was stated in the declaration, that <em>Merritt </em>owned lands upon both sides of the north branch of the <em>Sancocus Creek </em>\u2019which is a publick highway: that <em>Parker </em>also owned land below <em>Merritt </em>on the same stream, and had for many years a mill upon the stream; and under the authority of the legislature, had erected a dam- across the creek for the purpose of obtaining a head of water sufficient to turn his mill. It further appeared, that <em>'Merritt </em>in the spring of the year 1793 cut a small trench from the dreek, through his own land, by which he conducted a portion of the water into a small natural rivulet, which ran through his farm, and which in conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>qv/ncc o\u00ed this additional supply of water, was sufficient to gum the saw-mill which he had erected. This rivulet emptied u;;d\u00a3 through a \u00abmall neck <em>o\u00ed Parker's </em>land, and. fell into main creek below <em>Parker's </em>mill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b485-3\">Ouc of the witnesses who was brought forward was our <em>yohn Mullen, </em>who being sworn on his <em>voir dire </em>declared he had no interest in the suit, and should not be affected however ie xnight terminate; he stated however that lie was the: lessee of <em>Parker's </em>mill, but <em>Parker </em>was to indemnify him against any injury which he might sustain from <em>Merritt's </em>mill. The <em>court </em>declared he could not be permitted to give evidence upon the question whether there was sufficient water to turn born mills, but allowed him to prove other matters which Jid not affect his interest or possession. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b485-9\"><em>Griffith </em>and <em>R.

In this case it appeared clearly from the testimony, that by taking the water out of .the creek, no injury accrued to <em>Parker's </em>mill, because there was sufficient water for the supply of both; and <em>secondly </em>that in adding water to the rivulet no damage was occasioned, because the only part of the laud through which this stream ran, was of no value, and was not applied to any use. If therefore the plaintiff in applying this water so as to subserve his own interests and views, did not occasion any detriment to the defendant, he was perfectly justified by the law in so employing it; and if <em>Parker </em>actually received no damage, any attempt to throw the water back upon <em>Merritt's </em>land, so as to stop bis mill, was an outrage of a most unjustifiable nature, occasioned by his haired to his neighbour, and clearly punishable by the law.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b486-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number><em>Read </em>and <em>Woodruff </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Alax\">If <em>Parker </em>was author\u00bb ized to erect the dam across the <em>Rancocus, </em>of which there could be no doubt under the act of the legislature, this gave-him a property in the water thus raised, and no one had a right under the pretence that there was a superabundance of water, to draw off a portion of it for his own use. Upon the other part of the case the law is equally with the defendant, and the reason of the thing perfectly manifest. Whatever might be the value of this land to <em>Parker, </em>it is not a matter upon which the plaintiff has any right to determine. The law prohibits any violation of the property of another, any infringement of his rights; and it does not permit the person \u25a0who has committed outrages to shelter himself under the plea, that the person whose rights he has invaded has sustained no injury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b486-6\">If this act of <em>Merritt's </em>was tortious, if he occasioned a larger quantity of water thail usual to flow over the land of Parker, the latter was perfectly justifiable in providing against the consequences of this act by the erection of banks or dams, even though they should occasion a reflow of the water upon <em>Merritt's </em>land.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> Note. \u2014 It is presumed that the rule of evidence adopted b&gt; the court is now altogether exploded, and that if a witness is not interested in the event of the suit, he is competent: the interest in \u00bflie <em>question </em>goes only to his credit.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AE3\">delivered the following charge to the jury, which was fully concurred in by <em>Smith J.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">The action which you have been impanelled to.try, is an action on the case in which the plaintiff declares, that on the 1 <em>st </em>of <em>October </em>1793 he was possessed of a newly erected sawmill, on his own soil and freehold, and \u00e1djoining to a certain stream running and flowing through the same, of which rivulet he ought to have the free and uninterrupted use for the purpose of turning his mill. That the defendant on the said <em>1st </em>of October, and at divers times between that day and the <em>1st </em>of <em>August </em>1794, stopped a great part of the water of this stream, so as to clog the mill and prevent its being made use of. For the injury thus sustained the present suit is brought, and he demands damages proportionate to its amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">This is a summary of the plaintiff\u2019s case as stated in the declaration; to this declaration the defendant has pleaded <em>not </em>guilty, so that the question for your determination is, whether the defendant has done any injury to the plaintiff which will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>support this action, and if he has, what compensation in damages the plaintiff ought to recover,</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">The determination of the first question seems to involve \u00a1\u25a0ome important principles of law, as well aa facts. Upon a subject which appears to be attended with no small difficulty, It is not easy to lay down upon a sudden, principles not open to some kind of objection, and which will tend to guard and preserve the just rights of all.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">In general it may be observed, when a man purchases a piece of land through which a natural water-course flows, he lias a right to make use of it in its natural state, but not to stop or divert it to the prejudice of another. <em>Aqua </em>currit, <em>et debet cur rere </em>is the language of the law. The water flows in its natural channel, and ought always to be permitted to run there, so that all through whose land it pursues its natural course, may continue to enjoy the privilege of using it for their own purposes. It cannot legally be diverted from its course without the consent of all who have an interest in it. If it should be turned into another channel, or stopped, and ibis illegal step should be persisted in, I should think a jurjr right in giving almost any valuation which the party thus injured should think proper to affix to it. This principle lies at the bottom of all the cases which I have met with, and It is so perfectly reasonable in itself, and at the same lime so firmly settled as a doctrine of the law, that it should never be abandoned or departed from.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">The facts which have appeared from the evidence, so fax as it is necessary to stele them, in order to render those remarks which it is thought proper to make intelligible, are as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">It appears that <em>Parker </em>the defendant, previous to the erection of <em>Merritt\u2019s </em>mill, or the digging of the tremh which has led to this suit, had erected a dam on a branch of the <em>M ceneneus </em>in order to raise a head of water sufficient to turn a sawmill which he had before built; and that he had for se\\ oral years been in possession of this dam, saw-mill, and the water raised by the dam, as far as the nature of tbe thing admits of possession, without any appearance of dissatisfaction or com\u00bb plaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>It appears that in tac year <em>it\"92 Merritt </em>had a design \u00f3&gt; build another saw-mill, and to avail himself of the dam already erected by <em>Parker </em>and the water raised by it. In order to effect this, he cut a trench through his own land from the water in the dam, so as to convey a part of it into a small rivulet also in his own land, for the purpose of turning the mill which he either had then erected or intended to erect. This rivulet, or small stream, it is further to be observed passed through a part of <em>Par kept </em>land before it disembogued itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">These facts have not been disputed by either party. On examining the Acts of Assembly, it appears, that in <em>May </em>1793. <em>Parker </em>obtained an act of the Legislature confirming the dam which he had built upon the <em>Rancocus\u2019, </em>but by the terms of this law, he is not to do any injury to the publish or-to individuals, and for every injury which may be occasioned by this dam, he is answerable in damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">From this statement of the circumstances, I am satisfied that <em>Parker </em>was possessed of the mill-dam, and of the water retained by that dam, as early as the year 1780; at ant rate long before the erection of the plaintiff\u2019s mill, and before the cutting of the trench for the purpose of drawing the water out of the dam. The questions arising from these facts, and upon which you are to determine, are, \u2014 had the plaintiff a right to cut the canal in question, and draw <em>the water </em>out of the defendant\u2019s pond? If he had, \u2014 had he a right to force more water over the defendant\u2019s land than would natural!;run over it? \u2014 and whether the defendant had not a right to resist him in a step of .this kind, by the erections of any works whatever upon his own land calculated to effect ibis object? These questions are minutely connected with each other; \u2014 and upon the determination which you shall give to them or some of them, the present action depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">For my own part I confess, that if what some if not all the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses have sworn be true, that there is water sufficient for both mills, and that the defendant sustained but little if any injury by the passage of the water through his land, I should have been happy if a compromise could have beet?, made, and this suit prevented by a friendly arrangment. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>Wishes of this kind, however, are useless now, because neither the Court nor the jury can prescribe the terms oi a compromise, and it should not be permitted to operate upon our minds. We are called upon to carry the law into execution, and further than this we have no concern in the disputes between the parties. It becomes necessary' therefore to state to you the law which is applicable to the occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">Upon the best consideration which it has been in our power to bestow upon the subject since the commencement of the trial, we are of opinion that the plaintiff had no right to cut' the trench or canal, and thus to draw out the water, which the defendant by the erection of the dam had appropriated to his own use, and had acquired a property in, some time before.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Should this however be doubtful, and admitting the plaintiff had a right to use the water, and to cut the trench in order to enable him to use it, still we think, that he could not exercise his right in such a manner as to cause the flow of an additional quantity of water over the defendant's land without his consent,</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">Further, we think, that if one man by any contrivance causes to flow over the land of another a greater quantity of wa~ ?er than it is naturally subjected to, against his will, or without his consent\u00ed such other has a legal right to resort to any device, or may erect any banks, dams &amp;c. on his own land, to prevent ibis additional current of wateri and if any consequences injurious to the first wrong-doer result from this course, he roust submit to them, and cannot recover compensation iu damages. In the present case it is impossible that <em>Parker </em>could discriminate between the water that was drawn from the creek, and that which belonged naturally to the rivuletj neither could he prevent the one from flowing into his land without keeping- out the other also.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">It is unreasonable, and the doctrine cannot be countenanced \u201e that when one has erected a dam, and at a considerable expense has appropriated water to his own use, another person by' cutting a canal shall be permitted to diminish his supply,, and avail himself of the labour and work of the original owner, without defraying any portion of the expense that had been inemredj or undertaking to assist in keeping these works in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>repair. It would be equally unreasonable that one man should have aright to turn mors water over the land of his neighbour than would naturally go in that direction; and so far as regards the right, it is altogether immaterial whether it may be productive of benefit or injury. No one has a right to compel another to have his property improved in a particular mannerj it is as illegal to force him to receive a benefit as to submit to an injury.</p>\n<headnotes id=\"Ab7\">Note. See <em>Palmer et al. v. </em>Mulligan. <em>et al. </em>3 Caines Rep. 30V. and <em>Suckrider et al. v. Beers et al. </em>10 Johns. 241. <em>Bealy v. Shaw, </em>S East 208. <em>Brissel v. Sholl </em>4 Dali. 211.</headnotes>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In the light therefore in which we view this subject, whether the drawing of the water from the pond by means of the trench, or the causing an additional quantity of water to flow through the lands of the defendant, was productive of benefit or injury, are in my opinion, questions into which we have no right to examine. It is sufficient that the plaintiff \u2022pursued a course not warranted by the law; and the defendant has only adopted measures to prevent the consequences of this first act from affecting his own property, and our opinion is, that he was authorized by the law to do what he has done.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-12\">Verdict <em>for Defendant,</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
