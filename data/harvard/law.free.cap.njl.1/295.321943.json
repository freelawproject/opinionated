Ogden </em>and <em>Woodruff </em>contended</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ake\">that this award was void \u2014 1st. Because it was not final \u2014 the arbitrators not having decided the title which was submitted to them. 2d. Because it was uncertain \u2014 awarding the land to be \u201c the proper-[256]-ty of Charles Coxe,\u201d did not declare what right he had, and the expression is not descriptive of any legal title. 3d. They award it to be his, because part of 6,230, not saying what, or where situated, so as to bring it within the submission. They cited <em>Kyd on Awards </em>117, <em>(old ed.) </em>170, 176, <em>(Phil, ed.); </em>8 <em>Co. </em>89, <em>Baspole\u2019s case.</em></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b320-6\"><em>B. Stockton </em>and <em>Leake, contra.</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHEK\">The award is sufficiently certain, and within the express words of the submission. They awarded the land to be the <em>properly </em>of Coxe, and order Lundy to deliver him the possession. The word property must be taken in its most extensive signification, according to its ordinary acceptation, and carries with it the entire estate. At any rate the possession is submitted, and that is ordered to be delivered to Coxe. Awards are not now examined with the same strictness as formerly \u2014 they are liberally construed ; and, therefore, this mode of terminating differences has become eminently beneficial and convenient. <em>Kyd </em>154, <em>&amp;c., (old ed.) </em>228, <em>&amp;c., (Phil. ed.)</em></p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b320-7\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"Aep\">The counsel on the part of the defendant appear to consider it as necessary for the arbitrators to make use of technical language in order to express their meaning. This was formerly required by the courts; but in modern times a greater\" latitude and more liberality has been found beneficial to all parties, and common words are sufficient; their meaning is to be expounded according to the intentions of the arbitrators, appearing on the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-8\">The submission is general \u2014 of right, title and possession; the award, that it is the property of Coxe. Now, admitting that the word property is not particularly and specifically ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>propriated to any one kind of estate, still it is so far clear that it shows some title; to the possession especially, for the delivery of that immediately follows, and should have been performed. It may, for aught that appears, be the whole dispute between the parties. What estate belongs to Coxe under this award, is not the question before us. It appears that he had some right to the laud, which the arbitrators thought ought to be delivered to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Rule discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">Cited <em>in Imlay </em>v. <em>Wikoff, </em>1 <em>South. </em>139 ; <em>Hazen </em>v. <em>Addis, </em>2 <em>Gr. </em>337.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
