An <em>accord </em>must be pleaded and cannot be given in evidence upon the general issue. An agreement that under certain conditions one shall have the land confers no title until such conditions \u00a9re-performed.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-8\">THIS was au action brought to recover the mesne profits of certain lands, from April 1788, till November 1791, valued at <em>\u00a3 SO per annum. </em>Plea <em>not guilty.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-9\"><em>- </em>The plaintiff offered the judgment roll inthe.ejectmcuc case by which it appeared the demise was laid April <em>&amp; th </em>1788, judgment signed November <em>10th </em>1792. The value of th\u00a9 property was proved as laid in the declaration, and the possession of defendant was admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b194-10\">The defence set up was, that the defendant had come into possession of the premises under a deed from his father; that an ejectment was brought by plaintiff and an agreement made between the parties that <em>Ketcham </em>should remain in possession on condition he paid a certain debt due by his father, and if he did not discharge the debt within a year the plaintiff should have the land.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-11\"><em>Stockton </em>objected to the reading of the agreement to the jury,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AzH\">because it was conditional, and the condition had never -been -performed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-12\"><em>Frelinghuysen </em>contra'</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AZp\">The objection goes to the effect of the testimony, not to its competency.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b194-13\">Per Cur.</author>\n<p id=\"AlM\">The agreement is evidence; it is improper to give an opinion on the operation of it at present.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">It appeared that by this agreement <em>Ketcham </em>bound himself in the penalty of ,\u00a3500 to perform the conation or to deliver up the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-15\"><em>Frelinghuysen </em>contended that the defendant' being in by-title was not compellable to pay the mesne profits. He cited the opinion of the <em>Chief Justice </em>11 Co. 51. <em>Liford\u2019s </em>case.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-16\">The <em>Chief Justice </em>in his charge to the jury, said \u2014 That this w,as an action of trespass for the recovery of the mesne <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>profits of certain lands, which the plaintiff recovered some time since in an ejectment, and it is immaterial whether the judgment vas on a verdict or by confession,.- \u2014 It appears that during the pendency of this action of ejectment, an agreement was entered into by the parties, by which each undertook to perform certain things, and were to receive certain benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-9\">This agreement is offered in evidence to bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in the present action. There is no doubt that the defendant has performed certain parts of this agreement, and that some equally material parts, particularly that on condi\u00bb tion of which he was to have the land, viz. the payment of the money has not been performed. The question is whether' without this performance the defendant is entitled to the bene\u00bb \u00f1i of the agreement, and can bar the plaintiff\u2019s recovery in this action. If he is, this absurdity follows, that he is equally benefited whether he performs what he has undertaken or does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-10\">This agreement should not have been allowed to go to the jury without being pleaded, upon the present issue it is not evidence, but this objection equally escaped the attention of the counsel and the court at the time it was offered. If this agreement has any operation it is as an <em>accord </em>which the law considers as of no validity without performance; and If a man wishes to have the benefit of an agreement of this nature, it it; reasonable and proper that he should in the first place make it appear that he has executed what he undertook to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-11\">It ill becomes a man who comes to claim the benefit of a contract, to be unable to say, he has performed the agree\u00bb naent himself: to apply for the enforcement of his advem sary, when he himself has been equally negligent. The law should compel every one to perform stipulations into which ha has voluntarily entered, and unless this is done .should not aid him in compelling others.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-12\">As to the law upon the subject of the mesne profits I take, it to be clear, that in all cases whatsoever, where a man makes use of the land of another, whether he enters by virtue of a, deed or otherwise, he is compellable to account for it to the true owner, and the only manner in which he can possibly be exonerated from khis demand is by some <em>apt </em>of release by such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>owner. The agreement in question does not however in any manner operate as a bar to the plaintiff\u2019s action^ nor until the condition is fully complied with by the defendant can such an implication be supported.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
