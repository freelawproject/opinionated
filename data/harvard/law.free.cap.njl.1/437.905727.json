J. </em>and <em>Smith J.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-11\">On the evidence it appeared the tenant claimed title under <em>Joseph English </em>the brother of <em>Isaac English </em>the demandant's husband. <em>Thomas English </em>the father of <em>Isaac </em>and <em>Joseph </em>was seised of the premises in question, and had conveyed, them to Joseph, who entered upon the lands, and continued in possession until the date of his conveyance to <em>Wright </em>about ten years since. Subsequent to this deed from the father to Joseph, <em>Isaac </em>became insolvent and was thrown into prison by his creditors. He there produced to them another deed of a prior date from his father to himself, which however appeared to be a conditional conveyance. It appeared, however that the condition had never been performed, that-<em>Isaac </em>was present at the execution of the deed from his father to Joseph, had acquiesced in the conveyance, and actually consented to receive other land from his father in lieu of this which had been conditionally given him, \u2014 and that he was called upon at the time of the execution of this last conveyance to give up the deed to himself which however he alleged was lost. The creditors not being informed of any of these circumstances which tended to invalidate the first deed, took out execution, levied upon the premises as the property of <em>Isaac </em>together with other lands belonging to him, and the whole were sold by the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b461-12\"><em>Joseph </em>attended at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and with a view of purchasing in and extinguishing this pretended claim, boughs the whole of the land, and took a deed from the sheriff,.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number><em>3ftlhahie </em>for the demandant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A5W\">contended that <em>Joseph </em>having recognized the title of <em>Isaac </em>by the purchase from the sheriff, ought not to be permitted to set up a prior title in himself to oust the widow of her dower: \u2014 so far as regarded her claim, he was estopped from saying her husband was not seised.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b462-8\"><em>Griffith </em>and i?. <em>Stockton </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahfp\">Estoppels are ever odious in the law, and under any circumstances they operate only between parties to a deed. <em>Joseph </em>made this purchase and accepted a conveyance from the sheriff as a matter of prudence to avoid controversies, and to silence every pretence of a deficiency in his title; \u2014 and it^l' in the highest degree unjust that the widow should, when her husband was notin any manner entitled to this\u00bbproperty, found a title upon an act of the brother which was in itself perfectly innocent and prudent.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b462-9\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"ATj\">The demandant must recover. <em>Joseph </em>has received a deed under her husband and this amounts to sufficient proof of seisin, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>With regard to the merits of <em>Isaac\u2019s </em>title, she is not bound to prove it; <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it is altogether immaterial in an action for dower. There are circumstances of hardship it is true, but it must be recollected that it would lead widows into great difficulties, if they were to be cut out by a prior title, after the person setting up such title had accepted a deed under the husband.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">Verdict <em>for demandant.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b462-11\"><em> </em>Note. \u2014 See the case of <em>Jackson Ex-dem.
