The declaration stated that this endorsement was made at the special instance and request and to the use of the said Baldwin, and the note with the endorsement so as aforesaid made was delivered to <em>Baldwin </em>on the faith of a special agreement and undertaking by him that he would secure the payment of the sum specified in the note, or the value thereof to <em>O'-Brian </em>when he should be thereunto afterwards requested. Notice was given of the said endorsement to <em>Brotan. </em>The <em>%d </em>count stated that in consideration of so much money having been paid, laid out, and expended for the use of the said <em>Baldwin </em>and at his special instance and request he promised &amp;c. <em>3d </em>For the balance of an account stated.

A. 0\u2018B.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b443-11\">It was proved! <em>by two </em>witnesses that this assignment was made at the request of <em>Baldwin, </em>that it was delivered by OBrian to him, and he promised that he would pay OBrian the amount, and the question was whether under these circumstances and these pleadings the plaintiff ought to be non-suited,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b443-12\"><em>Ea. Boudhiot </em>for the nonsuit,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9C\">The first count in the declaration states a special case which must be proved as laid. Two facts are there stated to which there has been no evidence, and which it was essential for him to prove before he can legally recover in the present action. <em>1st </em>That the assignment was made to the use of <em>Baldwin. %d </em>That the plaintiff below gave <em>notice </em>of the assignment to <em>Brown </em>the drawer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b443-13\">It is perfectly immaterial whether it was or was not necessary for the plaintiff to state the contract circumstantially, but the rule is imperative that if he undertakes to plead the facts he is bound to make his <em>probata </em>correspond with his allegata. These facts as he has represented them enter into the very essence of the contract, and the contract which he lias proved is materially variant. <em>Lord Mansfield </em>in the case of <em>Bristsn it. </em>Wright, <em>hough </em>667. though evidently inclined <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>to overrule the objection, which he had before overruled <em>In </em>a previous stage of the case, felt himself compelled to adhere to the strict rules of pleading and declared it to be fatal.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-6\">This case however is stronger, the circumstances here stated constitute the ground of the undertaking by <em>Baldwin </em>&gt; He is alleged to have promised in consideration of the premises. Every fact therefore which had been previously stated is expressly made a part of the consideration of the assumption, and however unimportant they may be in themselves must be proved. The plaintiff has therefore failed i\u00bb making out of his case; he has counted upon an agreement and proved another variant from it in essential points.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-7\">Another variance between the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>is still more important. The note which he states to have been assigned to Benjamhi'Coe, he states was wholly unpaid at the time of his endorsement, all the money was by the endorsement ordered to be paid to the assignee. The note which has been shown in evidence bears two receipts upon it of part payment anterior in date to the assignment. It cannot be presumed that this was the note declared upon. In <em>Buller\u2019s N. P. </em>145. a variance much less important was held to be fatal. The agreement declared upon was to sell the plaintiff all his merchandizable skins, that which was proved and signed by the defendant corresponded with it precisely, yet because an agreement of the same date entered, on defendant\u2019s books and signed by the plaintiff, was to sell all his merchandizable <em>Calf </em>skins, the plaintiff was nonsuited.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-8\">The case of the plaintiff is essentially defective in another particular under the statute of frauds. By that statute <em>sec. </em>3. no action shall be brought to charge any defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt, default or miscarriage of another unless the agreement upon which such action is founded shall be reduced to writing and signed by the parties. The c\u00e1se of <em>pish v. Hutchinson </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>shows that contracts similar to that under consideration have been considered as clearly within th\u00bb terms of the statute. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>381.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b444-9\">Where the promises are mutual, and the one in consideration of the other the plaintiff must allege performance of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>promise on Ms part; here the undertaking to pay was in consideration of the endorsement, and it is not stated that the endorsement was actually made previous to the demand. <em>Collins Gibbs, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-3\">Independent however of these objections to the contract itself and the manner in which it is stated in the pleadings there is no legal breach of his undertaking by the defendant laid in the declaration. On a promise to pay a collateral sum on. request a <em>smpius requisiius </em>will not be sufficient, a special request must be stated and proved. <em>Butler </em>N. <em>P. </em>157'.. <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b445-4\">Aa\u00ab <em>Ogden </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ACYn\">After a verdict has passed between the parties the court will infer circumstances which must necessarily have been proved before a recovery could have been had, and will reject as immaterial such averments in the pleadings as it was not essential should have been set forth.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b445-5\">The objection <em>is </em>that the declaration stated the assignment to have been made for the use of defendant. If the plaintiff endorsed the note at his request and in consequence of his promise to pay the amount, it is perfectly immaterial to whose use it was to enure. To support an action of assumpsit the consideration may be either some positive benefit to the defendant, or inconvenience or loss to the plaintiff. The plaintiff in this case has parted with his claim upon <em>Broivn </em>at the defendant\u2019s request, and this being stated in the declaration the ground of the action is complete and the plaintiff\u2019s rights are not to be forfeited by the mere introduction of a superfluous allegation. The notice of the assignment was also unimportant, but if essential may be presumed to have been proved at the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>The note was proved to have been actually delivered to the defendant^ when he was asked for the money he offered to pay half; on the ground that it was a hard case he endeavoured to avoid paying the whole. This is also satisfactory evidence of an actual request, and an acknowledgment by the defendant that up to that period every thing was regular and the plaintiff\u2019s title to the money was good.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-6\">The objection founded upon the statute of frauds is inapplicable. By a solemn adjudication in this court prior to the revolution, that statute has been held not to extend to this state, and much property and many rights depend upon an adherence to that decision. The opinions of <em>Lord Chancellor </em>King, and of <em>Sir Dudley Ryder </em>which are known to have been taken upon the question are entitled to considerable weight, and they are confirmed by those of some of the most eminent counsel in New-Jersey. The question may therefore be considered as settled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-7\">But the statute does not embrace a case of this description. It was a purchase of a note which is a negotiable instrument; and the assumpsit was to pay the consideration of the assignment which was a new debt. The agreement was also in part performed by the endorsement, and the case is therefore entirely out of the statute.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-8\">The objection that the <em>licet scepius requisitas </em>is insufficient is founded upon the same error as the preceding. The undertaking is not a collateral but an original one, originating in but entirely independent of the note from <em>Brown,</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-9\">This however is at best a mere technical defect of pleading, and' the court would if there was any necessity for it presume after verdict that a special request was proved. But such a presumption is unnecessary here, because one of the witnesses expressly swore that <em>Baldwin </em>was called upon for the money and that so far from denying his liability he said it was a hard case, that the loss ought to be divided and that he was willing to pay half the amount demanded.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b446-10\">The objection is at any rate too late after verdict, it should have been taken advantage of by demurrer* defects of this kind are cured by verdict.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b444-10\"> 2 Wils. <em>94.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b445-6\"><em> </em>2 Burr. 899.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b445-7\"> Note. \u2014 This rule is correctly and perspicuously stated 1 Selwyn\u2019s N. P. 94. when it is said \u201c It is observable that when the defendant is chargeable, upon a collateral promise to pay, \u00a9mit or do some act upon request, and not for a mere debt or duty, an actual request ought to be made before action brought, and consequently it ought to be averred in the declaration, and the day, year, and place where the request was made must be expressed; Ibr in tins case the request is parcel of the case.\u201d <em>Birks v. Tripped </em>1 Saund 33 <em>n. </em>3. <em>Rushton v. </em>Aspinall <em>Dougl. 679.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b446-11\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AuIx\">None of the objections which have been made go to the justice of the case or affect the equity of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>claim. The merits are clearly with the plaintiff\u2019 and there is no question but that he may recover the entire amount of the verdict in another action, should it be adjudged that the pleadings are defective. \u201c judges ought\u201d to use the language of <em>Lord Mansfield </em>\u201c to lean against <em>every </em>attempt to nonsuit a plaintiff upon objections which have no relation to the real merits: much more when the plaintiff is clearly entitled to recover upon the merits, and must recover in another action. It is unconscionable in a defendant to take advantage of the <em>apices liligandi </em>to turn a plaintiff round where his demand is just. Against such objections every possible presumption ought to be made which ingenuity can suggest.\u201d 3 <em>Burr, </em>12&amp;3.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">These are the principles which ought to govern courts in all cases of applications of this nature. But this case is still stronger here a verdict has passed between the parties, the questions of fact, which might have appeared questionable on the mere pleadings are settled and reduced to a certainty by the decision of a jury, and no attempt has been made to impugn the righteousness of their determination. In <em>Goslin </em>v. <em>Wilcock </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the court refused to grant a new trial where a material averment was omitted in the declaration because the verdict was right upon the merits; and <em>Lord Camden </em>says \u201c as the justice and equity of the cause is on the side of the \u201c verdict we ought not to grant a new trial,\u201d In <em>Sampson v. Appleyard </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Nares J. </em>said \u201c The court never grants a new trial when they clearly see the merits have been fairly and fully tried.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Enough appears upon the pleadings to show the foundations of the present claim. The defendant will always be able to plead this recovery in bar of another action on the same ground. This we consider as the true inquiry in the case <em>( </em>3 <em>Burr. 1590.) </em>and when that appears we will look no further.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Judgment affirmed.,</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b447-9\"> <em>% </em>Wils. 302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b447-10\"> 3 Wils. <em>273.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
