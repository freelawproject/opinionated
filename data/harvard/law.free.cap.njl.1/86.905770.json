The plaintiffs case, as stated and proved, was, that on the <em>27ttif </em>uly 1780, <em>Barnet, </em>by general words in the common form assigned to plaintiff a sealed bill, of one <em>Baumans </em>for <em>\u00a370 </em>payable in 1778, for which plaintiff paid him <em>\u00a3 </em>3100 in continental currency, as appeared by <em>Barnefs </em>receipt for the money. About two years after the assignment, the plaintiff brought an action against Bauman, and proceeded to judgment and execution; but failed in recovering the money, as <em>Bauman </em>had become insolvent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b110-10\">This action was brought to recover back the consideration paid for the note, upon the ground of an implied assumpsit,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-11\">\n<em>Woodruff and Frelinghuysen for defendant,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcT\">Upon the opening of the cause, objected to the offering the bill and assignment in evidence, contending that upon a general assignment, of a bill or <em>chose in </em>action, that no implied warranty arose: that it was a purchase unless the contrary was expressly stipulated, and then an action must be framed on the special agreement. <em>The court </em>however admitted the evidence, holding that upon a general assignment of a bill or bond, the assignor would be liable to refund the consideration, if upon due diligence used by the assignee,**it proved irrecoverable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b110-12\">On the part of the defendant it was <em>first </em>contended that there had teen laches in the assignee, by which the money was lost. <em>Second. </em>That it was a mere purchase of the note,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> the plaintiff being willing to exchange bad money for a doubtful security. <em>Tfyird. </em>That it was expressly agreed at the time of assigning the note, that the plaintiff should put it immediately in suit, and take it at his own risk.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b110-13\">\n<em>Kirkpatrick and Stockton for plaintiff,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUG\">objected to the evidence, respecting the terms on which the plaintiff took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>assignment; contending that it was going out of the assignment, and varying the instrument, or the construction arising from the instrument, as it stood. That if the defendant meant to put any terms, or impose any liability on the plaintiff beyond his responsibility on a general assignment, it ought to have been stated in the assignment: that it never was heard of that after endorsing a note generally, the endorser could, when prosecuted, by the endorsee, set up a special agreement, to overthrow the general operation of the endorsement; and that in this respect there could be no difference between a note and a bill. They insisted that the parties must be bound by the operation of the assignment: as it stood, it was clear and explicit; the evidence offered, went to annex a qualification to the instrument, directly repugnant to the construction resulting from the <em>face </em>of it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b111-3\">Kinsey C. J. <em>and </em>Smith J. thought the evidence admissible. Chetwood <em>J. contra.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-4\">Kinsey C. J. charged the jury that by the general operation of the assignment, <em>Barnet </em>would be liable, unless upon the evidence, it appeared, either, first, that there was an agreement to the contrary at the time; or <em>second,, </em>that the debt had been lost by the negligence of plaintiff in not suing. He said that the delay of two years was certainly not admissible, unless <em>Mehelm </em>had accounted for it, by proving that <em>Barnet </em>had himself been the cause of it. The general doctrine of assignees was, that they must use all proper and reasonable diligence to recover the money on the assignment; if not, and the debtor fails, tbe loss must be borne by the assignee. What is reasonable time, is not settled in New-Jersey: from the nature of business, and other circumstances, no precise rule has been, or perhaps can be laid down; but certainly two years is more than reasonable time, unless it can be account - ed for as arising from the conduct of <em>Barnet </em>the ass'gnoiv The jury found a <em>verdict </em>for the <em>defendant.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b111-5\">The counsel for the plaintiff obtained a rule to show cause,, why a new trial should not be awarded,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b112-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number><em>Frelmghuysen for the </em>defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXm\">showed cause and as to the objection, that the court were wrong in admitting the evidence relative to the agreement of plaintiff to take the bill at his own risk: H\u00e9 argued,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-6\"><em>First. </em>That the casfe of <em>Bates v. Grabham. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>cited <em>by </em>the court at the trial, clearly proves that such testimony is proper. That was <em>a policy of </em>insurance, a <em>parol </em>agreement was proved, that the policy should not commence, until the ship came to such a place, and held the parol agreement should avoid the writing. That case goes farther than is necessary to my purpose. I am willing to narrow the principle, and contend for no more than in the <em>second place: </em>that any parol testimony, consistent with the written, is admissible. You shall not destroy, but you may explain it: you may prove another agreement not inconsistent with the former.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b112-7\">The source of mistake on the other side, arises from misapplication of the law, which I mean not to contradict, namely that parol testimony shall not control, what appears on the face of the deed; because parties write every thing, then in contemplation: now this is true, but does not touch the case here. What is the written agreement in this case, an assignment of our right and title to a bill, putting it out of our power, and placing it in the power of the assignee, to recover the money. This agreement we admit, we desire to establish it. The property of the note was changed; we have no further claim to it; the doctrine of law, arising upon this agreement, \u201c that we are to pay the money to the assignee, if with due diligence he cannot get it,\u201d is not reduced to writing, it is no part of the agreement in fact. The written agreement may remain unaltered, and another agreement to discharge the assignor: from the legal operation may consistently be proved, It is not contradictory to the writing, it is to r\u00e9but the law, arising upon the assignment, and not to destroy the assignment. Particular legacies were given to executors, and no disposition of the surplus; the law gives it to the next of kin; parol proof was admitted that the testator designed it for the Executors, <em>% Bac. </em>310.

Stockton </em>in support of the rule</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AqCN\">This evidence was admitted at the trial upon the authority of 2 <em>Salk. </em>444. <em>5 Burr. </em>2802.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-5\">1 <em>st </em>'Where a contract is reduced to writing, the terms of which admit of a certain construction, no parol evidence is to be admitted, to lessen, or enlarge, vary, or explain such contract. This rule of law, grows out of the fundamental principle, of the doctrine of evidence \u2014 that the best which the nature of the case admits of, is required, and only the best; and when produced it is the guide to go by. <em>Preston .Merceau </em><footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>(before, cited) <em>Cary v. Bertie and others, </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>But not only is the writing to be held inviolate, but the construction which it affords, the legal construction must take effect, even if there be an ambiguity on the face of the writing. <em>Povj. on 31ort. 5%, 55. </em>A deed may be helped sometimes by election, but never by averment. <em>Loraine v. Thom~ hnson. </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>These cases prove, <em>1st </em>that no parol evidence can he admitted to vary the nature of a written contract. <em>2d </em>That where different constructions are contended for, they must he deduced from the writing, and not from parol evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-6\"><em>2d </em>The communication is for the assignment of a note, the money is paid, and the note assigned: every thing is put into writing, now what contract does the law raise on this transaction? why that <em>Barnet </em>should repay the money, advanced, on failure of the giver of the bill, due diligence having been used. This is the admitted construction of the instrument. Now the parol evidence offered, <em>viz. </em>that <em>Barnet </em>should not be liable on failure of Bauman, went to destroy the operation of the contract in writing, in this particular.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b113-7\">The opposite counsel has said this parol agreement is a distinct thing from the writing: it is not consistent with it; it goes merely to repel a <em>legal consequence </em>of the instrument, and not the <em>words </em>of it. I cannot conceive, that there b any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>thing in this distinction; to contradict or destroy, the legal operation or construction of an instrument, is the same thing as to control its verbal stipulations. <em>Barnet </em>on this assignment was as completely bound, to answer over on default of <em>Bauman, </em>as if it had been so expressed; and if the legal consequence had been put into writing, the defendants counsel could not have argued this point \u2014 surely, to have the benefit of a contract, it is not necessary to put the legal consequences of it into writing: if it were so, no endorsee could ever recover against an endorser. The liability never arises out of the <em>words </em>of the endorsement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b114-8\"><em>ad </em>As to the cases against us, that in <em>Salk. </em>444. is not law. Either <em>Lord Holt </em>or <em>Sergeant Salkeld </em>forgot the case: it is misreported. They have set down the opinion of the jury for that of the Judge. The fact is, that the Judge\u2019s opinion was against the parol testimony as inadmissible, and a new trial was awarded. The case is reported by the name of <em>Kaighes v. Knightly </em>in Skinner 54. and <em>Park on insurance </em>states it to the same effect, 5 <em>Burr. </em>2802 is plainly inapplicable; besides the objection was not taken at the trial.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b110-14\"><em> Note. </em>The Counsel and Court used the term \u201c note\u00bb\u201d ip speaking of the sealed bilk</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b112-8\"><em> % </em>Salk. 444.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b113-8\"> 2 Blac. rep. 1249\u00bb</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-4\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b113-9\"> 3 Atk. rep. 388.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-5\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b113-10\"> 3 Blac.. 1249,</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-6\" label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"AZK\"><em> </em>2 Vem. 333</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-7\" label=\"(e)\">\n<p id=\"Aqr\"> Doug. 56*.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-8\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b114-9\">Kinsey C.

As far as respected the particular case in question, he observed that the parol evidence did not vary, add to, or restrain the assignment, as to the <em>subject matter of it, </em>the <em>chose in action, </em>the <em>security, </em>nor in any respect control the words of it. It went merely to restrain the operation of the general rule of law, which was no part of the contract between the parties, vid: 2 Wash. 219, lb. 233, <em>255. </em>This cannot affect purchasers, for if the first assignee should assign it to another, I agree, that this other would not be bound by the parol agreement, unless a disclosure of it was made to him previously to the assignment; so that no bad consequences can attend the doctrine: as to the case in <em>Salkeld, </em>I admit it is dubiously reported.
