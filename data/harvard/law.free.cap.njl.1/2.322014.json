It would be highly improper, and a surprise upon the plaintiff, to allow the separate demands of the partners to be set off against their joint debt. Evidence rejected. See <em>Bull, N. </em>P. 180 ; 10 Ves., <em>Jr., </em>105 ; 1 Binn. 64, <em>Crammond </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number><em>Bank of U.

It would seem they held a joint lease of Andover Iron Works, where Bowne had worked ; that the service was performed for their joint benefit, and although the evidence proves Thompson alone actually contracted with Bowne, yet it also proves that Brackenridge, who resided personally at [3] the works, and must have had knowledge of his being employed in the general service of the partnership, at least acquiesced in the arrangement made with him. This is sufficient evidence to go to the jury; it is with them to decide whether it be conclusive to charge Brackenridge. A non-suit should be granted only in a clear case.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-7\">Motion refused.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
