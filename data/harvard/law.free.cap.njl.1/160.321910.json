HUNT AND ANOTHER.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b184-10\">On a <em>sei.fa. </em>to revive a judgment for \u00a3200, and a plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>a judgment on an award for \u00a324 debt due on a bond, the penalty of which Was \u00a3200, is sufficient to sustain plaintiff's issue.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b184-11\">This was a <em>scire facias </em>to revive a judgment, and <em>nul tiel record </em>was-pleaded by the defendants.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b184-12\"><em>Stockton, </em>for the plaintiffs,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_d\">said this was a suit under the practice act of August, 1784, and read \u2014 1st, A declaration on a bond for \u00a3200, with oyer of a condition to pay the plaintiff\u2019s intestate \u00a37 annuity. 2d. A plea of payment and set-off by the defendants,. 3d. An award made in the cause, pursuant to a rule of court, in favor of the plaintiff, for \u00a324, with- costs of suit taxed at \u00a36 9s. <em>8d. </em>He said the legal debt was the whole penalty, \u00a3200; the award was for the sum actually due at the time, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b185-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>\n<em>Leake,</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMb\"><em>contra, </em>insisted there was no such judgment for \u00a3200, as was recited in the <em>scire facias. </em>The report is for \u00a324, which is stated to have been \u201cread, filed, and judgment accordingly.\u201d He proceeded to argue that no costs were taxable upon this judgment, it being for a sum under \u00a350, and cited <em>Vote </em>v. <em>Covenhoven, Sept. Term, </em>1791; <em>Wilson\u2019s Laws </em>265, \u00a7 5; <em>Allinson\u2019s Laws </em>159.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b185-5\">[138] <em>Stockton, </em>in reply. The question about the costs is not before the court. With regard to the real matter of controversy, it is the settled principle of law that a judgment on a bond where there is anything due, is for the whole penalty.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b184-13\"> These proceedings were only entries made in the minutes of the court, no record being made up under what was called the practice act, now repealed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b185-6\">Per Cur.</author>\n<p id=\"AoP\">Undoubtedly the judgment is properly recited in the <em>scire facias. </em>With regard to the other question raised by Mr. Leake, it is not before the court. If we have taxed costs improperly, this is not the way to revise it; our judgment is rendered, and we cannot correct the error, if there be one.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
