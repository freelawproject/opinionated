' I am by no means satisfied that the prisoners were entitled to copies of the indictment and pannel, without demanding them; we will however consider of it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-12\">The question was not again mentioned.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-13\"><em>%d Leake </em>for defendants, asked a witness upon his examination what <em>Mairs </em>meant by an expression which the witness had sworn that he had used.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b478-14\">Per <em>C. </em>Justice, the question is altogether improper.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-15\"><em>3d Stockton </em>for the state, put these questions to a witness: \u201c Did old <em>Mairs </em>ask you who it was\u201d \u2014 \u201c Did you tell him;\u201d Did he tell you to desire Apollo,\u201d &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b478-17\">Per Kinsey C. J. These are leading questions and therefore improper. I knew a man acquitted of a foul murder because the principal witness for the prosecution became paralitick before the trial, and could only answer \u201c yes\u201d and '* no;\u201d and the court would not permit the facts, upon which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>las e\\ klence was wanted, to be put to him in the interrogatory.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-3\"><em>ith Leake </em>offered one <em>Forman to </em>prove that <em>Wilds </em>the prosecutor who had been examined, harboured malice against <em>Apollo Muirs </em>one of the prisoners, that he had in a previous quarrel bit off <em>Muirs\u2019 </em>nose, and had afterwards threatened ho would tear out his wind-pipe and eat it up, if it cost him his life. This evidence was introduced for the purpose of discrediting the testimony of the prosecutor, and to lead the jury to believe that <em>Wilds </em>had probably commenced the affray.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b479-4\">It was objected to, so far as it went to a detail of the grounds of the malice, and the particular language in which this malice was manifested, \u2014 -as the state could not come prepared to contradict it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b479-5\"><em>Ogden </em>and <em>Leake </em>in reply contended,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFDj\">that they were entitled to prove a witness undeserving of credit, <em>1st </em>by general reputation, which is by an inquiry into his general character for veracity; <em>%d </em>by showing that his testimony is not entitled to full credit, on account of private malice against the person whom he accuses, or a quarrel with him; \u2014 and in this last case it is proper to admit testimony going to show the particular grounds of this enmity or malice, and the particular circumstances or expressions in which it has been displayed. They cited upon the general principle <em>Watts v. Brains Cro-. El. </em>778. <em>Brown v. Seymour </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>5. <em>Cockroft v. Smith </em>Salk. 842. <em>Cook v. Beal 1 Ld. </em>Ray. 176. to show that the circumstances of a previous dispute, or the origin of the quarrel between the parties, constituted an important part of every ease.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b479-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">The evidence is improper so far as it tends to prove particular causes of malice, or particular expression;-, of ill will and revenge. You may establish the point of ge - neral malice or ill will, by asking the witness if the prosecutor was not known or reputed to entertain feelings of hostility towards the prisoner, prior to the offence charged. Or you may prove a particular malice by asking the witness if <em>he folQxm </em>that prosecutor entertained any hatred or revengefui <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number>spirit towards the\u2019 prisoner \u2014 but you are not allowed to inquire into the particular manner in which the prosecutor showed these feelings: for a witness may always come prepared to answer general imputations with regard to his character, but he cannot come prepared to rebut the testimony which may be given with regard to individual facts. The rule is reasonable and correct. <em>Bull. </em>295.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\"><em>5th Leake </em>asked the witness, what was the general character of the prosecutor as to his being a peaceable or quarrelsome man; and contended that if it appeared that his disposition was a quarrelsome one, it might afford a ground for the jury to infer, that he had made the first assault, although he had sworn that <em>Mairs </em>struck first.</p>\n<author id=\"b480-7\">Per. Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A1N\">A man may be a boxer or a bully and yet speak the truth upon oath. The establishment of this point in his character will not lessen his credibility; he has sworn positively to the fact; the evidence is therefore irrelevant and inadmissible.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">After the evidence was closed, the counsel for .the prisoners requested the court to charge the jury upon the extension of the <em>Coventry </em>act, (on which this indictment was grounded) to this state; and stated they were prepared to argue the question if any doubts were entertained by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">The court refused, saying that at this time the jury were only to find the facts, on the plea of <em>not guilty', </em>the questions as to the extension of the statute or the sufficiency of the court, would come before them more properly on a motion to arrest the judgment, in case the prisoners should be convicted.</p>\n<author id=\"b480-10\">Kinsey C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"Atl\">charged the jury (after stating the nature of the accusation, and what was the peculiar province of the jury in this case.)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-11\">In order to find the defendants or either of them guilty upon the first count, it is necessary you should be satisfied of these <em>facts.' </em>\u2014 1st That there was an actual lying in wait. <em>2d </em>That the defendants actually cpt or slit the nose of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>prosecutor with the intention to maim or disfigure him. 3d That the act was done maliciously.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The proof of these circumstances must from their very nature he drawn from the actions of the party. The intentions and views with which a man enters upon the perpetration of a criminal act, are not generally expressed in language. If you, however, upon deliberately weighing the testimony whichiyou have heard, shall be of opinion, that' the defendants watched an opportunity and actually carried their intention into execution by cutting off the nose of <em>Wilds, </em>it is in point of law maliciously done. Deliberation and cruelty evince a mind regardless of social duty, and are full proof of malice; and under these circumstances they may be said to lie in wait for the purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">Some observations have been made upon the manner in which the nose has been taken off. Upon this part of. the case I must remark that <em>the </em>substance of the crime charged upon the defendants, is the wilful and deliberately cutting off the nose, and whether this is effected by one instrument or another is perfectly immaterial, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>I think I may go further and say, if the party deliberately and with the intention of biting off the nose of another, watches his opportunity and effects his purpose, the nose may be said to be cut off, and the jury would be bound to find so. It is not necessary to prove it to have been done with a knife as laid in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">Another thing is important to be stated. If both were present, and one only committed the crime by cutting off the nose, and the other was aiding and abetting, both are equally guilty; both may be said to have done the act, and both are answerable for it as principals. In this case <em>Apollo Mairs </em>is charged as the principal and <em>David </em>as accessary, yet if you find that <em>David </em>was the principal and <em>Apollo </em>the accessary, the indictment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">The jury found a verdict of <em>not guilty </em>upon the first count, and <em>guilty </em>upon the second; and the court fined <em>David </em>(the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>father) one thousand dollars, and <em>Apollo </em>(the son) five hundred, and bound each of them to their good behaviour with sureties for three years.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b481-8\"><em> Note. </em>\u2014 \u201c The indictment must declare how and with, what it was done, <em>viz. </em>with a certain sword, &amp;c. Yet if the party were killed with another weapon, it maintains the indictment, <em>Crown Circ. </em>104. see. 52, 3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
