It is admitted that Mary Martin, the wife of Brown, was the heir-at-law of the devisor. Until, therefore, it appears there is such a person as John Martin, to whom it was intended the lands should go, she is. entitled to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-11\">Judgment for plaintiff.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
