Where justice has been done by a verdict, though there has been a misdirection by the judge, a new trial should not be granted.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"b116-6\">This was an action of debt tried at bar in April Term last, and a verdict for the plaintiff. (See the case fol. 57, <em>ante.)</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-7\"><em>Leake </em>had moved for a new trial.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ajj\">The principal points pressed by him were\u2014</p>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-8\">1st. That the court misdirected the jury, in leaving it to them to fix the time that an assignee may hold the note. He said it was a question of law, (3 <em>and </em>4 <em>Ann,) </em>and cited the case of <em>Steinmitz et al. </em>v. <em>Currie, </em>1 <em>Dall. </em>271.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-9\">2d. That Findley\u2019s declaration was not fraudulent, as stated in the charge of the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b116-10\">3d. That the insolvency of Harris was no excuse for Snyder not giving notice to Findley, and cited the cases of <em>Russel </em>v. <em>Langstaff, Doug. </em>496; <em>Bickerdicke </em>v. <em>Bollman, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>408; <em>Heylin et al. </em>v. <em>Adamson, </em>2 <em>Burr. </em>676.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b116-11\"><em>Woodruff </em>and <em>Stockton </em>in reply,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AZn\">said that on the question of laches, McKean, C.. J., in Dallas, left it to the jury. [79] That as to notice, where the drawee is insolvent at the time, none was necessary. <em>Goodall et al. </em>v. <em>Dolley, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>712. As to the fraud, if it were so at first it could not be purged by subsequent laches. <em>Baugh </em>v. <em>Price, </em>1 <em>Wils. </em>320. They added that this was the third trial in the cause. In the case of <em>Furneaux </em>v. <em>Hutchins, Cowp. </em>808, the- court refused to grant a third trial.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b116-12\">The court took a few days, and then discharged the rule for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-13\">The Chief Justice said that fraud was defined in the books ; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>that one definition of it was <em>suggestio falsi, aut suppressio veri.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">The justice of the case was with the defendant, and therefore had there even been a misdirection it ought not to be a ground for a new trial. Whoever positively and generally makes a false assertion, as an inducement for another to contract with him, and succeeds on that ground, is guilty of a fraud which vacates the contract. It must be as represented, or it is fraudulent; a man who does so\u201dassert ought to suffer he must answer for the truth. The case of <em>Sir Crisp Gaseoigne </em>is full to this. I do not say that Findley was guilty of <em>wilful </em>dishonesty. It seems from M\u2019Share's\u2019 evidence that he might have thought Harris solvent; but he made an assertion of a matter of fact, which the jury have found was false; and then as to the legal operation, his belief of it, one way or the other, is of no consequence; as to negligence, the custom of merchants settles it in Great Britain; there is, however, no such custom here.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">Rule discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Cited <em>in Den </em>v. <em>Steelman, </em>1 <em>Harr. </em>68; <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferguson, </em>2 <em>Vr. </em>107.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
