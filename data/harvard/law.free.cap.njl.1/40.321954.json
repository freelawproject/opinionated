The term \u201csettled,\u201d implies a general, not \u201cspecial account.\u201d If a man will create evidence against himself, it is better he should suffer, than that a general and correct rule of evidence be violated. Circumstances, however, may be shown in evidence to rebut this presumption of the law; and one very material fact among others shown for the consideration of the jury in the present ease, is, that <em>both </em>bills remain in the possession of the plaintiff. The jury are to consider the evidence, and weigh all the circumstances; if they think one is included in the other, their verdict will only be for the amount of the last; if not, for both.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Verdict for both bills claimed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
