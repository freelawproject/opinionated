That no notice was given by Van tine, the prosecutor, to Covenhoven, of the taking of the inquisition. As to this, it appeared that there were two intruders, Anderson and Covenhoven. A notice was served\"by Vantineon Anderson\u2019s wife, and a copy left; and the justice served a similar notice on Covenhoven. The notices were directed to both defendants; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>both appeared and made defence. He cited, on this exception, 2 <em>Imp. C. B. </em>168, 9, 442.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-5\">2d. That the justice before whom the inquisition was taken had not signed it.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b323-6\">\u2022 3d. That the dates are set forth in figures, and not in words at length, or Roman numerals. 2 <em>Burns\u2019 Just. </em>665, <em>\u201cIndictment,\u201d Crown Circ. </em>94; 2 <em>Hale Hist. </em>170; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Phillips, </em>1 <em>Str. </em>261.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>R.

See 2 <em>Imp. C. B. </em>432 ; <em>Pat. Laws, fol. </em>290. The signing by the justice is unnecessary.

The signature of the justice to the inquisition is unnecessary. As to the figures, the eases cited apply exclusively to indictments ; in New Jersey these inquisitions are considered as civil prosecutions ; and, as quashing is not <em>de jure, </em>we will not do it on these exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">Cited <em>in Cruiser </em>v. <em>State, </em>3 <em>Harr. </em>208</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
