FREES.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b323-11\">1.

J., saying they would not in any case compel the prosecutors of these writs to pay costs; it was a laudable and humane thing in any man or set of men to bring up the claims of these unfortunate people before the court for consideration.</p>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b324-4\">It appeared that the negroes had been the property of Robert Patterson, who appeared to have had an intention of setting them free, and in casual conversation with third persons, and sometimes in the presence of the negroes themselves, had declared this intention. No 'express promise or understanding was proved ; Patterson made his will, devising all his real and personal estate, without mention of his negroes\u2019 freedom. His executors sold the slaves to Frees for \u00a3157.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The court disallowed the claim, and remanded the negroes, holding that these casual and general declarations, unaccompanied with any particular act or formality, were insufficient to give them their freedom. See <em>Kettletas </em>v. <em>Fleet, </em>7 <em>Johns. </em>324. And as testator had devised away all his real and personal estate, they must go with the other property, and legally belonged to the defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
