See <em>ante </em>p. 16\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b440-8\">The parties were both infants under the age of 21 years. It appeared that the father of the defendant had applied to an attorney and retained him in the cause without informing him that his son was an infant. The appearance was accordingly entered in the usual manner, and plea filed, on which issue was joined. A rule of reference was afterwards entered, the referees made their award which was returned and filed, and judgment <em>nisi </em>entered. The defendant then applied for and obtained an extension of the time within which reasons were to be filed against the report, until the ensuing term. He afterwards filed his reasons one of which was that he had appeared by attorney instead of by guardian.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b440-9\"><em>Stockton </em>for the plaintiif now moves that the proceedings be amended by entering the defendant\u2019s appearance &amp;c. as by guardian,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfJZ\">and in support of the application cited 1 <em>Strange </em>33\u00bb <em>Stratton v.

If the mistake had been discovered earlier, or if before the defendant appeared the plaintiif had applied to have him appear by guardian it would have been proper.

Cade </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> Shipman v. </em>Stevens. <footnotemark><em>(c)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The general rule is laid down by <em>Lord Mansjield </em>1 Burr. 321. that amendments come too late after trial.
