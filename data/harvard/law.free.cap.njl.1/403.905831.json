In the first case i\u00a3 is necessary that the Judge should be satisfied before the writ is allowed, and the court, in the latter. Neither of them ought to act without some probable cause being exhibited, to raise at least a reasonable question as to the legality of the claim under which the negro is detained. But there is no authority for confining the mode of showing this probable cause to any one course, whether by affidavit or otherwise; nor is there any reason for this restriction.

In cases of this kind the State is bound to protect the rights of all who are within its dominion, and fulfil the duties which are imposed by the social contract. The obligations of allegiance and protection are reciprocal. Whenever therefore an individual is deprived of his freedom, the State is bound to interfere to assist in extricating him from his confinement, and there is no individual who can be called upon to enter a security of the kind required. The State neither can nor will bind itself to defray the expenses of the prosecution, and it would be impossible to force it upon a private member of the community,. The effect of the measure which the court is called upon to adopt will be, to prevent entirely the relief intended to be afforded by this writ unless the unfortunate victims can themselves procure the means of defraying this extraordinary and preliminary expense. Their situation, already sufficiently distressing, will be seriously exasperated, and that liberty which it is the object of our government to protect, and of our laws to promote, will be oppressed and destroyed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-6\">Nor are there any grounds to warrant the adoption of such a measure. It is novel and unprecedented. By the common law no costs were allowed, and the statutes which give them do not apply to cases of this description. The question has been once before stirred in this court in the case of <em>The State v. Oliver et ux. (Sept, term </em>1787. <em>J </em>but it was then rendered abortive, and the decision then given ought to be conclusive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b429-7\">Smith J. I perfectly well remember the case of <em>Oliver and \u2022wijl </em>which has been alluded to. The point now urged was pressed with much zeal by the counsel for the then defendants, but it did not receive the sanction of the court. Wc cannot but think that to require security in such cases, would be in effect, considering the destitute and friendless situation of every negro who is claimed as a slave* tantamount to &amp; denial of the writ, The motion must be overruled\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>In support of the claim to freedom preferred by the negro, various testimony was produced, some of which being parol,</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b430-6\"><em>Williamson </em>objected,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHnH\">That the admission of oral testimony in cases of this description was improper. All the facts requisite to support the claim for freedom should be reduced to writing and attested in the form of affidavits: the court cannot afford the time to listen to a tedious examination of witnesses when other business is pressing for their attention. Juries hear <em>viva voce </em>testimony, because it is peculiarly adapted to their capacities and habits, but the universal practice in England is for courts to proceed upon written evidence. Upon a <em>Habeas Corpus </em>in civil cases special circumstances are disclosed by affidavit: cases of certiorari are always examined in the same manner; all motions in which it is necessary to establish certain facts as the ground for the court to adjudicate upon, follow the same practice. Indeed if the court were to undertake to listen to parol testimony in all these cases, the course of business would languish and the interests of the suitors suffer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b430-7\">Per Curiam. It has been the \u25a0 constant practice of the court in cases of this kind to hear <em>viva voce </em>testimony when offered. The general principle in the admission of evidence is, not that courts are restricted by narrower rules in receiving testimony than juries are, but that they being able to discriminate between that which ought to be listened to, and that which should be disregai-ded, are not prohibited from hearing any evidence which they may think calculated to illustrate the subject before them, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The objections that have been urged apply wholly to the convenience of the judges, and when we find it necessary to adopt another course <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>i'ii&amp;t we may be enabled to get through the business before us we shall give previous notice, that no inconveniences may result from an alteration of the practice. At present however no such necessity exists, and as it has been customary in all cases of this kind to receive parol testimony, we do not think proper at this time to introduce a new rule.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b431-8\">The evidence produced on the part of the negro was \u2014 .</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AB4a\"><em>1st </em>A deed of gift dated <em>March 1 st </em>1750, from <em>Zaecheus Mayew </em>of Massachusetts, to <em>Lucy Utile </em>then the wife of ---- <em>Little </em>by which he conveyed to her his title to <em>Flora </em>a negro girl.

Since that period <em>Flora, </em>has been considered in the neighbourhood as a frcewomac, no claim to hold het as a slave was heard of for 17 years, she worked as a free-woman in tin neighbourhood of the widow <em>Eaton, </em>and occasionally h-r her,, and for the wife ot <em>John Eaton </em>the eldest sou of the Dr. who always paid her wages.

That <em>Mota </em>since her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>marriage with <em>Reap </em>had two children one named <em>Lydia </em>the other Margaret, the present applicant. These children lived with their parents and were brought up by them from the fruits of their own industry, and continued with them until <em>Margaret </em>was seized and carried away forcibly. Since this occurrence, an instrument has been executed by <em>William Little </em>the son-in-law of <em>Dr. </em>Eaton, by which he relinquishes all his title and claim to <em>Flora </em>and her children and manumits them so far as regards any rights belonging to him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b432-6\">The only evidence offered on behalf of the defendant was an affidavit taken exparte, without notice to any one interested for \"the prosecution, and without being entitled as of any cause in court.

The uniform practice is to read the affidavits with which the party may be prepared at the opening of the case, and when it is requisite, a day is given to the adverse party to answer them. The reason is obvious and shows it is impossible it should be otherwise, there are no pleadings in the case, no issue or notice in any shape by which the party can be forewarned to what point he must prepare his testimony: unless therefore the cause is heard in this manner, both parties are liable to be surprised without any laches or negligence on their part; a claim may be preferred of which no previous suspicions were entertained, a defence set up which was never anticipated though both may owe their strength to the very circumstance of the ignorance of the opposite part}-. Time is therefore always allowed to answer the matter con~ tained in the affidavits. 1 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>412 <em>The King v. Delayed and others. </em>1 <em>Burr. </em>636. <em>Rex v.

To notify the negro that on such a day particular persons would be examined in relation to his case would be merely a form, and would not answer the purposes for which notice is ever required. It is a matter perfectly notorious to eve\u00bby one that in cases of this kind the State is formally made &amp; party to the suit, but its officers never or rarely interfere <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Ni <em>iy: </em>notice to the Attorney General would therefore in \u2022\u2022\u2022't.:.i ;..s be equally nugatory No prosecutor\u2019s name is endorsed upon the writ or appears in any other manner to die defendant, and he is therefore absolutely prevented from notifying any individual to whom the giving such notice would not be a mere idle ceremony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b433-3\">i?. <em>Stockton </em>against the admission of the evidence.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A_gRS\">The general rule of law is clear that <em>exparte </em>testimony is illegal and inadmissible; that no one can be affected by evidence taken without his knowledge, and without an opportunity having been afforded hi ;n to cross examine the witness. The cases cited (rom the English books are inapplicable. The practice there is to examine cases of this kind altogether upon affidavits, here the witness may be produced. Even in England however the cases do not prove that the affidavits are admitted without notice having been given that they were to be taken, for though time is sometimes allowed to rebut the testimony that has been adduced, it does not appear that this is to be done by taking counter affidavits of the same witnesses.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-4\">To say that this is a state prosecution is no answer to this abjection. The name of the Attorney General is endorsed on the writ, as the prosecutor, and notice to him in his official, capacity may legally be given. The difficulties in the way of serving the notice however, will not alter the rule oflaw, and affect the claimant\u2019s right to her liberty without a full opportunity being afforded her to cross examine the witness.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-5\">Pur Curiam. This evidence has been objected to on tbe ground that it is <em>exparte </em>and taken without any notice being previously given to the person against whom it is designed to operate. The party adducing it is bound to show that the testimony is legal, and taken in a mode conformable to law. The fact which constitutes the ground of objection has <em>not </em>been denied, and as we are not satisfied that there exist any reasons to take it out of the general rule, the evidence must fee overruled.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b433-6\">The evidence with which the defendant was prepared be\u00bb ing rejected, he moved for an adjournment of the cause that: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>he might prepare the proof necessary to support his claim. The evidence that has been heard establishes the fact that after several conveyances the title to <em>Flora </em>the mother of tljie applicant became a second time vested in <em>Dr. Eaton. </em>Upon his death, unless there was a legal manumission of the slave, she must be considered as constituting a part of his personal estate, the right to which became vested in his representatives, or in case of a bequest by his will, must go to the legatee. The evidence going to establish the fact of manumission, does not lead to the supposition that the manumission proceeded from any other person than the widow of <em>Dr. Eaton </em>or her son <em>William. Little. </em>There is a material chasm therefore in the testimony, it not being proved that either of these individuals had any right of which they could legally dispose. The defendant had no previous notice of this deduction of title and could not be prepared with evidence to rebut it. It is but reasonable therefore that he should be allowed time to ascertain the contents of <em>Dr. Eaton's </em>will, to show from it, that no title or right was given to his wife or son in-law, and therefore that no claim to freedom can be supported under a manumission by either.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-6\"><em>Woodruff </em>(Attorney General) contra. This application ought to he denied upon two grounds. 1</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-7\"><em>1st </em>The title of <em>Dr, Eaton </em>to <em>Flora </em>is acknowledged by this very application. The defendant claims to detain the daughter as a slave; if this claim has any legal foundation it must be derived either mediately or immediately under <em>Eaton. </em>The defendant must be presumed conusant of his own title, and therefore the facts disclosed cannot be a surprise.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b434-8\"><em>%d </em>It would be as dangerous as it is unprecedented to permit a party, after a cause has been opened and evidence heard, after the witnesses have been examined and cross examined, to have an adjournment of the cause that he may supply himself with proofs to rebut this testimony.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b434-9\"><em>Stockton </em>on the same side.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AOQ\">There is no doubt but that a court upon proper grounds, and under certain circumstances will interpose their discretionary powers to prevent either party from being surprised or entrapped; but it is equally clear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>that it will in no case permit a party, after being apprized of the case and proofs of his adversary, to have further time to prepare his testimony to meet the case which has been disclosed. The facts stated by the <em>Attorney General </em>show clearly that there can be no surprise if the defendant\u2019s claim has any legal foundation^ and if it is a right of mere possession a claim to detain an unfortunate being in .slavery without a shadow or pretence of title, it is certainly not a claim for the protection of which a Court will interpose its extraordinary powers or authorize any departure from the ordinary rules of practice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b435-4\">Though it is true as has been urged that t\u00edtere arc no formal pleadings in cases of this kind, it does not necessarily follow that a party may not be as well prepared to establish his case as in any civil action. The question in controversy is simpfy this, is the claimant detained legally or illegally, and the party must always know his own title and be prepared to show it. If an action of detinue had been brought for this negro by a third person, the point in issue could not.be more simple or unembarrassed and assuredly the Court in that case would not listen to an application to adjourn the trial after evidence had been given, that the opposite party might prepare himself to rebut it. This case stands on the same principles, and ought to be governed by the same rules. A <em>Habeas Corpus </em>is to one of these blacks illegally detained in slavery precisely what an action of detinue is in ordinary cases: in both the defendant may be, and should be prepared to answer the charge and to show the grounds upon which Jiis claim rests\u00ae</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b435-5\"><em>Williamson </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHv\">The similarity which has been said to exist between this case and the action of detinue is wholly imaginary. In the latter the party is apprized of the claim, and is informed by whom his rights are questioned, here the writ is general, no claim of freedom appears on the writ, nor if he should suspect that such is the object, will be able to imagine upon what foundation it rests. He cannot ascertain the grounds on which the writ issued until the circumstances of the case arc actually laid before the court. The cases. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>are widely different in all their material features, and avgu* ments drawn from the one are not fairly applicable to the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-7\">But even in cases of detinue, or in any other civil action, where by the forms of pleading and other preliminary steps such instances can but rarely occur, the Court will not permit the defendant to be ousted of his rights without an opportunity being afforded him of rebutting any unforeseen claim; and the plaintiff is always permitted by suffering a voluntary non-suit to parry the effects of an unexpected defence. In this case a judgment against the defendant will be conclusive; no new trial can be granted; the rights of the party must be protected now or the opportunity will be forever lost. This is, it is true a question in which the liberty of one individual is at stake, but it also involves the rights of property claimed by another: both are entitled to the protection of the law, and while the Court are watchful in guarding the one, they will be careful not to invade the other.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-8\">Per Curiam. This is a question of considerable importance; one which we should be unwilling to be looked upon as settling by an opinion delivered on the spur of the occasion. No great inconvenience can result from allowing the defendant under the peculiar circumstances of this case an opportunity of producing the will of <em>Dr. Eaton. </em>We are therefore of opinion that time should be allowed him for that purpose, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>but as we think it would be establishing a dangerous precedent to extend this permission further, no other testimony will be admitted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b436-9\">On the following day the Counsel for the defendant informed the Court that he had examined the will of <em>Dr. </em>Eaton, but not finding it to answer his purposes, thought it unnecessary to produce it; and on being called upon by the <em>Attorney General </em>to exhibit its contents, he refused.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b436-10\"><em>Woodruff </em>and <em>Stockton.</em></attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AiF\">By the chain of title that has been exhibited in this cause, the person in whom the absolute right to <em>Flora </em>was shown to exist was <em>Dr. </em>Eaton, yet under the strong circumstances of the case a legal manumission or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>dcreiiction of the property may be presumed from the facts that have appeared in evidence. The declarations of <em>Eaton </em>as to die views with which he bought hack Flora, his avowal that fils principles were opposed to slavery, the great length of time during which <em>Flora </em>has enjoyed her freedoni.be\u00bb lug upwards of seventeen years, not privily or clandestinely, or in a situation where she was unknown, but openly, notoriously, in the neighbourhood and in the family of her former owner, receiving wages from them as a free-woman, marrying a free-man, rearing children to maturity without interruption and without assistance, the refusal on the part of the defendant to produce to the Court the will of <em>Dr. Eaton, </em>are so many circumstances leading to the presumption that her freedom was obtained in a legal and satisfactory manner, though it is difficult or perhaps impossible at this remote period to obtain conclusive evidence to the point.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b437-3\">By a series of decisions a rule has indeed been adopted in this Court of a harsh and severe character that a negro applying for his freedom is compelled to show that he is free: the <em>onus probandi </em>is thrown upon him and doubtless many are detained in servitude in consequence of this rigorous requisition. With this rule however we have complied: sufficient evidence has been adduced to authorize this Court, exercising the functions of jurors and of Judges, to presume an actual manumission. Courts of law may presume any fact or any link in a chain of title after a lapse of time. Acts of parliament, grants, records, instruments of the highest character in the law have been presumed to support a title founded in length of possession; and surely under the authority of such precedents a manumission, which if merely oral will be sufficient, may be presumed in favour of the rights of human nature after a peaceable and uninterrupted enjoyment of freedom for 17 years. <em>2 Shower </em>47. <em>Mayor of Hull v.

If a lord contracted with his villein in any manner whereby the latter acquired a right of action, or became invested with an ownership inconsistent with his state or condition of bondage, the law ever ready to lay hold of the minutest circumstance in favour of freedom, construed this a manumission. His treating his slave as a freeman invested him with the rights of one, and the lord was not permitted to question the consequences of his own acts. <em>% BL Com. 9i. </em>Here the mistress contracted with her slave, compensated her for her services, and if the facts are too ambiguous or inconsiderable to be construed a manumission, they at least are strong circumstances to warrant the presumption of an actual former manumission.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b438-6\">The general rule that a negro must disprove every title and establish the fact of his freedom is scarcely applicable to a case of this kind, where the claimant was born of parents openly living in a state of freedom and in the uninterrupted enjoyment of their liberties. After having been for years in this situation the defendant has suddenly snatched her away f|-om her parents and consigned her to a state of slaveiy, the presumption therefore is against him, and it lies upon him to show his title and his authority.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b438-7\"><em>Williamson </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aqoo\">The only question before the court is whether the claimant <em>Margaret </em>is, or is not free. It has been shown that <em>Flora </em>the mother \u2019.vas a slave, transferred from hand to hand as such, and that her daughter <em>Rose </em>has been held in the same condition of servitude. Under such circumstances the applicant is bound to show that her mother was manumitted previous to her daughter\u2019s birth or that che daughter has been manumitted since; and this should be established by evidence as conclusive at least as that which is required to support any other legal claim. In fact the rule Is settled that fhe <em>onus probandi </em>lies with the negro, the pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>su 'i'.pi'ion is that she is a slave, and therefore evidence of a higher character than ordinary is required in the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b439-3\">But there are here no circumstances to warrant even a presumption of an actual manumission. It is not pretended that <em>Dr. Eaton </em>ever gave <em>Flora </em>her freedom, there is not even the evidence of general report in favour of such a presumption; and if the fact was clearly made out that there had been a deed of manumission executed by <em>Mrs. </em>Eaton, it would avail nothing until it was shown how the title vested in her. There is no evidence of any manumission having been made by <em>Dr. Eaton, or </em>by any one who has shown <em>n </em>title under him to the negro.
