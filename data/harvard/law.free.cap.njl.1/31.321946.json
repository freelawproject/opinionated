JOHNSON.</parties>\n<headnotes data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b55-5\">It is a matter for the jury to decide, whether a man contracts on hia own account or as public agent, where the intent is doubtful.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-6\">This was an action of debt on a bond, and on the trial defendant offered to set off the price of a quantity of flour which the plaintiff had purchased from him.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-7\">By the evidence, it appeared that Stewart, during the war, was an issuing commissary, and wrote to Johnson in these words: <em>\u201c </em>I find flour will be wanted to supply the ovens at Pittstown,\u201d and desires him to get some in readiness, adding, \u201c when 1 see Mr. Buchanan, or his deputy, I shall let him know I have engaged what flour you can make; I think it will be more for your interest than selling the wheat.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b55-9\">It was contended by <em>R. Stockton </em>and <em>Ab. Ogden, </em>for defendant,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av\">that this was a private contract, and that the \u00f1onr was sold by Johnson to Stewart, and not to the public. On the other side, it was argued by <em>Leake </em>and <em>Frelinghuysen, </em>that this was a clear case of agency for the public. Stewart was an issuing, Buchanan a purchasing commissary. The counsel for the plaintiff desired the court to charge the jury as to the legal operation of the letter that had been given in evidence, which was declined.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The court, in their charge, told the jury that Stewart, being an issuing commissary, had no right to make the purchase on behalf of the public, yet such might have been the understanding, and it being a question altogether of intention, it was for the jury to decide between the parties. <em>Macheath </em>v. <em>Haldimand, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>182, opinion of Justice Buller.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-11\">[28] The court further said, that if the letter contained an assumption by Stewart, in his private capacity, he was per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>sonally responsible; if it was meant as a mere offer to assist Johnson in effecting a sale to the public, he was not liable\u2014 that the general rule of law was, that words were to be taken most strongly against the party using them.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">The jury disallowed the set-off, and found a verdict for the amount of the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Note. \u2014 See 1 <em>Comyn on Contracts </em>272, for the different cases that have occurred in the English courts upon this point.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
