This constitutes a part and an important part of a regular and scientifick system; and it is impossible to violate the rules which immemorial custom has prescribed, without impairing the symmetry of the whole edifice. <em>Cotvp. </em>417, 18. 1 <em>Sir. </em>634. <em>Reynolds Clarke.

If the deposit was in specie, there would be some plausibility in the assertion that <em>Pettit </em>was a wrong-doer, but they contended that the case would wear a totally different aspect if the money originally received by him was in <em>Province Bills.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b325-5\">The admission which was made at the trial by the counsel for the defendant, that the deposit was made in specie should be laid altogether out of the question, unless the assertion by which it was accompanied is also received. It was said that the plaintiff requested <em>Pettit </em>to change the specie into paper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and that it was done accordingly! If the whole admission is taken together and it is extremely unfair and unjust to mutilate and separate it, the amount of it is that strictly speaking the money deposited was in paper. Either the whole admission must be taken, with the explanatory circumstances attending it, or it must be altogether rejected. Independent then of any conclusion which may be drawn from this source, it was a fact left open for the consideration of the jury, to be determined by them according to the testimony adduced. Considering it therefore in this point of view, without any reference to the admission that had been made, there is abundant room for the jury to presume that the payment to <em>Pettit </em>was actually made in Province Bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-8\">In the first place this presumption is to be drawn, from the want of any conflicting testimony. A plaintiff is required to make out by evidence every circumstance which is material to his case: and if it was important for <em>Mott </em>that the deposit was made in specie, the fact should have been substantially proved on the trial, and the jury should not have been left to infer a fact which vitally affected the plaintiff\u2019s right, and which would make the defendant a wrong-doer. <em>Bull. N. P. </em>322.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-9\">It is also to be taken into view, that Pettit\u2019s receipt on the 6th <em>April </em>1775 was in general for so much money; and after such a receipt, couched in terms so indefinite, <em>Mott </em>in whose favour it operated ought not to be permitted to dispute the species of money, and certainly not unless the fact can be verified by unexceptionable evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b326-10\">In the third place, if any presumption at all can be drawn from the circumstances, it is in favour of the idea that the deposit was in paper money. <em>Mottos </em>object in bringing forward this money was to make a legal tender; if so it is a strong circumstance in corroboration of our presumption, because Province Bills were the only legal tender at that time. Gold and silver were not considered a legal tender, and the practice was to exchange the latter for the former. <em>Wharton v. Morris\u00bb </em><footnotemark>(<em>a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>From this view of the case, it appears, that it was at least questionable before the jury, whether gold or silver was deposited by Pettit, and therefore it was a proper fact for their decision, if important to the plaintiff that it should have been proved.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-4\">\u2019\u00ed'hat it was an important fact in the case will appear evident from the following considerations, which will show in the clearest manner, that if the original deposit was in Province Bills, the exchange of those bills for continental money, and the payment of that money in 1779 to <em>Reed </em>his successor in office may at least be justified by the defendant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-5\"><em>Pettit </em>by bis receipt to Mott in 1755 made himself liable for lawful money of New-Jersey, and he is chargeable only according to his receipt. The contract, thus arising on the receipt, was discharged by paying over to his successor in office, what in law was in every respect equivalent to gold or silver. <em>Reed\u2019s </em>receipt was in the same general words \u201c Received from <em>Charles Pettit </em>the above sum of <em>\u00a3%&amp;9. B. Reed </em>Clk.\u201d and must fully and entirely exonerate <em>Pettit. </em>The question therefore is, whether the payment of Continental money in 1779. was a good payment at the time it was made, and of this there can exist no doubt. The law was express that continental bills should go in discharge of all contracts, as gold and silver. <em>Pettit </em>received this money as clerk of the Supreme Court, if he disposed of the specifick money deposited, he was a debtor to the office, and had a right to discharge the debt in tbe currency of the day: and <em>Reed </em>being his successor in the office was the proper person to receive the money, and to give an acquittance.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-6\">Again, if the jury could have found tbat this deposit was made in paper money, the exchange of that which was originally placed in tbe hands of <em>Pettit </em>for Continental bills, might have been justified under some circumstances; and it was not conclusive proof of a user by defendant as was stated to the jury in the charge of the Court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b327-7\">The doctrine of bailment is perfectly well settled. \u2014 -A person under whose charge money or any other article is placed for safe keeping, is not responsible in every instance for the loss of it. He is only compelled to bestow ordinary care up<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>on it, and he has a right to exercise a prudent management in the use of it. <em>yones on Bail. </em>75, 7jS, 91, 2. They contended that in fact <em>Pettit </em>had exchanged these Province Bills for Continental Bills under the act of New-Jersey, passed <em>yime 8th </em>1779, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which required all persons holding Province Bills to bring them into the Treasury, and receive continental money in lieu of them, or be foreclosed forever. This act made it not only excusable, but incumbent on <em>Pettit, </em>having this old money in his possession, to exchange it for continental bills; and in so doing he justly considered himself as performing a duty, and benefiting <em>Mott </em>and the plaintiff in ejectment. The case is precisely like that of a stake-holder who holds province money at that time, and the event on which the wager was depending, could not occur before the time, when this species of money was to become totally useless. Would it not have been within the authority of this stake-holder, and incumbent upon him, as an honest and honourable man, to change the money which he held into that which was to retain its value, for the benefit of the fortunate wagerer. If any thing, the case of <em>Pettit </em>is stronger in his favour, because he held the money <em>qua </em>officer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-7\">If a dragoon bailee of a horse which is taken sick, is offered a sound horse by government for his sick one, and accepts him, and the horse received in exchange afterwards dies, the bailee in such a case cannot be considered liable to the owner of the first horse, because he acted as a prudent man would have acted with his own property.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-8\">If <em>Pettit </em>had held bills of a certain emission, which on account of the great number of counterfeits had been called in, and new bills made to replace them, if he made the exchange and afterwards the bills received became of no value, he would not be responsible.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b328-9\">The conclusion therefore is, that the Court ought to have left it as a fact for the jury to determine whether <em>Pettit </em>did not change the Province bills, (if they should determine that the deposit was made in that money) with a view to comply with the act of Assembly, and to benefit the persons for whom he held in trust: \u2014 whereas he peremptorily charged them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>that the single fact that tbe original money was exchanged, was conclusive evidence that this exchange was made for his own benefit, and therefore that he was a wrong-doer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-4\"><em>3d </em>They insisted that if in fact the money deposited was Province bills, the plaintiff had sustained no damage by the user of the money by Pettit, even if he had converted it the day after he received it; because if those bills had been specifically retained by Pettit, or been paid over by him to <em>Reed </em>his successor, at the time of his leaving the office, they would have been of no sort of value to Mott, as they ceased to have any value in 1779, nine years previous to any demand by plaintiff In fact the continental money paid by <em>Pettit </em>to <em>Reed </em>in 1779 was at that time, and is now, of more value than the Province bills.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-5\">These circumstances furnish a fair and conclusive answer to the plaintiff\u2019s demand. He cannot in this species of action recover more than <em>the loss </em>which he has actually sustained. <em>SBurriSB2. </em>He must prove himself injured; the amount of the damage sustained; and that it was occasioned by some fault of ours, or bis cause of action fails him. If <em>Mott </em>sus\u00bb tamed no loss by the user of the money, it is a matter perfectly immaterial how much <em>Pettit </em>gained by it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b329-6\">It is one of the principles of the law of bailment, that a bailee of money, which does not perish in the using, can never be answerable for any profit which he makes of it, provided he is ready at the time it is demanded to make a repayment to the bailor. In this case the money returned was worth more than the money deposited, at the time it was called for. The distinction is obvious, and clearly exonerates the defendant. It is not the user which throws responsibility upon the bailee, it is the loss which arises in consequence of that user, which renders him liable. <em>Jones 62. </em>This doctrine, so consonant with commort sense and common reason, is completely at variance with that laid down hy the court on the trial, when they expressly stated to the jury, that if the defendant used the money and derived advantage from it, he was liable to return the whole value of it at the time it was received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number><em>4thly. </em>It is important to refer to the acts of Assembly which were passed to prevent the evils arising from the application of the rigorous principles of the Common law, to debts contracted or owing during the war.

They should have been told by the court that it was their duty to find the sum which <em>ex equo et bono </em>ought to be paid. Instead of this their whole attention was directed to the exchange of the money, which as a single fact unaccompanied by explanatory circumstances, was perfectly immaterial, and never was denied by Pettit: they were not permitted to consider whether paper or specie was <em>originally </em>deposited; nor whether <em>1st </em>it was not specifically paid over to <em>Reed </em>in 1779 according to the terms of the receipt? nor <em>%dly </em>whether the exchange was xiot made for the benefit of <em>Mott </em>under the act of 1779, for calling in province bills; nor <em>3d </em>whether if the money was used, any damage or loss accrued, in consequence thereof, to the plaintiff; nor <em>4thly </em>whether, under all the circumstances of the case, and the different acts of Assembly affecting the question, <em>Mott </em>ought to recover any thing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b330-8\">In a case attended by such circumstances, bearing so hard upon the plaintiff\u2019s interest, and involving in a considerable degree his character as an officer, it is but right that another opportunity should be afforded him of substantiating before a jury the justice of his case, and having it fully and thoroughly investigated. 3 <em>Bl.

The question is, were the jury warranted by the evidence in forming this determination?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-7\"><em>1st </em>On the receipt signed by <em>Pettit </em>it stands indifferent, and no conclusion can be drawn against us at least, from that paper. The receipt is in general for so much proclamation money, which is no doubt descriptive rather of the value than of the species; for if it could fix the species it could only be hard money, as Jersey money did not exist at the time of the proclamation. Considering it as an unsettled question, what are the grounds on which a determination is to be made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b331-8\">It was on the trial argued by the defendant that it was a deposit of hard money, and expressly stated to be so by his counsel. But it is now contended that this admission was coupled, with an assertion which would render it altogether nugatory, or turn the weight of it against us; and that it would he unfair and unjust to take part of a confession without taking the whole. It is beyond all question a settled principle of law that tbe whole of a confession must go to a jury for their consideration; but it is an extraordinary doctrine to contend for, that the jury are compelled to believe the whole or none. It is unnecessary to do more than state this doctrine to have it refuted by the common sense of every man. The jury heayd the whole admission, they weighed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>the credibility of the statement that the plaintiff desired tp have the specie exchanged for paper, and their verdict shows that they found it wanting.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-6\">The jury had a full right, from, the different situations of the pai'ties with respect to proof, to presume against the defendant; because he had the custody of the money; because he on one occasion by his own account, changed it without the approbation or knowledge of <em>Mott; </em>and because if he did at that time actually make this exchange, the evidence was in his own power. The rule of evidence is that every presumption is to be made against him who has it in his power, but omits or refuses to show the quality of an article in his possession. <em>Armory v. Delamitie. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-7\">Another fact is fairly to be inferred from the verdict, viz. that the conversion was made soon after the deposit was made. It was left in the office in 1774 and 1775, it was not there when defendant went out of office, and the jury were to presume that he converted it <em>instanter.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-8\">That he converted it to his own use, is equally inferrible. The continental money was not brought forward until after the expiration of his commission; the conversion therefore could not have been made officially, as has been confidently-asserted, and the court were accurately right in charging the jury that if he did exchange it, it was for his own benefit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-9\">Two facts then are legitimately to be inferred from the evidence, or from the verdict: Isi That the deposit was made in hard money; <em>2d </em>That defendant converted it to his own use. No ground then can be urged with any face of plausibility to induce the court'to order a new trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b332-10\">Money of a certain and precise value is deposited in court; it is placed by the court in the charge of their clerk; the question is shall this officer shift the deposit, \u2014 speculate upon it, \u2014 take the chance of gain,' \u2014 and after a lapse of several years substitute in its stead what he pleases to call an equivalent, \u2014 money with barely a nominal value? If the clerk might lawfully use money thus committed to his custody, there would be some weight in the argument for the defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>-unt; but every thing they have urged, every tiling they can urge, assumes this as an undeniable proposition.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"56\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6DC\">Such a doctrine however, though serving as a basis to the case, though implied in every argument that has been employed, has not been openly avowed, and is clearly untenable. The court will not permit such an idea to be broached. The clerk stands neither in the character of a trustee, nor a bailee, and all the cases cited, therefore are inapplicable. There is no confidence reposed in him by the parties; the money was committed to the custody of the law; and <em>Mr. Pettit </em>possessed the same authority over it, had the same right to employ it to his private purposes, as he had to use the records of the court. As was said by the court in their charge, the clerk has a clear path to walk in; he is <em>to </em>wrap up the money until it is called for by the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"57\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-6\">Considering him however in the light of a trustee or a bailee, he is not borne out by the law. If a trustee employs the money confided to him, to any purposes not within the trust, he is answerable for all the consequences, even though he acts with the honest view to benefit the trust. As to his being a bailee, by using the tiling deposited he is answerable in all events. <em>Jones </em>94. <em>sec. </em>4. <em>pi. 5. </em>It is not true as has been urged that this doctrine is applicable only to cases where the waste is occasioned by the user; and therefore does not extend to money. <em>Jones </em>62 which was cited does not bear him out; he may indeed use where the thing is not impaired thereby, but it is at his peril because not within the contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"58\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-7\">Under this distinction, therefore, if this deposit was hard money, if <em>Pettit </em>acted as Clerk, trustee, or bailee, he was a wrong-doer, and is answerable to the full amount of the value received, and all the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"59\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b333-8\">It has been said, that a strong presumption arises to prove this deposit to have been paper from the fact that gold and silver was not a legal tender. But there is no proof of this fact; and we deny that there ever was a time, especially since the proclamation in the reign of Queen Anne, when gold and silver was not a lawful currency in this state. But it was nothing to the defendant in this case whether law\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>ful or not; it rested altogether with the person for whose use it was deposited to make the objection, and <em>Mott </em>might without much apprehension have incurred the risk of silver and gold being refused because not a legal tender.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"60\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-8\"><em>%d </em>But supposing the deposit to have been made in paper, the defendant is equally responsible, because\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-9\">1 <em>st </em>He received the whole when it was as good, and as the defendant now urges, better than specie.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"62\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-10\"><em>%d </em>He used it while he remained in office, and while for aught that appears to the contrary, it continued of the s ame value.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"63\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-11\">But we are told that in 1779 he exchanged this Jersey money for continental money, under the act of Assembly; that he did it officially, for the benefit of those for whose use it was held; and that he acted correctly in so doing. A single fact, proved at the trial, and uncontradicted by one circumstance or assertion, must put an end to this ungrounded and unsupported defence. It was made out by the testimony that <em>Mr. Pettit </em>at the time of this pretended exchange, was not in the office of clerk; he paid this continental money into the hands of his successor <em>Reed </em>above a year after he left the office, as it appeared by the evidence, and much longer in fact.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"64\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-12\">But if he had been the officer, there was no such discretionary power confided to him; and in making such an exchange he went beyond the pale of his duty, unless directed by the Court on the application of the party interested. The assertion that the clerk was bound to make this exchange appears to border on extravagance: no trust was reposed in him but that of safe keeping.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b334-13\">Again, if this substitution or exchange was made in the execution of his official duty, why is there no proof of the fact; why is so important a feature of the case left to rest altogether upon unsupported assertion, and unwarranted inference. The receipt of the Treasurer; the treasury books; the witness to the transaction should have proved it. An officer venturing to change a deposit for any purpose, should come prepared to prove what the object really was. The peculiar modesty of the defendant has concealed even from the parties immediately interested, this extraordinary and unsoli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>cited act of benevolence; and this meritorious and disinterest-up as a defence against this legal demand of their rights.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"66\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-4\">The great point however, so strenuously urged by our opponents still remains; \u2014 that supposing the deposit to have been in Jersey money, and used immediately by the defendant, still the plaintiff has received no injury? for if the defendant had never touched the money, it would have been of no value to <em>Mott </em>in 1788 at the time it was called for, and that then the continental money offered in payment was worth more.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-5\">To this there is an answer which results from the most obvious reason, as well as from a settled principle of law: \u2014 &lt; that by making use of the deposit he acted illegally and thereby shifted the responsibility from us to himself. If it had remained specifically with him, it would have been our money, and our loss; but the \"moment it was changed, he became our debtor for so much money received to the use of the person ultimately entitled to the deposit.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"68\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-6\">The sum found by the jury is not at all affected by the supposition that the deposit was paper money. At the time of the receipt it was of full value, and the jury were to presume an immediate conversion. The value of the money at time it was used is then the only <em>datum </em>upon which they were to found their verdict. If one takes money wrongfully and converts it to his own use, he shall not be permitted years after, when called upon to replace it, to say that it is true I employed your money when of full value, but it has since been cried down and become altogether useless. A simple bailee would not be allowed to avail himself of such a defence; he is to return the money, identically as he received it, or to account for the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"69\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b335-7\">But exceptions of an extraordinary and novel character have been urged against the charge of the Court. To these It will be sufficient to answer, that the attention of the jury was directed to the material fact of the case, whether the mosey was used by the defendant, and the court said the exchange was evidence of that fact. This in, point \u00a9f law was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>sufficient. It never before was heard of that the Judges m their charge were to take up, discuss, and express an opinion upon every ground which the ingenuity or despair of counsel may have induced them to urge: they are to disincumber the case of all immaterial questions, and to place the fact upon which it hinges fully before the jury. This is all that can be required and this has been fully complied with. As to charging the jury under the acts of Assembly that they were to give what <em>ex equo et bono </em>ought to be paid, it is to be observed, that these laws are entirely unconnected with the subject, and were never cited or alluded toby the counsel on the trial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"70\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-6\"><em>%d </em>The next question is should interest be allowed? I shall, show</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"71\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-7\"><em>1st </em>That interest is by law due in this case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"72\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-8\"><em>%d </em>That it may be recovered in this form of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"73\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b336-9\">1 <em>st </em>If the defendant is considered in the light of a trustee* interest is recoverable from him as the profit of the trust estate, or money; \u2014 and the jury had a right to presume, and did presume that he made this profit. <em>Ratclijfe v.

You need not press that point, unquestionably interest is due, confine yourself to the form of action.)</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"76\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b336-12\">\n<em>Stockton.</em>\n</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"77\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A54\">If interest is recoverable in any form of action, as it is admitted to be, the court will never order a new trial merely to remedy a technical error which has been productive of no injustice to the party impeaching the verdict. <em>% Burr. </em>936.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"78\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b336-13\">But the cases that have been cited establish no such principle as has been contended for. The amount of them is that this being an action on the case, which sounds in damages, the plaintiff is to recover what in equity he ought to receive; under this rule the plaintiff is entitled to all which <em>ex equo et bono </em>the defendant ought to pay. There may be cases, and those cited ar.e such, where no interest is recoverable; \u2014 as where an overpayment is made by mistake* the person <em>ve</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>ccivingit is in no fault, and he is therefore liable to refund only what he was not entitled to receive.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"79\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-3\">But where it appears that the defendant has received money to which he had no right, wilfully and wrongfully, then the law raises a contract not only to refund the numerical money received, but also to make satisfaction for the detention. This then is what the defendant ought in equity to pay, and it is recoverable in this form of action.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"80\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">But this objection if solid, goes to the recovery of interest in any shape, and is not confined to this form of action; fot this is a case of money actually received to the use of the plaintiff, and not a mere implied trust raised by the law. In this form of action the precise fact is laid as the ground of the plaintiff\u2019s action; and in any other form of action it would not be laid. If no interest is recoverable in this form of action, it must be upon the ground that none is actually due, or else this surprising result will follow, that in consequence of stating the precise truth of his case he can recover no interest, but if he depart from it then the law will do him justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"81\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-5\">This form of action however is technically adapted to the recovery of interest. Its object is to recover all the money actually received to our use; and the cases that have already been cited prove that interest was, or might have been derived from the employment of this money. The money was employed, and in the absence of other testimony, the jury were right in considering the rate of interest, as affording a legal and fair criterion by which to estimate the amount of the profits.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"82\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-6\">Under these circumstances, when the charge of the court appears to be correct; \u2014 when there is no doubt as to any material fact; \u2014 when no surprise is pretended;' \u2014 nor any suggestion made that any further light can be thrown on the subject, is this a ease in which the court will exercise the high discretion reposed in them, and set aside a verdict of an intelligent and impartial jury?</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"83\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b322-17\"> Note. \u2014 On the argument, plaintiff\u2019s co\u00fcnsel offered to prove that <em>Reed </em>was appointed in 1776 as appeared by the minutes of the joint meeting, and they contended that in this particular the case might be amended according to the truth of the fact; but the court declared that on an application for a new trial on the ground of misdirection, they must take' the facts as they appeared at the trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"84\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b324-19\"> 2 Str. 910.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"85\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b325-6\"> Cowp. 197.

The plaintiff proved that in 1774 and 1775 he paid him as clerk of this court the sum of <em>\u00a3263-2. </em>it does not satisfactorily appear in what description of money, but it does appear that whatever it might have been, it was at that time fully equal in value to gold or silver. In 1788 <em>Mott </em>made a demand of this money, and in the room of it, he is offered a bundle of Continental bills; some dated in 1779, which had been delivered by <em>Pettit </em>to his successor, a long time after he had gone out of office. This was not the money that had been deposited; it was good for nothing. The plaintiff says, I must have <em>that </em>money, or you must pay me the value at the time it was received. In answer to this the defendant replies, the money you deposited was paper, had I kept it, it would have been as bad as the Continental money at the time of the demand. The plaintiff answers, the deposit was ip hard money. Upon this the jury were to pronounce.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\">Again the plaintiff says, if paper was deposited with 'you, it was at that time equal in value to hard money, you used it when good, and you must account for it: defendant says that he Gannot be oompelled to answer for the mere user of money which was not thereby deteriorated: but the court is of opinion that he became instantly liable as a wrong-doer and the plaintiff is entitled to the value converted.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Again the defendant says, I changed this money for your benefit. The plaintiff replies, in the first place there is no proof of this; and in the next place if true, you were authorized, neither by me nor by the court, to make an exchange, and we think with the plaintiff upon this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In short the plaintiff proved the receipt of the money in 1775, the defendant ought to have exonerated himself by showing that the money was paper, and sunk in his hands; or that he lost it without any default; \u2014 or that in some other way he was justly and legally excused from returning it. \u2014 - This he has not done; and from the evidence, the verdict of the jury is right; and the charge of the Judge at <em>Nisi Prius </em>does not appear to be erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">\u2022 The objection <em>to </em>the recovery of interest in this case we conceive to be groundless. In an action *f indebitatus, <em>as</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number><em>rampiit </em>for money had and received, the plaintiff proves that th- defendant converted a deposit to his own use; it is therefor'\u2019 in effect to recover damages to the amount of defendant's liability, and the interest is as much a part of the money reed ved as the principal, and therefore the plaintiff has the same right to demand and receive it.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\">Rule <em>discharged*</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
