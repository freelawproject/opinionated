An award made in these words, \u201c For \u00a399111s. <em>9d., </em>sterling money of Great Britain, payable in good safe sterling bills of exchange on England or Holland to that amount, or so much current money as will purchase such bills,\u201d is sufficiently certain, though otherwise in case of a judgment.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b122-8\">2.

The referees, in August, 1789, made a report \u201cfor \u00a3991 11s. <em>2d., </em>sterling money of Great Britain, payable in good safe sterling bills of exchange on England or Holland to that amount, or so much current money as will purchase such bills.\u201d</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b122-11\"><em>Leake </em>objected to this award, as\u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b122-12\">1st. Uncertain; because \u201c safe and good sterling bills \u201d admitted of construction and doubt, so that defendant might not certainly Enow what were good and safe bills; besides, these bills are to be drawn on England or Holland: which is wholly vague and insensible; it is impossible to perform it. The award ought to have designated some person or partnership; or at least some particular fund, or place, ought to have been mentioned.</p>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>2d. He contended that the award was illegal on the face of it, in awarding sterling money, which was foreign money, and not recoverable here; that no person in New Jersey could have a judgment rendered against him for sterling money.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b123-5\">3d. He contended that the referees ought to have rendered the foreign denomination of money into currency; that the court cannot do this. It is a defect in the award which cannot be altered.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b123-6\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AOz\">There is nothing uncertain in the award. It is expressed in mercantile and intelligible terms. Everybody knows what good and safe bills, drawn on England or Holland, mean : namely, such as would be honored and paid, in either of those states, by the drawee, on using proper diligence and legal means. As to the objection that the award is made for sterling money, there might be something iri it, if this were a judgment; but as against an award, there is nothing in it. The judgments of this court must, to [85] be sure, be entered in the current money of the state. Let the rule be discharged and the award confirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 Vide 1 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>227; <em>Kyd on Awards </em>228.
