He cited <em>Sheppard\u2019s Touchstone </em>501, 2, 3, <em>(6th edit.)) Buller's N.

It appears that Green was [143] something more than a mere trustee; he is in some measure a principal, and interested himself in his own right, for he has covenanted to save Beatty harmless against any claim for dower. The cases cited are all cases of ejectment, where the trustees could neither have lost nor gained, but were merely representatives of the rights of others. The court cannot interpose in this manner and decide against the release, nor can they say that the money has not been paid. If this release was fraudulent, as has been alleged, the case of <em>Winch </em>v. <em>Keeley, </em>1 <em>T. R. </em>619 ; proves that the fraud should have been pleaded, that the parties might have gone to issue on that question, and have had it tried by a jury, which is the tribunal appointed by our laws and constitution.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b190-6\"><em>Leake </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3B\">The course we have taken is the correct, and in <em>fact the </em>only one that could have been pursued. We are compelled to use Green\u2019s name in the suit, and it would have been an absurdity to plead his own fraud in giving the release.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ai1\"> The decree in this case was affirmed in the House of Lords. 1 <em>Br.

This is a right and not a favor; and if a right, it follows <em>ex debito justitice </em>that the <em>cestui que trust </em>must be protected against any fraudulent attempts of the trustee, in violation of his duty, to destroy the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">It has been said there is nothing in the bond, condition, or plea from which the court can infer that Green is a trustee, and that we are not permitted to go out of the record for evidence of the fact. The articles by which this trust was created are, it is true, not on the record, but in a case of [144] this nature, the court feel themselves authorized to examine the question in a broader light, and to receive affidavits to prove the fact. It appears clearly and undeniably that Green was a trustee for the wife, and our opinion is that the release be set aside, and that Green show cause why an attachment should not go against him for this violation of his duty. <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">Motion granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> See <em>McCuttum </em>v. <em>Coxe, </em>1 <em>Dallas </em>139.
