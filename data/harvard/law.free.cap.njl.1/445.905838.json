When the deposition was offered in evidence it was \u00a9biected that under the act of assembly the notice must , . , , . , , , , . be given to the party, and as no notice had been given to him in this case, the evidence was not legally taken.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A-f\">Kinsey C.

The defendant objected that the contract was void having been made byparol, and that plaintiff had acquired his title by parol, and moved for a nonsuit on these grounds.</p>\n<author id=\"b469-15\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"AKY\">This motion for a nonsuit must be overruled. We are unable to see the propriety of the objection \u00bfhat has been urged. This is not a question between the master and the apprentice, but between the plaintiff who had an apprentice hoy, and the defendant who agreed to pay a certain sum of money for his services for a stipulated time. The boy was delivered to defendant and has performed the services, and it is unjust to refuse payment upon such a presence, neither will the law uphold it. I have seen a case,, though I cannot at present recollect where, in which a pate! <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>assignment of an apprentice was held valid. The defence however is so void of common honesty that as at present advised I cannot give my assent to it.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ApUK\"><em>Read </em>and <em>Griffith </em>for plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AKMY\"><em>Leake </em>and <em>Woodruff </em>for defendant.</attorneys>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
