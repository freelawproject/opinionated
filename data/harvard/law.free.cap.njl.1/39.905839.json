When the parties appeared to strike^ the counsel for <em>Inskeep </em>objected to 3 or 4 of the jury; and the Judge, being of opinion that they should not have been placed upon the list, altered it before striking, and the parties then proceeded to strike the jury m the usual manner.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"ATH\"><em>Stockton </em>insisted that this was an illegal interference on the part of the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ach\">who should not be allowed on any account, or in any degree, to alter the list of jurors.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Am_\"><em>Leake </em>contra</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AeH\">cited 3 <em>Bl.
