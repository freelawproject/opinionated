This <em>scire facias </em>was sued out in 1790, to revive the judgment, that another execution might be taken out.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-13\">The defendant to this <em>scire facias </em>pleaded, <em>1st </em>Payment. <em>2nd, </em>The former execution, levy, and transfer.' At the trial before <em>Mr. Justice Smithy </em>the defendant relied upon the transfer, as a bar to further execution, and as a discharge of the debt. His honour however considering it altogether void, overruled it, and a verdict was found for the plaintiff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b142-14\">This was a motion to arrest the judgment, and in support of it, <em>Stockton </em>and <em>Frelinghuysen </em>took two exceptions upon the record.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>l,y,, That it appeared and was admitted of record, that at the time of bringing the <em>scire </em>facias, there had already been an execution and a seizure of all the property that belonged to the defendant, which should be deemed a sufficient discharge of the debt, at least, until the sheriff had returned the amount of proceeds arising from the sale, <em>Clerk v. </em>Withers, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Mountney v. Andrews. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-5\">They contended, that the object of reviving a judgment by <em>scirefacias </em>is to warrant an execution; but here that end was already obtained. There has been an execution issued, the very thing which plaintiff is presumed to have in view; and it is vexatious to proceed to a new judgment and execution. The hardship of the case upon the defendant, and the harassing intentions of the plaintiff are unequivocally manifested by the fact which appears on the record, that all the property of the defendant had been already levied upon.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-6\">It was further contended, that a <em>fi. fa. </em>and levy under it amounted to a satisfaction of the original judgment. The value returned by the sheriff is known to be no criterion, for it is customary to return as in the present case an inconsiderable sum to prevent themselves from being responsible for a larger amount. Certainly however, as all the property belonging to the defendant has been seized, it must be presumed to amount to a full satisfaction of the judgment, until, the sheriff proceeds to sell, and has ascertained the deficiency. It appearing then by the record that the plaintiff had, execution at the time of suing out this <em>scire </em>facias, the court must adjudge upon that fact, without reference to the subsequent finding of the jury, which is not allowed to countervail, the record. <em>Hobart </em>56.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b143-7\">There is not a single case to be met with in the books, where a <em>scire facias </em>has issued to revive a judgment upon which there was at the time an execution in full existence,under which the property of the defendant was at that very period held. The writ will lie only where there is a judg\u00ab* ment to be revived that has suffered to sleep for a year and a day, and upon which no execution has issued; \u2014 -and where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>an execution has indeed issued, which has been spent by a sale of property, the proceeds of which have proved insufficient to discharge the amount of the judgment. In this latter case also the writ must be especially <em>pro residuo, </em>and this was the doctrine laid down in all the books and precedents upon the subject. The Statute of Westminster, 13 <em>Ed. 1. S\u00ed. </em>1. <em>cap. </em>45. Which is the foundation of this writ, allows this mode of proceeding only where an execution had not been sued out within the year \u2014 and the commentary of Lord Coke,\u20182 <em>Inst. </em>471, 2. regards it in this light only. Reason and common sense are equally opposed to the course that has been pursued by the plaintiff; for by the same principle, he may proceed <em>,in </em>infinitum, if it be not permitted the defendant to plead the first execution in bar. 1 <em>Richardson?s K. B. </em>207, 287. 2 <em>Crompt. </em>95. <em>Bohun </em>117, 263. establish the doctrine that the only object of the <em>scire facias </em>is to warrant an execution.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-8\">To the objection made at the trial, that the sheriff had acted irregularly by making a transfer, this it is contended is entirely unconnected with the question now before the court. It should be made the subject of a distinct application to the discretionary and general controling powers vested in the eourt! \u2014 it is a matter exclusively and entirely resting between the plaintiff and the sheriff, and cannot in any degree affect the validity of the first seizure. The plaintiff himself insists on the record that this transfer was void; and the court and jury in the tidal have decided the same pointj so that upon the grounds which they themselves have alleged, it ought not to be considered as affecting one way or another the point now before the court. Our case stands entirely independent of this transfer, and it is immaterial to us upon the present motion, whether the court should coincide in opinion with the Judge at <em>Nisi Prius </em>that the transfer is absolutely void, and therefore not to be regarded, or valid and therefore a complete bar to the plaintiffs claim.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b144-9\">The <em>2d </em>objection upon the record, is that this was a scire facias to revive the entire judgment for the <em>whole </em>sum, whereas it appears on the record, that <em>\u00a35. </em>was levied on the first <em>fi. fa. </em>The jury in their verdict have foun\u00e1 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>against the express admission of the parties on record! it is a general verdict for the whole sum which is erroneous. <em>Figers </em>\u00bb. <em>Aldrich, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b145-5\"><em>It </em>is perfectly immaterial whether the error appears as there, on demurrer, or as in this case, ia arrest of judgment! errors apparent on the record, which show a complete bar to the plaintiff\u2019s claim, or that he has pursued a wrong remedy, may be taken advantage of at this stage of the cause. The writ here is clearly erroneous; it should have been an <em>alias ji. fa. </em>for the residue, or a <em>sci. </em>fa, for the residue, and not for the whole amount of the original judgment\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b145-6\"><em>Leake </em>and <em>IJorvell </em>for the plaintiff,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdT\">acknowledged that the \u00abourt must give judgment upon die record, without regard, to a contrary finding of the jury; but they insisted, Is? that the levy in this case on the <em>ft. fa. </em>could not be taken to be beyond the value returned by the sheriff, <em>viz fS. </em>The case of <em>Clerk v. Withers </em>which has been cited proves nothing further, than that when the sheriff liar, actually seized to the amount, of the execution, such levy is a bar.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-7\"><em>2d </em>When an execution has been permitted to lie dormant and unexecuted for more than a year, it is competent for the plaintiff to revive his judgment by a <em>sci.fa. </em>and this so far from operating to the prejudice of the defendant, is unquestionably calculated to promote his advantage as much as a <em>sci.fa. </em>where no execution has been issued. He has it in Ms power to plead <em>payment or </em>a release in his discharge, and the right arises from a liberal extension of the statute, so as to meet cases within its obvious intent.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b145-8\"><em>3d </em>In this case the sheriff has interposed an apparent satisfaction of the plaintiff\u2019s judgment, by executing a transfer under the first execution; in such circumstances it was impossible for the plaintiff to have the benefit of the writ; and the <em>sci.fa. </em>is a proceeding, which can alone give an effectual remedy! under this the plaintiff can prove every thing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>that goes to show the judgment unsatisfied, and the defendant is let in to establish by testimony every circumstance that will go to his discharge, by showing either a partial or a total payment. It gives an opportunity to try the cause upon its actual merits, and secures to the parties the benefit of a jury of their country.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-8\">As to the <em>2d </em>objection that the <em>scire facias </em>should have been special it was answered,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-9\">1 <em>st </em>That it might have been so, had the plaintiff actually received any portion of his debt; but it appears there has not been even a partial payment to him. The property levied upon, was never actually sold; the entire debt remains unsatisfied; a mere return by the sheriff of property <em>levied </em>upon, is no payment to the plaintiff and no discharge of the defendant, until sold.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-10\"><em>2d </em>Admitting it an actual payment, it was then matter of plea <em>pro tanto. </em>The defendant had pleaded payment, which is a good plea to the <em>sci.fa. </em>and after verdict, the court must presume it was allowed so far as it was supported by the testimony.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b146-11\"><em>3d </em>This objection comes too late after verdict.</summary>\n<footnote data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"AiL\"> 1 Salk. 322. pi. 10</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b143-8\"><em> </em>Cro.

Note. \u2014 This case in Burrows is by no means conclusive upon the poiut for which it appears to have been cited, but the law is correctly laid down by tlie counsel as will appear by reference to <em>7 Bac. abr, </em>40, and the cases there sited.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b146-12\">Kinsey C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"ATh\">delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-13\">As to the first objection taken by the defendant, on this motion in arrest of judgment, we think that a <em>scire facias </em>lies under the statute in all cases where the whole debt has not been levied, upon the execution. 1 <em>Richardson's B. R. </em>289. <em>Kettleby v. Hales </em>3 <em>Lev. 119. Lutes </em>402.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-14\">On the second objection; \u2014 regularly the <em>sci. fa. </em>should have been special <em>pro. </em>residuo, reciting the previous levy; but the defect cannot at this stage of the cause, be admitted to prevail. The case in <em>Burrows </em>is clearly distinguishable, and there, the error was taken advantage of on demurrer. The case of <em>Kettleby v. Hales </em>was open to the same objection, but it does not appear to have been thought of. At any rate, after verdict the objection comes too late.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-15\">Judgment <em>for plaintiff.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
