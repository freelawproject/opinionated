The declaration had stated certain covenants made on the <em>IMh </em>of August-1779 which from the acknowledged terms of the instrument should have been performed at least in the life time of the testator: \u2014 that breaches had been assigned in the non-performance of these covenants by the testator in his life time on request. The plea of the defendants after craving oyer of the articles, had explicitly admitted this construction of the covenants, (namely that they were to be performed in the life time of the testator) by confessing their legal operation as stated in the de\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>\u25a0tlaraiioa\u00bb and averring a precise performance o\u00ed\u2019them. Could any thing wear a more singular aspect in a court of law, than to offer to prove the execution of a contract, by the testator in his life time, from an instrument which had no validity nor legal operation until after lvis death; \u2014 -and by provisions under it which could not for a certain period, and might not for a remote one benefit the plaintiff. They cited the case of <em>Dunham v. Admr. of Hadden </em>decided at the last <em>Burlington </em>assizes, in which it was held that under a plea of payment by testator, payment by the executors was inadmissible evidence. On ibe whole the evidence offered, so far from establishing the plea, was irreconcilably at variance with it, and in fact confessed the breach as laid in the declaration.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-4\">With regard to the plea of payment by the executors since the death of the testator they contended 1 <em>st </em>That the will as stated by the counsel did not intitule the bequest of any money whatever to the plaintiff, nor was it pretended that the executors under the will had paid him any. <em>%My </em>That under the plea of payment, the executors could be permitted to show only a strict payment of money in discharge of the covenant broken; or, under the notice, to set-off a counter demand of the testator. \u2014 In neither point of view did the will or the execution of it by the executor support this plea. In the light of strict payment, it was impossible seriously to contend for it. The executors merely executed a trust raised by the will; \u2014they assented to and delivered the specifick legacies given by the testator to the plaintiff; and as these bequests were not expressly given in satisfaction of debts the executors could have neither pretence nor right to annex a condition or qualification which the testator had not created. They had done no more than to put the plaintiff in possession of property, in which he had acquired a vested interest under the will.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b389-5\">Considering it in the light of a set-off the proposition contended for by the defendant would appear still more untenable. A set-off under the \u201c Act for preventing multiplicity -if actions\u201d passed May <em>Slh </em>1723. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>as is evident both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>from the preamble and enacting clause, is limited to dealings and contracts between parties upon which a balance of debt ar*ses *n hivour of the one or the other. The words of the <em>Section </em>are, \u201c If any two or more dealing together, or \u201c having dealt together, be indebted to each other upon bonds, bills, bargains, promises, accounts, or the like See. if \u201c defendant cannot gainsay the deed &amp;c. he may plead pay\u00bb <em>a meat </em>and give notice with the said plea of what he will in- \u00a3\u2018 sist on at the trial by any bond, bill, receipt, account, or \u201c bargain, or else forever be barred of bringing any action for <em>\u201c </em>that which he might/w ought to have pleaded by virtue of <em>tl </em>this act.\u201d- From these words and from the avowed design of the law as exhibited in the title, it is manifest, that nothing can be the subject matter or a set-off within the intentions of the legislature, but an actual subsisting debtj a debt upon which a cross action could 4\u00a3vc been maintained before the passing of the act. The argument for the defendant was in fact bottomed upon and terminated in these propositions:\u2014 that a testator by the gift of an unconditional legacy to his creditor, raised a debt against him: \u2014 and that the executors could have maintained a suit against the plaintiff for the property given to him under the will of their testator.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-5\">It is further to be observed upon this plea of payment by the executors and set-off, that no plea of payment could be pleaded to a single obligation without an acquittance under seal. The debt is raised immediately upon the execution of the instrument, and can be discharged only by matter of as high a nature. <em>Blake's </em>case <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Preston v. Christmas, </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This latter case went even further and proved that the defendants could not have pleaded the acceptance of the legacies even by way of accord and satisfaction without deed. If therefore the facts which are offered to be proved, are admissible under any plea that might have been framed, they clearly are not so in the present case.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b390-6\">' <em>%dly </em>But the evidence proposed creates no legal defence under any form of pleading, and therefore is clearly inadmissible. The construction put upon these articles by the defendant is, that the whole instrument taken together should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>hs; construed into covenants by way of provision or portion for a child, and if so the bequests and devises to the son in the will, amounted to a complete equivalent and ought to go in satisfaction of the covenants. But in the first place there is nothing in the instrument which warrants such a construction, E very part of it shows clearly that there was a legal contract between <em>Alexander Moore </em>the father and <em>Alexander Moore </em>the son for a valuable consideration, to be performed <em>in prccsenti </em>forming a mutual obligation, and creating immediately, and in the strict sense of the phrase, a debt. The preamble to the instrument, and the consideration specified show abundantly that it was not intended to secure to the plaintiff a bounty or portion from his father, but carried on the face of the instrument, what it in fact purported to be, a composition for actually subsisting claims and demands. The mere mention of the connexion which existed between the parties affords no ground for drawing an inference of so important a nature: it is to be regarded as a description of the persons (they having the same name) between whom the agreement was made.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-3\">Nor can the language of the instrument where the testator covenants to <em>give </em>a lease, to <em>give </em>\u00a31000, justify the interpretation which it has been attempted to fix upon it. This word does not when employed in legal instruments necessarily dc-flote a mere bounty: but is usually inserted in deeds and conveyances where the consideration precedes the transfer of the property. It comes precisely within one class of contracts mentioned by <em>Blackstone fado ut des. % Bl. Com. </em>M&lt;5. The plaintiff releases in consideration that the testator should give.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-4\">But in the law the word give, independently of a consideration expressed, is amply sufficient to create a debt. 44 These words41 am content to give to W. \u00a310.\u2019 amount to an obligation and an express engagement to pay.\u201d 5 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>158, <em>tit. </em>\u201c Obligations.\u201d B. which authority goes further than tb\u00a9case before the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b391-5\">If the court were satisfied that this covenant was sufficient to raise a strict debt or duty, upon which an action could have been maintained against the testator in his life tunes it,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AxWR\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>would not be difficult to show that neither in law nor in equity, could general legacies or bequests in a will, amount to a satisTacti\u00b0n. The case of <em>Goodfelloxv v. Burchett </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> is </em>stronger than the present. There one <em>Trill </em>on the marriage of bis daughter with the defendant gave him a bond for part of the portion: he afterwards devised lands to his son-in-law, his wife and their heirs of much greater val\u00fae than the debt. Yet the court although creditors were concerned, would not for a moment yield to the idea that the devise was to be considered as a satisfaction of the bond though there were a deficiency of assets.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-4\">Supposing for an instant however that this was a mere gift to the son, and by way of provision or portion, then secondly, it was not competent for a court of law to admit in satisfaction of express covenants, a collateral compensation, a performance by will, even if it clearly appeared that it was so intended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b392-5\">\u2022It was true that Courts of Equity had sometimes assumed a jurisdiction in certain cases, and had decreed legacies and devises as satisfaction of debts or covenants when the money-given, or the thing devised agreed in every respect with the money to be paid, or the act to be performed under the contract. <em>' </em>But this was only in cases where the court thought themselves entitled to infer from undoubted circumstances that such was the intention of the testator. So in cases of portion or provision for children, under circumstances leading to the same belief, those courts had decreed a provision by will to have the effect of payment or performance, though in some respects differing from the covenants if equally beneficial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG_\">These powers however had never been assumed by any other than courts vested with Chancery powers, and even with regard to them it has been thought that they have carried their doctrines upon this subject too far; and they have of late been inclined against considering legacies as a satisfaction, because to use the language of <em>Lord Hardwicke si </em>legacies naturally imply a bounty.\u201d 3 <em>Atk. 97.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>No cases can be shown where courts of law have adopted ihe language and doctrines of courts of Equity with regard to collateral satisfactions. In <em>Hargrave\u2019s Co. Lilt. </em>366. <em>n. </em>1. it is said collateral satisfactions at law are not a bar of dower, the remedy is purely equitable; and so it is here. If the interpretation for which the defendant contends can be supported by testimony, the court of Chancery is the proper tribunal before which to bring the question; but the admission of such testimony as is now offered, the entering into such questions as are now proposed, by a court of law, would unsettle the most indubitable and the longest established legal principles.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b393-3\"><em>Leake </em>and <em>Ogden </em>contra</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"All\">Contended that the question as to the effect of the evidence proposed was not regularly before the court, upon an objection which went to resist its admission. Testimony is inadmissible in a court of justice where it flows from an interested or a criminal source or where the policy of the law or the want of some legal formality renders its introduction improper; but if not thus tainted^ it should be heard, and its legal operation should be a mat\u00bb ter for the after consideration of the court and jury. This rule should more especially be observed in cases of written testimony, where the writings should always be proved before the effect of them can come under consideration. This has been distinctly settled in the case of a deed, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>not upon the principle of its having a piece of was attached to its but because, whether it supported the issue or not, was <em>a </em>question which could be best determined after the contents were read in evidence to the jury.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b393-4\">Between a deed and any other written instrument it would be difficult to establish a distinction; and if it should be con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>tended that the seal constitutes the difference, an iinswec would be afforded by the fact that in this case the will actu - ally had a seal, was attested by three witnesses, and was , <em>J </em>,,, .. \u2019 . therefore as solemn an instrument as could be iramed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-7\">Courts should never, except in cases of the last extremity, or when it is to avoid manifest attempts to mislead or delay, entertain these exceptions to the admissibility of evidence. Too much light can rarely be thrown upon a litigated question, and if it should be tinctured by the medium through which it passes, it is within the province and capacity of a jury to detect the error or the deception. Objections of this kind have a tendency to-throw too much power into the hands of the court, and to infringe upon the clearly defined rights of juries. Juries have a right if they think it proper to reject the opinion of the court upon the law, and in every case to give a general verdict. This right which, un\u00bb questionably belongs to them, if it does not afford a sufficient ground to overturn all exceptions of this nature, should at least be so far considered by the court as to prevent them when not absolutely bound by preceding decisions, from closing to the jury any of the avenues to the truth, and subjecting their high privileges to the mercy of the court.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-8\"><em>-%dly </em>Admitting however that the question was properly before the court, they contended <em>first, </em>that the evidence offered coincided sufficiently with the plea of performance by the testator in his life time. It was a covenant to give, neither the time when, nor the manner in which it war, to be effected was specified. It appears that four years after the execution of the covenant he actually publishes his last will, under which a disposition of his property was made similar to that which he had engaged to make, and this will was never revoked.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b394-9\">Supposing that the bequests in the will amounted to a performance of the original covenants, there appeared nothing at variance either with the rules of pleading or common sense in averring the performance to be made in the life time of the testator. So far as it was the act of the testator it was executed while he was alive, and though its operation was not complete until consummated by his death, yet it had it* av&gt; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>f.eption at a previous period. It is; undeniable that to some purposes :i will has relation to the time of its execution, which it becomes as material to fix as the date of any, other .instrument. Although it is necessary that the death o\u00ed the testator should give complete effect to this species of instrument yet the disposition of the estate is literally made during his life.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-6\">If the evidence did not precisely accord with the plea, this was to lie attributed rather to the nature of the instrument to which reference was to be made, than to any defect in the mode of drawing the plea. It could not be pleaded that the executors had performed the covenants, because unJess the will amounted to a compliance with the terms of the covenant, their acts as executors could not supply the deficiency. If the plea had stated that the testator had performed after his death, or by the act of dying, far more room \u25a0would have been found for exciting the smiles of the court than the present mode has afforded. The plea was intended to state that the testator himself performed, and the words <em>in Ms life time </em>are to be considered rather as legal formality or technical inference than any thing substantial.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-7\"><em>fjd </em>If the forms of pleading would allow of the admission of the evi dence, then the evidence itself furnished, a good arid legal defence to the action. This depended upon two considerations which constituted the grounds of the plaintiff\u2019s objection <em>\u2014first </em>the construction of the articles, <em>secondly </em>the jurisdiction of the court, or more properly speaking its capacity to do justice.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b395-8\"><em>First </em>On the construction of the instrument, it was on the face of it manifestly a voluntary and gratuitous settlement upon a son. The phraseology employed and the nature of the provisions lead directly to that conclusion, <em>it is </em>mated to he a covenant between father and son, \u2014 -no pecuniar)' consideration is expressed, \u2014 -and with respect to the son\u2019s releasing his claims &amp;c. it unquestionably had reference to any future demands upon his father\u2019s estate as heir at law, 1\u2019be nature of the provisions clearly corroborates this interpretation. He gives his son a farm, half his furniture, \u2014 -provisions for his family for a year, fire-wood for four yearn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>horses, cows, &amp;c. These are precisely what a father might be expected to give his son as an outfit, and they tend to strengthen the idea that they were so intended.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-8\">If by the term strict debt, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel meant to imply that under these articles an action of covenant or debt might have been maintained against the testator in his life time, there is no intention or wish to dispute the correctness of their judgment. If however it was intended to assert that the covenants were entered into for value received, or for any valuable consideration whatever, the case is altogether different. The law cited from <em>Bacon </em>is not denied. Covenant or debt might have been maintained, but the covenantee did not elect to pursue this course, and the covenantor has given by his will what amounts to a full performance of the benefit intended by the original articles, if they are considered as securing a portion.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-9\">With regard to the principle that there can be no collateral Satisfaction for the breach of an express covenant, it is contradicted by cases of undisputed authority, <em>Lord Hardwlcke </em>found fault only with the too common error of pushing a correct doctrine to an extravagant excess, and not with the principle itself. In the cases of <em>Blandy v. Widmore </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Wilcocks v. Wilcocks </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the doctrine for which we contend is recognized to' the full extent of our wishes; and even further for they prove that an estate thrown upon a covenantee by the act of law should go in satisfaction of an express covenant.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-10\">It has however been contended that whatever may have been the decisions in equity upon questions of this nature, it does not come within the powers of a court of common law to examine, under the plea of performance, into those circumstances which in equity might be considered as a complete performance and satisfaction of the express undertaking.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b396-11\">Upon this question it may be observed that in the action of covenant, there being strictly speaking no general issue, -the plea of performance which approaches as near to it as possible, ought to be considered as analogous to the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>Issue, which according to <em>Blackstone 3 </em>Com. 306. \u201c leaves every thing open, the fact, the law, and the equity of the, case.\u20195 Under the plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>any thing which show s that <em>ex equo et bono </em>the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, maybe given in evidence, as payment, usury, duress, nonage, &amp;:c. Upon what ground then are we prevented from introducing an instrument, the operation of which is to preclude the plaintiff from recovering by showing that he has sustained no inconvenience or damage.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-3\">But an action of covenant is an action for damages, and the damages to be recovered should be proportionate to the actual injury received. It is therefore of extreme importance that this evidence should he received upon the principle that whatever tends to diminish the damages, though it does not entirely destroy the demand, is admissible in testimony\u00bb It would be unnecessary to cite cases for the purpose of proving this doctrine, and that it is uniformly acted upon in actions of assault, slander, actions <em>per </em>quod, -which in effect differ in no respect from the present case. \u2022</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-4\">There are circumstances in this case which most conclusively show the necessity of such a rule, and would almost justify a court in introducing it without any precedent or analogous case to warrant it. We have offered to prove that some of the identical articles which by the articles were covenanted to be conveyed, were actually bequeathed by the will, and have in fact been delivered to the plaintiff. Is it to be allowed that he shall recover damages for the non delivery of these articles, when in fact they have been delivered. In trover the defendant is always permitted to prove the re turn or recaption of the goods in mitigation of damages; and with that view, if in no other, the present evidence should be received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b397-5\">There is however no rule of law or technical nicety which, prevents this court from receiving the evidence which we have offered in bar of the plaintiff\u2019s action. Such a performance, if designed as such, though not a literal compliance with the terms of the covenant is sufficient; and whether it was intended so to operate, whether it is equal in value, are questions which a court and jury are, to say least, as competent to decide as any Chancellor\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AENm\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>it becomes those who aim to limit the jurisdiction o; lias court to substantiate their exceptions by some clear and. dc-c^ve authority. It is acknowledged that if our interpretation be correct there is a tribunal from which we may receive justice, and as it does not appear that upon principle there, is any objection to the jurisdiction o\u00ed this court, the mere showing that courts of equity have assumed cognizance of such causes is not sufficient to prove their jurisdiction exclusive. A court of law possesses all the means of coming at the justice of a case which a court of equity can command; and as tvc did not make choice of this tribunal but were brought into it, it ought surely to be allowed us to make our defence here.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAt\">In the case of <em>Read v. Brookman </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was determined, that the obligee need not go into equity in case of a lost bond. This case was afterwards cited in <em>Atkinson v. Leonard </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in Chancery, when <em>Lord Chancellor Thurlovj </em>remarked that \u201c it does not follow because the court of law will give relief that this court loses its concurrent jurisdiction.\u201d This was a precedent where, what is warmly' called, an invasion of the peculiar jurisdiction of the courts of equity, was n ade without producing any inconveniences, and without exciting any unpleasant feelings on the part of those whose rights were thus infringed.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b398-4\">Courts of common law have of late years repeatedly extended redress beyond the ancient limits of the law, and have adopted this rule for their government never to send suitors into another court, if justice can be done as well in their own. The language of <em>Lord Kenyon </em>which <em>Buller </em>calls \u201c sound and manly\u201d is \u201cthat where he found justice and honesty on \u201c the side of a plaintiff here, he would never turn him round <em>a m </em>order to give him the chance of getting justice elsewhere.\u20199 Is <em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">This will cannot be received in evidence: \u2014 we are bound by the rules of law, and they offer insurmountable objections. The utmost time within which bylaw, the testator was allowed to perform these covenants, was during his own life; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number><em>'v </em>this respect the evidence does not support the plea of performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-3\">Hut wc are clear that whether the contents of the will are , o be regarded as a satisfaction, or performance of the original aj\u00edleles, is exclusively a subject of equitable jurisdiction. The constitution has not vested this court with power to decree covenants performed by general devises in a will to the covenantee. Whether such bequests ought <em>ex equo </em>to go in part or entire satisfaction of express covenants in a deed, cannot be the subject of a legal discretion; it must be referred altogether and entirely to the Court of Equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">The defendants then offered to prove that there were two parts of the articles declared on, and that at a certain tiras: the plaintiff being at the house of the testator, the latter produced his part which with the assent of the plaintiff and in his presence, was cancelled and destroyed by <em>Dr. Harris </em>one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">The Counsel for the plaintiff objected to the testimony. They contended that the covenant which was in the posses sion of the plaintiff had been produced and appeared not to be cancelled, and that it did not appear because the other party had destroyed his, that therefore the whole contract was at an cud.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">But there had been in this case a plea of performance which admitted the existence of the articles at the time o!. pleading; the evidence offered was therefore in contradiction to the admission of the party tendering it. The defendant if he really had such a ground of defence ought to have plead\u00bb cd <em>non est factum. </em>Under the plea of payment in an actio\u00bb, on a bond it would not be permitted to prove that the obliga* tion had been cancelled before action brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-7\">Lastly if this evidence can have any operation it must be. by proving the fact of satisfaction, which should have beet-, specially pleaded, and cannot be given in evidence under this plea.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">The Counsel for the defendant argued in answer to the first: objection that both parts made but one instrupa^st, and thfii <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>if either was cancelled, with the consent of the parties to it3 both were at an end.</p>\n<p id=\"AYL\">With regard to the second and third objections they said that although cancellation did not absolutely prove perform.anee, yet it was evidence from which performance might be inferred by the jury, and was therefore proper to go to them,</p>\n<author id=\"b400-4\">Per Cur.</author>\n<p id=\"AAQ\">The cancellation of an instrument may be considered as evidence either that an existing obligation had been destroyed, or that it had been actually performed. If it was cancelled in consequence of performance, it is unquestionably evidence of that fact. The jury must draw their own inferences. \u00b0</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">The <em>Chief Justice </em>observed during this argument that according to the old cases the plea <em>of actio non </em>had reference to the time of pleading; \u2014 but that according to the modern decisions it referred to the commencement of the action, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">The plaintiff then offered to prove by one of the subscribing witnesses to the articles, who was the person that actually drew them, that the testator intended that the \u00a31000 given generally, should be paid in specie. The evidence was objected to on the ground that it was to alter the nature of the instrument; that the money given must be considered as the legal and current money of the time, but the objection was overruled by the Court who said that it was a case of <em>Jmbiguitas latens; </em>that the testimony was intended to show the actual meaning of the instrument and not to vary or contradict it, and the evidence was admitted, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">The jury in this case had agreed upon a verdict for defe\u00f1dant, but the plaintiff suffered a nonsuit.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b400-8\"><em>\u0430) </em>Note.
