The case was argued in <em>November Term </em>by <em>R. Stockton </em>and <em>Ab. Ogden </em>for the rule, and by <em>Leake </em>and <em>Aaron Ogden </em>against it; and again argued at this term <em>by </em>the same counsel.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>For the defendant, it was contended, that the execution of process was a personal authority, delegated to a special individual by whom alone it could legally be performed. That no interest vested in, and no duty devolved on the administrator as representative of a deceased sheriff; that he was not authorized to interfere in lands, and that tl)e authority to convey on a sale, was specially confined to the sheriff by the act of assembly.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b289-4\">For the plaintiff it was argued, that lands by the act of assembly and by the whole course of the decisions of the courts of this State, are made chattels for the payment of debts on execution; \u2014 that by the seizure, the sheriff acquired a special property in them, which at his death, could be considered as vesting only in his representatives, who might therefore be called upon to sell: \u2014 that a remedy in such cases ought to exist, and no other can be suggested.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b289-5\"><em>The Court </em>were unanimously of opinion tbat so far as respected the payment of debts on execution, lands were to eve\u00ab rv intent chattels; and that chattels seized in execution might be sold by the executor or administrator of a deceased sheriff.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">In delivering the opinion of the court, Kinsey C.

By the seizure the defendant is absolutely discharged from the debt; he may plead it to a <em>sci.fa. </em>or to an action on the judgment, and a second <em>fi.fa. </em>cannot issue after a seizure. <em>2 Ld.
