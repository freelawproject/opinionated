On the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number><em>(JLAd </em>of <em>November </em>1789. the prisoner came to the bouse <em>of </em>the deceased for the turkey which he demanded; the deceased being then absent from home at the house of one <em>Jansen </em>a Mack smith. The wife of the deceased desired the prisoner would cal! again when her husband should be at home, which he declined doing. She then told him that her husband hud left word, that if the prisoner took any fowl, he should, tak* one particular one, which the prisoner, after looking at it, said that he would not have, but would go and see the deceased upon the subject; \u2014 upon which she told him to take which he pleased. The prisoner then went out, caught a turkey, brought it into the house, and said, that he bad some busiueso at the Blacksmith\u2019s where he should see \u00bfhe deceased and settle with him for the fowl. The wife then requested be would not go there, expressed her apprehensions lest he might get into a quarrel with her husband, av:. wished him. to go home with the turkey which he promised he would do.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b449-3\">The prisoner took the turkey and carried it to his own house which was about a mile ac-t a half distant from that of the deceased. After remaining ac home sometime, during which he was assisting his brother in some work, he took a shovel, which required mend mg, at, tho desire of his brother, to the blacksmith\u2019s shop, which win about half way between where the prisoner lived, and. the. house of the dec-creed. He found the deceased at the shop standing near the door. After some words had passed upon the cuaject of the prisoner\u2019s taking the turkey, the deceased appeared angry, gave the prisoner some harsh language calling him a Chief. The prisoner then went into the shop, the deceased following immediately after him, joat\u00ed\u00edng the prisoner with bis elbow, and using extremely abusivo language, \u2014 ih prisoner at this time making no resistance. \u2014 When they bad gut into the shop, and. after some further words had passed lchui.e to their taking the law of each other, the deceased said if it war not for the law he would whip the prisoner\u00bb and the latter rcnlied he need xioi be aft aid of that, and he was: ready for him. Thereupon the deceased made up to die prisoner, struck him, and, seized him by the hair, when the prisoner caught him by tho \u2022CMgh or round the body\u00bb and ran him up bato a comer v! vh\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>shop, when the blacksmith interfered, parted them, gave to each his hat and expostulated with them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-6\">After they were separated,the deceased and the prisoner were standing several feet apart when the quarrel was renewed, the deceased first using aggravating language, to which the prisoner replied in a similar strain, when the former stepped up and struck the latter, who returned the blow and struck the deceased in the face. The prisoner upon receiving the blows from the deceased fell against the vice, when he took up a club, and struck the latter a blow which knocked, him down, and occasioned his death.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-7\">It also appeared from the testimony both of the blacksmith and his son, that when the prisoner gave the fatal blow, he could not in their opinion have retreated further; that near the place where he took up the club, with which he struck the deceased, there were also the handle of a dung-fork, some blacksmith\u2019s hammers, and some old <em>scythes, any </em>of which the prisoner might have taken in his hand, as easily as the club with which he gave the mortal stroke.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-8\">It appeared that the fracture in the skull of the deceased was upwards of five inches in length, and about an inch and a half in breadth, and the bones were much broken.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-9\">Two of the witnesses also swore, that the prisoner, in conversation with them afterwards on the day the affray occurred, declared to them, he could manage the deceased almost as he pleased. To another of the witnesses he said, the deceased was no more in his hands than a child; and to another, that when the deceased struck him in the second affray, ho looked toward the door in order to go out, but as he could handle the deceased as he pleased, he thought it would appear cowardly and he would not do it.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b450-10\">The defence set up by the prisoner\u2019s Counsel was that of excusable homicide. After citing several authorities to show what was the legal signification of this phrase, they examined one or two witnesses to show that the prisoner was on friendly terms with the deceased, and to rebut an idea, which, had been rather intimated than proved, that there was a previously subsisting quarrel between them.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>The Judge in his charge to the jury having observed that as the ret of homicide was fully proved, aud indeed admitted on behalf of the prisoner, told them the subject of their inquiry wi,a, whether the prisoner, at the bar wan guilty as he stood charged in the indictment or not:--that homicide was in some cases justifiable, and in others was excusable, but, he remarked that whoever would shelter himself under the plea of self defence, more particularly in the case of a mutual conflict, must make it appear, that, before ih ^ &gt;orU.\u00a11 stroke was given, he had declined any further combat; \u2014 that he had retreated as far as it was possible to do with safety,- \u2014 and that he killed his adversary through mei e necessity, in order to avoid his own destruction.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-3\">He informed them further that it was the peculiar province of the jury, after hearing the evidence given, to determine in their own minds, whether, upon the evidence so given, the prisoner, before striking the mortal blow, had retreated as far as <em>ho </em>could with safely;- \u2014 and whether he had killed his adversary through mere necessity, and for the preservation of Ms own life. If they should be satisfied that he had not failed in either of these circumstances, they would acquit the prisoner; if otherwise, it was their obvious duty to find him guilty as charged in the indictment,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-4\">The jury after being out seme time sent a note to the Judge requesting permission to come into Court, which being granted they accordingly came, and by their foreman desired again to hear the testimony of the blacksmith and his son, who were called and repeated their testimony much to the same purport as before, but said that the prisoner upon being struck in the second affray, fell up against, or retreated to the side of the shop. The jury then requested the judge again to state to them the law relating to excusable homicide.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b451-5\">The Judge repeated in substance what he had before stated., with this further remark \u2014 -that although it might be contended from some of &gt;he authorities which had been cited, that filter a person assaulted had retreated as far as it was in his power, to avoid a battery or some bodily harm, it would be, excusable in him to protect himself from further injury by 'rilling his adversary, yet; he thought this was not a principie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>warranted by the law, but that the observations which he had before made and the limitations he had pointed out coincided with the ideas o\u00ed .7ir <em>Michael Foster, </em>and were grounded in reason; \u2014 for were it .otherwise the life of the citizen would be unnecessarily anebugered, and would betaken away at too easy a rate.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-7\">During the trial <em>an. </em>counsel for the State offered testimony to prove che copy , -cations of the prisoner relative to the affray. This was ^bjccted to on behalf of the prisoner upon the ground that his written confession had been already read in evidence. The court however overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b452-8\">The counsel for the prisoner offered evidence to prove the characters of the deceased, and of the prisoner: this was objected to and the objection allowed.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b452-9\">The motion for r new trial was argued by <em>Aa. Ogden </em>and <em>R. Stockton </em>for the prisoner, and <em>Woodruff </em>attorney general for the State.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b452-10\">Kinsey C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"AMq\">There are three grounds upon which the counsel for the prisoner found their application for a new-trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-11\"><em>\u00edst </em>It has been contended that the Judge who presided at the trial misconceived the law, when he charged the jury that to excuse the commission of homicide as done <em>se defendiendo, </em>it ought to appear the killing was through mere necessity, and to prevent his own destruction; otherwise it amounted' to manslaughter. The counsel have urged that this principle was laid down by the court in too broad and unlimited a manner: that the apprehension of an enormous battery would equally excuse the killing of an adversary; and the circumstances of this case warrant the application of this principle of defence.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-12\"><em>2d </em>The Judge was wrong in admitting parol evidence of a confession of the prisoner, variant from the written confession, taken in a more solemn and authoritative form.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-13\"><em>3d </em>That evidence of the general characters of the prisoner and the deceased was improperly overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Willi regal'd to this last point I think clearly that the court was mistaken. The defendant has an unquestionable right to adduce testimony tending to show his general good and p&amp;cifick character, and to let it have w hat weight it may be entitled to with the jury. Still if evidence of this kind is admitted, I should think it my duty to inform the jury, that it should receive little attention in any case, unless where the fact is itself dubious, or where the charge rests altogether upon presumptive testimony. Against the positive declara\u00bb tions of honest witnesses it ought not to be permitted to weigh.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">Upon the second point the court was unquestionably right\u00bb No authority has been adduced by the prisoner\u2019s counsel to support the doctrine for which they contend, and the argument that has been offered is far from convincing. I take the law to be that parol evidence of the confession before the Justice would be improper; blit confessions made at another time and place, although different from that made before the Justice are evidence. Indeed upon any other principle this monstrous consequence would ensue, tbat if a criminal had twenty times acknowledged the commission of a fact, and should afterwards refuse to confess it, upon an examination before the Justice, for the very purpose of preventing any proof of his former acknowledgements, he would by his own act defeat the ends of Justice. <em>Fearshire\u2019s case Leach </em>446. and <em>The King v. Jacobs </em>&amp; <em>al Ibid 285. </em>establish this fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">We now come to the most material question in this case, <em>viz. </em>whether the offence proved to have been committed by the prisoner comes up to the legal signification of the wort! manslaughters \u2014 -and I am of opinion it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">A reference to <em>NailoFs </em>case <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>is sufficient to remove all doubt upon this point. In that case the prisoner was indicted for the murder of Ms brother, and the circumstances as they appeared in evidence were, \u201c that the prisoner on the night the fact was committed came home drunk. His fa- \u201c ther ordered him to go to bed which he refused to doj 48 whereupon a scuffle ensued betwixt the father and son\u00bb ;8 The deceased who was then in bed, hearing the, disturbance. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>\u00ab g0\u00a3 up, and fell upon the prisoner, threw him down, and \u201cbeat him upon the ground; and | there kept him down, so \u201c that he could not escape, nor avoid the blows. While they \u201c were thus striving together, the prisoner gave the deceased \u201c a wound with a pen-knife, of which wound he died.\u201d Some doubts existing in the minds of the Judges, a special verdict was found stating these circumstances, and upon a conference with all the judges of England it was unanimously holden to be manslaughter \u2014 for there did not appear to be any inevi46 table necessity so as to excuse the killing in this manner.\u201d In a note to this case, which I presume to be Foster\u2019s, it is said, the deceased did not appear to aim at the prisoner\u2019s life, but rather to. chastise him for his misbehaviour and insolence towards his father.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In the present case, the attack of the deceased was without any kind of weapon that might have rendered it necessary for the prisoner to avail himself of the instrument which occasioned the death. On his own confession, much less would have been sufficient, and I consider it therefore as clearly manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">What I particularly allude to, is the declaration of the prisoner to the witnesses who have been sworn, made soon after the affray, that he- could manage the deceased as he pleased, and that he was no more than a child. These declarations show there could have been no necessity for the weapon, and they are proper to be relied upon. See also the case of <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Oneby 2 Ld. Ray. </em>1485.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">The observations I have made render it unnecessary to enter further into the discussion of the question that has been raised, than to remark, that in,my opinion, no man is justified or excusable in taking away the life of another unless the ne'cessity for so doing is apparent as the only means of avoiding his own destruction or some very great injury, neither of which appears to have been reasonably apprehended in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Upon the whole case I am of opinion that there should be no, new trials for if justice has been done, and if the result of another trial ought to be the same as this, and the court are decidedly of this opinion, though the Judge may have direct\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>ed the jury improperly, or have rejected evidence which strictly speaking ought to have been admitted, yet a new trial should not be granted and would in no degree advance the ends of justice. <em>Edmonson </em>v. <em>Machell, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b455-4\">In considering this question, I have purposely avoided mentioning many circumstances which operate strongly against the defendant; \u2014 which show that he was full as eager for the combat as the deceased; \u2014 -that he manifested no inclination to decline the affray, which led to the unhappy circumstance which has brought down a just but severe punishment upon himself\u00bb</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">New Trial <em>refused,</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\"> Fester 2?8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b455-9\"> 2 T.
