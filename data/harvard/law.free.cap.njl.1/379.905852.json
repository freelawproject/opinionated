A witness was called to prove that at a certain time the records of <em>Gloucester County </em>were destroyed by fire.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-11\"><em>Leake </em>and <em>Aa, Ogden </em>for the defendant,</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ahe\">objected to proof of the destruction, before a legal ground for the admission of the evidence was laid, by proving in the first place the existence of the survey.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-12\">It is an essential preliminary before evidence k admitted! of the loss of a paper, to show that the title, deed, or survey had a legal execution or perfection; when that is made out the rules of law permit the party to prove its contents or loss,</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-13\">St is not denied that a plaintiff in ejectment may begin with any link of his title provided the proof offered is of itself legal evidence; but the testimony now offered is net evidence, until the previous fact of a legal survey is first established. The law admits the proof of a bond by testimony establishing the hand writing of the witnesses, but not until their absence or death is first made out. It is secondary evidence and the reasons of its production must first be shown.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b403-14\">The course proposed will frequently occasion a needless waste of time. After having through aseries of tedious testimony reached the fact of a destruction, it may all be rendered unnecessary by a failure in the proof of the existence of the paper or its contente\u00bb</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b403-15\"><em>M. Stockton </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ADTW\">There is no rule of law which prevents a party from pursuing that order in the introduc - tion of his testimony which he deems expedient. The plain-CuT reljies upoa % sur/cy not avvr to be found, ia which, cate. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>tbe law require him to prove its existence, loss, and contents j and it is altogether discretionary with him whether he begins by proving the existence of the instrument or its loss.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-8\">The case of a bond cited by <em>Mr. Leake </em>is unquestionable law, and would be analogous to the present case had we attempted to prove the contents in the first place. But the proof of the loss is a part of the preliminary proof which that case requires.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-9\">The argument drawn from the waste of time proves too much for even the defendants objection; it would require the existence, loss, and contents to be proved together and not consecutively in any order. A failure in either point of the Case would render the whole evidence useless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-10\">Pr. Smith J. (Chetwoqd J. Assenting.) We think the plaintiff is at liberty to adduce his testimony in the way he thinks most advantageous for himself.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-11\"><em>2d Mr. Adams (Secretary of State) </em>was called on the part of the plaintiff to pro ve there was a publick book in his office of <em>deeds and surveys </em>made in <em>Gloucester </em>county, in order to warrant an inference that deeds and surveys were formerly recorded together in that county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b404-12\">The counsel for defendant objected that the book itself should be produced.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b404-13\"><em>Stockton </em>find <em>Alb.

If it was a question whether a certain book con\u00bb <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>' </em>allied both laws and resolutions of ihe legislature, the clerk's certificate on oath would be good c\\ idence of the fact.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AOCS\"><em>I,cake </em>and <em>Aa.

The issue is <em>devisavit vel </em>non, and the existence of the book, its condition, and general contents are to be proved; surely it must be by producing the original, and not by collateral, which must necessarily be inferior, evidence.\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-6\">Smith J. (Chetwood J. Assenting.) The book itself should be produced: that will show what it really is. If copies would have answered the plaintiff should have come prepared with them| if they would not, it is a case out of the aci; and the book itself must be brought.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-7\"><em>3d It </em>became a question whether one <em>Thomas Sharp </em>was a deputy surveyor of the Proprietaries. The counsel for the. plaintiff contended it was sufficient to show he acted as such; that he was generally reputed tobe a legal surveyor, and they said being a private authority it was not proveable.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-8\">Per. Cur. You may prove that he acted as surveyor in the locating of lands, and was generally presumed to hold the situation; this will be evidence of a deputation.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-9\"><em>Mh </em>The plaintiff offered sworn copies of maps and surveys extracted from <em>Sharp\u2019s </em>book in evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-10\">The counsel for defendant objected\u2014</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-11\"><em>1st </em>That the book itself was not a book of record nor made so by act of Assembly, but merely a private collection of maps and surveys, and if evidence at all the original must be produced.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b405-12\"><em>2d </em>Neither the act of <em>March </em>27th 1719. <em>sec. </em>10. <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>nor that of <em>December 2d </em>1743. <em>sec. 8. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>made copies of such books evidence: the first having reference only to copies of surveys after 1719, and enacting that surveys antecedently collected should be kept in the office, making a clear distinction between them; and the latter act applying only to deed;.. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>and conveyances acknowledged in the manner directed in the <em>second </em>section\u00bb</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGeE\">For the plaintiff it was answered: \u2014 Admitting the rule of <em>'iaw w\u20181^1 </em>respect to originals of a private nature to be as is contended by the other side, yet sworn copies of books of a pubiick nature though not records were admissible evidence\u00bb <em>Lynche v.
