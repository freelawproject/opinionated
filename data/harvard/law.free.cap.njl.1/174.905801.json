On the trial, he proved that between the <em>20th </em>of <em>September </em>1776, and the <em>3d </em>of <em>October </em>1779, he had made a tender in continental bills. The court charged the jury that it was not necessary to prove the bills to have been emitted prior to the <em>20th September </em>1776; to which opinion a bill of exceptions was taken, and the question before this court on the writ of error, was whether this opinion o\u00a3 the court below was correct.</summary>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-10\">Kinsey C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">On the trial of this cause, the defendant proved, that in the month, of June 1777 he tendered to the plaintiff\u2019s testator, ninety-five dollars in continental money, who refused it,, saying that it was not made to pay debts, but to support war, and he would rather lose his debt than receive it in payment, On this evidence, after reading the act of September <em>2Oth </em>1776, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the defendant rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">The counsel for the plaintiffs insisted it was not a legal tender, unless the defendant further showed, that the bills were emitted prior to the passing of this act, as under that, bills then emitted were alone made a tender: \u2014 but the court \"held the tender sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">On a perusal of that act we are clear, that to enable a party to claim the benefit of it, he must prove, the bills he offered are such as are thereby made a tender. The <em>preamble </em>recites that disaffected persons had refused to take the bills which the continental congress and the late convention emitted, and then it is enacted, \u201c that the bills, emitted, and made current by the continental congress, and the con- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00ab vention of the state, shall be, when properly tendered, a Bar *5 to any future demand.\u201d</p>\n<headnotes id=\"b199-10\"><em>Note. </em>\u2014 See the e \u00bb\u25a0, :, .T \u25a0; l1. \u00a1l):X <em>Go6.

Tenders are always to be considered <em>stricli juris, </em>and if it be not legal, even <em>a </em>court of equity will not support it, nor supply a defect, <em>Gammon v. Stone. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Nor are they any more favoured at law, the rules which govern them are strict, and are strictly applied. The whole sum due must be tendered, although the debtor may be ignorant of its precise amount. To say \u201c I am ready to pay you\u201d is insufficient, there must be an offer of payment. In like manner the refusal must be absolute; to Tefase u till I consult my attorney\u201d is not a refusal in law. If a tender be made after the day of payment, it is not good unless the debtor has given reasonable notice of the time and place of his making it. In the case before the court however, the proof of the tender was essentially defective, inasmuch as the defendant did not prove tb'' bills he offered.
