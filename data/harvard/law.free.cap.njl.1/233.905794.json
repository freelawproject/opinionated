Although <em>Applegate </em>\u201c agrees to pay the money to Johnson\u201d yet it is \u201c for the use of the parties of the first part,\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number><em>There is </em>however no weight in this objection.

According to the sound and legal observation of <em>Ashhurst J. </em>in <em>Hotham v. East India Co. </em>1 T. R. 645. there are no precise technical words required in a deed to make a stipulation a condition precedent or subsequent;\u201d it <em>\u201c </em>depends upon the intention of the parties, the good sense of the case; and technical words should give way to such intention\u201d as is remarked by <em>Serf. Williams </em>1 Saund. 320 <em>a nota, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>So numerous are the cases in which this question has been involved, and so delicate are the shades o\u2018f difference which distinguish them, that the determination in each seems chiefly to rest upon its peculiar circumstances. The learned <em>Serjeant </em>Williams, in the note to which reference has already been made, ventures to deduce certain general rules which it may be important to give in his own words. 1st If a day be appointed for payment of money, or part of it, or for doing any other act; and the day is to happen, or may happen, before the thing which is the consideration of the money, cr the other act is to be performed; an action may be brought for the money, or for not doing such other act before performance; \u2014 for it appears that the party relied upon his remedy, and did not intend to make the performance a condition precedent: and so it is where no time is fixed for performance of that which is the consideration of the money or other act. <em>Dyer </em>76. <em>a. in margine.
