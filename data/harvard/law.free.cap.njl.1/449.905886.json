The testimony of the different witnesses varied much upon one point, whether she lived as a boarder at <em>Wood\u2019s, </em>or whether she performed any of the house work. There was no pretence of any express contract between the parties, but two of the witnesses for the plaintiff swore, that the testator had said in their presence, that his daughter lived well at <em>Wood\u2019s </em>and that he would pay him well, or satisfy him for it.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b473-8\"><em>R.

The amount demanded is \u00bfTlOOO.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">The defendants have pleaded the general issue, denying the whole demand, and the question for your determination is reduced to this simple form, \u2014 Whether, the estate of <em>Gill </em>is indebted to the plaintiff, and if so, to what amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-11\">every case where a man is bound by the ties of natural justice and equity to pay a particular sum, the law raises a promise to do it, and will compel its performance. Actions of this nature are founded upon express promises of payment, or upon implied promises. An implied promise is that which may be legally inferred by the jury from circumstances, and it is equally obligatory in conscience and in law with that which has been clothed in words. A familiar instance will render this doctrine perfectly intelligible: \u2014 a man sends to a shop for a pound of sugar which is obtained by him, here although there was no express or actual promise that he would pay the price of the commodity which he has received, the law supposes, and for reasons too obvious to require illustration, he undertook to satisfy the seller the full value of the article. Upon the same principle in almost</p>\n<p id=\"AKO\">From the evidence which you have heard in this case it appears, and this fact is not questioned, that <em>Mary Gill </em>the daughter of the testator did actually reside in the family of <em>Wood </em>for a considerable length of time. In what capacity she lived there, is not so clear, there being much variance iu the testimony of the different witnesses; some saying she lived there boarding as a lady, others that she earned her living by her services in the house, by her attention to and care of the family. This point it is your duty to settle; it is of considerable importance in the case, and will serve to explain the whole transaction between the parties; for if the plaintiff undertook to board and provide for this female, with the consent or at the request of the father; with the understanding at the time that he was to be recompensed by the fathei for what he did; \u2014 or that the testator made any actual promise of compensation, or did any act which would fully and clearly imply a promise, or one from the whole circumstances of which, it appears that <em>by </em>the ties of natural justice he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>uay st. he was liable and his executors are now bound</p>\n<p id=\"ARrD\">Ac \u00dcie daughter was of full age, and voluntarily departed friur, Nr father\u2019s roof, he is not by law bound to pay for her board and clothing in the house of another, unless he expressly promised so to do, or unless he did some act which implies a ovomise that he would pay. Slight circumstances are not uu.mck.-nt to warrant you in inferring a promise. I think the plaintiff ss bound to make it appear clearly to the jury that he took this girl to his house with a prospect and with the understanding that he was to be compensated; that she went with the consent of the father, and that the father did expressly or impliedly undertake to pay these necessary expenses. This proof should be clear and explicit, and the circumstances of this case prove, if proof was necessary, the wisdom and propriety of the rule: for if slight presumptions should be deemed sufficient to impose such a burthen upon a father, a man might be ruined by enormous bills of this description, which he never had any expectation would be brought up against him, and which in justice he is under no obligation to pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Let us then examine the testimony and see how far it supports the allegation of an express or implied promise. The only circumstance which appears to me to hear powerfully upon this point, is what has been stated by two of the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses, \u2014 that <em>Gill </em>in a conversation which took place In their hearing, in answer to the question what charge <em>Wood </em>had made, replied, he did not know, they had not settled, but added4\u00a3 he intended, or was to make satisfaction for her being- at <em>Wood\u2019s </em>for she lived well there.\u201d This is vague language, and may mean that, deducting all equitable allowances, he would make a fair compensation; \u2014 or that in consequence of the kind treatment which his daughter had met with, he felt himself called upon to make <em>Wood </em>some remuneration: the language is too vague to warrant of itself any \u25a0certain inference as to his meaning. At any rate, it was made to a third person, and after the daughter had been some time with <em>Wood, </em>after the consideration was past and ex-\u00absc\u00editcdj and it qgsnot therefore be regarded as <em>m </em>assumption <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>\u00a1binding in law, or sufficient to support an action, it appears t0 me q\u00a3 more weight as furnishing evidence, to show that he f1ad previously assumed to. pay the debt; but whether it is of itself, or in connexion with the other circumstances of the case, sufficient to authorize such an inference, you, and not the Court, are the proper judges.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The case seems to turn altogether upon questions of fact, which you will determ\u00edne, and apply to them the observations which have fallen from the Court. If you think from the whole case, that <em>Mary Gill </em>went to the plaintiff\u2019s house to live and be provided for, at the expense of the father, and with his concurrance, the plaintiff ought to recover. If you think the circumstances will not bear this construction, that there was neither an express nor implied promise to pay for her maintenance, or that she earned her support by her labour and services in the family, in either of these cases, I think your verdict should be for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"AiT\">Verdict for plaintiff <em>\u00a3150. </em>and 6 pence costs.</p>\n<p id=\"AXN\">The Jury were polled and they all agreed in the verdict.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
