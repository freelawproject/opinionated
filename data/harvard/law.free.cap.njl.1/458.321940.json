A <em>certiorari </em>might <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>as well lie to a court martial. The nature and objects of the tribunals are perfectly distinct, and one cannot, with any appearance of reason or show of propriety, interfere with the acts of the other. It is contrary to public policy to countenance proceedings of this nature, which, in a case of emergency, might retard, or perhaps totally frustrate, a levy of troops.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b483-5\">But it was ruled by the court that the writ well lay, and the proceedings appearing to be erroneous, they were quashed <em>quoad </em>Stevenson, the prosecutor.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">Assessment quashed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">Cited <em>in State </em>v. <em>Hanford, </em>6 <em>Hal. </em>71; <em>N.
