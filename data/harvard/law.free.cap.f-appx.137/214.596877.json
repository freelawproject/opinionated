The district court sentenced Nunez to sixty-three months imprisonment. Nunez appeals his convictions on the ground that the district court erred by failing to conduct a second <em>Faretta </em>hearing subsequent to the one the court held less than four months prior to his trial. <em>See Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b239-10\">From the outset, Nunez has been uncooperative. In total, three different counsel have been appointed to represent him. The district court granted Nunez\u2019s request to dismiss his first counsel. His second counsel moved to withdraw, stating that Nunez had accused him of discrimination and deceit. In compliance with Nunez\u2019s demands to proceed <em>pro se, </em>the third court-appointed counsel remained on as stand-by counsel. With each dismissal of counsel, Nunez demanded that he be allowed to proceed <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b239-11\">Nunez was also uncooperative in the district court\u2019s repeated attempts to ensure that Nunez was competent both to proceed to trial and to proceed <em>pro se. </em>On Nunez\u2019s first counsel\u2019s motion, the district court ordered a competency evaluation, but Nunez refused to cooperate with the doctor. Nunez was then sent to a federal facility for evaluation. After holding a competency hearing, the district court found that Nunez was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-13\">Approximately four months later, the court ordered a second competency evaluation. Again Nunez refused to cooperate with the doctor and was sent to a federal facility for evaluation. While there, Nunez submitted a letter to the court asking that he be allowed to represent himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-14\">On June 17, 2003, the district court held a competency hearing and a <em>Faretta </em>hearing. The district court found that Nunez was competent both to stand trial and to proceed <em>pro se </em>and that, by his obstructive conduct, Nunez had forfeited his right to be represented by counsel. The district court also entered an order directing Nunez\u2019s third court-appointed counsel to remain as stand-by counsel. The trial began on October 14, 2003. The jury returned a verdict of guilty a week later.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-15\">Apparently Nunez does not disagree with the district court\u2019s finding that he \u201cknowing and intelligently\u201d relinquished his right to be represented by counsel, <em>Faretta, </em>422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, at the time of the June 2003 hearing, which was four months prior to his trial. Instead, Nunez contends that the district court should have realized, either on the eve of trial or sometime during the trial, that he was no longer competent to represent himself and, therefore, should have held another <em>Faretta </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-16\">If we were to place upon the district court an obligation to reassess its <em>Faretta </em>hearing decision, we would do so only on a showing of a substantial change in circumstances since the initial hearing. <em>Cf. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number><em>ed States v. McBride, </em>362 F.3d 360, 367 (6th Cir.2004). Nunez has not demonstrated that there was a substantial change in his condition between the time of his <em>Faretta </em>hearing and his trial. To the contrary, his mental state, and uncooperative nature, appear to have remained constant throughout the proceedings. The district court committed no error in failing to <em>sua sponte </em>order a second <em>Faretta </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
