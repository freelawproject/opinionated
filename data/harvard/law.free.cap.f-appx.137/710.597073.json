Kessler, a Texas prisoner (# 909358), appeals from the magistrate judge\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 habeas corpus petition, in which Kessler challenged his 2000 jury-trial conviction of the aggravated sexual assault of his stepdaughter, Kelsey. The jury assessed a sentence of 99 years in prison and a $10,000 fine. The magistrate judge granted Kessler a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the issues \u201c(1) whether Kessler was denied due process or a fair trial through the introduction of extraneous offenses at trial, and (2) whether Kessler received ineffective assistance of counsel when his attorney failed to object to the introduction of extraneous offenses at trial.\u201d This court expanded the COA to include a claim that counsel performed ineffectively by failing to seek a limiting instruction on the extraneous-offense evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-7\">Federal habeas relief may not be granted upon any claim that was \u201cadjudicated on the merits in State court\u201d unless the adjudication \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>see Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 409, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b735-8\">The Texas Court of Appeals\u2019 unpublished opinion on direct appeal reported that the trial evidence showed that Kelsey, who was six at the time of the offense, described several occasions during which Kessler asked her to perform oral sex on him. Kelsey\u2019s mother and her brother, Joseph, observed Kelsey performing oral sex on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-11\">Other trial evidence reflected that Kessler, his wife Julie, and her three children were members of a nudist \u201cranch.\u201d At the time of trial, Julie had already pleaded guilty to the aggravated assault of Joseph, who was only seven or eight years old at the time, and had been sentenced to 15 years in prison. The testimony of Julie, an admitted abuser of methamphetamines, and of Kelsey and Joseph, indicated that both Kessler and Julie regularly committed sexual acts with both of Julie\u2019s older children, as well as with each other and a variety of people from outside the household, often in plain view of other family members. The evidence also included testimony about extraneous offenses and acts, including drug use; masturbation; unusual sexual practices; the use of bad language; domestic violence against Julie; the open presence of pornography, handcuffs, and chains in the household; the harboring of a juvenile runaway; Kessler\u2019s having given Julie a \u201cnympho sex slave diploma\u201d; and Kessler\u2019s and Julie\u2019s having given Kelsey her own vibrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-12\">Kessler argues that his trial counsel should have objected to this extraneous evidence as irrelevant and prejudicial, and that he should have requested limiting instructions with respect to its use at trial. Kessler fails to acknowledge that, under Tex.Code.Ceim. Peoc. art. 38.37 \u00a7 2, such extraneous evidence is more often admissible in cases involving sexual assaults of children, notwithstanding Texas\u2019s normal rules of evidence. <em>See, e.g., O\u2019Canas v. State, </em>140 S.W.3d 695, 698 (Tex.App.2003) (permitting evidence of exposure of child victim to \u201ccorrupt lifestyle\u201d); <em>McCoy v. State, </em>10 S.W.3d 50, 54 (Tex.App.1999) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>(art. 38.37 effectively supersedes prior precedent holding that \u201cbackground\u201d evidence is not admissible). Although it is possible that certain evidence introduced at Kessler\u2019s trial was inadmissible even under the expanded standard of art. 38.37, Kessler has not demonstrated that counsel performed deficiently by making a strategic decision to refrain from making repetitive objections to such evidence, <em>see United States v. Haese, </em>162 F.3d 359, 364 (5th Cir.1998) (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 case) (citing <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 689, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984)), or by declining to call additional attention to such evidence by seeking limiting instructions. <em>See, e.g., Ali v. State, </em>26 S.W.3d 82, 87 (Tex.App.2000). Kessler also has not established that he was prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failures, because he has not shown that such objections or limiting instructions would have resulted in a different outcome at trial. <em>See Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 692, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Kessler has not shown that the state courts unreasonably applied federal law in rejecting these ineffective-assistance claims. <em>See 28 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Although the magistrate judge granted Kessler a COA on the substantive issue \u201cwhether Kessler was denied due process or a fair trial through the introduction of extraneous offenses at trial,\u201d a review of the record reflects that Kessler did not raise such a substantive claim in the district court, either in his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 petition or his lengthy reply brief. Notwithstanding the COA, such claim is not properly before this court on appeal. <em>See Roberts v. Cockrell, </em>319 F.3d 690, 695 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">The judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b735-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
