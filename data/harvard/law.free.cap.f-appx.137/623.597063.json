On appeal, Sylvest contends that the district court committed error in the wording of both the jury instructions and the jury verdict form. For the reasons that follow,\" we dismiss Sylvest\u2019s appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-10\">Sylvest brought this action against the Defendants, alleging that they had violated her rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cADA\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12101, <em>et seq., </em>and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 621, <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment and dismissed Sylvest\u2019s claims under the ADEA, a judgment Sylvest does not appeal. The district court, however, denied Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment with respect to Sylvest\u2019s ADA claims and allowed those claims to proceed to trial. At trial, the jury rendered a unanimous verdict rejecting Sylvest\u2019s claims under the ADA, and the district court subsequently entered judgment for Defendants. Thereafter, Sylvest filed a notice of appeal, but failed to include the trial transcript in the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-15\">Sylvest\u2019s failure to include the trial transcript in the record on appeal precludes us from reviewing her appeal on the merits. Under the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, an appellant who \u201cintends to urge on appeal that a finding or conclusion is unsupported by the evidence or is contrary to the evidence ... must include in the record a transcript of all evidence relevant to that finding or conclusion.\u201d Fed. R.App. P. 10(b)(2). Failure to include a transcript in the record is grounds for dismissal; however, the decision whether to dismiss an appeal due to lack of a transcript is within our discretion. <em>See, e.g., RecoverEdge L.P. v. Pentecost, </em>44 F.3d 1284, 1289 (5th Cir.1995); <em>Coats v. Pierre, </em>890 F.2d 728, 731 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b648-16\">In the instant case, a transcript is required because Sylvest challenges the jury instructions, which were delivered orally by the district court and recorded only by the court reporter. A transcript also is required to determine whether Sylvest\u2019s objections to the jury verdict form were properly lodged in the district court. Ab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>sent a transcript, there is no record of how the jury instructions were actually worded or whether Sylvest objected at trial to the jury verdict form, thereby rendering appellate review of the issues raised by Sylvest impossible. Accordingly, we dismiss Sylvest\u2019s appeal and affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b648-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
