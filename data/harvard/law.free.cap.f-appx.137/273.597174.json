Robinson appeals his fifty-seven-month sentence, which was imposed as a result of convictions for the following offenses: production of false identification documents, in violation of 18 U.S .C. \u00a7 1028(a)(1) (counts 1 &amp; 8); production, transfer, or possession of a document-making implement, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(5) (count 2); aiding and abetting transfers of false identification documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(2) (counts 3, 5, 7, &amp; 9); and attempt and conspiracy to transfer false identification documents, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028(a)(2) and (f) (counts 4 &amp; 6). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>government cross-appeals Robinson\u2019s sentence, requesting a remand with instructions that the district court make its preliminary order of forfeiture part of its judgment against Robinson.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">Robinson argues that the district court erred because the loss of over $182,000 it attributed to him was based solely on co-conspirator Derrick Grayson\u2019s fraudulent check-cashing scheme. Robinson contends that his conspiratorial agreement with Grayson was limited to providing false identification. Therefore, Robinson argues, Grayson\u2019s bank-fraud scheme was outside the scope of criminal conduct in which he agreed to participate and he should not have been held responsible for the losses resulting from Gray-son\u2019s bank fraud.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">We review the district court\u2019s loss calculation for clear error, but we review its application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo . United States v. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d 725, 728 (11th Cir.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">A defendant\u2019s offense level is properly increased according to the amount of loss caused, which is the \u201cpecuniary harm that the defendant knew or, under the circumstances, reasonably should have known, was a potential result of the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1(b)(1) <em>&amp; </em>cmt. nn. 3(a)\u00a9 <em>&amp; </em>(iv). In determining the amount of loss attributable to a defendant, the sentencing court must consider, \u201cin the case of a jointly undertaken criminal activity ..., all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in furtherance of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, that occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction.... \u201d M \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">Accordingly, \u201c[w]hen determining the loss amount attributable to a particular defendant convicted of a conspiracy offense,\u201d the district court must engage in a two-prong analysis. <em>McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d at 731. It \u201cmust first determine the scope of criminal activity the defendant agreed to jointly undertake and then consider all reasonably foreseeable acts and omissions of others in the jointly undertaken criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). \u201cOnly after the district court makes individualized findings concerning the scope of criminal activity that the defendant undertook is the court to determine reasonable foreseeability.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d 1314, 1319 (11th Cir.2003). In determining the scope of the defendant\u2019s agreement, the district court \u201cmay consider any explicit agreement or implicit agreement fairly inferred from the conduct of the defendant and others.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, cmt. n. 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">Here, as in <em>Hunter, </em>\u201cthe district court made findings regarding reasonable foreseeability, [but] it did not first determine the scope of the criminal activity [Robinson] agreed to jointly undertake.\u201d <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1320. That it was reasonably foreseeable to Robinson the false identifications he made might be used to commit fraud does not mean that he agreed to \u201cjointly undertake! ]\u201d that fraud. \u201c[T]he Guidelines establish that the fact that the defendant knows about the larger operation, and has agreed to perform a particular act, does not amount to acquiescence in the acts of the criminal enterprise as a whole.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-12\">Here, there is no evidence at all in the record to suggest that Grayson\u2019s bank-fraud scheme was within the scope of Robinson\u2019s criminal agreement. First, there is no evidence of an explicit agreement. Second, there is no evidence from which such an agreement can be inferred. The record shows only that Robinson provided false identifications to Grayson, for which he was paid between $125 and $200, and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>he later provided Grayson with information and items for producing fake identifications. While this evidence shows that Robinson was involved with the production and transfer of false identifications (to which he pleaded guilty), it does not show that he was involved in the bank fraud. There is no evidence that Robinson himself engaged in fraudulent check-cashing or was present when any fraudulent checks were cashed. <em>Cf. Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1320 (defendant who personally cashed nine fraudulent checks would be accountable for the loss from those checks, but not necessarily for the entire scope of the check-cashing conspiracy). Nor is there any evidence that Robinson recruited others into the fraudulent check-cashing scheme. <em>Cf. McCrimmon, </em>362 F.3d at 732 (defendant who \u201cwas actively involved in recruiting investors to further the [] scheme\u201d was liable for the entire amount of loss from the scheme). Additionally, there is no evidence that Robinson received any of the proceeds from Grayson\u2019s check-cashing scheme. The presentence report says only that Robinson received a small fee from Grayson for each false identification he provided, which suggests that Robinson agreed to perform only a particular act within the scheme, not to participate in the entire scheme. <em>Hunter, </em>323 F.3d at 1320.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">The government correctly notes that \u201ca sentencing court\u2019s failure to make individualized findings regarding the scope of the defendant\u2019s activity is not grounds for vacating a sentence if the record support[s] the court\u2019s determination with respect to the offense conduct, including the imputation of others\u2019 unlawful acts to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Petrie, </em>302 F.3d 1280, 1290 (11th Cir.2002). In this case, however, the record does not support the district court\u2019s determination of the offense conduct. As we have said, there is simply no evidence to justify the imputation of Grayson\u2019s bank-fraud scheme, and the resulting loss, to Robinson. Therefore, Robinson is entitled to resentencing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b300-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-10\">The government cross-appeals from Robinson\u2019s sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(b)(1), which permits the government to appeal sentences that are imposed in violation of the law. The government argues that the district court\u2019s failure to make its preliminary order of forfeiture part of its judgment against Robinson renders Robinson\u2019s sentence unlawful because it violated Fed.R.Crim.P. 32 \u20222(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-11\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3) provides in pertinent part: \u201cAt sentencing \u2014 or at any time before sentencing if the defendant consents \u2014 the order of forfeiture becomes final as to the defendant and must be made a part of the sentence and be included in the judgment.\u201d The issuance of a preliminary order of forfeiture does not relieve a district court of its obligation to include an order of forfeiture in its judgment. <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 813 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b300-12\">Here, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(2), the district court entered a preliminary order of forfeiture against Robinson, to which Robinson consented. The district court did not, however, include an order of forfeiture in its final judgment against Robinson.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Fed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>R.Crim.P. 32.2(b)(3) required the district court to include the forfeiture order in its final judgment, the court\u2019s failure to do so requires correction. <em>See United States v. Gilbert, </em>244 F.3d 888, 915 n. 66 (11th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure have the force and effect of law. Just as a statute the requirements promulgated in these Rules must be obeyed.\u201d (quotation omitted)). Therefore, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(f)(1), we remand and instruct the district court to amend the judgment to include an order of forfeiture.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Robinson\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for resentencing in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b300-5\">. Because Robinson will be resentenced under <em>post-United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), rules, his <em>Booker </em>claim as to his original sentence is moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b300-13\">. We recognize that the preliminary order of forfeiture entered by the district court stated that it was \u201chereby final as to [Robinson], part of the sentence, and included in the Judgment.\u201d We conclude, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>such self-executing language was insufficient to make the forfeiture order part of the final judgment, particularly in light of the affirmative action contemplated by Rule 32.2 (the order of forfeiture must be \"made\u201d part of the sentence and actually \"included\u201d in the judgment).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b301-9\">. At first blush, it may seem that the government should have asked the district court to amend its judgment to include the forfeiture order under Fed.R.Crim.P. 36. Our <em>Pease </em>decision indicates, however, that Rule 36 amendment is not the proper procedure in these circumstances. In <em>Pease, </em>as here, the district court had entered a preliminary order of forfeiture against the defendant but failed to include that order in its final judgment. <em>Pease, </em>331 F.3d at 811. The government moved the district court under Rule 36, asking it to amend the judgment to include the forfeiture order. <em>Id. </em>at 812. The district court did so. <em>Id. </em>On appeal, however, we held that was improper, explaining that \"Rule 36 can be used to correct 'clerical' errors; it cannot be used, as it was here, to make a substantive alteration to a criminal sentence.\" <em>Id. </em>at 816. Instead, we suggested, the government \"[sh]ould have cross-appealed the defendant's sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(b) \u2014 specifically, the district court\u2019s failure to include an order of forfeiture in its final judgment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 811. That is what the government has done in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
