On appeal, Rocket argues that the district court committed reversible error under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by sentencing him under a mandatory Guidelines system.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-10\">Because Rocket preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim by raising it at sentencing, we review the challenge to his sentence <em>de novo, </em>but will vacate and remand only for harmful error. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). \u201cA non-constitutional error is harmless if, viewing the proceedings in their entirety, a court determines that the error did not affect the sentence, or had but very slight effect. If one can say with fair assurance ... that the sentence was not substantially swayed by the error, the sentence is due to be affirmed even though there was error.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289 (11th Cir.2005) (quotations, brackets, and citations omitted). Under harmless error review, the government bears the burden of showing that the error was harmless. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-11\">We have explained that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error \u2014 (1) the error of imposing a sentencing enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury, or \u201cconstitutional error,\u201d and (2) the non-constitutional error of being sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system, or \u201cstatutory error.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005). Because Rocket alleges only statutory error, we confine our discussion to that argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">Due to the nature of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>remedy, we have concluded that a district court errs whenever it sentences a defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330-31. Furthermore, the government has failed to meet its burden of proving that the error of sentencing Rocket under a mandatory guidelines scheme did not affect his substantial rights. Therefore, the district court\u2019s error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">Upon review of the record and the parties\u2019 briefs, we vacate and remand for re-sentencing consistent with <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
