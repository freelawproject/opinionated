On appeal following a bench trial, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>See A.I.G. Uruguay Compania de Seguros, </em>S.A. <em>v. AAA Cooper Transp., </em>334 F.3d 997, 1003 (11th Cir.2003) (citing <em>MiTek Holdings, Inc. v. Arce Eng\u2019g Co., </em>89 F.3d 1548, 1554 (11th Cir.1996)). Upon thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>As a general rule, the FLSA provides that employees are entitled to receive overtime pay at one and one-half times their regular rate for all hours worked in excess of forty per week. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 207(a)(1). The FLSA exempts from its overtime pay requirements \u201cany employee employed in a bona fide executive, administrative, or professional capacity\u201d who receives payment on a salary basis. <em>See </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 213(a)(1); <em>see also Avery v. City of Talladega, </em>24 F.3d 1337, 1340 (11th Cir.1994). The employer has the burden of showing entitlement to an exemption. <em>Jeffery v. Sarasota White Sox, Inc., </em>64 F.3d 590, 594 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The Code of Federal Regulations defines professional employees as those (1) who receive compensation \u201cof not less than $250 per week,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(e); (2) whose principal duties involve specialized scientific or other knowledge and training, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(a)(1); and (3) whose work requires \u201cthe consistent exercise of discretion and judgment,\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(e).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> An employee is paid \u201con a salary basis,\u201d for purposes of the FLSA if he or she \u201cregularly receives each pay period on a weekly, or less frequent basis, a predetermined amount constituting all or part of his compensation, which amount is not subject to reduction because of variations in the quality or quantity of the work performed.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.602(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-6\">Bearing these definitions in mind, we agree that Provident met its burden to show that Stevins was covered by the exemption for professionals. For the reasons stated by the district court in its decision, Stevins worked in a bona fide professional capacity for Provident. That his position did not require a specific and mandatory educational prerequisite, as opposed to advanced, specialized knowledge based on work experience, does not alter Stevins\u2019s status as a professional employee within the meaning of the FLSA. Stevins has been in the construction industry for some 40 years. He holds a Bachelor of Science degree in civil engineering and construction and has a Florida Certified General Contractor Class \u201cA\u201d Builder\u2019s License, for which he attended 20 hours of independent study and is required to attend 14 hours of continuing education every two years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> His specialized degree and state license directly relate to his primary duties as a construction superintendent. The FLSA regulations do not require that an exempt professional hold a bachelor\u2019s degree; rather, the regulations require that the duties of a professional entail advanced, specialized knowledge. We conclude that a construction superintendent must have advanced, specialized knowledge in order to perform his duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-10\">Moreover, as the district court found, a construction superintendent is not analogous to a \u201cconstruction worker\u201d or \u201claborer,\u201d as those terms are defined under the applicable FLSA regulations, 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(a). The record contains no evidence that physical labor was a primary part of Stevins\u2019s position. As the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>court put it, <em>no </em>construction superintendent spent more than \u201ca minor period of time performing physical labor.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">Finally, we are not persuaded by Stevins\u2019s argument concerning the district court\u2019s finding that he consistently exercised discretion and judgment in performing his job at Provident. The district court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that construction superintendents (1) were able to deviate from design plans without seeking approval from the project manager; (2) could order materials without needing approval from the project manager; (3) determined the answers to subcontractors\u2019 questions that arose during construction, including issues not addressed in the design blueprints. In addition, construction superintendents had the power to approve invoices and modify schedules and blueprints. The conclusion that Stevins\u2019s position involved the regular exercise of discretion and judgment is bolstered by the fact that it was he who was on the work-site on a daily basis (the project manager was present for only 10 to 20% of the total project time). Simply put, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s conclusion concerning Stevins\u2019s \u201cconsistent exercise of discretion and judgment,\u201d within the meaning of 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">On this record, we can discern no clear error in the district court\u2019s factual findings, nor do we find error in its application of the law to the facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b223-7\">. This is the \"short test\u201d for determining whether the exemption for overtime pay applies because an employee is a professional. The short test applies to employees who are paid \u201con a salary or fee basis at a rate of not less than $250 per week.\u201d 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.2(e)(2). Here, the parties do not dispute that the short test applies in this case given that Stevins earned an annual salary of $70,200 during his employment at Provident.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b223-11\">. These facts distinguish this case from <em>Dybach v. Florida Dept. of Corr., </em>942 F.2d 1562, 1565 (11th Cir.1991). Unlike in <em>Aybach, </em>in which the plaintiffs were not required to take any specific courses <em>to </em>qualify for their jobs, here Stevins took specialized courses and, in connection with his Builder's License, must attend regular continuing education every two years.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
