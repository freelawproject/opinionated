Stat. Ann. \u00a7 760.01 <em>et seq., </em>and (3) retaliation, under \u00a7 1981, Title VII, and the FCRA. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Scheppke and Emtel on Burstein\u2019s discrimination claims. But we vacate the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Emtel on Burstein\u2019s retaliation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b230-18\">Burstein, an emergency room physician who is Jewish, began working at the emergency department at JFK Hospital in Atlantis, Florida, in January 1999, under a contract with PhyAmerica, which contracted to supply services to JFK. PhyAmerica lost its contract with JFK in 2001; and Emtel, a physician management group, sent Burstein a letter proposing to engage him as an emergency room doctor at JFK. Because of a noncompete clause in Bur-stein\u2019s PhyAmerica contract, he instead entered into a one-year independent contractor agreement directly with JFK on 29 November 2001.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Burstein also worked shifts in the emergency department at another hospital, Martin Memorial.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-19\">On 4 November 2002, Burstein submitted an e-mail requesting shifts at JFK for December 2002. At this point, Burstein already knew his scheduled shifts at Martin Memorial. To meet his obligations at both hospitals, Burstein on 8 November sent an e-mail to Scheppke<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> requesting a shift change where Burstein would work Scheppke\u2019s 1 and 2 December shifts, and Scheppke would work Burstein\u2019s 22 and 23 December shifts. According to Burstein, on 11 November, Scheppke responded in a \u201chostile and prejudiced fashion\u201d by degrading Burstein\u2019s religion, questioning how he spent the holidays, and calling him \u201ca Jew.\u201d Burstein then cursed Scheppke and immediately reported the incident to Dr. Caswell Rumball, the emergency department director.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>On 15 November, Burstein received an email from Rumball with an attached draft copy of the Emtel employment agreement. Also on 15 November, Burstein sent a letter to Dr. Joseph Degioanni, Emtel\u2019s chief executive officer, complaining of (1) Scheppke\u2019s acts in questioning Burstein\u2019s religion, and (2) Rumball\u2019s failure to resolve the situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">On 25 November, Rumball met with Degioanni to discuss Rumball\u2019s concerns with Burstein\u2019s attitude and performance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Rumball prepared a document listing a number of concerns. Under the heading \u201cAnger and hostility\u201d, Rumball briefly remarked on the Burstein-Scheppke argument and stated, \u201c[Burstein] subsequently raised accusations of religious bias, accusations that were refuted in subsequent discussions with Sandra Whitfield [director of the JFK emergency room] and myself. ...\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">On 27 November, Emtel\u2019s counsel sent Burstein a letter informing him that he would not be offered a contract with Emtel when his JFK contract expired at the end of that month. Other doctors whose contracts Emtel was not going to pick up received 90 days\u2019 notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">We review the district court\u2019s rulings on a motion for summary judgment <em>de novo; </em>we view all evidence and factual inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>Miller v. King, </em>384 F.3d 1248, 1258-59 (11th Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Burstein argues that Scheppke may be held liable under \u00a7 1981 because Scheppke allegedly influenced Rumball\u2019s decision not to recommend Burstein for employment: Scheppke thus was an integral part of the decisionmaking process ending in Emtel\u2019s decision not to offer Burstein a contract.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We disagree: we see no reason to hold Scheppke liable under a discrimination or retaliation theory. The record does not suggest that Scheppke participated in the decision of Emtel not to offer Burstein a contract. <em>See Quinn v. Monroe County, </em>330 F.3d 1320, 1326-28 (11th Cir.2003) (writing, in First Amendment retaliation case, that an individual may be liable under the civil rights laws for decisions he personally is involved in making). Scheppke participated in the 11 November argument with Burstein, threatened to \u201cwrite up\u201d Burstein, and (like Burstein) discussed the matter with Rumball. But nothing shows that Scheppke actually did \u201cwrite up\u201d Burstein; and Rumball and Degioanni stated clearly that Scheppke did not participate in their decision not to offer a contract to Burstein. Nothing in the record suggests that these statements are unbelievable.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-10\">Burstein next submits that he established that Emtel\u2019s explanations for withdrawing his contract were a pretext for discrimination and retaliation.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">In cases involving circumstantial evidence of discrimination or retaliation under Title VII and \u00a7 1981, courts use the analytical framework set forth in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-25, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), which requires the plaintiff first to demonstrate a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination or retaliation. <em>See Cooper v. Southern Co., </em>390 F.3d 695, 724-25 (11th Cir.2003) (Title VII and \u00a7 1981 discrimination claims); <em>Goldsmith v. City of Atmore, </em>996 F.2d 1155, 1162-63 (11th Cir.1993) (Title VII retaliation claim).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The defendant then may rebut the <em>prima facie </em>case by offering a legitimate, nondiscriminatory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>reason for the employment act. If the defendant rebuts the plaintiff\u2019s <em>prima, facie </em>case, the plaintiff must come forward with evidence sufficient to show that the employer\u2019s proffered reasons are pretextual. <em>Cooper, </em>390 F.3d at 725; <em>Goldsmith, </em>996 F.2d at 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">No one seriously disputes that Bur-stein presented a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination and retaliation.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And Em-tel presented many legitimate reasons why it decided not to offer Burstein a contract, including (1) Rumball\u2019s belief that Burstein intentionally refused to see a patient; (2) Burstein\u2019s perceived unreasonable scheduling requests and lack of loyalty to JFK; (3) Burstein\u2019s insubordination to Scheppke and his disruption of the emergency department during the 11 November argument; and (4) Burstein\u2019s perceived attempt to undermine the centralization of the department. Emtel\u2019s subsequent offering of a contract to Bur-stein \u2014 on 15 November, when Emtel knew of all these matters \u2014 might appear suspicious. This fact, however, does not show that Emtel\u2019s reasons were a pretext for religious <em>discrimination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">But we agree with Burstein\u2019s argument that he has created a genuine issue of material fact on whether Emtel\u2019s reasons for withdrawing his contract were a pretext for <em>retaliation. </em>He points to (1) Em-tel offering him a contract before he complained of religious discrimination, but withdrawing its offer after he complained, and (2) Rumball specifically identifying Burstein\u2019s discrimination complaint under one of Rumball\u2019s points of concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">We again note that Emtel offered reasonable explanations for why it would not wish to employ Burstein. The problem is with the timing of the events. On 14 November, Emtel was aware of the facts underlying its explanation for refusing to offer a contract. But on 15 November, Emtel offered a contract to Burstein. That day, Burstein complained of discrimination.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Then, on 25 November, Rumball and Degioanni met to discuss Rumball\u2019s concerns about Burstein. These concerns included a written reference to the fact that Burstein had filed a complaint of religious discrimination against Scheppke. In other words, in full awareness of its concerns with Burstein, Emtel offered him a contract. But with the addition of one fact \u2014 Burstein filing a discrimination complaint \u2014 the record supports an inference that Emtel then decided not to hire him. In sum, Burstein has shown a basis for a mixed-motive retaliation claim: a reasonable jury might believe that Emtel relied on both legitimate and illegitimate grounds in deciding not to hire him.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-10\">. Emtel and Burstein executed a \"Florida Physician's Engagement Letter\u201d in October 2001 contemplating Emtel's employment of Burstein to work at JFK.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b230-14\">. Burstein and Scheppke applied in February 2002 for the position of assistant director of the JFK emergency department. Scheppke was selected.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b230-21\">. Burstein recalled the argument,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-22\">It started off by my asking him on our return from breakfast if he had read my email. He said he did and quite frankly he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>answered that I needed to set my priorities straight, that I should first fulfill my obligation to JFK Medical Center.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\">And then abruptly he said, \"What religion are you?\u201d And I said, \"Ken, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an appropriate question.\u201d He said, \"No, I think it\u2019s very appropriate; what religion are you?\u201d I said, \"Ken, I don't think it\u2019s your business or this department\u2019s business what religion I am.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-8\">He went on and on and on walking down the hall asking what religion I was, very hostile. I said, \"Ken, I\u2019m not answering that.\u201d We walked into the nursing lounge and we sat at the table. And he asked me again, \"What religion are you?\u201d He was adamant. I said, \"I don\u2019t think it's relevant.\u201d He said, \"I think it's very relevant.\u201d He said, \"What do you do on Christmas?\u201d I said, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s your business.\u201d He said, \"What does your family do on Christmas?\u201d I said, \"Christmas is a time that I like to spend with my family. It\u2019s very few times that my kids are off school and I like to spend time with them.\u201d He said, \"That\u2019s what summer vacation is for.\u201d I said, \"Ken, Christmas vacation has become secularized, it\u2019s called winter recess, and to postpone seeing your family until summer is kind of ridiculous. I think physician parents should be given consideration in scheduling for the Christmas break off.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-9\">He then said that I\u2019m not a team player, and he says he works the Jewish holidays so I can be off and he would expect that I would work Christmas so he can have off. And he suggested I should look for another job.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-15\">And finally, he looked me right in the eyes and it made me sick, and he said, \"You are a Jew.\u201d And I stood up, and I threw my food in the garbage can and I said, \"\u2014 you. My wife and kids celebrate Christmas. They grew up Catholic. Every year we have a nine-foot Christmas tree, and it\u2019s none of your \u2014- damn business.\u201d And he looked at me and he stood up right in my face and said, \"I\u2019m writing you up.\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b231-16\">. Rumball stated that he was concerned with (1) Burstein\u2019s proposed December schedule, which Rumball thought requested an unreasonable number of days off in the light of a physician staffing shortage; (2) Burstein committing an insubordinate act: e-mailing department staff, after the emergency room department centralized its staffing in September 2002, and stating that the department would return to its prior division; (3) what Rumball considered to be Burstein\u2019s intentional failure to examine a boy later diagnosed with appendicitis; and (4) Burstein\u2019s perceived scheduling inflexibility, which was what Rumball\u2014 after speaking to Scheppke and Sandra Whitfield (director of the JFK emergency room)\u2014 deemed was the cause of the argument between Scheppke and Burstein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b232-6\">. Appellees argue that Burstein\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claims fail because purely religion-based discrimination and retaliation claims are not cognizable under \u00a7 1981. The district court refused to grant summary judgment on this issue, noting that (1) \u00a7 1981 protects against discrimination based on ancestry and ethnicity, and (2) Jewish religion and ethnicity often are tied closely. But Appellees did not file a cross-appeal: we do not consider this issue. See <em>Wexler v. Lepore, </em>385 F.3d 1336, 1338 n. 3 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b232-7\">. We reject Burstein\u2019s argument that Scheppke\u2019s statements during their argument \u2014 either by themselves or as referred to in Rumball\u2019s memorandum \u2014 constitute \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination or retaliatory attitude. Scheppke did not participate in Emtel's decision not to offer a contract to Burstein. And Rumball\u2019s memorandum does not show \u2014 without inference \u2014 that Burstein\u2019s religion or his complaint of religious discrimination was the cause of Emtel's refusal to offer a contract to Burstein. <em>See Wilson v. B/E Aerospace, Inc., </em>376 F.3d 1079, 1086 (11th Cir.2004) (statement that suggests, but does not prove, discriminatory motive is not direct evidence).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b232-13\">. Florida courts apply federal case law interpreting Title VII to FCRA claims. <em>Fla. State Univ. </em>v. <em>Sondel, </em>685 So.2d 923, 925 n. 1 (Fla. 1st Dist.1996). We analyze Burstein's FCRA claims concurrently with his Title VII and \u00a7 1981 claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\">. Burstein contends that the district court erred in failing to modify the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>analysis with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Desert Palace, Inc. v. Costa, </em>539 U.S. 90, 123 S.Ct. 2148, 156 L.Ed.2d 84 (2003). But we recently reasserted the applicability of <em>McDonnell Douglas. See Cooper, </em>390 F.3d at 725 n. 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"Ac\">. It is unclear which event happened first on 15 November.
