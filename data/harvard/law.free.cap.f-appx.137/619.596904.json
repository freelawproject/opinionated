(Damian\u2019s motion for appointment of counsel is DENIED.)</p>\n<p id=\"b644-13\">The district court examined Damian\u2019s complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. We review such a dismissal <em>de novo. Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998). Damian contends: he was arrested illegally on 17 February 1986; his conviction was the product of \u201cunsavory objectionable fact finding\u201d; and this action has \u201cpotential for success and [a] substantial amount of [mjonetary [djamages.... \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b644-15\">To the extent Damian seeks money damages based on an alleged illegal conviction, his claim is barred under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Damian has not shown that his conviction or sentence has been reversed, expunged, declared invalid, or called into question by a federal court\u2019s issuance of a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b644-16\">To the extent Damien has claims concerning future conduct, Damian challenges the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for lack of standing. Damian contends he has demonstrated that his case presents a live case or controversy. He asserts that he has shown he suffered an injury that is traceable to the defendant and that the requested relief would likely redress the injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">\u201cArticle III of the Constitution confines the federal courts to deciding actual cases and controversies.\u201d <em>Society of Separationists, Inc. v. Herman, </em>959 F.2d 1283, 1285 (5th Cir.1992) (citation omitted). To sufficiently allege a case or controversy, the \u201cplaintiff must show that he \u2018has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury\u2019 as the result of the challenged official conduct and the injury or threat of injury must be both \u2018real and immediate,\u2019 not \u2018conjectural\u2019 or \u2018hypothetical\u2019 \u201d. <em>City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, </em>461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-18\">Damian has not established a case or controversy because his contention that he will face future misconduct is entirely speculative. <em>See Herman, </em>959 F.2d at 1285. Damian has not alleged any facts that would render the likelihood of future <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>injury any more than a remote and speculative possibility. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b645-5\">\n<em>AFFIRMED; MOTION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b644-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
