He was sentenced to forty-six months of imprisonment. At the sentencing hearing, Marrs objected to the district court\u2019s consideration of certain relevant conduct in determining his sentence, arguing that the holding in <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), applied to the federal sentencing guidelines. The district court overruled his objection, relying on <em>United States v. Hammoud, </em>378 F.3d 426 (4th Cir.) (order), <em>opinion issued by </em>381 F.3d 316 (4th Cir.2004) (en banc), <em>vacated, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1051, 160 L.Ed.2d 997 (2005). Marrs noted an appeal. The parties have now filed a joint motion to remand the case for resentencing, citing <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>401 F.3d 540 (4th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-13\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that the mandatory manner in which the federal sentencing guidelines required courts to impose sentence enhancements based on facts found by the court by a preponderance of the evidence violated the Sixth Amendment. 125 S.Ct. at 746, 750 (Stevens, J., opinion of the Court). After <em>Booker, </em>courts must calculate the appropriate guideline range, consider the range in conjunction with other relevant factors under the guidelines and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005), and impose a sentence. If a court imposes a sentence outside the guideline range, the court must state its reasons for doing so. <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 546. This remedial scheme applies to any sentence imposed under the mandatory guidelines, regardless of whether the sentence violates the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 547 (citing <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 769 (Breyer, J., opinion of the Court)).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">We conclude that Marrs preserved the issue of whether his sentence was imposed in violation of the Sixth Amendment. We further hold that the sentence did constitute such a violation, and therefore, grant the parties\u2019 joint motion to remand, vacate the sentence, and remand for resentencing consistent with <em>Booker. </em><footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Following resentencing, the appeal shall be returned to this court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-19\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b592-14\"> Just as we noted in <em>Hughes, </em>401 F.3d at 545 n. 4, \"[w]e of course offer no criticism of the district judge, who followed the law and procedure in effect at the time\u201d of Marrs's sentencing.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
