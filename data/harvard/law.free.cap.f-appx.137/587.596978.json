Perry appeals the district court\u2019s order dismissing his 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (2000) action for failure to pay the partial filing fee. See <em>Perry v. Gowan, </em>No. CA-04-874-3 (E.D.Va. Jan. 31, 2005). We dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction because Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was not timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-18\">Parties are accorded thirty days after entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Director, Dep\u2019t of Corrections, </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-20\">The district court\u2019s order was entered on the docket on January 31, 2005. Appellant\u2019s notice of appeal was filed on March 21, 2005. Because Appellant failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we dismiss the appeal. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-21\">\n<em>DISMISSED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
