On appeal, Bonilla argues that the district court erred at sentencing, under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), by applying an enhancement for his role as a pilot of a vessel that was carrying cocaine because that fact was not charged in the indictment, found by a jury, or admitted by him. According to Bonilla, the <em>Booker </em>error was <em>not </em>harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the district court indicated that it thought Bonilla\u2019s sentence was greater than necessary and that, if not for the mandated Guidelines range, it was inclined to impose a 96-month, rather than 108-month, sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-19\">Bonilla raised this argument in the district court and therefore is entitled to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948-49 (11th Cir.2005). We will reverse a <em>Booker </em>error only if the error was harmful, meaning that the error affected substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>The government bears the burden of establishing that an error did not affect a defendant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b265-20\">In <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 2536, 2543, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the Supreme Court reversed an upward departure imposed pursuant to the State of Washington\u2019s sentencing guidelines, applying the rule in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), that \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d In reversing the upward departure, the Supreme Court held that the relevant \u201c \u2018statutory maximum\u2019 for <em>Apprendi </em>purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant. </em>\u201d <em>Id. </em>124 S.Ct. at 2537 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>While the instant case was pending on appeal, the Supreme Court issued its decision in <em>Booker, </em>finding \u201cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue\u201d in <em>Blakely. Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 749. Resolving the constitutional question left open in <em>Blakely, </em>the Court held that the mandatory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 749-51. In extending its holding in <em>Blakely </em>to the Sentencing Guidelines, the Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale in <em>Apprendi </em>that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 2935, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (2005), we stated that, under the holding in <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthe Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where <em>under a mandatory guidelines system </em>a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d (emphasis in original). In <em>Paz, </em>we concluded that, because the district court had indicated that it would have imposed a lesser sentence, had the guidelines not been mandatory, the government could not show that it was harmless error for the district court to apply an extra-verdict enhancement. <em>Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">Because Bonilla\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory guidelines system, based on facts not found by a jury and not admitted to by him during the plea colloquy, and the government has not met its burden to show harmlessness, and indeed appears to concede the error was not harmless (at the sentencing hearing, the district court stated it would impose a lower sentence if it was not bound by the Guidelines), we vacate and remand Bonilla\u2019s sentence for resentencing, pursuant to the discretionary Sentencing Guidelines scheme now required by <em>Booker.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b266-7\">. We note that in this case, the district court correctly determined the Guidelines range for Bonilla\u2019s conviction. We have considered Bonilla\u2019s challenge to the two-level enhancement for his role in the offense, and note that the district court did not err factually by applying the enhancement based on its conclusion that he was captain of the vessel that was transporting the cocaine. On remand, pursuant to <em>Booker, </em>the district court is required to sentence Bonilla under an advisory Guidelines scheme, and, in so doing, must consider the Guidelines range and \"other statutory concerns as well, <em>see </em>[18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp.2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
