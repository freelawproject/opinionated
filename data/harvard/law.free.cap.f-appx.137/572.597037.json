We deny her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-21\">We note it is undisputed that Ayoade\u2019s motion to reopen was untimely by over five years. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) (2004) (requiring a motion to reopen to be filed within ninety days of the final administrative decision). In 1993, she filed a notice of appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s decision,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> but neither she nor her former attorney filed any further documents relating to her appeal. In 1998, after giving Ayoade the opportunity to file new briefs in light of amendments to the immigration statutes, the Board dismissed her appeal as \u201cmoot\u201d and \u201cabandoned.\u201d She did not file her motion to reopen until 2004, over five years after her appeal was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-22\">However, the time period for filing a motion to reopen may be subject to equitable tolling. <em>See Socop-Gonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1190-93 (9th Cir.2001). Ayoade argues that her motion is subject to equitable tolling because she received <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel during the appeal of the immigration judge\u2019s decision to the Board. She argues her counsel misled her into believing he was representing her in the appeal and never informed her that the appeal was dismissed. We note that over ten years passed between the filing of her notice of appeal and the time at which Ayoade indicates she first became aware that her appeal had been dismissed. We find that equitable tolling is not warranted in these circumstances. For this reason, we decline to find the Board abused its discretion in dismissing her motion to reopen as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">Accordingly, we deny Ayoade\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-14\"> The record reflects Ayoade filed her notice of appeal pro se and by hand, and the attorney representing her before the immigration judge never filed a notice of appearance with the Board.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
