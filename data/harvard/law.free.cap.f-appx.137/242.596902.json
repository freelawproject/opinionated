R.App. P. 35. The petition for panel rehearing is GRANTED. Upon rehearing, we vacate our original opinion, <em>United States v. John Freddy Rincon-Castrillon, </em>2005 WL 723880 (11th Cir.2005) and substitute the following.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-21\">Rincon-Castrillon argues that the district court violated his constitutional rights in considering Rineon-Castrillon\u2019s prior convictions when determining his sentence. Rincon-Castrillon also argues that we should remand to the district court for re-sentencing because the sentencing guidelines are advisory under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-24\">We have explained that there are two types of <em>Booker </em>error: (1) a Sixth Amendment error \u2014 that is, imposing a sentencing enhancement based on judicial findings that go beyond the facts admitted by the defendant or found by the jury; and (2) statutory error \u2014 being sentenced under a sentencing guidelines scheme that is mandatory. <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330\u201431 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b267-25\">A. <em>Sixth Amendment Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b267-26\">Since Rincon-Castrillon raised his <em>Blakely v. Washington, 542 </em>U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), (now <em>Booker) </em>argument before the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>court, we review his <em>Booker </em>claims for harmless error. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005). Constitutional error must be disregarded if the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Candelario, </em>240 F.3d 1300, 1307 (11th Cir.2001). In the instant case, we find no constitutional <em>Booker </em>error, so we need not reach whether the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court \u201cleft undisturbed its holding in <em>[Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 227, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 1233, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998)], that recidivism is <em>not </em>a separate element of an offense that the government is required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962 (11th Cir.2005). Moreover, the Court reaffirmed <em>Apprendi\u2019s </em>holding that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction), which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, in <em>Orduno-Mireles </em>we observed that \u201cthe Court\u2019s holding in <em>Booker </em>... is not implicated when a defendant\u2019s sentence is enhanced based on a prior conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-5\">To the extent that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Shepard </em>arguably undermined <em>Almendarez-Torres, </em>that decision does not undermine our outcome here. <em>See Shepard v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005). At his change of plea hearing, Rincon-Castrillon admitted the underlying fact of his prior conviction for trafficking cocaine and that he was sentenced to 15 years imprisonment for that conviction. Accordingly, the sentencing court did not resolve disputed facts, but based its sentence on admitted facts. <em>See Shepard, </em>125 S.Ct. at 1263; <em>see also United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330. Therefore, in this case, we are not presented with an opportunity to determine the implications and reach of <em>Shepard.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-9\">Because <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>remains good law, the district court did not err in finding that Rincon-Castrillon should receive an enhancement based on his prior conviction. Thus, we conclude that the district court\u2019s use of prior convictions to enhance Curtis\u2019s sentence did not violate the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">B. <em>Statutory Error</em></p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Although the district court did not violate the Sixth Amendment in sentencing Rincon-Castrillon, it did commit a statutory <em>Booker </em>error. Due to the nature of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Booker </em>remedy, we have concluded that a district court has committed <em>Booker </em>error whenever it sentences a defendant under a mandatory guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment error. <em>Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1330\u201431.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">When an error is nonconstitutional, it is harmless if it does not affect the substantial rights of the parties. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111; <em>United States v. Guzman, </em>167 F.3d 1350, 1353 (11th Cir.1999). \u201c[A] non-constitutional error requires reversal only if it resulted in actual prejudice because it had substantial and injurious effect.\u201d <em>Guzman, </em>167 F.3d at 1353 (internal quotations and citation omitted). The government bears the burden of showing that the error did not affect Rincon-Castrillon\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Fern, </em>155 F.3d 1318, 1327 (11th Cir.1998). \u201cThe non-constitutional harmless error standard is not easy for the government to meet.\u201d <em>United States v. Mathenia, </em>409 F.3d 1289, 1291-92 (11th Cir.2005). Here, the government has failed to meet its burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>In this case, without opposition from the government, the district court granted Rincon-Castrillon a full three-level departure for acceptance of responsibility and then imposed a sentence at the lowest end of the mandatory guidelines range. We cannot say with fair assurance that the sentence would not have been lower if the district court had considered the guidelines advisory instead of mandatory. Therefore, the government has failed to show that district court\u2019s error did not have a substantial and injurious effect on Rincon Castrillon\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE Rincon-Castrillon\u2019s sentence and REMAND to the district court for re-sentencing consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">SENTENCE VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
