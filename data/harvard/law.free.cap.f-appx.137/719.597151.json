He first contends that the district court erred in sentencing him as an aimed career criminal under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"720\">*720</page-number>Because Mata did not object to the armed-career-criminal enhancement in the district court, review is for plain error. <em>See United States v. Vonn, </em>535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002). Mata has demonstrated that the enhancement was plainly erroneous because the record does not establish that his prior conviction for simple possession of cocaine under Texas law was a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d or that his prior conviction for theft under Texas law was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d within the meaning of the statute so as to qualify as predicate offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(e)(2)(A) and (B). Even assuming that the two other prior convictions pleaded in the indictment constitute valid predicate offenses, three predicate offenses are required by the statute. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). The error affected Mata\u2019s substantial rights because, without the enhancement, he would have been subjected to a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Mata next renews the argument, preserved in the district court, that his constitutional rights were violated when the district court assessed a two-point adjustment, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4), based on judicially determined facts, citing <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). In light of the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the two-level adjustment violated Mata\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury, and the Government has not carried its burden of demonstrating that the error was harmless. Accordingly, Mata\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING. <em>See United States v. Pineiro, </em>410 F.3d 282, 286-87 &amp; n. 4 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Akpan, </em>407 F.3d 360, 377 (5th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 n. 9 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(March 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b743-20\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
