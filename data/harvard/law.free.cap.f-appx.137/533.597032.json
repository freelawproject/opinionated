Appellants also appeal from the district court\u2019s order rejecting the magistrate judge\u2019s decision and denying Appellants\u2019 motion to extend the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) (No. 04-1709). We affirm in part and dismiss in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In No. 04-1709, Appellants assert that the district court applied an incorrect standard of review when considering the propriety of the magistrate judge\u2019s decision and that the court abused its discretion in denying their motion to extend the appeal period. We have thoroughly reviewed the parties\u2019 briefs, the joint appendix, and the materials filed by the parties pursuant to Fed. R.App. P. 28(j). We conclude that the district court applied the correct standard of review and did not abuse its discretion in finding that Appellants failed to demonstrate excusable neglect warranting an extension of the appeal period. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Hayes v. Crown Cent. Petroleum Corp., </em>No. CA-02-122-A (E.D.Va. May 25, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Turning to the appeals in Nos. 04-1425 and 04-1505, we may now consider Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss these appeals for lack of jurisdiction. We previously deferred action on Appellees\u2019 motion pending our consideration of the appeal in No. 04-1709.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-11\">Parties are accorded thirty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(A), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5), or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). This appeal period is \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b558-12\">The district court\u2019s judgment granting Appellees\u2019 Rule 12(b)(6) motion was entered on the docket on February 12, 2004; the thirty-day appeal period expired on March 15, 2004.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The notices of appeal were filed on April 5 and 19, 2004. Because Appellants failed to file a timely notice of appeal or to obtain an extension or reopening of the appeal period, we grant Appellees\u2019 motion to dismiss and dismiss the appeals in Nos. 04-1425 and 04-1505 for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-13\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-14\">No. 04-1709 <em>AFFIRMED</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-15\">Nos. 04-1425 and 04-1505 <em>DISMISSED</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b558-8\"> The thirtieth day fell on Saturday, March 13, 2004. Appellants therefore had until Monday, March 15, to timely file a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 26(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
