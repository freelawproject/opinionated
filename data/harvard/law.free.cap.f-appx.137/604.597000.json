Bjorlo and Sharon J. Bjorlo appeal the district court\u2019s judgment denying their claims for specific performance and damages. After a bench <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>trial, this court reviews the district court\u2019s conclusions of law de novo and its findings of facts for clear error. <em>Minyard Enter., Inc. v. Southeastern Chem. &amp; Solvent Co., </em>184 F.3d 373, 380 (4th Cir.1999); Fed. R. Civ.P. 52(a). A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when, \u201calthough there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d <em>United States v. United States Gypsum Co., </em>333 U.S. 364, 395, 68 S. Ct. 525, 92 L.Ed. 746 (1948); <em>In re Green, </em>934 F.2d 568, 570 (4th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">We have reviewed the parties\u2019 opening briefs, Appellants\u2019 reply brief, and the joint appendix and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court. <em>See Bjorlo v. Qualliotine, </em>No. CA-03-567-2 (E.D.Va. Sept. 28, 2004). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
