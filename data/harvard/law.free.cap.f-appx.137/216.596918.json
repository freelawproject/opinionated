Haines, a black male with various medical restrictions, appeals the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment in favor of his former employer, John E. Potter, the Postmaster General of the United States Postal Service (\u201cUSPS\u201d), in this employment discrimination (disability and race) lawsuit alleging violations of the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 701, and Title VII of the CM Rights Act of 1964 (\u201cTitle VII\u201d), 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e, <em>et seq. </em>On appeal, Haines argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>that the following genuine issues of material fact should have prevented entry of summary judgment on his claims: (1) whether USPS employees were motivated by discriminatory intent (based on disability or race, or both) when they directed Haines to park in a designated handicapped spot, rather than in a place near the dumpster that was not a parking spot; and (2) whether, after he started parking in the handicapped spot, the employees retaliated against him by asking him not to park in the spot if he did not display his handicapped permit. After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">We review the district court\u2019s order granting summary judgment <em>de novo. See Madray v. Publix Supermarkets, Inc., </em>208 F.3d 1290, 1296 (11th Cir.2000). A motion for summary judgment should be granted when \u201cthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). \u201cWhere the record taken as a whole could not lead a rational trier of fact to find for the non-moving party, there is no \u2018genuine issue for trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith Radio Corp., </em>475 U.S. 574, 587, 106 S.Ct. 1348, 1356, 89 L.Ed.2d 538 (1986) (quoting <em>First Nat\u2019l Bank of Arizona v. Cities Serv. Co., </em>391 U.S. 253, 289, 88 S.Ct. 1575, 1592, 20 L.Ed.2d 569 (1968)). In making this assessment, we \u201cmust view all the evidence and all factual inferences reasonably drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\u201d <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1285 (11th Cir.1997), and \u201cresolve all reasonable doubts about the facts in favor of the non-movant.\u201d <em>United of Omaha Life Ins. v. Sun Life Ins. Co., </em>894 F.2d 1555, 1558 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">Under Title VII, it is an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against an employee \u201cbecause he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000e-3(a). As with a discriminatory treatment claim, a plaintiff alleging a retaliation claim under Title VII must begin by establishing a prima facie case; the plaintiff must show that (1) he engaged in a statutorily protected activity, (2) an adverse employment action occurred, and (3) the adverse action was causally related to the plaintiffs protected activities. <em>See Little v. United Technologies, </em>103 F.3d 956, 959 (11th Cir.1997); <em>Coutu v. Martin County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1995) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">An adverse employment action is an ultimate employment decision, such as discharge or failure to hire, or other conduct that \u201calters the employee\u2019s compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, deprives him or her of employment opportunities, or adversely affects his or her status as an employee.\u201d <em>Robinson v. City of Pittsburgh, </em>120 F.3d 1286, 1300 (3rd Cir.1997) (citation and internal marks omitted). Conduct that falls short of an ultimate employment decision must meet \u201csome threshold level of substantiality ... to be cognizable under the anti-retaliation clause.\u201d <em>Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-9\">Here, the district court found the following: (1) Haines was afforded reasonable accommodations because he was permitted to park in a designated handicapped parking spot so long as he displayed the required permit; and (2) Haines presented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number><em>no </em>evidence of an adverse employment action \u2014 neither based on the occasion when he was asked not to park in a place by the dumpster that was not a designated parking space, nor when he was told to move his car from the designated handicapped spot because he was not displaying his handicapped parking permit. In his brief, Haines asserts that the district court erred by entering summary judgment because there remain genuine issues of material fact concerning his former employer\u2019s alleged discriminatory <em>intent. </em>We do not need to reach that issue since we find the district court properly entered summary judgment based on Haines\u2019s failure to allege an adverse employment action under Title VII or the Rehabilitation Act. <em>See Watkins v. Bowden, </em>105 F.3d 1344, 1353 n. 17 (11th Cir.1997) (appellate court may affirm district court on any ground, even one not considered). Notably, in this appeal, Haines does not challenge the district court\u2019s findings that reasonable accommodations \u2014 such as allowing Haines to park in a designated handicapped parking spot when displaying the required permit\u2014 were made and that the incidents of which Haines complained did not rise to the level of materially adverse employment actions. Those findings alone support the district court\u2019s decision and obviate any need to address evidence of discriminatory intent. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Potter.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
