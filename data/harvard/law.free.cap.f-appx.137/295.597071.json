O\u2019Brien appeals <em>pro se </em>the district court\u2019s grant of the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss his claims of negligence under the Federal Tort Claims Act and the court\u2019s ruling that O\u2019Brien failed to raise or never intended to raise an Eighth Amendment claim and thus failed to reach the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss a possible claim under <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2005, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). He further appeals the district court\u2019s failure to consider whether one of the defendants was properly served. For the reasons stated more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-15\">O\u2019Brien, a federal prisoner proceeding <em>pro se, </em>filed a <em>\u201cpro se </em>Federal Tort Complaint for Monetary Damages\u201d against the United States; the Federal Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d); the Federal Detention Center (\u201cFDC\u201d) in Miami, Florida; John Doe, Warden of the FDC; Associate Warden Hulle of the FDC; M.A. Stern, D.D.S., of the FDC; and J.J. Jan,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> D.D.S., of the FDC, all jointly and severally liable in their official and individual capacities. O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint stated that he sought redress for \u201cactual pain and suffering and emotional distress, injuries sustained as a direct result of the actions, inactions, and omissions of the named Defendants and of their employees, agents, subordinates,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(Federal Tort Claims Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d). O\u2019Brien specifically cited to the jurisdiction, venue, and statute of limitations requirements of the FTCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-16\">In his complaint, O\u2019Brien alleged the following: (1) he was incarcerated from February 6, 1999, through February 4, 2002, was protected by \u201cthe Eighth Amendment\u2019s proscription against cruel and unusual punishment,\u201d and at all times had the right to \u201creasonable medical care that was the equivalent to that measure of care accorded to private citizens,\u201d including dental care; (2) he submitted 11 written request forms to the dentist complaining of mouth pain and was examined at least 8 separate times to address his complaints; (3) from January 18, 2000, to September 25, 2000, defendants Doe, Hulle, Stern, and Dan were aware of O\u2019Brien\u2019s continued complaints of mouth pain; (4) from September 25, 2000, when O\u2019Brien had two molars extracted, until February 4, 2002, Doe, Hulle, Stern, and Dan, were all aware of O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaints regard<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ing his two remaining molars; (5) from January 18, 2000, to September 25, 2000, Stern told O\u2019Brien that he had been placed on the oral surgery schedule three separate times, but defendant Doe removed O\u2019Brien\u2019s name from the list, thus causing O\u2019Brien ongoing mouth pain in breach of the duty of reasonable care owed to him; (6) the same duty of reasonable care was breached again between February 27, 2001 and February 4, 2002, when the defendants failed to provide reasonable care to O\u2019Brien after being made aware of continuing pain from O\u2019Brien\u2019s remaining molars.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">Based on the foregoing allegations, O\u2019Brien argued that the defendants exhibited \u201cdeliberate indifference to his medical needs by: (a) delaying his thrice-scheduled oral surgery, and for an unreasonably long period of time; and (b) failing to reschedule him for follow up surgery to address the remaining two impacted molars, again for an unreasonably long period of time.\u201d O\u2019Brien further alleged that the FDC defendants were vicariously liable based upon the reasonably foreseeable knowledge that their failure to act would cause O\u2019Brien pain, they acted in bad faith, and they committed \u201cwanton misconduct and negligence.\u201d O\u2019Brien further stated that the laws of the State of Florida permitted the defendants\u2019 liability for their negligent acts committed within the scope of their employment and that the FTCA did not allow the United States to assert sovereign immunity. O\u2019Brien sought, <em>inter alia, </em>$10,000 in compensatory damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">The defendants subsequently filed a motion to dismiss O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ. P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The defendants argued that O\u2019Brien had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies under the FTCA because (1) he had filed an administrative claim with the BOP and FDC on July 16, 2002, but filed his FTCA claim in federal court on September 24, 2002, before the administrative claim had been decided. Because O\u2019Brien\u2019s administrative claim was not denied until December 2, 2002, the defendants argued that O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA civil action had been prematurely filed and not properly refiled within six months of the denial of his administrative claim and, thus, the district court lacked jurisdiction over the claim because O\u2019Brien had failed to properly exhaust his administrative remedies. The defendants further argued that, under the FTCA, only the United States was a properly named party and, therefore, all of the individual defendants and the federal agencies named as defendants were due to be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Finally, the defendants <em>sua sponte </em>noted that, although O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint made only a single reference to the Eighth Amendment and one use of the term \u201cdeliberate indifference,\u201d and furthermore, on its face did not seek relief against the individual defendants under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 for violating O\u2019Brien\u2019s constitutional rights under <em>Bivens, </em>any possible construction of O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint to encompass a <em>Bivens </em>claim was also due to be dismissed under Fed.R.Civ.P 12(b)(1) because O\u2019Brien had not exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to that claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">O\u2019Brien responded to the defendants\u2019 motion by stating that he did not dispute that his FTCA complaint was filed prematurely, but argued that he had no access to the rules regarding the filing of such claims. O\u2019Brien further argued that he made a good-faith attempt to exhaust his administrative remedies, which should prevent the district court from dismissing for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. Finally, O\u2019Brien argued that he was denied access to proper legal materials despite <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>requests. No mention was made of any <em>Bivens </em>claim or the fact that the defendants addressed the issue in its motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\">The defendants replied to O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument, that the exhaustion requirements be waived, arguing that the exhaustion requirements were procedural and nonwaiveable, even for a <em>pro se </em>litigant and, in any event, it was evident from O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint that he had access to the FTCA because it was explicitly cited as his cause of action. It further noted that O\u2019Brien had failed to include any requests for materials that were denied to him and that O\u2019Brien had failed to allege that he did not have access to legal resources during the time in which his FTCA complaint should have been filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">On October 21, 2003, O\u2019Brien filed a motion to amend his complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a) in order to substitute Monica Wetzel, the warden of the FDC in Miami for the majority of O\u2019Brien\u2019s incarceration, for \u201cJohn Doe.\u201d He then filed a response to the defendants\u2019 reply brief, arguing that (1) the FTCA\u2019s exhaustion requirements did not address an \u201cattempt\u201d at exhausting remedies where request forms were filed and a plaintiff was unable to obtain the proper forms; (2) he did not have an urgent need for a legal library or legal materials after he had filed his \u201ctort\u201d claim on July 16, 2002; (3) he had no way of knowing that he could refile his claim because he did not have legal materials available to him and, while he conceded that he overlooked the inclusion of his specific requests, the materials he requested were statutes, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2401(b) and 2675(a), \u201cwhich would have assisted plaintiff on the filing procedures for his Tort Complaint;\u201d and (4) the government\u2019s failure to object to the evidence O\u2019Brien presented waived any right to do so, making summary judgment in O\u2019Brien\u2019s favor appropriate. O\u2019Brien also filed a motion to supplement his response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, essentially restating his arguments and citing <em>Thomas v. Woolum, </em>337 F.3d 720 (6th Cir.2003) to support his \u201cattempt\u201d argument regarding exhaustion requirements. No mention of <em>Bivens, </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, or any other potential constitutional deprivation was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">O\u2019Brien filed two more motions to supplement his response to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, first arguing that the BOP\u2019s regional counsel obstructed the evidence and violated the \u201cPrivacy Act,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and second, arguing that the government\u2019s reading of <em>Thomas </em>was flawed and the issue was whether an \u201cattempt\u201d to follow prison procedures was sufficient to exhaust his administrative remedies, which O\u2019Brien argued was enough. The government responded only to O\u2019Brien\u2019s FOIA claims, arguing that (1) O\u2019Brien failed to exhaust his administrative remedies and (2) the defendants were otherwise exempt from O\u2019Brien\u2019s request. The district court granted O\u2019Brien\u2019s motions to supplement, finding that the defendants had not objected to the additional arguments. O\u2019Brien\u2019s FOIA claims, however, were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">On April 13, 2004, O\u2019Brien submitted a brief arguing that he had received a response from the BOP denying his tort claim and, therefore, the prematureness of his FTCA complaint should be deemed cured. It is noted that, at no point in any of O\u2019Brien\u2019s responses, replies, supplemental filings, or briefs, is there a mention of <em>Bivens, </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, the Eighth Amendment, or any other deprivation of a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">Finally, on September 28, 2004, the district court granted the defendants\u2019 motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>to dismiss. It found that it was without jurisdiction to consider O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA claim because he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies before filing his complaint. The court specifically rejected O\u2019Brien\u2019s argument that his claim be allowed to proceed because no substantial progress had taken place before his administrative claim was denied granted and, furthermore, it found that even though O\u2019Brien was <em>pro se, </em>the procedural requirements of the FTCA applied to him without leniency. The district court found that O\u2019Brien\u2019s claim that the BOP delayed his attempt to comply with administrative procedures was irrelevant because O\u2019Brien had filed an administrative claim with the BOP, then improperly filed a civil complaint before the administrative claim had been denied, and failed to file an FTCA claim within six months after O\u2019Brien\u2019s administrative grievance had been denied. Finally, the court declined to reach the defendants\u2019 argument that O\u2019Brien\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim, if he had even made one, be dismissed for failing to exhaust administrative remedies because the court found that \u201cthe Complaint does not state a <em>Bivens </em>claim and ... in his Response ... Plaintiff did not assert that he intended to raise such a claim.\u201d All other pending motions were denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">On appeal, O\u2019Brien first argues that the district court erred by finding that he had failed to state a claim under <em>Bivens. </em>He argues that the district court, by failing to find that his claim was a constitutional claim under Bivens, failed to reach the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss, and in so doing, failed to accept as true all the factual allegations in his complaint, which he argues raised a constitutional claim under the Eighth Amendment and deliberate indifference standards. O\u2019Brien argues that the district court was obligated to liberally construe his claim, and failed to properly apply the rules for determining whether a cause of action under <em>Bivens </em>had been made. He further argues that the district court should have permitted him to amend his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">The United States Supreme Court has held that federal officials may be sued in their individual capacities for violations of a person\u2019s constitutional rights. <em>Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents, </em>403 U.S. 388, 397, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 2005, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971). Because claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and <em>Bivens </em>are similar, courts generally apply \u00a7 1983 law to <em>Bivens </em>cases. <em>Abella v. Rubino, </em>63 F.3d 1063, 1065 (11th Cir.1995). Thus, under <em>Bivens, </em>\u201ca plaintiff must show that he or she was deprived of a federal right by a person acting under color of [federal] law.\u201d <em>Griffin v. City of Opa-Locka, </em>261 F.3d 1295, 1303 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">We will assume that review of the district court\u2019s conclusions regarding whether a plaintiff intends to raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>as even under a <em>de novo </em>review, the record shows that O\u2019Brien, despite having an opportunity to do so, never attempted or intended to invoke <em>Bivens </em>and, in fact, has raised <em>Bivens </em>for the first time on appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b324-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint sought redress for \u201cactual pain and suffering and emotional distress, injuries sustained as a direct result of the actions, inactions, and omissions of the named Defendants and of their employees, agents, subordinates,\u201d pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b), 2671 <em>et seq. </em>(FTCA). O\u2019Brien specifically cited to the jurisdiction, venue, and statute of limitations requirements of the FTCA. At no point does the complaint mention 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (protecting against deprivation of constitutional rights by government agents acting under color of state law), <em>Bivens </em>(extending \u00a7 1983 protection to individuals acting under color of federal law), or either 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 or 1343 (federal question jurisdiction or civil rights jurisdiction, including constitutional rights).</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">As the defendants noted in their motion to dismiss, O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint does assert that, while incarcerated at the FDC in Miami, he was protected by the Eighth Amendment, but the complaint does not allege that O\u2019Brien\u2019s Eighth Amendment rights were violated. Moreover, while O\u2019Brien mentions that the defendants were \u201cdeliberately indifferent\u201d to his medical needs, the relief O\u2019Brien sought was for, <em>inter alia, </em>vicarious liability, agency, and negligence, all of which he claims would be governed by Florida law under the FTCA. The defendants, in their motion to dismiss, gave O\u2019Brien the benefit of the doubt and raised the possibility that O\u2019Brien might have intended a <em>Bivens </em>claim. It noted that, even if the district court were to give such a construction to O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint, which it need not do given that the complaint did not facially seek relief for a violation of constitutional rights, the claim should be dismissed for failure to exhaust administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">In his multiple responses to the defendants\u2019 motion, O\u2019Brien never once raised <em>Bivens, </em>mentioned any alleged constitutional violation, filed a motion to amend his complaint to include such a claim, or even addressed the government\u2019s argument that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies regarding a <em>Bivens </em>claim. Furthermore, O\u2019Brien knew how to amend his complaint pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), as he filed a motion to do so seeking to amend one of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">The fact remains that throughout his responses and motions to amend/supplement those responses, O\u2019Brien only argues the FTCA, and for the first time on appeal argues that he intended to raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim. \u201cThis Court has repeatedly held that an issue not raised in the district court and raised for the first time in an appeal will not be considered.\u201d <em>Access Now, Inc. v. Southwest Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1331 (11th Cir.2004). Accordingly, while O\u2019Brien is <em>pro se </em>and entitled to a liberal construction of his complaint, he had multiple opportunities to respond to the defendants\u2019 assertion that O\u2019Brien did not raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim, but if he did, it should be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. O\u2019Brien chose not to amend his complaint or argue <em>Bivens </em>despite being on notice (as he did respond to the defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss) that a <em>Bivens </em>claim was not out of the question if he intended to raise it. However, we conclude that O\u2019Brien\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claim is raised for the first time on appeal and, therefore, decline to consider it. <em>Access Now, </em>385 F.3d at 1331.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">O\u2019Brien next argues that the district court erred by finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative remedies, contending that his \u201cattempt\u201d to do so should have been satisfactory. We review the dismissal of an action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction <em>de novo. Ochran v. United States, </em>117 F.3d 495, 499 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cThe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA) provides that an \u2018action shall not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages\u2019 unless the claimant has first exhausted his administrative remedies.\u201d <em>McNeil v. United States, </em>508 U.S. 106, 107, 113 S.Ct. 1980, 1981, 124 L.Ed.2d 21 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a) of the FTCA:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-6\">An action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages for injury or loss of property or personal injury or death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee of the Government while acting within the scope of his office or employment, unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency and his claim shall have been finally denied by the agency in writing and sent by certified or registered mail. The failure of an agency to make final disposition of a claim within six months after it is filed shall, at the option of the claimant any time thereafter, be deemed a final denial of the claim for purposes of this section.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AK\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">In <em>McNeil, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided whether an action may be maintained under the FTCA when the claimant failed to exhaust his administrative remedies prior to filing suit, but did so before substantial progress was made in the litigation. <em>McNeil, </em>508 U.S. at 107, 113 S.Ct. at 1981. In <em>McNeil, </em>the plaintiff filed a complaint on March 6, 1989, in district court under the FTCA and four months later filed an administrative claim, which was subsequently denied on July 21, 1989. <em>Id. </em>at 107-08, 113 S.Ct. at 1981-82. The government moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that the complaint was not filed until April 15, 1990, when the plaintiff paid the filing fees, while the plaintiff argued that the complaint was filed on March 6, 1989, and, therefore, timely. <em>Id. </em>at 108-09, 113 S.Ct. at 1982. The Court rejected the plaintiffs argument that, so long as no substantial progress has been made in the litigation by the time the claimant has exhausted his administrative remedies, the federal agency will have had a fair opportunity to investigate and/or settle the claim. <em>Id. </em>at 111-12, 113 S.Ct at 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Thus, the Supreme Court in <em>McNeil </em>held that the \u201cFTCA bars claimants from bringing suit in federal court until they have exhausted their administrative remedies,\u201d and because the plaintiff there \u201cfailed to heed that clear statutory command, the District Court properly dismissed his suit.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 113, 113 S.Ct. at 1984. The Court further noted that, the fact that the plaintiff in <em>McNeil </em>was <em>pro se </em>did not excuse mistakes in following procedural rules in ordinary civil litigation. <em>Id., </em>113 S.Ct at 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-10\">Here, like in <em>McNeil, </em>O\u2019Brien prematurely filed his civil complaint under the FTCA and likewise \u201cfailed to heed that clear statutory command\u201d requiring that his administrative remedies be exhausted before bringing suit. Moreover, while <em>McNeil </em>noted that <em>pro se </em>litigants are entitled to have their pleadings liberally construed, procedural rules such as exhausting administrative remedies before filing suit were specifically excluded from that rule. <em>See McNeil, </em>508 U.S. at 113, 113 S.Ct. at 1984. Finally, any argument O\u2019Brien makes regarding his inability to properly file an administrative claim is meritless given that he adequately presented his tort claim to the BOP, which denied the claim. Accordingly, O\u2019Brien\u2019s complaint was filed prematurely, before administrative proceedings had concluded, and was not refiled within six months after his administrative claim had been denied. Therefore, we conclude that the district court properly dismissed O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">Lastly, O\u2019Brien argues that the district court failed to address and review whether defendant Wetzel was properly served. Here, because we have already determined that the district court did not err by finding that O\u2019Brien did not raise or intend to raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim and did not err by dismissing O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA complaint for lack of jurisdiction, any unresolved issues relating to service of process on Monica Wetzel, former warden of the FDC in Miami, are moot because the district court does not have jurisdiction over any of O\u2019Brien\u2019s claims, including those against Wetzel.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">Based on the foregoing, the district court did not err by dismissing O\u2019Brien\u2019s FTCA complaint, finding that O\u2019Brien did not raise or intend to raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim, or denying as moot the propriety of service of process on defendant Wetzel. We, therefore, affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-12\">. The complaint states \"Dan,\u201d but pursuant to O\u2019Brien's request and the district court's order, the name was corrected to read \"Jan\u201d and, therefore, is changed in this opinion as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b322-6\">. O'Brien refers to the Freedom of Information Act (\"FOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\">. The closest analogy to the district court's finding that O'Brien did not intend to raise a <em>Bivens </em>claim might be a finding that O\u2019Brien failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted, warranting dismissal under Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). That finding would be reviewed <em>de novo. See, e.g., Simmons v. Sonyika, </em>394 F.3d 1335, 1338 (11th Cir.2004). However, this is not a case where the district court found that the plaintiff failed to state a claim either factually or legally, but rather found that this plaintiff never intended to raise a claim in the first instance, meaning it did not reach any merit-based decision regarding whether the claim should be dismissed because it found the claim did not exist in the first place.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
