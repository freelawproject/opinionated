The district court dismissed the complaint pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i)-(ii). Trujillo also appeals the court\u2019s denial of his subsequent Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) motion wherein he argued that the dismissal of his complaint should have been without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>Trujillo argues that the district court erred by failing to afford him the opportunity to have his case heard by a magistrate judge as required under Rule 3(b) of the Local Rules for the Western District of Texas. We review Trujillo\u2019s challenge to the district court\u2019s interpretation of its own procedural rules <em>de novo. See Bellaire Gen. Hosp. v. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, </em>97 F.3d 822, 827 (5th Cir.1996). Rule 3(b) of the Local Rules for the Western District of Texas does not guarantee a litigant a right to proceed before a magistrate judge. The district court was thus not required to afford Trujillo the opportunity to have his case heard before a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Trujillo also argues that the district court erred by dismissing his complaint with prejudice without affording him an opportunity to articulate his claims at a <em>Spears v. McCotter, </em>766 F.2d 179, 181 (5th Cir.1985), hearing. He argues that the interrogatories propounded by the district court were insufficient to allow him to develop his claims because they permitted him \u201cno opportunity to frame his allegations in a non-frivolous manner.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">A lower court \u201cmay abuse its discretion by providing insufficient opportunity for the plaintiff to develop his claims.\u201d <em>Davis v. Scott, </em>157 F.3d 1003, 1005 (5th Cir.1998). \u201cThe principal vehicles which have evolved for remedying inadequacy in prisoner pleadings are the <em>Spears </em>hearing and a questionnaire to bring into focus the factual and legal bases of prisoners\u2019 claims.\u201d <em>Eason v. Thaler, </em>14 F.3d 8, 9 (5th Cir.1994). <em>Id. </em>(internal quotations and citation omitted). However, \u201cplaintiffs cannot be allowed to continue to amend or supplement their pleading until they stumble upon a formula that carries them over the threshold.\u201d <em>Jacquez v. Procunier, </em>801 F.2d 789, 792 (5th Cir.1986). The district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to allow Trujillo additional opportunities to develop his claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-7\">Finally, to the extent that Trujillo challenges the district court\u2019s basis for dismissing his complaint, we perceive no error. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00a9 authorizes the dismissal of an IFP complaint that is frivolous or malicious. A complaint is frivolous \u201cif it lacks an arguable basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998). Dismissals under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i) are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 213. However, because the district court also dismissed the complaint under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii) for failure to state a claim, we review the dismissal of the instant complaint de novo. <em>See Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 274 (5th Cir.1998); <em>Velasquez v. Woods, </em>329 F.3d 420, 421 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-8\">The record supports the district court\u2019s determination that Trujillo\u2019s condition was treated repeatedly. Although Trujillo couches his argument as the complete denial of medical care based on a policy decision, the essence of Trujillo\u2019s claim is that the defendants were negligent for failing to determine that his condition warranted surgery. Such is not a basis for a civil rights action under \u00a7 1983. <em>See Varnado v. Lynaugh, </em>920 F.2d 320, 321 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b687-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
