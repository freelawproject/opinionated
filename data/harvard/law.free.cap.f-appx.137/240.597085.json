Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). <em>See Welch v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 1997, 161 L.Ed.2d 852 (2005). We previously affirmed Welch\u2019s sentence. <em>United States v. Welch, </em>127 Fed.Appx. 473 (11th Cir.2004). After reconsideration, we vacate Welch\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-22\">The government admits that the district court committed constitutional error under <em>Booker </em>when it enhanced Welch\u2019s sentence, under Sentencing Guidelines the court considered to be mandatory, based on a fact not found by a jury or admitted by Welch. We will affirm Welch\u2019s sentence, however, if the error was harmless. <em>United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-23\">Constitutional error is only harmless if it is \u201cclear beyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A careful review of the record reveals no clear evidence that the error did not contribute to the sentence. Accordingly, we vacate Welch\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-24\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
