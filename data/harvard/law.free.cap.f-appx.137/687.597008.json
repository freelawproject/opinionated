Martinez argues that the district court erred by imposing a two-level upward adjustment to his sentence for obstruction of justice and denying a two-level downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. Martinez contends that the obstruction of justice adjustment was based on facts to which he did not admit, which were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt, and which were not charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-13\">Because Martinez raises these issues for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <em>See United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 520 (5th Cir.2005), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Mar. 31, 2005) (No. 04-9517). We may correct forfeited errors only when: (1) there is an error, (2) that is clear or obvious, and (3) that affects the appellant\u2019s substantial rights. <em>United States v. Calverley, </em>37 F.3d 160, 162-64 (5th Cir.1994) (en banc) (citing <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-14\">During the pendency of this appeal, the Supreme Court held in <em>United States v. Booker, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 756, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Accordingly, application of the adjustment for obstruction of justice constitutes error under <em>Booker </em>and that error is now plain in light of <em>Booker. </em>Even if we assume, arguendo, that the district court also committed <em>Booker </em>error by denying a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, Martinez has not met the third prong of the plain error test because he has made no showing that he would have received a lesser sentence had the district court sentenced him under an advisory application of the sentencing guidelines. <em>See United States v. Holmes, </em>406 F.3d 337, 365-66 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b712-17\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b712-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
