We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">We review a district court\u2019s judgment imposing a sentence after revocation of supervised release for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Davis, </em>53 F.3d 638, 642-43 (4th Cir.1995). The district court need only find a violation of a condition of supervised release by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2005). Moreover, because Lucas\u2019 sentence does not exceed the statutory maximum under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), we review the sentence only to determine whether it is \u201cplainly unreasonable.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a)(4) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">On appeal, Lucas contends her sentence is plainly unreasonable because it exceeds the applicable range under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 7B1.4(a) (2004), and that a sentence within the Guidelines would have imposed adequate punishment. However, while the applicable sentencing range is one of the factors to be considered, it is advisory only, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)(B) (2000); <em>Davis, </em>53 F.3d at 640-41, and we find the district court properly considered Lucas\u2019 need for intensive drug treatment when determining the length of her sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (2) (2000). Thus, the district court did not abuse its discretion, and Lucas\u2019 sentence is not plainly unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-13\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
