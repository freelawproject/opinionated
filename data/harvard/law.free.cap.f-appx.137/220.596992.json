No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997) (reprinted in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, historical and statutory notes).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">In 1998, pursuant to a plea agreement in which he agreed to forfeit to the United States his interest in certain real and personal property, Pease pled guilty to conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) &amp; 846. After the plea was entered, but before sentencing, upon the Government\u2019s request, the court granted the Government\u2019s application for a preliminary order of forfeiture (\u201cPOF\u201d) pursuant to Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> At sentencing, however, the court failed to make the POF part of its judgment. We affirmed Pease\u2019s conviction and sentence on March 1, 2001. <em>United States v. Pease, </em>240 F.3d 938 (11th Cir.2001)(\u201cPease I\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b246-16\">While Pease\u2019s appeal was pending, the Government, drawing on the POF for its authority, published a notice informing third parties that the property described in the POF had been forfeited to the United States and of their right to petition the district court pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2), (6) for a declaration that they held an interest in such property and that their interest was superior to Pease\u2019s forfeited interest. On September 27, 1999, Pease, claiming an interest in three items listed in the POF, also filed a \u00a7 853(n)(2) petition. The Government moved to strike Pease\u2019s petition on the ground that \u00a7 853(n)(2) prohibits a convicted defendant from claiming an interest in forfeited property. On the same day, Latoya, Reedy, and Foster (Pease\u2019s sister, mother, and girlfriend, respectively) filed \u00a7 853(n)(2) petitions with the district court, claiming an interest in some of the property described in the POF.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-17\">In January 2000, while these petitions and the Government\u2019s motion to strike them were pending, Pease moved the district court to dismiss the ancillary proceeding. He contended that because the judgment in his criminal case did not include a final order of forfeiture, the court lacked authority to entertain a \u00a7 853(n) ancillary proceeding. Latoya, Reedy, and Foster subsequently moved the court to dismiss the ancillary proceeding on the same ground. In response, the Government moved to correct the judgment in Pease\u2019s criminal case pursuant to Rule 36 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>which authorizes a district court to correct clerical mistakes in judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">The magistrate judge (to whom the district court referred the matter), in a report to the district court, concluded that Latoya and Reedy had failed to carry the burden of proof prescribed by \u00a7 853(n)(6) and that the statute barred Pease from claiming his interest in the forfeited property. On June 6, 2000, the district court, adopting the magistrate judge\u2019s conclusions, entered an order amending the judgment in Pease\u2019s criminal case, denying the petitioners\u2019 claims, and granting the Government\u2019s motion to strike Pease\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Pease, Reedy, and Latoya appealed the district court\u2019s order. We accepted the appeal only as to Reedy and Latoya, and concluded that Pease\u2019s petition was barred by \u00a7 853(n)(2). <em>United States v. Pease, </em>331 F.3d 809, 811 (11th Cir.2003) (hereafter <em>Pease </em>II). We determined that (1) the Government never acquired Pease\u2019s interest in any of the properties because the forfeiture had not been included in the judgment in Pease\u2019s criminal case, and (2) the district court misused Rule 36 to modify the judgment because the alteration of the judgment was substantial. We reversed the district court\u2019s order and remanded the case with instructions that the district court dismiss the ancillary proceeding for lack of an order of forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-7\">In June 2004, Reedy, Latoya, and Foster filed a joint motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to EAJA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). Pease and the claimants filed a joint motion to dismiss the action, for return of the property listed in the POF, and for damages stemming from the \u201cwrongful seizure\u201d of the properties. Pease also moved the court to grant him attorney\u2019s fees and costs pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B). Pease also claimed that he was entitled to such fees and expenses under \u00a7 2412 through the Hyde Amendment. The district court dismissed the ancillary proceeding, denied the claimants\u2019s motions for attorney\u2019s fees, and awarded costs in the amount of $40. The claimant now appeals the district court\u2019s order denying them attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-9\">Reedy, Foster, and Latoya contend that the district court abused its discretion by denying their motion for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under EAJA because the Government\u2019s pursuit of the forfeiture of Pease\u2019s property was not substantially justified. The claimants assert that at the time the Government moved the district court pursuant to Rule 36 to correct the judgment in Pease\u2019s criminal case to include the omitted forfeiture order, it knew that Rule 36 was not a proper vehicle to correct that judgment. Pease contends that the district court erred by denying him reimbursement for attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Hyde Amendment. He submits that he was a prevailing party on the issue of the Government\u2019s misuse of Rule 36 as a method for correcting the omission of the forfeiture from the judgment. He says that the Government\u2019s action in seeking forfeiture was vexatious, frivolous, and in bad faith. Reedy contends that the district court failed to address her claim to the real property on Daphne Drive.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">I. Foster\u2019s EAJA claim</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">A plaintiff seeking to invoke a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing standing. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 561, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2136, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). Article III of the United States Constitution requires \u201cthe party who invokes the court\u2019s authority to \u2018show that [s]he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant,\u2019 and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>the injury \u2018fairly can be traced to the challenged action\u2019 and \u2018is likely to be redressed by a favorable decision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College v. Americans United for Separation of Church and State, </em>454 U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (citations omitted). \u201cIt is well established that in order to contest a forfeiture, a claimant first must demonstrate a sufficient interest in the property to give him Article III standing; otherwise, there is no \u2018case or controversy,\u2019 in the constitutional sense, capable of adjudication in the federal courts.\u201d <em>United States v. $38,000.00 Dollars in U.S. Currency, </em>816 F.2d 1538, 1543 (11th Cir.1987)(civil forfeiture case).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\">The record reveals that Foster withdrew her claim from the ancillary proceeding and therefore is not able to demonstrate an interest in any property that was the subject of the forfeiture count in Pease\u2019s criminal case. Moreover, she was not a party in the appeal of the ancillary proceeding in <em>Pease II. </em>Accordingly, she lacks standing to move for attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">II. Pease\u2019s EAJA claim</p>\n<p id=\"Afg\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-6\">Any person, other than the defendant, asserting a legal interest in property which has been ordered forfeited to the United States pursuant to this section may, within thirty days of the final publication of notice or his receipt of notice under paragraph (1), whichever is earlier, petition the court for a hearing to adjudicate the validity of his alleged interest in the property. The hearing shall be held before the court alone, without a jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-7\"><em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 853(n)(2)(emphasis added). In relevant part, \u00a7 2412 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b248-8\">Except as otherwise specifically provided by statute, a court shall award to a prevailing party other than the United States fees and other expenses, in addition to any costs awarded pursuant to subsection (a), incurred by that party in any civil action (other than cases sounding in tort), including proceedings for judicial review of agency action, brought by or against the United States in any court having jurisdiction of that action, unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b248-10\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) (emphasis added). While a proceeding ancillary to a criminal forfeiture prosecution \u2014 in which innocent third parties seek adjudication of the validity of their interests in the property- \u2014 -is a civil action, the criminal forfeiture of a defendant\u2019s interest in property is a mandatory element of the sentencing package. <em>See United States v. Douglas, </em>55 F.3d 584, 585 (11th Cir.1995); <em>see United States v. Gilbert, </em>244 F.3d 888, 924 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-11\">Because Pease\u2019s petition in the ancillary proceeding had been barred by \u00a7 853(n)(2), we refused to consider his claims in <em>Pease II. </em>Thus, Pease lacks standing to raise in this appeal any challenge relating to the ancillary proceeding. Moreover, because \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(A) provides for payment of attorney\u2019s fees and costs to prevailing parties in civil actions, and Pease was a defendant in the criminal action, the district court correctly concluded that he was not entitled to the fees and costs pursuant to \u00a7 2412(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">III. Reedy\u2019s and Latoya\u2019s EAJA claim</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">Section 2412(d) authorizes a district court to award fees and expenses after making three findings: (1) the litigant opposing the United States must be a prevailing party; (2) the government\u2019s position must not have been substantially <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>justified; and (3) there must be no circumstances that make an award against the government unjust. <em>Jean v. Nelson, </em>863 F.2d 759, 765 (11th Cir.1988), <em>aff'd sub nom. Commissioner, I.N.S. v. Jean, </em>496 U.S. 154, 110 S.Ct. 2316, 110 L.Ed.2d 134 (1990). \u201cThe government\u2019s position is substantially justified under EAJA when it has a \u201creasonable basis both in law and fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 767. \u201c[T]his question is one which the district courts are better positioned to decide.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citation omitted). In making the determination, the district court may consider (1) the state at which the litigation was resolved; (2) views expressed by other courts on the merits; (3) the legal merits of the government\u2019s position; (4) the clarity of the governing law; (5) the foreseeable length and complexity of the litigation; and (6) the consistency of the government\u2019s position. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">A party is deemed to have abandoned an issue that it includes in its statement of issues but does not address in its brief. <em>See Cheffer v. Reno, </em>55 F.3d 1517, 1519 n. 1 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">The only dispute Reedy and Latoya raise in this appeal is whether the Government\u2019s position was substantially justified. The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Reedy\u2019s and Latoya\u2019s motion because the Government\u2019s position was substantially justified. At the time the Government moved the district court to modify the judgment to include the forfeiture order, it was not clear from the case law in this circuit whether Rule 36 was a proper vehicle for modifying a judgment to include an omitted forfeiture provision. Further, based on events that unfolded in Pease\u2019s criminal case, the Government had reason to believe that its position regarding the correction of the judgment was justified. Pease\u2019s indictment included a forfeiture count, Pease\u2019s plea agreement contained a forfeiture provision, and at the change of plea hearing the magistrate judge questioned Pease about his understanding of the forfeiture. At the sentencing hearing, the court and the Government again briefly addressed the forfeiture of Pease\u2019s property, and defense counsel confirmed that he was not challenging the forfeiture. Because Pease never objected to the forfeiture of his property, the Government\u2019s belief that Pease\u2019s property had been forfeited was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">IV. Pease\u2019s Hyde Amendment claim</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">A grant or denial of attorney\u2019s fees under the Hyde Amendment \u201cis reviewed for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Adkinson, </em>247 F.3d 1289, 1290 (11th Cir.2001). \u201c \u2018An abuse of discretion occurs if the judge fails to apply the proper legal standard or to follow proper procedures in making the determination, or bases an award [or a denial] upon findings of fact that are clearly erroneous.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d 1293, 1298 (11th Cir.1999) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">The Hyde Amendment provides in relevant part that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b249-11\">[d]uring fiscal year 1998 and in any fiscal year thereafter, the court, in any criminal case (other than a case in which the defendant is represented by assigned counsel paid for by the public) pending on or after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 26, 1997], may award to a prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney\u2019s fee and other litigation expenses, where the court finds that the position of the United States was vexatious, frivolous, or in bad faith, unless the court finds that special circumstances make such an award unjust. Such awards shall be granted pursuant to the procedures and limitations (but not the burden of proof) provided for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>award under section 2412 of title 28, United States Code.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-5\"><em>See </em>Pub.L. No. 105-119, 111 Stat. 2440, 2519 (1997) (reprinted in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3006A, historical and statutory notes). \u201c \u201cVexatious\u2019 means \u2018without reasonable or probable cause or excuse.\u2019\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>198 F.3d at 1299. \u201cA \u2018frivolous action\u2019 is one that is \u201c[g]roundless ... with little prospect of success; often brought to embarrass or annoy the defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFinally, \u2018bad faith\u2019 \u2018is not simply bad judgment or negligence, but rather it implies the conscious doing of a wrong because of dishonest purpose or moral obliquity; ... it contemplates a state of mind affirmatively operating with furtive design or hi will.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">As discussed above, because the Government\u2019s position with regard to the Rule 36 matter was substantially justified, Pease has not shown that it was vexatious, frivolous, or pursued in bad faith. Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Pease an award of attorney\u2019s fees and costs under the Hyde Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">V. Daphne Drive property</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">The subject matter jurisdiction of the district court is a question of law and, therefore, subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>United States v. Perez, </em>956 F.2d 1098, 1101 (11th Cir.1992). Article III of the Constitution limits the \u201cjudicial power\u201d of the United States to the resolution of \u201ccases\u201d and \u201ccontroversies.\u201d <em>Valley Forge Christian College, </em>454 U.S. at 471, 102 S.Ct. at 757. (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-9\">Under the law of the case doctrine, a legal decision made at one stage of the litigation, unchallenged in a subsequent appeal when the opportunity existed, becomes the law of the case for future stages of the same litigation, and the parties are deemed to have waived the right to challenge that decision at a later time. <em>See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </em>110 F.3d 1556, 1560 (11th Cir.1997); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.App.P 4(a)(1)(B)(when United States is a party, notice of appeal must be filled within 60 days).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-11\">The record reveals that the Government abandoned its intent to forfeiture the Daphne Drive property. Although Reedy filed a notice of appeal from the district court\u2019s June 6, 2000 order, she did not challenge the district court\u2019s resolution regarding the Daphne Drive property. Accordingly, Reedy waived that issue and her attempt to appeal it is untimely. Moreover, because the Government did not seize the Daphne Drive property and withdrew any claim to it, the title dispute over the property became a private matter between Reedy and other parties involved. The requirement of a case or controversy is not satisfied under these circumstances; hence, we lack jurisdiction to review Reedy\u2019s claim regarding the Daphne Drive property.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b246-18\">.
