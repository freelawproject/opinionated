(\u201cNational Union\u201d) filed this diversity suit against defendants-appellees Allfirst Bank and SunTrust Bank,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> alleging state-law claims arising from the banks\u2019 acceptance for deposit of checks issued by National Union\u2019s subrogor. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on all claims, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">This action arises from a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by a former employee of the accounts payable department of Kaiser Foundation Health Plan of the Mid-Atlantic States (\u201cKaiser\u201d). By submitting fraudulent invoices for services never rendered, the employee induced Kaiser to pay out fifteen checks for large sums to three payees \u2014 \u201cNot Just Computers,\u201d \u2018Tates Technology, Inc.,\u201d and \u201cMoffat Sales Corp.\u201d J.A. 323-24. The defendant banks accepted these checks for deposit into accounts in the names of the three payees. J.A. 323-24. Upon discovery of the fraudulent scheme in August 2000, Kaiser brought two Maryland state court actions against the three payees and obtained judgments against them in the full amount of the issued checks. J.A. 325, 342. Kaiser also filed a claim with its insurer, National Union, which fully compensated Kaiser for its losses from the fraudulent scheme. National Union subsequently filed this subrogation action in the district court, bringing claims against the banks for statutory negligence in violation of sections 3-404, 3-405, and 3-406 of the Maryland Commercial Code; for \u201cmoney had and received\u201d under Maryland common law; for conversion; and for breach of restrictive indorsement. J.A. 292-303. The district court granted summary judgment for the defendants on all claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-14\">In granting summary judgment for the defendants, the district court held <em>inter alia </em>that National Union was judicially estopped from alleging that the three payees were \u201cfictitious entities\u201d under section 3-404(b) of the Maryland Commercial Code. Because judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that falls within the district court\u2019s discretion, we review the district court\u2019s decision to apply judicial estoppel for abuse of discretion. <em>King v. Herbert J. Thomas Mem. Hosp., </em>159 F.3d 192, 196, 198 (4th Cir.1998) (\u201cAs an equitable doctrine, judicial estoppel is invoked in the discretion of the district court.... [W]e conclude that the district court was well within its discretion in applying judicial estoppel----\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b554-15\">In support of its statutory negligence claims under section 3^104(b), National Union contends that the three payees of the Kaiser checks were \u201cfictitious persons.\u201d <em>See </em>Md.Code, Com. Law I, \u00a7 3-404(b)(ii) (allowing for recovery in cases <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"531\">*531</page-number>where \u201cthe person identified as payee of an instrument is a fictitious person\u201d). The district court held that National Union is judicially estopped from asserting this theory, because its subrogor Kaiser affirmatively pled in the two state court actions that the three payees were real entities and secured judgments against them thereby. J.A. 340-46.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">We hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in applying judicial estoppel to prevent National Union from arguing that the three payees were fictitious persons. The doctrine of judicial estoppel has three necessary elements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b555-6\">(1) The party to be estopped must be asserting a position that is factually incompatible with a position taken in a prior judicial or administrative proceeding; (2) the prior inconsistent position must have been accepted by the tribunal; and (3) the party to be estopped must have taken inconsistent positions intentionally for the purpose of gaining unfair advantage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b555-7\"><em>King, </em>159 F.3d at 196. But \u201cjudicial estoppel will not be applied where the party\u2019s inconsistent positions resulted from inadvertence or mistake.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, it is evident that the position taken by Kaiser in the two state court actions \u2014 namely that the three payees were real entities amenable to judicial process and judgment \u2014 is \u201cfactually incompatible\u201d with National Union\u2019s current claim that the three payees were \u201cfictitious persons.\u201d And the state courts accepted the prior inconsistent position, because they rendered judgments against all three payees. <em>See </em>J.A. 305, 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion in determining that National Union is now taking the subsequent inconsistent position \u201cintentionally for the purpose of gaining unfair advantage,\u201d rather than as a result of \u201cinadvertence or mistake.\u201d As the district court noted, Kaiser consistently alleged that the payees were real entities in the state court, after significant investigation and across multiple amendments to the complaints. <em>See </em>J.A. 343-35 (\u201c[N]one of these judgments were ... the inadvertent result of Kaiser\u2019s hasty assumptions formed only days after discovering the fraud. They came as a result of a deliberate and lengthy course of conduct in litigation.\u201d). In addition, the record shows that Kaiser\u2019s investigation uncovered evidence of the real existence of all three payees. <em>See </em>J.A. 343 (Kaiser\u2019s investigation concluded that Not Just Computers was a real computer business owned and operated in the District of Columbia); J.A. 339 (National Union acknowledged that Yates Technology, Inc. is an entity validly incorporated in the Bahamas); J.A. 389 (Kaiser alleged that \u201cMoffat Sales is doing business at 1207 Nova Avenue, Suite 1, Capital Heights, Maryland\u201d). Moreover, as subrogee of Kaiser, National Union holds enforceable judgments against all three payees in the full amount of the Kaiser checks, raising the possibility of double recovery on inconsistent factual theories, which renders judicial estoppel particularly appropriate. <em>See King, </em>159 F.3d at 198 (\u201cTo allow King to obtain benefits from two sources based on two incompatible positions, simply because the positions aid her claims for remuneration, would reduce truth to a mere financial convenience and would undermine the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-10\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-11\">In regard to National Union\u2019s other arguments in favor of its claims under sections 3-404 and 3-405, as well as its other claims based on section 3-406, on \u201cmoney had and received,\u201d on common law conversion, and on breach of restrictive indorsement, we have reviewed the record thoroughly and found no reversible error. As <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"532\">*532</page-number>to these claims, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">For the reasons stated herein, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AUb\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b554-11\"> Two other defendant banks were dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b556-6\">SHEDD, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aqn\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"ANz\">Although I agree with the majority that summary judgment was proper on all of National Union\u2019s claims, I follow a different rationale on the fictitious payee claim under Md.Code Ann, Com. Law \u00a7 3^04. While the majority bases its affirmance as to this claim on judicial estoppel, I would affirm because National Union has failed to present any evidence that the three corporations at issue were fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">Judicial estoppel is an equitable doctrine that must be applied with caution, <em>John S. Clark Co. v. Faggert &amp; Frieden, P.C., </em>65 F.3d 26, 29 (4th Cir.1995), and should be reserved for those cases where it is necessary to \u201cprotect the essential integrity of the judicial process,\u201d <em>Allen v. Zurich Ins. Co., </em>667 F.2d 1162, 1166 (4th Cir.1982). Although the state court entered default judgments against the three corporations (and others), that court did not necessarily accept the allegations by National Union\u2019s predecessor concerning the named defendants\u2019 corporate status (or lack of status).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Whether the alleged corporations actually existed was not litigated or essential to the state court\u2019s judgment. <em>See id. </em>at 1167 (stating that \u201cthe earlier assertion of a legally irrelevant, albeit inconsistent, position should seldom, if ever, lead to the application of judicial estoppel\u201d). Accordingly, I am not convinced that the district court acted within its discretion in applying the equitable doctrine in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-11\">I agree, however, that summary judgment should be affirmed, because National Union has failed to present evidence that the three corporations were fictitious, <em>i.e., </em>that the corporations did not actually exist. Although there is substantial evidence that the corporations were used as part of an intricate plot to defraud, there is no evidence in our record showing that the corporations did not exist.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b556-8\">. It is apparent from the state court records that it was immaterial to that court whether the named defendants actually existed. For example, National Union\u2019s predecessor alleged that Just Computers is \"not a corporation, and may be a trade name or alter ego for Not Just Computers.\u201d J.A. 400. Even though Just Computers was not alleged to have any recognizable status, the state court nevertheless entered default judgment against the nonentity Just Computers.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b556-9\">. Of the three corporations, whether there is evidence that Moffat Sales Corp. (\"MSC\u201d) was a fictitious payee requires the closest review of the record. The Articles of Incorporation for MSC indicate that it is a District of Columbia corporation. In its brief, National Union represents that the District of Columbia has no record of MSC\u2019s existence. Although this representation suggests that the Articles of Incorporation are not legitimate and that MSC does not exist, National Union has failed to present any evidence to support its representation, even though it appears that the District of Columbia would provide such verification if requested. <em>See </em>J.A. 353 (D.C. Certification dated Feb. 12, 2003, verifying that D.C. received and accepted the Articles of Incorporation for Not Just Computers, Inc. in 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
