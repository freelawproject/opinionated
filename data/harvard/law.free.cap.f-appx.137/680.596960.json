Johnson, a Texas resident, challenges the district court\u2019s denial of his application to proceed in forma pauperis (\u201cIFP\u201d) on appeal following the district court\u2019s dismissal of his civil complaint as frivolous. Johnson is effectively challenging the district court\u2019s certification that he should not be granted IFP status because his appeal is not taken in good faith. <em>See Baugh v. Taylor, </em>117 F.3d 197, 202 (5th Cir.1997); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(a)(3); Fed. R.App. P. 24(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b704-25\">Johnson\u2019s action concerns the alleged 1996 implantation of a transmitter in his scalp by the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d). He has alleged that the DEA has thus caused him to be: \u201caggressively sought after for purposes of sexual reasons by many famous individuals\u201d; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>made a \u201claughing st[oe]k to[ ] members of Organized Crime Families[] and Cripps/ Bloods Gang members\u201d; known by 70 percent of the United States\u2019s population; subjected to \u201cextremely high numbers of sexual assaults\u201d by a \u201cvigilante mob\u201d; and exploited by \u201cwealthy persons\u201d from Europe and Asia who have sought to \u201cclone [his] spiritual persona\u201d and \u201cremov[e] [his] Reproductive Fluids.\u201d The district court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that such allegations were factually frivolous; the allegations are indeed \u201cfanciful,\u201d \u201cfantastic,\u201d and \u201cdelusional.\u201d <em>See Taylor v. Johnson, </em>257 F.3d 470, 472 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Hicks v. Garner, </em>69 F.3d 22, 25 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Because Johnson has failed to show that his complaint presented nonfrivolous issues for appeal, we uphold the district court\u2019s order certifying that the appeal is not taken in good faith. Johnson\u2019s request for IFP status is DENIED, and his appeal is DISMISSED as frivolous. See <em>Baugh, </em>117 F.3d at 202 &amp; n. 24; 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Johnson is warned that future frivolous filings will subject him to sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">IFP DENIED; APPEAL DISMISSED AS FRIVOLOUS; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b704-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
