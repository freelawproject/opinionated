Rule 35(a). On appeal, he argues that the district court erred in finding that his Rule 35(a) motion had to be filed within seven days after the imposition of his sentence. He argues in his initial brief that because he was sentenced under the federal sentencing guidelines, he can challenge the illegality of the sentence under Rule 35(a), pursuant to <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Harrell also argues in his Reply brief that under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the district court should have granted relief pursuant to <em>Blakely </em>and <em>Booker. </em>Harrell also asserts that because all of his co-defendants entered into plea agreements before he proceeded to the retrial, the conspiracy count could no longer exist, since he was the only person named and charged in the redacted indictment. Accordingly, the sentence violated his due process rights because the government never proved the existence of the conspiracy. Harrell also argues that his sentence exceeded the 20 years statutory maximum because in addition to 235 months\u2019 of imprisonment the district court imposed three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-12\">Whether a district court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>or plenary review. <em>See United States v. Martinez, </em>241 F.3d 1329, 1330 (11th Cir.2001)(court\u2019s determination that it did not have equitable jurisdiction is reviewed <em>de </em>novo); <em>see United States v. Sjeklocha, </em>114 F.3d 1085, 1087, (11th Cir.1997)(whether the district court had the authority to re-sentence the defendant under former Rule 35(a) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is a legal question subject to plenary review).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-13\">The 1987 version of the Rule 35(a) provided that \u201cthe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time and may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner within the time provided herein for the reduction of sentence.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a)(1987). The \u201ctime provided herein for the reduction of sentence\u201d referred to the timing requirements in Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b), which allowed a sentence reduction \u201cwithin 120 days after the sentence is imposed or probation is revoked, or within 120 days after receipt by the court of a mandate issued upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of the appeal, or within 120 days after entry of any order or judgment of the Supreme Court denying review of, or having the effect of upholding, a judgment or conviction or probation revocation.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P.35(b)(1987). Rule 35(a), as amended on November 1, 1987, permitted correction of a sentence upon remand from the court of appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b294-14\">(a) Correction of a Sentence on Remand. The court shall correct a sentence that is determined on appeal under 18 U.S.C. 3742 to have been imposed in violation of law, to have been imposed as a result of an incorrect application of the sentencing guidelines, or to be unreasonable, upon remand of the ease to the court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>Fed.R.Crim.P.35(a)(2002). As of December 1, 2002, Rule 35(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> provides that \u201cwithin 7 days after sentencing, the court may correct a sentence that resulted from arithmetical, technical, or other clear error.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(a)(2005). The 7-day requirement in the current version of Rule 35(a) is jurisdictional. <em>United States v. Diaz-Clark, </em>292 F.3d 1310, 1317 (11th Cir.2002)(discussing former Rule 35(c), which became new Rule 35(a) on December 1, 2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">The record reveals that Harrell was charged with crimes that he committed between 1991 and 1996. Accordingly, the pre-November 1, 1987, version of Rule 35(a) is inapplicable to Harrell\u2019s situation. Furthermore, the version of the Rule 35(a) that was in effect at the time Harrell was convicted has no application either, because his sentence was not remanded from the court of appeals. Under the circumstances of this case, current Rule 35(a) applies but provides no relief to Harrell, because his motion was filed years after the seven-day period had expired, and therefore, was untimely. Accordingly, <em>the </em>district court lacked jurisdiction to correct Harrell\u2019s sentence, and this we need not address Harrell\u2019s claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Even if the district court had construed Harrell\u2019s motion as a motion for relief under \u00a7 2255, there was no relief available to Harrell because he had already filed a \u00a7 2255 motion, and there was no indication in the record that he had obtained our authorization to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">Based on the foregoing, the district court did not err by denying Harrell\u2019s Rule 35(a) motion. As such, it is not necessary to analyze the merits of Harrell\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">Accordingly, upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b295-7\">. The seven day limitation was contained in former Rule 35(c). <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(c)(2002), and 2002 Advisory Committee Notes to current Rule 35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b295-8\">. In any event, we have held that the Supreme Court has not made <em>Blakely </em>retroactively applicable on collateral review. <em>See In re Dean, </em>375 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2004). We have also held that because the Supreme Court has not made <em>Booker </em>retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review, an application to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 petition based on <em>Booker </em>does not meet the statutory criteria. <em>In re Anderson, </em>396 F.3d 1336, 1340 (11th Cir.2005). For these reasons, and because Harrell\u2019s motion to supplement his initial brief to discuss <em>Booker </em>was rendered unnecessary by Harrell\u2019s subsequently filed reply brief which did address <em>Booker, </em>Harrell\u2019s motion to supplement is denied as moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
