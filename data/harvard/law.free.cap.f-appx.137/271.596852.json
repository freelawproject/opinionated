Cledanor admitted that he had a prior conviction, that he had been deported, and that he did not have permission to re-enter the United States. In calculating the sentence, the district court imposed an enhancement based on Cledanor\u2019s prior drug-trafficking conviction and sentenced Cledanor to twenty-four months imprisonment and two years supervised release. Cledanor appealed, asserting that (1) his sentence was unconstitutional under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), and (2) that the enhancement was improper. After we affirmed the sentence, the U.S. Supreme Court granted certiorari, vacating and remanding the decision in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b296-25\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court applied the <em>Blakely </em>decision to the Federal Sentencing Guidelines, holding that the mandatory nature of the federal guidelines rendered them incompatible with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee to the right to a jury trial. 125 S.Ct. at 749-52. The Court explicitly reaffirmed its rationale that \u201c[a]ny fact (other than a prior conviction) which is necessary to support a sentence exceeding the maximum authorized by the facts established by a plea of guilty or a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>jury verdict must be admitted by the defendant or proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 756.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">Cledanor did not raise a <em>Booker </em>challenge to his sentence before the district court; therefore, we review for plain error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1301, 1306 (11th Cir.), <em>petition for cert. pending, </em>No. 04-1148 (Feb. 23, 2005). \u201cPlain error occurs where (1) there is an error; (2) that is plain or obvious; (3) affecting the defendant\u2019s substantial rights in that it was prejudicial and not harmless; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">Cledanor\u2019s enhancement was based on a prior conviction. Even after <em>Booker, </em>such an enhancement does not violate the Sixth Amendment. <em>See United States v. Orduno-Mireles, </em>405 F.3d 960, 962-63 (11th Cir.2005); <em>Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d at 1290. Thus, there is no constitutional error in Cledanor\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">We have, however, recognized that a statutory <em>Booker </em>error may result from the mandatory application of the guidelines, absent any enhancement. As this court has explained, although a statutory <em>Booker </em>error may meet the first two prongs of the plain error test, to meet the third prong, Cledanor must show that his sentence would have been different but for the mandatory application of the guidelines. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005); <em>see also United States v. Martinez, </em>407 F.3d 1170 (11th Cir.2005) (holding, under plain error review, that the mandatory application of the sentencing guidelines affected Martinez\u2019s substantial rights because the court indicated its frustration with the severity of the guideline sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-12\">Here, Cledanor has met that burden. The district court expressed its concern over the sentence required under the guidelines, stating that \u201cI see your argument, I would like to go with the argument, I think that in the scales that the clear language is that I must follow 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), and I regretfully overrule the objection.\u201d The court further stated that it was \u201cvery sorry to impose the sentence,\u201d and that it would impose the \u201clowest sentence possible.\u201d Thus, under <em>Shelton, </em>this statutory error warrants remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-13\">Accordingly, we VACATE and REMAND for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b297-8\">. Cledanor raised several challenges to his sentence, but we need not revisit those issues here, as they are unchanged by the <em>Booker </em>decision. <em>See United States v. Camacho-Ibarquen, </em>404 F.3d 1283 (11th Cir.2005) (rejecting similar challenges).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
