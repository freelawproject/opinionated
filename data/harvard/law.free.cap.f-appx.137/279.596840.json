O\u2019Neal also claims that his trial counsel was ineffective. After review, we vacate O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, and we dismiss without prejudice O\u2019Neal\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A3P\">A. Plea Colloquy</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">Pursuant to a written plea agreement, O\u2019Neal pled guilty to distributing 5 grams or more of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> During the plea colloquy, the government set forth the following facts, which O\u2019Neal admitted as true. On February 28, 2001, state and federal law enforcement officers met with an informant after searching the informant and his vehicle for drugs and money and finding none. The law enforcement officers then provided the informant with $500, a transmitter, and a recording device. The informant placed a call to defendant O\u2019Neal to arrange for the purchase of crack cocaine. The informant and O\u2019Neal arranged to meet at a residence in Dublin, Georgia, to consummate the sale. The informant was then surveilled as he went to the residence and met with O\u2019Neal. The informant paid O\u2019Neal $400 in exchange for 11 grams of crack.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-18\">B. PSI</p>\n<p id=\"b304-19\">The PSI indicated that O\u2019Neal was responsible for 161.9 grams of crack. This 161.9 gram amount included: (1) the 11 grams of crack O\u2019Neal admitted to selling during the plea colloquy; (2) the crack amounts in four other drug transactions; and (3) the crack in an automobile O\u2019Neal was driving. Specifically, according to the PSI, O\u2019Neal was involved in the following four other drug transactions and a separate traffic stop at which drugs were seized: (1) 25.2 grams of crack O\u2019Neal sold to an informant on January 12, 2001; (2) 24.2 grams of crack O\u2019Neal sold to an informant on March 6, 2001; (3) 11.3 grams of crack O\u2019Neal sold to an informant on April 4, 2001; (4) 51.5 grams of crack, which informants purchased from O\u2019Neal and Sterling Jackson on December 12, 2001; and (5) 38.7 grams of crack seized from an automobile O\u2019Neal was driving on August 5, 2001. In addition to the 38.7 grams of crack, law enforcement officers also seized a firearm from O\u2019Neal\u2019s automobile on August 5, 2001.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b304-21\">The PSI recommended a base offense level of 34, based on the drug quantity of 161.9 grams of crack. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(3) (drug offenses involving at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>least 150 grams but less than 500 grams of crack have a base offense level of 34). The PSI also recommended a two-level increase, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), because O\u2019Neal possessed a firearm on August 5, 2001. Thus, O\u2019Neal\u2019s total offense level was 36. With a criminal history category of II, O\u2019Neal\u2019s Guidelines range was 210-262 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">O\u2019Neal objected to the PSI on several grounds. First, O\u2019Neal objected to the drug quantity set forth in the PSI. Specifically, O\u2019Neal asserted that he should be attributed with only 49.7 grams of crack, the sum of the crack involved in the February 28 sale and the August 5 traffic stop. Thus, O\u2019Neal disputed that he sold crack on January 12, March 6, April 4, and December 12. Second, O\u2019Neal objected to the two-level enhancement for possession of a firearm. Third, O\u2019Neal objected to the PSI\u2019s failure to recommend a reduction for acceptance of responsibility pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. According to O\u2019Neal, his offense level should have been 27, yielding a Guidelines range of 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">C. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">During the sentencing hearing, the government offered witnesses in support of the drug quantity enhancement, and O\u2019Neal testified regarding the firearm enhancement. Specifically, as to drug quantity, the government offered witnesses who testified that O\u2019Neal was involved in the January 12, March 6, April 4, and December 12 crack sales. After the testimony, O\u2019Neal withdrew his factual objections regarding those sales. However, he reserved his right to object to the drug quantity enhancement based on <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004). Specifically, O\u2019Neal\u2019s attorney stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-8\">In light of the testimony from the witnesses today [defendant O\u2019Neal] wants to withdraw his objection to those particular factual situations. I have spoken with [the prosecutor] about this because I didn\u2019t want Mr. O\u2019Neal to lose his acceptance credit.... We would like to reserve his right to object to the relevant conduct being used to enhance his sentence as being unconstitutional, but in terms of any factual objection he would like to withdraw that objection.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">The district court then specifically asked O\u2019Neal if he wished to withdraw the factual objection to the drug quantity, to which O\u2019Neal responded: \u201cI want to withdraw the objection.\u201d The district court overruled O\u2019Neal\u2019s <em>Blakely </em>objection to the drug quantity, noting that pursuant to this Court\u2019s precedent, <em>Blakely </em>did not apply to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">O\u2019Neal then testified with respect to the firearm enhancement. Specifically, O\u2019Neal admitted that on August 5, 2001, he had crack and a firearm in his automobile. He testified, however, that he had purchased the firearm for his mother so that she could protect herself, and that the firearm was not related to the crack. The district court overruled O\u2019Neal\u2019s objection to the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) firearm enhancement, stating that \u201cI find it more probable than not that [the firearm] was connected. It may well be that the reason his mother needed the protection she did was due to [O\u2019Neal\u2019s] own drug activity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">In sentencing O\u2019Neal, the district court awarded O\u2019Neal a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. The district court calculated O\u2019Neal\u2019s total offense level at 33 and his Guidelines range at 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment. The district court sentenced O\u2019Neal to 151 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by a 5-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">O\u2019Neal timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A6nS\">A. Firearm Enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">On appeal, O\u2019Neal asserts that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence by two-levels because he possessed a firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). He admits that he did have crack and a firearm in his car when law enforcement officers pulled him over for not wearing a seatbelt. However, he asserts that: (1) the testimony that he bought the gun for his mother for her protection; and (2) the fact that no firearms were present during the other drug deals he was indicted for, were enough to establish that it was clearly improbable that the firearm was connected to the drug offense.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">Under the Guidelines, a defendant receives a two-level enhancement if he possessed a firearm. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l). The commentary to \u00a7 2D1.1 states that the adjustment should be applied if the firearm was present, \u201cunless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l), cmt. n. 3. \u201cOnce the government shows that a firearm was present, \u2018the evidentiary burden shifts to the defendant to show that a connection between the firearm and the offense is clearly improbable.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Fields, </em>408 F.3d 1356, 1358 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Hall, </em>46 F.3d 62, 63 (11th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">Here, the government clearly met its burden to show that O\u2019Neal possessed the firearm because O\u2019Neal admitted that he did. Thus, the burden shifted to O\u2019Neal to show that a connection between the firearm and the crack in the automobile was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d At sentencing, the district court actually found just the opposite: that a connection between the firearm and crack was \u201cmore probable than not.\u201d Given the connection was \u201cmore probable than not,\u201d inherent in the district court\u2019s statement is a finding that O\u2019Neal did not meet his burden to show a connection was \u201cclearly improbable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">We also conclude that the district court did not clearly err in its finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> O\u2019Neal stated that he had both the crack and the firearm in his car. Although he claimed that he had just bought it for his mother for her protection, O\u2019Neal failed to provide any other evidence to support his self-serving claim, such as testimony from his mother verifying that she needed a gun to protect herself, or that she had asked him to purchase the firearm for her protection. Absent such evidence, there is nothing to suggest that O\u2019Neal\u2019s statement that he planned to give the firearm to his mother is anything other than self-serving and it does not render the district court\u2019s finding clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Moses, </em>289 F.3d 847, 851 (6th Cir.2002) (concluding that the defendant\u2019s \u201cself-serving testimony [was] inadequate to justify setting aside the district court\u2019s finding that [the defendant] failed to satisfy the \u2018clearly improbable\u2019 standard\u201d). Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>ingly, the district court did not clearly err in its finding about the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">B. <em>Booker </em>Error</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">O\u2019Neal next argues that the district court erred under <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. -, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) when it enhanced his sentence based on facts that were not charged in the indictment and that he did not admit. Specifically, O\u2019Neal claims that the district court erred under <em>Booker </em>by determining that he was responsible for 161.9 grams of crack and in finding a connection between the crack and the firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-9\">In <em>Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that <em>Blakely </em>applied to the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1297-98 (11th Cir.2005). Under <em>Booker, </em>\u201cthere are two types of sentencing errors: one is constitutional and the other is statutory.\u201d <em>United States v. Dacus, </em>408 F.3d 686, 687 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]he Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury is violated where under a mandatory guidelines system a sentence is increased because of an enhancement based on facts found by the judge that were neither admitted by the defendant nor found by the jury.\u201d <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1297. The statutory error occurs when the district court sentences a defendant \u201cunder a mandatory Guidelines scheme, even in the absence of a Sixth Amendment enhancement violation.\u201d <em>United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-10\">In this case, we conclude that there is no Sixth Amendment violation as to the drug quantity enhancement, but that there is a Sixth Amendment violation as to the firearm enhancement. As to drug quantity, the PSI held O\u2019Neal responsible for 161.9 grams of crack. Of that amount, O\u2019Neal admitted in his plea colloquy that he sold 11 grams of crack to an informant on February 28, 2001. Further, O\u2019Neal failed to object to the 38.7 grams of crack found in his car on August 5, 2001. Finally, during sentencing O\u2019Neal waived all of his factual objections to the drug quantity in the PSI, which included the remaining quantities of crack: 25.2 grams, 24.2 grams, 11.3 grams, and 51.5 grams (for a sum total of 161.9 grams of crack). Thus, O\u2019Neal admitted to being responsible for 161.9 grams of crack, and there is no Sixth Amendment violation. <em>See United States v. Burge, </em>407 F.3d 1183, 1191 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201cBurge waived his objections to the factual statements about his relevant conduct in the presentence report and, therefore, admitted the facts in that report.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1330 (11th Cir.2005) (concluding that because defendant raised no objections to the factual statements in the PSI and stated that he did not dispute matters in the PSI, the defendant admitted to the facts in the PSI and there was no Sixth Amendment violation).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-12\">As to the two-level firearm enhancement, O\u2019Neal also admitted that he had both crack and a firearm in his car. However, as outlined above, O\u2019Neal never admitted that a connection existed between the firearm and the crack. The district court made that fact-finding. Although we affirm that fact-finding, O\u2019Neal\u2019s Sixth Amendment rights were violated because O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence was enhanced, under a mandatory Guidelines system, based on facts neither found by a jury nor admitted by O\u2019Neal. The Sixth Amendment violation stemmed not from the district court\u2019s extra-verdict enhancements, but from the district court\u2019s use of those extra-verdict enhancements in sentencing O\u2019Neal in a mandatory Guidelines scheme. <em>Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d at 1301.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"284\">*284</page-number>O\u2019Neal properly preserved his <em>Booker </em>claim in the district court by objecting based on <em>Blakely. </em>When there is a timely objection in the district court, we review the defendant\u2019s <em>Booker </em>claim <em>de novo </em>and determine whether the error is harmless. <em>See United States v. Paz, </em>405 F.3d 946, 948 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">After reviewing the record, we conclude that the government has failed to meet its burden to show that the <em>Booker </em>constitutional error was harmless. <em>See Paz, </em>405 F.3d at 948-49.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In <em>Paz, </em>which was a Soofcer-constitutional-error case, we explained that harmless error analysis puts the burden on the government to show \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the sentence obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 948. Thus, the government must show beyond a reasonable doubt that the mandatory, as opposed to the advisory, application of the guidelines did not contribute to the defendant\u2019s sentence. <em>See United States v. Davis, </em>407 F.3d 1269, 1270 (11th Cir.2005). In the record in this case, there is no evidence indicating what effect, if any, changing from a mandatory to an advisory approach would have had on the district court\u2019s sentencing decision. Accordingly, \u201c[w]e simply do not know what the sentencing court would have done had it understood the guidelines to be advisory rather than mandatory, and had properly considered the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271. \u201cTherefore, the Government cannot meet its burden of showing that the mandatory application of the guidelines in violation of [O\u2019Neal\u2019s] Sixth Amendment right was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">Thus, we vacate O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing. We note that the district court correctly calculated O\u2019Neal\u2019s Guidelines range of 151 to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1177 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts must consult the Guidelines and \u201c[t]his consultation requirement, at a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines\u201d). Accordingly, on remand, the district court is required to sentence O\u2019Neal under an advisory Guidelines regime, and shall consider the Guidelines range of 151-188 months\u2019 imprisonment and \u201cother statutory concerns as well, see [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) (Supp. 2004).\u201d <em>Booker, </em>125 S.Ct. at 757.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b308-9\">C. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b308-10\">Finally, O\u2019Neal contends that his trial counsel was ineffective because (1) at sentencing, his trial attorney withdrew his objections to the relevant conduct used to enhance the amount of drugs attributed to him so that O\u2019Neal would not lose his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>credit for acceptance of responsibility, and (2) his attorney advised him to admit to conduct other than the 5 grams of cocaine base alleged in the indictment.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Generally, we do not consider ineffective assistance of counsel claims on direct appeal when \u201cthe district court did not consider the claim nor develop a factual record.\u201d <em>United States v. Bender, </em>290 F.3d 1279, 1284 (11th Cir.2002). In the present case, O\u2019Neal did not raise his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in the district court, nor did the district court conduct a review of such a claim. Although O\u2019Neal\u2019s attorney\u2019s objections to the PSI and the transcript of the sentencing hearing are available for review, these materials do not address any arguments or contain evidence relating to an ineffective assistance claim. Further, the government was never given the opportunity to respond to O\u2019Neal\u2019s claim. Because the record has not been sufficiently developed, we dismiss O\u2019N eal\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim without prejudice. <em>See Massaro v. United States, </em>538 U.S. 500, 509, 123 S.Ct. 1690, 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 714 (2003) (\u201cWe ... hold that failure to raise an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim on direct appeal does not bar the claim from being brought in a later, appropriate proceeding under \u00a7 2255.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate O\u2019Neal\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing, and we dismiss without prejudice O\u2019N eal\u2019s ineffeetive-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">DISMISSED IN PART; VACATED AND REMANDED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b304-12\">.
