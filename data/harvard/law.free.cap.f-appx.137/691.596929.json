The district court sentenced him to 46 months in prison and to three years of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Davis argues that the district court erred by assigning him a base offense level of 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4)(A), based oh his having a prior conviction of a \u201ccontrolled substance offense.\u201d He maintains that his 2000 Louisiana conviction of distribution of a substance falsely represented to be crack cocaine does not qualify as such a conviction because it involved an \u201cimitation\u201d substance rather than a \u201ccounterfeit substance.\u201d Offenses involving \u201ccounterfeit substances\u201d qualify as \u201ccontrolled substance offenses\u201d pursuant to the applicable definition in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(b), but \u201ccounterfeit\u201d is not defined by the Sentencing Guidelines. Davis concedes that his contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Crittenden, </em>372 F.3d 706, 708, 709 (5th Cir.2004), in which we adopted a broad dictionary definition of \u201ccounterfeit\u201d in determining the plain meaning of that term. He raises the argument to preserve it for possible further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b715-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
