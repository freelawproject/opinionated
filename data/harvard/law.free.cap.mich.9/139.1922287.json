That in May, a copy of the case now filed in this court was served on plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, and the same was settled by the Circuit Judge, June 14, 1860; that at the time of settling the case the plaintiffs\u2019 attorney appeared and objected to its settlement, for the reason that the defendant had, by lapse of time, waived his right to have a case settled; but the judge held that the time for the settlement of a case did not commence running until the service of a written notice of the entry of judgment; that plaintiffs\u2019 attorney thereupon informed the Circuit Judge and the attorneys for defendant, that they would take no part in the' settlement of the case, and the same was settled in the absence of plaintiffs\u2019 attorney, who offered no amendments.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b140-5\">Counsel referred to rules 80, 81 and 82 of the Circuit Courts, and claimed that the Circuit Judge in settling the case more than ten days after the party had had actual notice of the judgment, and without an extension of time for that purpose to the time of settlement, had acted entirely without jurisdiction.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b140-6\"><em>W. B. Webber </em>and <em>J. G. Sutherland, </em>contra,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A-I\">claimed that the view of the Circuit Judge with respect to notice was correct: \u2014 <em>Circuit Court Hule </em>6. They also claimed that the action of the Circuit Judge in a matter of practice like this was not subject to review. And further, that where the case on its face discloses no irregularity, but purports to have been properly settled, the contrary can not be shown by affidavit. And they referred to <em>Farrand v. </em>Bentley, 6 <em>Mich. </em>281; <em>Sweetzer v. </em>Mead, 5 <em>Mich. </em>33; <em>Scribner v. Gay, 5 Mich. </em>511.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b141-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>By the Court:</author>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">The defendant in this case had Ms election to rely upon Ms exceptions, or to make and settle a case; but when he had procured a bill of exceptions to be settled, and had filed the same, he had made that election, and was not entitled to settle a case afterwards.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">With respect to the other question, we ar\u00e9 of opinion, whether a party is entitled to a written notice of a judgment rendered in his presence or not, that when he has acted upon the knowledge of that judgment, as in this case, he is then too late to object the want of written notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Motion granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
