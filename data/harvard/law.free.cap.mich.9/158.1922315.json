Wood appealed to the Circuit Court, where the cause was tried without a jury, and the Circuit Judge found as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-6\">\u201cThat on or about the fifteenth day of May, 1858, the defendant was the owner and occupant of a farm in the town of Blackman, county of Jackson. That on the same day the ^plaintiff\u2019s cow and a number of other cattle came from the public highway, through a pair of bars which were down, and without the leave or license of defendant, into and were upon and in the field of the defendant, being a field of barley, then and there growing on said farm there situate, and while said cattle were so upon said land, the defendant, for the purpose of driving said cattle off his said land, set his dog. upon them, and the dog then and there chased said cattle, by means whereof the cow of the plaintiff was thrown by said dog and fell, breaking or otherwise injuring the shoulder of said plaintiff\u2019s said cow: that the plaintiff\u2019s cow was injured to the amount of twenty dollars.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-7\">\u201c The conclusion of law by the court is that the defendant is a trespasser, and liable to the plaintiff for the damages aforesaid.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b159-8\">Judgment being rendered for LaRue on this finding Wood brought error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b159-9\"><em>Blair &amp; </em>Gibson, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AG\">argued that the action should have been <em>case </em>instead of trespass; that the defendant was liable at all only on the ground of negligence, which must be alleged and proved: \u2014 2 <em>Comst. </em>515; 4 <em>Cow. </em>352; 13 <em>Johns. </em>339; 1 Denio, 495: and that as the cow was a trespasser on defendant\u2019s land, (2 <em>Mich. </em>260; 3 <em>Mich. </em>163), he is not liable unless designed or wanton and malicious mischief is shown : \u2014 1 <em>Cow. </em>78; 2 <em>Mich. </em>262; 4 Denio, 259; 7 <em>Met. </em>274; 10 <em>Met. </em>371; 17 <em>Johns. </em>99.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number><em>Johnson db Bigby, </em>for defendant in error:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b160-5\">The plaintiff was bound to know what his dog was capable of doing, and if he chased cattle with a dog capable of doing injury, he did so at his peril: \u2014 1 Freeman, 348; <em>Cro.

L. </em>\u00a7 628), prohibits an action for damages done by the coav, it has no other effect; and it leaves the defendant\u2019s rights, in the present action, as they would have stood at common law under like circumstances:\u2014 <em>Williams v. Mich. C. R. R. Co. </em>2 <em>Mich. </em>259.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-11\">The cow being wrongfully on the land, the defendant had a clear right to drive her off by any of the ordinary means to which a prudent man would naturally resort; and for this purpose, Ave think he had a right to set a dog upon her; unless there was something in the size, character or habits of the dog, or in the mode of setting him on or pursuing, which would negative the idea of ordinary care or prudence. And if he exercised this right in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>faith, and was not wanting in ordinary care and prudence, we think he could not justly be \u00a1j held responsible for the injury which might ensue. Such was expressly held by the Supreme Court of Vermont to be the law in <em>Clark v. Adams, </em>18 <em>Vt. </em>425, and again in <em>Davis v. Campbell, </em>23 <em>Vt. </em>236. In the first cited case, Royce J. says: \u201cI have met with no decided case or other authority, which has denied the right of a party, at common law, to use a dog in driving from his own grounds cattle of another, which were wrongfully there doing damage :\u201d and in favor of this right he cites: 1 <em>Comeyn\u2019s Dig, </em>411 <em>(citing </em>\u201cR. Lat, 199,\u201d <em>and Mullen v. Fandrye, stated by Aston J. </em>4 Burr. 2994, from Popham 161, which I think sustains the right). The finding of the court shows nothing of the size or character of the dog, nor of the mode of setting him on, nor any lack of ordinary prudence and caution on the part of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-4\">It is not necessary to decide what might have been the conclusion, if the finding of facts had shown that the dog had seized or wounded the cow, or thrown her by force; for, though the language of the finding appears, at first view, a little ambiguous, we are satisfied it does not fairly warrant this construction. The language is, \u201c and the dog then and there chased said cattle, <em>by means whereof </em>\u201d (as we understand the language, by means of <em>such </em>chasing)\u201d the cow of the plaintiff was thrown by said dog, and fell, breaking or otherwise injuring the shoulder of said plaintiff\u2019s said cow.\u201d This is not the language which would naturally be used, had the cow been seized by the dog and thrown by force.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">The facts stated in the finding do not warrant the conclusion of law, that the defendant was a trespasser. The judgment must therefore be reversed, and the plaintiff in error must recover his costs in this court and in the court below, as well as before the Justice.</p>\n<judges id=\"b161-6\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
