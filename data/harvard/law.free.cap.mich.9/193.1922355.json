In tho Recorder\u2019s Court the prisoner moved to quash the information, on the ground that the constable had no legal right to serve the warrant. This motion was denied, and the case went to trial, \u201cthe prisoner,\u201d as stated in the bill of exceptions, \u201cwith the consent of the court, having waived his right to a trial by jury, under \u00a733 of Chap. 6 of the city charter.\u201d The Recorder found him guilty.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b194-7\"><em>J. J. Speed, </em>for defendant:</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-8\">1. The powers and duties of constables in Detroit were defined by \u00a718 of the charter <em>(Laws of </em>1857, <em>p. </em>90) which provided, among other things, that \u201cthe director of the poor and constables shall have the power and perform the duties of township officers elected under the general laws of the State, subject to the provisions of this act.\u201d Further rights, powers, duties and liabilities might be prescribed by the Common Council: \u00a7 20.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b194-9\">The Constitution <em>(art. </em>XI) provides for not exceeding four constables in each township, \u201c whose powers and duties shall be prescribed by laAv.\u201d It was evidently the intention of the Constitution, that in the case of township officers, they should have no common laAv powers, but whore there was in existence a law defining their powers, it should continue until altered or repealed by the Legislature; and if they had any common law poAvers, they should have them no longer, unless it should be so declared by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>Legislature, inasmuch as such powers should he \u201c prescribed by law.\u201d If township constables have no common law powers, the constables elected under the charter had none, because they had only the powers of township constables.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-5\">By the statute, township constables were, among other things, empowered to serve process directed to them \u201cin any township in their county.\u201d They were also declared to be ministerial officers of justices of the <em>peace: </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>L. </em>\u00a7\u00a7574, 575, 576.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b195-6\">The statute under which the warrant was issued under which defendant was sought to be arrested, does not specify the particular officers by Avhom this process shall be served. It must be directed to some one authorized by law to serve it. Township constables, sheriffs, and in some cases coroners, are authorized to serve warrants by virtue of provisions in the same statute which authorizes their issue. Though the statute does not say to whom the warrant shall be directed, the conclusion is irresistable that <em>township </em>constables and sheriffs are the only persons to-whom it may be directed, unless some other officer should be empowered to serve it by virtue of his office. City constables were so empowered by \u00a7 18 above quoted, but in amending this section, March 12, 1861, all allusion to constables was omitted in the section as amended. The statute conferring powers upon city constables being thus repealed, it must be held that the Legislature intended those powers should no longer be exercised. At least, the Legislature making certain provisions relative to the constables which included and even gave greater power than they had at common law, the Legislature impliedly repealed the common law, having exhausted the subject: \u2014 10 <em>Pick </em>37; 12 Mass. 537, 535; <em>1 Pick. </em>43, 45; 1 <em>Ashm. </em>179; 3 <em>Binn. </em>595; 8 Port. 434; 14 <em>Mo. </em>147; 6 <em>N. H. </em>59. By a repeal of these provisions they took away all the power that had been conferred, and left the officers without any power, either statutory or common law: \u2014 3 <em>Cush. </em>150.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>2. The right to a trial by jury could not be waived; <em>Cancemi's case, 18 N. </em>Y. 128; 8 <em>Mich. </em>110.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-5\"><em>JD. J\u00a3. Sarbaugh, Prosecuting Attorney for Wayne County, </em>for the People.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b196-6\"><em>G. </em>FI <em>S. Lothrop, </em>on the same side :</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-7\">The office of constable is a very ancient one. And at the common law he was a conservator of the peace, and a ministerial officer of justices, coroners, &amp;c. And this office is probably found wherever the common law has gone in the United States. And his duties and functions remain substantially what they were at common law.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-8\">In Michigan, the office has certainly existed from an early period. Under the territorial and State organization he has been a conservator of the peace, and the ministerial officer of justices.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-9\">The question now arises, whether the constables in this city have power to execute process. It is not denied that the office legally exists, or that it is legally filled. But it is insisted that they have no power, because the last clause of Sec. 18 of Chap. 4 of the revised charter was repealed last winter. Is this so ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-10\">So far as townships are concerned, the office is a constitutional one. In this city the office is statutory. <em>Rev. Charter, chap. </em>2, \u00a71.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-11\">By the Compiled Laws, p. 241, constables are made the ministerial officers of justices, and are authorized to serve any process lawfully directed to them, in any township in the county.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-12\">It may be said that this relates <em>only </em>to <em>town </em>constables. I doubt whether it does, exclusively so. If it has that strict construction, can a town constable serve a process in his county except in \u201ctownships?\u201d Can a Springwells constable serve a process in the <em>city </em>of Detroit ?</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b196-13\">Waiving this, how does the case stand otherwise?</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>Let us see what duties aud powers are expressly conferred on constables by existing statutes.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-5\">I. Civil duties.</p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-6\">I. Justices\u2019 courts of civil jurisdiction, both in town and city, exist under a common constitutional and statutory authority;\u2014 <em>Const. Art. VI; Comp. </em>Laws, \u00a7\u00a7 3653 and 3670. Justices\u2019 writs of summons run to \u201cany constable of the county,\u201d \u00a7 3665. So of civil warrants, \u00a7 3673. And of civil attachments, \u00a73678. And writs of replevin, \u00a73696. And subpoenas and attachments for witnesses, \u00a7\u00a7 3744, 3746. So making jury lists and serving venires, \u00a7\u00a7 3757, 3759. So keeping charge of jury, \u00a73772. So of executions, \u00a73790, <em>et seq.: </em>and see further provisions, \u00a73824 to \u00a7 3831.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-7\">These leave no doubt that a constable is the ministerial officer of justices\u2019 courts, in the city as well as elsewhere, in civil cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-8\">II. Duties in criminal cases.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-9\">1. <em>All </em>justices may hold court for the trial of minor criminal <em>offenses; </em>\u2014 Comp. <em>Laws </em>\u00a7 3624.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-10\">The next section authorizes the justice to issue his warrant for the arrest of the accused, \u201c requiring the <em>officer to whom it is </em>directed,\u201d <em>Sec. </em>The statute does not in terms name to what officer it may be directed. But \u00a7 3931, authorizes the court to direct \u201c any constable of the county\u201d to make a jury list.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-11\">By \u00a7 3932, the venire may bo directed to any constable of the county. By \u00a73937, the jury may be put in charge of any constable. And by \u00a73943, the warrant to execute the sentence may run to any constable of the county. This can leave no doubt but constables are empowered to perform all ministerial duties of a justices\u2019 court held for criminal trials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-12\">2. The above examination has shown that constables may act in all cases as ministerial officers of justices sitting for criminal trials.</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b197-13\">The Police Justice of Detroit is merely a justice of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the peace, whose jurisdiction is limited to that of justices sitting for criminal: trials, and as examining magistrates. <em>Laws of </em>1850, <em>p. </em>364-5, \u00a72. Warrants of arrest, or executions issued by himself, or issued by a justice of the peace and returnable bofore Mm, are governed by the laws applicable to justices of the peace acting in like capacity. See \u00a7\u00a7 3 and 6.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-4\">3. In proceedings before examining magistrates.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-5\">The warrant of arrest may be issued to any constable, <em>Comp. L. </em>\u00a7 <em>5979. </em>The order of commitant may be to a constable, \u00a7 5986.</p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-6\">The result is, that for all the purposes for which a justice of the peace or the Police Justice may sit, constables are recognized as their ministerial officers, to whom all their lawful processes may be directed. And of course they may execute all such writs. In other words, they have all the usual rights and powers of such ministerial officers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-7\">In the case before the court, the warrant of arrest was on a charge which could be tried by the Police Justice. It was issued by a justice of the peace of the city of Detroit, returnable before the Police Justice. <em>Laws of </em>1850, <em>p. </em>365, \u00a7 3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b198-8\">And as Ij have shown that the constables are ministerial officers of justices in such cases, the warrant gave the constable lawful' authority to make the arrest.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b198-9\">Campbell J.:</author>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">This case' comes before us upon a bill of exceptions from the Recorder\u2019s Court of Detroit, before judgment. It appears that the prisoner was tried by the court without a jury, which he is said to have waived by consent of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">The first question demanding attention is, whether a trial can be had without a jury, in\" the Recorder\u2019s Court, of a criminal prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>The charter of Detroit recites that \u201c <em>In all trials upon indictments, the person or persons upon trial shall he tried by a jury, unless the right to a trial by jury he, with consent of the court, waived.\u201d Laws of 1851, p. </em>115, \u00a733. The prisoner was not tried upon an <em>indictment, </em>but upon a complaint or information under the charter. The view we , have taken ,pf the law renders it unnecessary to determine whether the language of this section can be applied to [trials under any form of complaint except an indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">The charter, of the city leaves all proceedings in the liecorder\u2019s Court, in the trial and punishment of criminal offenders against the general laws of the State, to be governed by the laws applicable in the Circuit Courts, which provide expressly that all issues of fact on indictment or Information shall be tried by jury. <em>Comp. L. p. </em>1592; <em>Laws of </em>1859, <em>p. </em>301. In those courts there is no provision recognizing the waiver of a trial by jury. The charter does not authorize it expressly, but, if at all, by Implication. It does not point out how it shall be signified\u2014 whether verbally or in writing; nor when it may be made, nor whether it may be revoked. Neither dees it point out how the consent of the court is to be manifested of record, as it must be of necessity in order to make the record perfect if assailed on error. The law also makes no provision for the <em>finding </em>of the court for \u2022or against the prisoner, nor when or how judgment shall be rendered upon it. Nor is there any statute by which any rulings of law can be reached, unless they arise upon the admissibility of testimony, and upon this there would be very great difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">If the common law provided for such cases, the question might perhaps be reduced to one of power in the Legislature; first, to permit a waiver, of j a jury at all; and second, to permit it in one court, leaving all the \u25a0other courts of the State to be governed by a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>forbiding it. But we can not find any common law practice by which these deficiencies can be rectified. The consequences would be too serious to allow us to assume that, by the silence of the Legislature, the court was to be allowed to take any conree which might appear proper. This could not be permitted in such cases under any known rule of construction. And even if it could, there are so many cases expressly provided for by statute which could not be affected by such implication, among which may be mentioned findings on cases of insanity, that the adoption of even such a broad rule would not remove many serious difficulties. We must, therefore, conclude that, until the Legislature go further and provide some machinery for the trial and review of criminal causes in courts of record without a jury, the clause of the charter referred to must remain inoperative to change the general law. We are of opinion that the Recorder had no power to try the case without a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">As wo are informed that the question of the authority of constables in the city of Detroit, is one which is giving occasion to a good deal of litigation, and requires settlement in order to insure the due administration of justice, and will also arise upon the trial of this cause, wo have with some reluctance determined to decide it, <em>although </em>the case is fully disposed of at this hearing without it. Wo have been aided by a very able and exhaustive argument, and are entirely satisfied upon it. While there are doubtless some common law incidents of the office of constable not attached to it here, where it is to a great extent regulated by statute, yet -we are of opinion that constables in Detroit, independent of the repealed section of the charter, possess the same general powers belonging to the office in towns: the charter, so far as it applies, being only designed to affect some local powers. It is impossible to give full effect to the jurisdiction of justices of the peace in <em>the </em>city unless this construction- is given to the statutes. It <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>is very generally true that, when a statute provides for an officer by a known legal name, and with settled legal powers, the presumption of legal identity must prevail, unless repelled by strong circumstances. There is nothing in the legislation before us which indicates any repugnance. It could only be inferred by regarding the original section of the charter amended as the source of all the power of constables to serve process in cases like that before us. We do not think this presumption can fairly arise in view of the great body of statutes regulating the ministerial duties of these officers, which are strictly in accordance with the principles 'of tho common law, and would, probably, in the entire absence of special statutes, be substantially the same. The statutes were so fully reviewed on the argument that wo do not deem it necessary to enter upon a detailed examination of them. We think that the city constables remain ministerial officers of justices as before.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">The case must bo remanded to the Recorder\u2019s Court, as there has been no legal trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b201-5\">The other Justices concurred.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
