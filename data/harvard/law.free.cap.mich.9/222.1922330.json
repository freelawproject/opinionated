By the sale, report and confirmation \u2014there being no appeal taken from the order of confirmation \u2014 the purchaser\u2019s right under the sale became vested, without any further action on the part of the court. The order appealed from deprives him of this right. It contemplates, it is true, further proceedings on the decree, affecting the rights of the parties to the decree; but it does not contemplate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>any further proceedings whatever touching the right of the purchaser. As to him the order is final. It puts an end to his rights. As purchaser, he has no interest in, and is not a party to such further proceedings, whether he bo a party to the foreclosure suit or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">In <em>Baker v. </em>Pierson, 5 <em>Mich. </em>456, we held that an appeal would lie from an order denying a writ of assistance to a purchaser at a mortgage sale, to put him in possession of the mortgaged premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">The motion must be denied, with costs.</p>\n<judges id=\"b223-6\">Martin Ch.
