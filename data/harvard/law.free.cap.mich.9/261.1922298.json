The writ of error was issued in March, 1860, and Mr. Brown showed by affidavit that in April, 1860, the attorney for defendant in error was served with copy of the assignment of errors, and that in receiving it he made the remark that it was all right, or something to that effect.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b261-8\">The Court</author>\n<p id=\"Az9\">held that the application was too late. The object of requiring notice to be given of the writ, is that the defendant in error may be apprised of the proceedings which are being taken; and when he is otherwise informed, and does not move promptly to take advantage of the omission, he will be held to have waived the objection.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
