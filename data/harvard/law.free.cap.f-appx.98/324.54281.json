We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-20\">This court has held that subsequent possession of firearms satisfies the nexus requirement for possession because those firearms could have been used to facilitate the crimes at issue. <em>See United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 512 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d 748, 754 (5th Cir.1999). Based upon the facts in this case, the district court did not clearly err in applying the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(5) increase.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-21\">Davis next argues that his three prior state robbery convictions should be treated as a single conviction for the purposes of calculating his criminal history score and base offense level because Davis was sentenced for all three crimes at the same time. Davis also argues that the robberies were committed to achieve the common goal of supporting Davis\u2019 drug habit. Again, we disagree with Davis\u2019 argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Davis committed one robbery on February 21, 2001 and two robberies on February 28, 2001. Further, though the three robberies may have shared a common motive, that is not sufficient evidence to consider the offenses related under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(2) for the purposes of calculating Davis\u2019 criminal history score. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 519 (5th Cir.1999). Thus, the district court properly relied on the Presentencing Report and did not clearly err in finding that no functional consolidation of the offenses had occurred in the state court. <em>See Mitchell, </em>166 F.3d at 754; <em>Buford v. United States, </em>532 U.S. 59, 64, 121 S.Ct. 1276, 149 L.Ed.2d 197 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the sentence and conviction. AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b353-16\">. Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
