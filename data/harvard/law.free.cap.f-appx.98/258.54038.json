On appeal, his counsel has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), alleging that there are no meritori<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>ous claims for appeal, but addressing whether the district court should have departed based on diminished mental capacity. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, </em>\u00a7 5K2.13 (2002). Although informed of the right to do so, Brown has not filed a pro se supplemental brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">Because the court correctly understood its authority to depart in this case, we lack jurisdiction to review its decision not to depart under \u00a7 5K2.13. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>303 F.3d 539, 545 (4th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1138, 123 S.Ct. 929, 154 L.Ed.2d 832 (2003); <em>United States v. Bayerle, </em>898 F.2d 28, 31 (4th Cir.1990). Accordingly, we dismiss this portion of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">We have examined the entire record in this case in accordance with the requirements of <em>Anders </em>and find no meritorious issues for appeal. Therefore, we affirm Brown\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
