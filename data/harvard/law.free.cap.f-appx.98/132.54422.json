We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-24\">In October 1995, Myrta Maldonado applied for SSI benefits on behalf of her one-year-old son, Wilfredo Nieves, She alleged that Nieves qualified as \u201cdisabled\u201d under the SSI regulations because of his asthma, ear infections, and foot conditions. The Social Security Administration denied Nieves\u2019 application initially and upon reconsideration. Maldonado appealed, and after a hearing, an Administrative Law Judge issued a decision denying Nieves\u2019 application for benefits on November 24, 1997. The ALJ\u2019s decision became final when the Appeals Council denied Maldonado\u2019s request for review. The United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>States District Court for the District of New Jersey affirmed the ALJ\u2019s determination, finding that substantial evidence supported the decision. Maldonado now appeals the District Court\u2019s order. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">We exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s order, but we review the Commissioner\u2019s ruling to determine whether it was supported by substantial evidence. <em>Newell v. Comm\u2019r of Soc. Sec., </em>347 F.3d 541, 545 (3d Cir.2003). The Supreme Court has defined \u201csubstantial evidence\u201d as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971) (quoting <em>Consolidated Edison Co. v. NLRB, </em>305 U.S. 197, 229, 59 S.Ct. 206, 83 L.Ed. 126 (1938)). Where the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence on the record, we will not set it aside, \u201ceven if [the Court] would have decided the factual inquiry differently.\u201d Ha<em>rtranft v. Apfel, </em>181 F.3d 358, 360 (3d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">The Social Security Act provides that a child under 18 is \u201cdisabled\u201d for purposes of SSI eligibility if he or she \u201chas a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1382c(a)(3)(C)(i) (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">The Commissioner follows a three-step process in determining childhood disabilities. <em>See </em>20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.924 (2004). A child will qualify for SSI benefits if the Commissioner determines (1) the child is not engaged in substantial gainful activity; (2) the child has a medically determinable severe impairment; and (3) the impairment meets, medically equals, or functionally equals the severity of an impairment listed at 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1 (\u201clisted impairment(s)\u201d), and that impairment meets the durational requirement. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">In this case, the ALJ found that Nieves had never engaged in substantial gainful activity, and that his asthmatic condition constituted a severe impairment. But the ALJ concluded that Nieves\u2019 condition did not meet the criteria for any listed impairment, nor did it medically or functionally equal the severity of any listed impairment. The ALJ consequently determined that Nieves was not \u201cdisabled\u201d and did not qualify for SSI benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-11\">Maldonado claims that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision that Nieves\u2019 condition does not meet the requirements of asthma attacks, a \u201clisted impairment\u201d under 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 3.03B (2004). Maldonado further argues that remand is appropriate because the ALJ did not adequately explain the basis for his finding that Nieves\u2019 condition did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal the severity of a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-13\">Maldonado claims that the medical evidence demonstrates that Nieves\u2019 condition meets the requirements for asthma attacks, and that the ALJ\u2019s unfavorable decision on this matter is not supported by substantial evidence. To qualify for disability based on asthma attacks, the applicant must show that he or she suffered from attacks:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>... in spite of prescribed treatment and requiring physician intervention, occurring at least once every 2 months or at least six times a year. Each inpatient hospitalization for longer than 24 hours for control of asthma counts as two attacks, and an evaluation period of at least 12 consecutive months must be used to determine the frequency of attacks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">20 C.F.R. Pt. 404, Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 3.03B (2004). The ALJ\u2019s determination was supported by substantial evidence. The medical evidence established that during Nieves\u2019 first three years, his visits to the hospital were frequent. But an examination of the medical evidence submitted by Maldonado demonstrates that the number of hospital visits specifically necessitated by Nieves\u2019 asthma did not rise to the number of asthma \u201cattacks\u201d required by the listings for any consecutive twelve months during the relevant time period.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree with the District Court that substantial evidence supported the ALJ\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">Maldonado also argues that we must vacate and remand under <em>Burnett v. Commissioner of Social Security Administration, </em>220 F.3d 112 (3d Cir.2000), because the ALJ failed to explain the basis for finding that Nieves\u2019 condition did not meet, medically equal, or functionally equal the severity of a listed impairment. In <em>Burnett, </em>we remanded a case in which the ALJ\u2019s step three determination consisted of a one-sentence \u201cconclusory statement\u201d that although the claimant had a severe disability, it did not meet or equal the severity of a listed impairment. <em>Id. </em>at 119-120. We explained in <em>Burnett </em>that we could not engage in \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d unless the ALJ sets forth a \u201cdiscussion of the evidence and an explanation of reasoning\u201d behind the decision. <em>Id. </em>at 120.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">In Nieves\u2019 case, the ALJ did not specifically cite the numbered listed impairment he considered in making the disability determination. But we find (and Maldonado does not claim otherwise) that the only impairment at issue in this case is asthma attacks, a listed impairment at 20 C.F.R. Pt. 404 Subpt. P, App. 1, \u00a7 3.03B.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">In this case, the ALJ adequately explained the basis for his determination that Nieves\u2019 condition did not functionally equal the asthma listing.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> To determine func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>tional equivalence, the ALJ must \u201cassess all functional limitations caused by the child\u2019s condition to determine if the impairment(s) is functionally equivalent in severity to any listed impairment that includes disabling functional limitations in its criteria.\u201d 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a). Here, in making the functional equivalence determination, the ALJ cited physician reports, medical records, 'and testimony about Nieves\u2019 ability to engage in age-appropriate activities. The ALJ noted that Nieves had mild to moderate hearing loss from his ear condition and was on regular medication for asthma. But the ALJ also cited to a physician\u2019s report stating that Nieves was a \u201cfairly developed, nourished, alert, active and playful child,\u201d as well as Maldonado\u2019s own testimony indicating that Nieves could feed himself, play outside, and interact with others.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">Further, the ALJ adequately supported his determination that Nieves\u2019 condition did not meet or medically equal the asthma attack listing.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The ALJ specifically discussed the physician interventions necessitated by Nieves\u2019 asthma (the criteria used to determine whether an applicant meets requirements for the asthma attacks listing) and concluded that, although Nieves experienced \u201cseveral emergency room treatments for asthma,\u201d many of the other visits were not for emergency asthma issues. While the ALJ\u2019s decision did not specifically list and characterize each of Nieves\u2019 hospital visits in reaching its conclusion, a count of the asthma-necessitated visits in the medical record (which the District Court specifically set out in its opinion) demonstrates that Nieves did not experience the required number of attacks to qualify for disability benefits. Where, as in this case, we can determine that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision, the \u201cmeaningful judicial review\u201d goal of <em>Burnett </em>is satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">Because the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence, and it included an adequate discussion of the supporting evidence, we will affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-8\">. Maldonado specifically argues that the \"six attack\u201d requirement was met during the period from July 3, 1995 to June 18, 1996 since an October 14, 1995 visit was an \"admission\" which counted as two \"attacks\u201d under the regulations. However, medical records indicate Nieves was not admitted to the hospital on October 14, as he was discharged after the emergency room visit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b163-9\">. The criteria to be used in determining functional equivalence for children are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-10\"><em>General. </em>If you have a severe impairment or combination of impairments that does not meet or medically equal any listing, we will decide whether it results in limitations that functionally equal the listings.
