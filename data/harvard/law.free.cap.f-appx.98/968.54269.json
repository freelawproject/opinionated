We have reviewed the record and the BIA\u2019s order and find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Deku\u2019s motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (2003); <em>INS v. Doherty, </em>502 U.S. 314, 323-24, 112 S.Ct. 719, 116 L.Ed.2d 823 (1992). Moreover, despite Deku\u2019s urgings, we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s order affirming without opinion the immigration judge\u2019s decision denying Deku\u2019s applications for asylum and withholding from removal. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(6). (2000); <em>Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 394, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b996-19\">Accordingly, we deny the petition for review on the BIA\u2019s reasoning. <em>See In re: Deku, </em>No. A72-379-761 (BIA June 30, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b996-20\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
