Doakes\u2019 attorney has filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Although counsel states there are no meritorious issues for appeal, he challenges the district court\u2019s categorization of Doakes as a career offender based, in part, upon a previous state conviction for possessing a weapon of mass destruction, specifically a sawed-off shotgun. Doakes was informed of his right to file a supplemental brief, but he has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-22\">Doakes asserts that his previous firearm possession conviction was not a crime of violence under <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 4Bl.l(a) (2002) (career offender guidelines).<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> However, as counsel concedes, we found otherwise in <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>246 F.3d 330, 335 (4th Cir. 2001), which specifically held that \u201cpossession of a sawed-off shotgun is a crime of violence under USSG \u00a7 4B1.1 because the possession of such a weapon always creates a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing Doakes as a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-23\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case, including the Fed.R.Ci\u2019im.P. 11 hearing and sentencing transcripts, and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We, therefore, affirm Doakes\u2019 convictions and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court to withdraw from representation at that time. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Doakes. We dispense with oral argument, because the facts and legal contentions are ade<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>quately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b279-20\"> Doakes does not challenge the use of his other predicate conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
