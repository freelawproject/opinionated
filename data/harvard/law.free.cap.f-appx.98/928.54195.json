We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s decision, and will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-24\">We write solely for the parties and, therefore, recount only those facts relevant to our decision. Bashir had a comprehensive business insurance policy with American. In late March, 2001, Bashir discovered that a water leak in the roof of his building had caused damage to carpets and furniture in the building. Bashir notified American and filed a claim under the Policy. American denied the claim and this action followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-25\">The burden of proving that a claim is covered under an insurance policy falls on the insured, while the burden of proving that an otherwise covered claim is excluded is on the insurer. <em>New Castle County v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co., </em>933 F.2d 1162, 1181 (3d Cir.1991). Under the Policy, Bashir was insured for damage to all \u201ccovered property\u201d that was caused or resulted from any \u201ccovered cause of loss.\u201d App. at 55. The essential issue in this appeal is whether the damage Bashir sustained was caused by a \u201ccovered cause of loss\u201d. That phrase is defined in the policy as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-26\">Risks of Direct Physical Loss unless the loss is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b956-28\">a. Excluded, in Section B., Exclusions; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number>b. Limited in Paragraph A.4., Limitations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b957-5\">App. at 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-6\">Importantly, Bashir concedes that the District Court was correct in concluding that his loss was not caused by a collapse, as that term is used in the additional coverages section of the policy. <em>See </em>Appellant\u2019s Brief at 12 (indicating that Bashir does not \u201ctake issue\u201d with the District Court\u2019s conclusion that Bashir \u201ccould not possibly base a coverage claim under the word \u2018collapse\u2019 in the policy\u201d). Also, American did not argue that any limitation in paragraph A.4 applied. Thus, we are left to determine whether the District Court correctly concluded that Bahsir\u2019s claim was properly denied because one of the exclusions contained in Section B of the policy applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-7\">On this point, Bashir also concedes that the District Court properly concluded that Section B\u2019s exclusion of losses caused by \u201csettling, cracking, shrinking or expansion\u201d applied to Bashir\u2019s loss. However, Bashir argues an exception to that exclusion for \u201cspecified causes of loss\u201d should have applied and that the District Court erred in concluding otherwise. We disagree and, essentially for the reasons stated in the District Court\u2019s opinion conclude that the specified causes of loss exception does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-9\">Bashir also argues that the District Court erred by concluding that the Policy\u2019s exclusions for damage caused by negligent maintenance applied. Bashir ignores the fact that whether or not this exclusion applies is irrelevant because the exclusion for damage caused by \u201csettling, cracking, shrinking or expansion\u201d applied without exception. His claim is therefore excluded under a relevant exclusion and was not caused by a \u201ccovered cause of loss.\u201d Whether or not additional exclusions may apply does not alter this conclusion and, therefore, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order granting American summary judgment on Bashir\u2019s breach of contract claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b957-10\">Finally, Bashir argues that the District Court erred by granting American\u2019s motion for summary judgment as to Bashir\u2019s bad faith claim. We disagree and, for the reasons given by the District Court, will affirm its decision on this issue as well.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
