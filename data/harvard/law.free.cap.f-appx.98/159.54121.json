Three months before Mr. Nolan became eligible for parole, the Pennsylvania Board of Probation and Parole (\u201cBoard\u201d), after a hearing, issued a one-page written opinion denying parole. After exhausting his state remedies, Mr. Nolan filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254, contending that the Board\u2019s decision violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the Constitution in two respects: (1) by applying to him a 1996 amendment to Pennsylvania\u2019s parole statute, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1, enacted more than a decade after his incarceration; and (2) by failing to apply an automatic parole policy allegedly in place at the time of his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>incarceration. The District Court denied the petition, finding no <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Subsequently, this court decided <em>Mickens-Thomas v. Vaughn, </em>321 F.3d 374 (3d Cir.2003) <em>(\u201cMickens-Thomas I\u201d), </em>ruling that the 1996 amendment to 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1, which for the first time identified public safety as the principal concern in parole decisions, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause when applied retroactively. In light of this decision, we granted Mr. Nolan\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability on his <em>ex post facto </em>claims. Because our holding in <em>Mickens-Thomas I </em>undermines the rationale behind the District Court\u2019s order, we vacate the order and remand for the District Court\u2019s reconsideration in light of our decision in <em>Mickens-Thomas I.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Because we write solely for the parties and the District Court, we limit our discussion of the background facts to those relevant to the issues on appeal. On June 22, 1984, Mr. Nolan was sentenced in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas to a prison term of five to ten years for aggravated assault and carrying a firearm. On October 15,1985, he was sentenced to a consecutive term of seven-and-a-half to fifteen years for voluntary manslaughter and possessing an instrument of a crime. He has always maintained his innocence of the offenses for which he was convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Mr. Nolan became eligible for parole on December 26, 2000.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In advance of this date, the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections recommended against granting him parole based on \u201ca number of factors, not the least of which is whether or not an inmate takes responsibility for his/her crime.\u201d Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 120a. On September 26, 2000, the Board, after a hearing, issued a one-page written opinion denying Mr. Nolan\u2019s application on the basis that \u201cthe fair administration of justice cannot be achieved through your release on parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 121a. The Board subsequently denied Mr. Nolan\u2019s request for administrative relief.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Mr. Nolan filed a petition for a writ of mandamus in the Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania requesting review of the Board\u2019s decision on the grounds that it violated, <em>inter alia, </em>the Ex Post Facto Clause by (1) applying to him an amendment to Pennsylvania\u2019s parole statute, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1, enacted after his incarceration, and (2) failing to apply a policy or practice in place at the time of his incarceration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This \u201cpolicy or practice\u201d purportedly provided for automatic parole upon the expiration of an inmate\u2019s minimum sentence in the absence of any Class I misconduct citations within the previous nine months. The Commonwealth Court dismissed the petition on November 22, 2000, ruling that the decision whether to grant parole is discretionary and, there<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>fore, not subject to mandamus.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Mr. Nolan\u2019s petition for allowance of appeal to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court was denied on July 23, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">On September 14, 2001, Mr. Nolan, acting <em>pro se, </em>filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, asserting, <em>inter alia, ex post facto </em>claims identical to those he raised in the proceedings before the Commonwealth Court and Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania (\u201cDistrict Court\u201d), which denied the petition on August 20, 2002. On April 24, 2003, we granted a certificate of appealability on Mr. Nolan\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claims.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">We have appellate jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1291 and 2253. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a habeas proceeding <em>de novo </em>and any factual findings for clear error. <em>See Sierra v. Romaine, </em>347 F.3d 559, 564 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">The Ex Post Facto Clause, U.S. Const, art. 1, \u00a7 10, cl. 1, prohibits statutory or policy changes that \u201cretroactively alter the definition of crimes or increase the punishment for criminal acts.\u201d <em>Cal. Dep\u2019t of Corrections v. Morales, </em>514 U.S. 499, 504, 115 S.Ct. 1597, 131 L.Ed.2d 588 (1995) (quotations omitted). A new law or policy violates the Ex Post Facto Clause if it is (1) retrospective, i.e. applying to events predating its enactment, and (2) disadvantageous to the offender affected by it. <em>Weaver v. Graham, </em>450 U.S. 24, 29, 101 5. Ct. 960, 67 L.Ed.2d 17 (1981). Retroactive changes in the rules of parole may violate the prohibition against <em>ex post facto </em>laws. <em>Garner v. Jones, </em>529 U.S. 244, 250, 120 S.Ct. 1362, 146 L.Ed.2d 236 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-13\">Mr. Nolan contends that the Board violated the Ex Post Facto Clause when, in denying his application for parole in September 2000, it relied upon a 1996 amendment to the Pennsylvania statute governing parole standards, 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1. Entitled \u201cPublic Policy as to Parole,\u201d 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 represents the \u201caspirational introductory provision of the Pennsylvania parole statutes.\u201d <em>Mickens-Thomas I, </em>321 F.3d at 377. Since 1996, when the Pennsylvania legislature modified the Commonwealth\u2019s parole statute, this introductory provision has instructed that, in making parole decisions, \u201cthe board shall first and foremost seek to protect the safety of the public.\u201d 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> From 1941 to 1996 \u2014 and thus at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the time of Mr. Nolan\u2019s convictions in 1984 and 1985 \u2014 the parole statute made no specific mention of public safety.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Mr. Nolan argues that the Board applied the amended version of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 to his parole request, decreasing the likelihood he would be granted parole. The District Court rejected Mr. Nolan\u2019s argument. Even assuming that the Board relied upon the amended version of the parole statute, the District Court held that such reliance did not give rise to an <em>ex post facto </em>violation, as it did not create a significant risk of increasing the measure of Mr. Nolan\u2019s punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Subsequently, on February 21, 2003, we issued our decision in <em>Mickens-Thomas I. </em>In that case, an inmate eligible for parole sought federal habeas relief, alleging that the Board\u2019s application to him of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 as amended in 1996, resulting in the denial of parole, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. We found that while the Board had always considered the potential risk to public safety in making parole decisions, prior to 1996 the Board was required to make its decision on the totality of the factors pertinent to parole. <em>Mick-ens-Thomas I, </em>321 F.3d at 386. After 1996, in contrast, the Board, as we put it in <em>Mickens-Thomas I, </em>was required to assign \u201cforemost importance to the public safety factor.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 384. Therefore, we concluded, the amendment to 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1, by altering the manner in which the Board weighed public safety in making parole decisions, violated the Ex Post Facto Clause when applied retroactively. <em>Id. </em>at 393. We instructed the Board to reconsider Mr. Mickens-Thomas\u2019s parole application under the parole guidelines in existence prior to 1996. <em>Id. </em>When the Board, once again applying factors that violated the Ex Post Facto clause, denied Mr. Mickens-Thomas\u2019s application on remand, a determination upheld by the district court, we issued a mandate directing the Board to release Mr. Mickens-Thomas on parole. <em>Mickens-Thomas v. Vaughn, </em>355 F.3d 294, 296 (3d Cir.2004) <em>(\u201cMickens-Thomas II\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b191-11\">Mr. Nolan\u2019s convictions occurred in 1984 and 1985, long before the 1996 amendment of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1. Consequently, if the Board did in fact rely on the amended parole statute in denying Mr. Nolan\u2019s application, <em>Mickens-Thomas I </em>dictates that the Board\u2019s decision constituted an <em>ex post facto </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-12\">The question that remains is whether the Board in fact applied the pre-1996 version or the post-1996 version of the parole statute in reaching its decision. While the District Court appeared skeptical as to Mr. Nolan\u2019s allegation that the Board relied upon the post-1996 statute, stating that the claim was \u201cbased on speculation and conjecture,\u201d J.A. at 7a, the District Court did not ultimately make a finding on this point. Instead, the District Court explained that \u201c[f]or the purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>this order, in view of the fact that Nolan is proceeding <em>pro se, </em>we will presume that the Board in fact relied upon the amended version of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 ... in refusing to parole him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District Court is in a better position than this court to determine in the first instance whether the Board relied upon the amended version of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 in denying Mr. Nolan parole. Accordingly, we will vacate the District Court\u2019s decision in light of <em>MickensThomas I </em>and remand for the District Court to make the relevant factual determination. If the District Court concludes that the Board did in fact rely on the amended parole statute, it will be appropriate under <em>Mickens-Thomas I </em>for the District Court to order the Board to re-adjudicate Mr. Nolan\u2019s parole application under the standards articulated in the pre-1996 version of 61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Mr. Nolan also maintains that the Board violated the Ex Post Facto Clause when it failed to apply a policy or practice that existed at the time of his incarceration \u2014 namely, the automatic parole of an inmate upon expiration of his minimum sentence in the absence of any Class I misconduct citations within the previous nine months. The Commonwealth asserts that no such policy has ever existed.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The District Court summarily rejected Mr. Nolan\u2019s allegation of an \u201cautomatic parole\u201d policy, observing that Mr. Nolan had put forth no evidence of other inmates who, despite adverse recommendations from the Department of Corrections, were automatically paroled upon their first application. We agree with the District Court that, based on the record, there is no evidence that such a policy ever existed. Therefore, no <em>ex post facto </em>violation can arise from the Board\u2019s failure to apply the alleged policy, and the District Court did not err in denying Mr. Nolan\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claim on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the order of the District Court and remand for further proceedings in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. In custody since June 1983, Mr. Nolan would have been eligible for parole on December 26, 1995. While in prison, he was sentenced to sixty additional months, or five years, for what Mr. Nolan describes in his opening brief on appeal as \"parole violations.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-9\">. The Board also denied Mr. Nolan's renewed application for parole the following year, on October 1, 2001. The 2001 denial, communicated to Mr. Nolan in a letter virtually identical to the letter reporting the 2000 denial, is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-14\">. In the District Court, Mr. Nolan also alleged a third violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause, along with violations of his due process and equal protection rights. He has not pursued these claims on appeal, and we do not consider them here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b190-8\">. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has since held that it is within the Commonwealth Court\u2019s original jurisdiction to hear mandamus petitions raising questions whether Parole Board decisions violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. <em>Coady v. Vaughn, </em>564 Pa. 604, 770 A.2d 287, 290 (2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b190-9\">. We also directed the parties to address whether Mr. Nolan\u2019s <em>ex post facto </em>claims could properly be considered exhausted. The court and the parties agree that, by raising his <em>ex post facto </em>claims with both the Commonwealth Court and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, Mr. Nolan has exhausted his state remedies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b190-15\">. The complete statute reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-16\">The parole system provides several benefits to the criminal justice system, including the provision of adequate supervision of the offender while protecting the public, the opportunity for the offender to become a useful member of society and the diversion of appropriate offenders from prison. In providing these benefits to the criminal justice system, the board shall first and foremost seek to protect the safety of the public. In addition to this goal, the board shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>address input by crime victims and assist in the fair administration of justice by ensuring the custody, control and treatment of paroled offenders.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b191-8\">. From 1941 to 1996, the statute provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-9\">The value of parole as a disciplinary and corrective influence and process is hereby recognized, and it is declared to be the public policy of this Commonwealth that persons subject or sentenced to imprisonment for crime shall, on release therefrom, be subjected to a period of parole during which their rehabilitation, adjustment, and restoration to social and economic life and activities shall be aided and facilitated by guidance and supervision under a competent and efficient parole administration, and to that end it is the intent of this act to create a uniform and exclusive system for the administration of parole in this Commonwealth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-14\">61 P.S. \u00a7 331.1 (pre-1996 version).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. The Commonwealth suggests that Mr. Nolan might have mistakenly interpreted as the Board's parole policy a directive related to the Department of Corrections\u2019 work release program. Under Administrative Directive 805, according to the Commonwealth, one requirement of eligibility for work release is that the inmate has had no Class I misconducts, and no more than one Class II misconduct, during the nine months prior to his application.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
