In civil actions in which the United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party, all parties are accorded sixty days after the entry of the district court\u2019s final judgment or order to note an appeal, <em>see </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B), unless the district court extends the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5) or reopens the appeal period under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6). These time periods are \u201cmandatory and jurisdictional.\u201d <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978) (quoting <em>United States v. Robinson, </em>361 U.S. 220, 229, 80 S.Ct. 282, 4 L.Ed.2d 259 (1960)).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-4\">The district court\u2019s order denying Gray\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was entered on the docket on August 21, 2003. The notice of appeal, postmarked November 26, 2003, was received by the district court on December 1, 2003.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In his notice of appeal, Gray stated that he did not receive timely notice of the court\u2019s order denying habeas relief. We construe Gray\u2019s statement as a motion to reopen the time to note an appeal under Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Feuver, </em>236 F.3d 725, 729 &amp; n. 7 (D.C.Cir.2001). Rule 4(a)(6) permits a district court to reopen the appeal period if (a) the motion is filed within 180 days after the judgment or order is entered or within 7 days after the moving party receives notice of the entry, whichever is earlier; (b) the court finds that the moving party was entitled to notice of the entry of the judgment or order sought to be appealed but did not receive the notice from the district court or any party within 21 days after entry; and (c) the court finds that no party would be prejudiced. Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-11\">Here, the record is unclear as to when Gray received notice of the entry of the court\u2019s order denying his \u00a7 2255 motion. Accordingly, we remand the case to the district court for the court to determine whether Gray can satisfy the requirements of Rule 4(a)(6). <em>See Ogden v. San Juan County, </em>32 F.3d 452, 454 (10th Cir.1994). The record, as supplemented, will then be returned to this court for further review.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-12\">\n<em>REMANDED</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-7\">. For the purpose of this appeal, we assume the date appearing on the envelope containing the notice of appeal is the earliest date it could have been properly delivered to prison officials for mailing to the court. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(c); <em>Houston v. Lack, </em>487 U.S. 266, 108 S.Ct. 2379, 101 L.Ed.2d 245 (1988). Under the certificate of service, the only date reference is \u201cDone this_day of November 2003.\u201d To benefit from the mailbox rule, the prisoner must comport with the requirements of Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746 (2000). Gray does not attest to a date in the certificate of service by a declaration under penalty of perjury or a notarized statement.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b268-23\">. Gray cannot benefit from Rule 4(a)(5) because he filed his notice of appeal more than thirty days after the expiration of the appeal period. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(5).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
