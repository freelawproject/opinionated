Allstate Ins. Co., </em>243 F.3d 912, 916 (5th Cir.2001). The Plan\u2019s complaint alleged (1) that the Plan sought reimbursement of money it had paid out previously as benefits from $25,000 Douthitt had recovered from a third party; (2) to which the Plan was entitled pursuant to the reimbursement agreement; and (3) that Douthitt had recovered those funds, which were in his attorney\u2019s trust account. The district court properly exercised subject matter jurisdiction over the instant action because the Plan\u2019s suit was authorized under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a)(3), and the Plan\u2019s complaint sought recovery directly under that statute. <em>See Bombardier Aerospace Employee Welfare Benefits Plan v. Ferrer, Poirot and Wansbrough, </em>354 F.3d 348, 356 (5th Cir.2003), <em>pet. for cert. filed, </em>70 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>U.S.L.W. 3513 (U.S. Feb. 5, 2004) (No. 03-1135); <em>Bell v. Hood, </em>327 U.S. 678, 681-82, 66 S.Ct. 773, 90 L.Ed. 939 (1946). Whether Douthitt actually recovered the money, whether his attorney actually held the funds, and whether the Plan now possesses the funds or a check go to the merits of the Plan\u2019s claims, not to the question of the district court\u2019s jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Douthitt asserts that the imposition of a constructive trust was not appropriate in this case because there was no fraud involved and because his wife and attorney would not be unjustly enriched by receiving the funds, to which they were legally entitled under the Texas Common Fund Doctrine. Douthitt did not raise these issues in the district court, and we will not allow him to do so now. <em>See Topalian v. Ehrman, </em>954 F.2d 1125, 1131 (5th Cir. 1992). Additionally, Douthitt\u2019s arguments are foreclosed. <em>See Bombardier, </em>354 F.3d at 358-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b335-14\">.
