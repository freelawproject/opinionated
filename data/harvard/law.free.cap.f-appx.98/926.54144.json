She appeals from an order of the District Court affirming the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security denying her claim to Supplemental Security Income under Title XVI of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1381-1383\u00cd. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-25\">Ms. Benitez raises two issues on appeal: (1) whether the ALJ complied with the requirements of <em>Fargnoli v. Massanari, </em>247 F.3d 34, n. 4 (3d Cir.2001), and <em>Burnett v. Commissioner, </em>220 F.3d 112, n. 2 (3d Cir.2000), in ruling at step three that Ms. Benitez\u2019s impairments did not meet or equal the listings of the regulations; and (2) whether the ALJ improperly evaluated Ms. Benitez\u2019s claim that her pain is disabling.</p>\n<p id=\"b954-28\">For the reasons set forth in the thorough and thoughtful opinion of the District Court, we will affirm. The ALJ\u2019s analysis at step three was sufficient to permit meaningful appellate review. Similarly, we can find no fault with the methodology <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>of the ALJ\u2019s evaluation of Ms. Benitez\u2019s subjective complaints of pain. In particular, the ALJ properly relied upon the testimony regarding Ms. Benitez\u2019s extensive daily activities which constituted substantial evidence supporting his conclusion that her complaints were not entitled to full credence.</p>\n<p id=\"b955-5\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
