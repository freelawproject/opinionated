California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967). Hawkins notes that Easter waived his right to appeal his sentence, with certain exceptions, and Hawkins asserts that Easter\u2019s sentencing presents no nonfrivolous issue for appeal. Easter has received a copy of Hawkins\u2019s motion and brief, but he has filed no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-22\">Our independent review of the record reveals no potentially meritorious issues for appeal not discussed by counsel. Accordingly, Hawkins\u2019s motion for leave to withdraw is GRANTED, counsel is excused from further responsibilities in this case, and the appeal is DISMISSED. <em>See </em>5th Cir. R. 42.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-23\">MOTION GRANTED; APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1027-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the Court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in- 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
