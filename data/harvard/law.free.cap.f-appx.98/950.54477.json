We have reviewed the administrative record, the Board\u2019s order, and the immigration judge\u2019s decision and find substantial evidence supports the conclusion that Allen failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (stating that the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct.. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c\u2018was so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019\u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). We do not find the record so compelling as to reverse the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-20\">We further find no error in the immigration judge\u2019s application of the law. In addition, we find the Board did not violate Allen\u2019s right to due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-21\">We deny Allen\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-22\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
