(\u201cR &amp; B\u201d), appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its motion for summary judgment which sought indemnification, pursuant to a Day-work Drilling Contract (the \u201cContract\u201d) between R <em>&amp; </em>B and Defendant-Cross Defendant-Appellee, LLOG Exploration Offshore, Inc. (\u201cLLOG\u201d), for amounts paid to Plaintiff, Roger East, Jr. (\u201cEast\u201d), in settlement of a personal injury suit. R <em>&amp; </em>B also appeals the district court\u2019s grant of LLOG\u2019s motion for summary judgment finding that LLOG did not owe a duty to indemnify R &amp; B under the terms of the Contract. Based on the reasons enunciated below, we reverse the district court\u2019s denial of R &amp; B\u2019s motion for summary judgment as well as reverse its grant of LLOG\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">I. <em>Facts &amp; Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b346-23\">East brought an action against Defendants, Premier, Inc. (\u201cPremier\u201d), LLOG and R &amp; B, seeking recovery for personal injuries he allegedly sustained while working aboard the RBF 254, a mobile offshore drilling unit owned and operated by R <em>&amp; </em>B. East settled his claims against all the Defendants and the district court dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>missed that portion of the case. Under the terms of the settlement East was paid $10,000 from Premier, $127,500 from R &amp; B and $127,500 from LLOG. R &amp; B then filed a cross-claim seeking summary judgment against LLOG for defense and indemnification asserting that, pursuant to the terms of the Contract, LLOG was obligated to reimburse R &amp; B for the $127,500 it had paid East. LLOG filed a competing motion for summary judgment asserting that it owed no duty to indemnify under the terms of the Contract. The district court initially found that the Contract was ambiguous and, considering evidence beyond the language of the Contract itself, determined that the parties did not intend that LLOG would be liable to indemnify R &amp; B for claims arising from the latter\u2019s own negligence. R &amp; B now appeals these determinations by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">II. <em>Standard of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">This Court reviews the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>applying the same standard on appeal that is applied by the district court. <em>Lycon Inc. v. Juenke, </em>250 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.), <em>cert denied, </em>534 U.S. 892, 122 S.Ct. 209, 151 L.Ed.2d 148 (2001). \u201cUnder Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(c), summary judgment is appropriate when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986)). The movant need not negate the opposing party\u2019s claims nor produce evidence showing an absence of a genuine factual issue, but may rely on the absence of evidence to support essential elements of opposing party\u2019s claims. <em>International Assoc. of Machinists &amp; Aerospace Workers, Lodge No. 2504 v. Intercontinental Mfg. Co., </em>812 F.2d 219, 222 (5th Cir.1987). Contract interpretation, including the question of whether a contract is ambiguous, is a question of law subject to <em>de novo </em>review. <em>Instone Travel Tech Marine &amp; Offshore v. International Shipping Partners, Inc., </em>334 F.3d 423, 428 (5th Cir.2003). A contract is ambiguous when its meaning is uncertain and doubtful or is reasonably susceptible to more than one interpretation. <em>Reliant Energy Services, Inc. v. Enron Canada Corp., </em>349 F.3d 816, 2003 WL 22439846, *3 (5th Cir. 2003); <em>Heritage Resources, Inc. v. NationsBank, </em>939 S.W.2d 118, 121 (Tex.1996). If any ambiguity exists in a contract, \u201ca fact issue remains regarding the parties\u2019 intent,\u201d thus precluding a grant of summary judgment. <em>Instone Travel, </em>334 F.3d at 431.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-9\">III. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">R <em>&amp; </em>B and LLOG agree that, pursuant to its terms, the district court was correct in finding that the Contract is controlled by general maritime law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> R &amp; B does not dispute that East\u2019s injuries were caused by its own negligence. It is also undisputed that East was an invitee of LLOG. The only disputed item in this appeal is whether LLOG owed a duty to indemnify R &amp; B under the Contract for East\u2019s personal injury suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">The district court correctly held that, under general maritime law, indemnification for an indemnitee\u2019s own negligence must be \u201cclearly and unequivocally expressed.\u201d <em>Seal Offshore, Inc. v. American Standard, Inc., </em>736 F.2d 1078, 1081 (5th Cir.1984). However, as the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>also correctly noted, general maritime law has not adopted the \u201cexpress negligence test,\u201d which requires an indemnity provision to expressly state whether a party is to be indemnified for its own negligence. <em>Theriot v. Bay Drilling Corp., </em>783 F.2d 527, 540-41 (5th Cir.1986). Under general maritime law, a court may not look beyond the written language of the document to determine the intent of the parties unless the disputed contract provision is ambiguous. <em>Corbitt v. Diamond M. Drilling Co., </em>654 F.2d 329, 333 (5th Cir.1981). The question this court must ask, therefore, is whether the language of the Contract as written, \u201cclearly and unequivocally\u201d provides that LLOG will be liable to R <em>&amp; </em>B for injuries to an LLOG invitee, even when such injuries are caused by R <em>&amp; </em>B\u2019s own negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">A duty to indemnify in a given situation will exist if the parties\u2019 intention for a particular indemnification can reasonably be inferred from the language of a contract, even in the absence of an express provision. <em>Corbitt, </em>654 F.2d at 333. The district court found that it could not reasonably infer that the parties intended LLOG to indemnify R &amp; B for injuries, caused by R <em>&amp; </em>B\u2019s own negligence, to an LLOG invitee. Thus, the district court held that the Contract was ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">However, the language of the liability provisions of Article IX in the Contract, in particular Paragraphs 904 and 910, unambiguously provides that indemnity does exist for the situation here. Paragraph 904 of the Contract provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-6\">Operator [LLOG as provided by the Contract] shall be responsible for all claims, demands, and causes of action of every kind and character arising in connection herewith in favor of Operator\u2019s Personnel or <em>Operator\u2019s invitees, </em>on account of bodily injury, death or damage to property (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">While, the language of Paragraph 910 states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b348-8\">... It is the intention of the parties hereto that the provisions of this Article IX and Paragraphs 606 and 607 shall exclusively govern the allocation of risks and liabilities of said parties <em>without regard to cause </em>(as more particularly specified in Paragraph 910) ... (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-9\">The district court may be correct in noting that the language in parentheses in Paragraph 910 is unclear because it does not list any particularly specified situations. However, the previous phrase in Paragraph 910, \u201cwithout regard to cause,\u201d clearly provides that liability for claims is to be allocated according to the particular paragraphs without regard to the cause of such claims. Additionally, Paragraph 904 clearly provides that LLOG will be responsible for all claims arising from injuries to its own invitees. As R &amp; B notes in its brief, when looking at Article IX in its entirety, it becomes clear that the parties identified when each would be liable for differing situations and events that may occur during the life of the Contract, regardless of the cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-10\">This court has held that, in determining whether or not a contract is ambiguous, our primary concern is to give effect to the <em>vnitten expression </em>of the parties\u2019 intent. <em>Instone Travel Tech Marine &amp; Offshore v. International Shipping Partners, Inc., </em>334 F.3d 423, 428 (5th Cir.2003) (emphasis added). In doing so, we are required to read all parts of a contract together to ascertain the agreement of the parties, while ensuring that <em>each provision of the contract is given effect and none are rendered meaningless. Id. </em>(Emphasis added.) The controlling language in Paragraph 910 \u201cwithout regard to cause,\u201d undermines the district court\u2019s conclusion that an ambiguity exists regarding whether it can be rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>sonably inferred that the parties intended that LLOG would be liable to indemnify R <em>&amp; </em>B for injury to an LLOG invitee caused by R &amp; B\u2019s own negligence. <em>Corbitt, </em>654 F.2d at 333.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">As noted above, general maritime law does not require an express statement that an indemnitee will be entitled to indemnification for its own negligence in order for a contract to provide such indemnification. <em>Theriot, </em>783 F.2d at 540-41. Fifth Circuit maritime cases have also held that simply adding an \u201cany and all\u201d provision alone will not work to indemnify an indemnitee for its own negligence. <em>See e.g. Seal Offshore, Inc. v. American Standard, Inc., </em>736 F.2d at 1081 (citing <em>Mott v. ODECO, </em>577 F.2d 273 (5th Cir.1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>440 U.S. 912, 99 S.Ct. 1226, 59 L.Ed.2d 461 (1979) and <em>Brown v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., </em>554 F.2d 1299, 1302 n. 3 (5th Cir.1977)). The question we must answer then is whether the phrase \u201cwithout regard to cause\u201d satisfies the \u201cclear and unequivocal\u201d test. In <em>Theriot, </em>we held that the phrase \u201cwithout regard to the cause or causes thereof or the negligence of any party\u201d satisfied the clear and unequivocal test. 783 F.2d at 540. We rejected the appellee\u2019s argument that a prior holding of ours in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v. E.D. Walton Construction Co., </em>517 F.2d 1119, 1122 (5th Cir.1975), precluded such a finding. 783 F.2d at 540. We stated that in <em>Chevron, </em>the phrase at issue \u201cirrespective of negligence,\u201d failed to specify to whom it referred; while in <em>Theriot, </em>the phrase \u201cwithout regard to\u201d was followed by the phrase \u201cthe negligence of any party.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">Here, the Contract\u2019s provisions in Paragraphs 904 and 910 provide that LLOG \u201cshall be responsible for all ... causes of action of every kind ... arising in connection herewith ... of ... Operator\u2019s invitees on account of bodily injury ... without regard to cause.\u201d The language at issue here more closely resembles the language in <em>Theriot </em>than in <em>Chevron, </em>while satisfying the concerns raised in the former. For example, the phrase \u201cresponsible for ... all causes of action ... arising in connection [with] ... Operator\u2019s invitees on account of bodily injury\u201d addresses the concern of what specific type of cause action is to be covered, such as injury due to negligence, while the phrase \u201cwithout regard to cause\u201d addresses the concern of identifying whom the previous language is to apply; here, neither the Operator, nor the Contractor.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Additionally, the entire Article IX sets forth specific causes of action relating to specific individual\u2019s, property or events, i.e. \u201cContractors\u2019 Personnel,\u201d Paragraph 903; \u201cOperator\u2019s Personnel,\u201d Paragraph 904; \u201cDebris Removal and Cost of Control,\u201d Paragraph 906; and \u201cUnderground Damage,\u201d Paragraph 907, and specifies who is to be responsible for the actions arising under those paragraphs. In <em>Chevron </em>there was no language in the contract setting forth which party would be responsible for specific causes of action, but simply included an \u201cany and all\u201d clause. 517 F.2d at 1121. Moreover, perhaps an even more significant difference between <em>Theriot </em>and <em>Chevron </em>was the fact that the latter was not a maritime case, thus applying Texas law, and clearly based its decision on an implicit application of the \u201cexpress negligence test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(\u201cTexas courts indicate an increasingly stricter application of the clear and unequivocal rule and have progressed toward the so-called \u2018express negligence\u2019 rule as near as judicially possible without adopting it.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b349-10\">Finally, requiring a statement that included the phraseology \u201cLLOG will indem<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>nify R &amp; B for its own negligence\u201d would in effect be applying the \u201cexpress negligence test,\u201d which, as the district court acknowledged, has not been adopted by general maritime law. <em>Theriot, </em>783 F.2d at 540-41. Therefore, we hold that the district court erred in finding the Contract ambiguous. We also find that the district court erred in looking beyond the language of the Contract when it considered extrinsic evidence. Because no other issues remain, we also hold that the district court erred in denying R &amp; B summary judgment and in granting LLOG summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">Because we find that the district court erred in determining that the Contract was ambiguous, and in finding, based on extrinsic evidence, that LLOG was not obliged to indemnify R &amp; B for the underlying claim at issue here, we REVERSE the district court\u2019s denial of R &amp; B\u2019s motion for summary judgment and also REVERSE its grant of LLOG\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
