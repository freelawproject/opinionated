Because the parties are fully familiar with the background facts and procedural history we need not set them forth, and limit our discussion to our <em>ratio decidendi.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">Reppert seeks to proceed on both federal and state claims. The District Court dismissed his state law claim on the ground that it was preempted by the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cNLRA\u201d). <em>See Reppert v. Reading Area Sch. Dist., </em>No. 01-5696, 2003 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7769, at *13 (E.D.Pa. Apr. 16, 2003). As the Court aptly noted, Reppert\u2019s papers do not identify exactly what state causes of action he is asserting, hence the defendants \u201ccan only ... point to the allegedly offending conduct and show that such conduct is arguably governed by the NLRA.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *12. It appears to us, based on the papers, that Reppert\u2019s state law claims arise from his termination from employment with the District, and that the termination was based on allegedly false representations that Reppert made to the District in his capacity as union shop steward, i.e. the alteration of the statement of Mr. Moll\u2019s doctor based upon which Moll sought (and Reppert as shop steward sought on his behalf) to be placed in another position under the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the District. Under these circumstances, Reppert\u2019s termination is governed by the NLRA, and the preemption decision was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In contrast, and contrary to the statements in Reppert\u2019s appellate brief, his \u00a7 1983 claims were not dismissed on preemption grounds. The District Court clearly stated that \u201cAccordingly, in this case, Plaintiff\u2019s section 1983 claims are not within the sole jurisdiction of the NLRB. The Court determines, therefore, that it has jurisdiction to hear such claims.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *9. The threshold problem here (again) was the conclusory nature of Reppert\u2019s complaint. As the District Court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ab\">Moreover, the gravamen of the complaint is that Plaintiff was fired for exercising his right to free speech as a member of a union. Plaintiff pleads no facts support a Fourth or Fourteenth Amendment claim. Thus the Court construes Plaintiffs claim as one alleging infringement of his First Amendment rights.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ASE\"><em>Id. </em>at *16 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">With respect to the First Amendment claims, the District Court reasoned that Reppert\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claims were dismissed because the conduct that resulted in his dismissal \u201cdoes not relate to a matter of public concern.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *19. Rather, the Court concluded that the termination arose in the context of \u201chis personal business as a union official\u201d and concerned Mr. Moll\u2019s health, \u201crather than any union business which might possibly be important to the community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *19-20. In sum, in the absence of allegations that Reppert was punished for speaking out on a matter of public concern, or that his First Amendment rights were otherwise abridged, Rep-pert\u2019s \u00a7 1983 claim was \u201cdismissed for failing to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the deprivation of his constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *20.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-8\">Because \u201c[t]he inquiry into the protected status of speech is one of law, not fact,\u201d <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 148 n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983), and there are no factual disputes here about what was actually said, the question is not, strictly speaking, whether Reppert raised a genuine issue of material fact, but rather whether, as a constitutional matter, his speech was on a matter of public concern. This technicality aside, the District Court\u2019s analysis was correct. To be protected, a public employee\u2019s speech must address a matter of public concern, <em>id. </em>at 146, which it does if \u201cit can be \u2018fairly considered as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community.\u2019 \u201d <em>Holder v. City of Allentown, </em>987 F.2d 188, 194 (3d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Connick, </em>461 U.S. at 146). Mr. Moll\u2019s interest in changing jobs and Reppert\u2019s fraudulent conduct can scarcely be considered to be of public concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">The judgment of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
