Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by not determining the net weight of the marijuana attributed to him. For the first time on appeal, Rodriguez argues that the district court erred by not granting him a downward departure from his sentencing guidelines range. The Government asserts that Rodriguez\u2019s appeal is barred by the appeal waiver set forth in Rodriguez\u2019s plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-22\">Because Rodriguez\u2019s appeal waiver was not mentioned during his rearraignment by either the magistrate judge or the Government, Fed. R. Civ. P. ll(b)(l)(N) was not satisfied and the waiver cannot be held to have been knowing and voluntary. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>187 F.3d 516, 517-18 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>we can entertain the merits of Rodriguez\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Rodriguez\u2019s argument that the district court did not determine the net weight of the marijuana attributed to him is refuted by the record. Furthermore, because Rodriguez was sentenced as a career offender pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, the district court correctly determined that the weight of the marijuana attributed to Rodriguez did not affect his sentence and his argument is moot. <em>See United States v. Mankins, </em>135 F.3d 946, 950 (5th Cir.1998). Because the record does not indicate that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to make a downward departure, we lack jurisdiction to consider Rodriguez\u2019s downward departure argument. <em>See United States v. Landerman, </em>167 F.3d 895, 899 (5th Cir.1999). Accordingly, we AFFIRM Rodriguez\u2019s sentence and DISMISS his appeal to the extent that he argues that the district court should have made a downward departure.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">AFFIRMED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
