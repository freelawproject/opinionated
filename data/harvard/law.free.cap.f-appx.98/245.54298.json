McKinney claims that the court erred in denying his motion to suppress. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-19\">McKinney first claims that the court erred in concluding that his encounter with Officer C.T. Sluder of the UNC-Greensboro Police Department was consensual in nature. Because this claim involves mixed questions of fact and law, this court reviews the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear error and the legal conclusions drawn from the facts de novo. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996); <em>United States v. Gerant, </em>995 F.2d 505, 508 (4th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-20\">Our review of the record supports the district court\u2019s conclusion. Sluder\u2019s interaction with the occupants of the vehicle was described as cooperative. It was brief, and there were no actions taken by Sluder that suggest McKinney\u2019s will was overborne. Accordingly, we deny relief on this claim. <em>See United States v. Lattimore, </em>87 F.3d 647, 650 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc); <em>see also Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 415, 117 S.Ct. 882, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b274-21\">McKinney also asserts that even if the encounter was consensual, Sluder lacked probable cause to arrest McKinney for possession of a concealed weapon because such possession is not per se illegal in North Carolina. As this issue was not presented to the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See </em>Fed. R. Crim P. 52(b); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number><em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). North Carolina law provides for the issuance of a concealed weapon permit. <em>See </em>N.C. Gen.Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 14-415.10\u2014415.23 (2001). However, North Carolina also requires one with a concealed weapon to advise a law enforcement officer \u201cwhen approached\u201d that the individual is carrying a concealed weapon and has the appropriate permit on his person. <em>See </em>\u00a7 14-415.11(a). McKinney did not advise Sluder that he was carrying a weapon until asked and did not inform Sluder that he had a permit for such a weapon. As a consequence, Sluder had reason to believe that McKinney was in violation of North Carolina law. It was not plain error for the district court to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">We affirm the judgment of the district court. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
