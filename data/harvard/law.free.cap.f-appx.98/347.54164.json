The plain error standard of review governs this issue since it was not raised below. <em>United States v. Wilder, </em>15 F.3d 1292, 1301 (5th Cir.1994). The Government concedes that there was an error, that the error was clear or obvious, and that the error affected Colindres\u2019 substantial rights. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993) (setting forth elements of plain error review).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">The text of the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d) states that for the offense at issue 173 days of Colindres\u2019 total sentence of 180 days were suspended. In accordance with the relevant Guidelines, this \u201csentence of imprisonment\u201d was therefore only seven days and thus this conviction should not have received two criminal history points. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b) and comment.; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(b)(1) and (2); <em>United States v. Carbajal, </em>290 F.3d 277, 283 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 934, 123 S.Ct. 34, 154 L.Ed.2d 235 (2002) (if the guideline language is unambiguous, this court\u2019s inquiry begins and ends with an analysis of the plain meaning of that language). This offense also did not qualify for criminal history points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c), since Colindres had other convictions that scored four points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(c).. Thus, the Guidelines indicate that there was an error in the PSR. Because the parties failed to mention this error to the district court, the error also affected Colindres\u2019 substantial rights, since Colindres\u2019 sentence is greater than the upper end of the correct Guidelines range. Additionally, the fairness of the judicial proceeding was seriously affected because the increase in Colindres\u2019 sentence was erroneous and substantial. <em>See United States v. Aderholt, </em>87 F.3d 740, 744 (5th Cir.1996). We therefore VACATE the sentence insofar as its calculation includes two criminal history points for Colindres\u2019 2001 Youngstown, Ohio, Municipal Court conviction for Improper Handling of a Firearm in a Motor Vehicle (Misdemeanor).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">Colindres also argues for the first time on appeal that the district court\u2019s application of the eight-level offense level increase of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) was plain error. He argues that the conviction that formed the basis for the adjustment, a California conviction for \u201cPetty Theft With a Prior (Felony)\u201d is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C). The Government does not concede that the district court erred with respect to this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-8\">Unlike with the prior issue, the text of the PSR indicates that the district court did not commit clear or obvious error with respect to this issue. <em>See Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 732-34. Rather, Colindres had a theft conviction prior to being deported and he was sentenced to one-year imprisonment for the theft conviction. Based on the plain language of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), the theft conviction qualified as an aggravated felony. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) (the base offense level is increased by eight levels if a defendant who unlawfully enters the United States was previously deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C), comment, n. 2 (\u201caggravated felony\u201d has the meaning given that term in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43) (aggravated felony means, <em>inter alia, </em>a theft offense for which the term of imprisonment is at least one year); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) (term of imprisonment is deemed to include the period of incarceration or confinement regardless of any suspension of that imprisonment in whole or in part); <em>United States v. Yanez</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number><em>Huerta, </em>207 F.3d 746, 749 (5th Cir.2000) (applying 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(48)(B) to aggravated felony determination of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2). Thus, the language of the PSR and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(C) indicates that the adjustment is appropriate and the district court therefore did not plainly err when it relied on information in the PSR that Colindres did not challenge. <em>See United States v. Vital, </em>68 F.3d 114, 120 (5th Cir.1995); <em>United States v. Davis, </em>76 F.3d 82, 84 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>367 F.3d 274, 276-78 (5th Cir. 2004). The district court\u2019s judgment with respect to this issue is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">Colindres also argues that the \u201cfelony\u201d and \u201caggravated felony\u201d provisions set forth in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1) and (b)(2) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Colindres\u2019 challenge is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 227-47, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that Congress intended to set forth sentencing factors in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b), not a separate criminal offense, and that the sentencing provisions in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) were not unconstitutional. The Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>expressly declined to overrule <em>Almendarez-Torres. See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 489-90; <em>United States v. Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d 979, 984 (5th Cir.2000). This court must therefore follow the precedent set in <em>Almendarez-Torres </em>\u201cunless and until the Supreme Court itself determines to overrule it.\u201d <em>Dabeit, </em>231 F.3d at 984.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED FOR RESEN-TENCING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b376-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
