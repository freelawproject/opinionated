Aguirre-Espinoza\u2019s attorney has filed, a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), asserting there are no meritorious grounds for appeal but arguing the penalty provision of \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is unconstitutional under <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Counsel also notes Aguirre-Espinoza\u2019s sentence was enhanced based on a prior conviction not alleged in his indictment. Aguirre-Espinoza has been informed of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief but has not done so. Finding no meritorious issues and no error by the district court, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(2), an alien who illegally returns to the United States after having been removed subsequent to conviction for an aggravated felony faces a maximum prison term of twenty years. Since \u00a7 1326(b)(2) is a penalty provision, the aggravated felony conviction need not be charged in the indictment. <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998); <em>see also United States v. Sterling, </em>283 F.3d 216, 220 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>536 U.S. 931, 122 S.Ct. 2606, 153 L.Ed.2d 792 (2002) <em>(Almendarez-Torres </em>was not overruled by <em>Apprendi). </em>Moreover, the Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>specifically excepted prior convictions from its holding. <em>See Apprendi, </em>530 U.S. at 490 (\u201cOther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). In keeping with the prior conviction exception in <em>Apprendi, </em>a district court may use a prior conviction to enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence without requiring proof of the prior conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Sterling, </em>283 F.3d at 219-20; <em>see also United States v. Kinter, </em>235 F.3d 192, 202 (4th Cir.2000). Accordingly, the district court did not err in enhancing Aguirre-Espinoza\u2019s sentence based on a prior conviction under either \u00a7 1326(b)(2) or <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(A) (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the entire record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm Aguirre-Espinoza\u2019s conviction and sentence. This court requires that counsel inform his client, in writing, of his right to petition to the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If the client requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on the client.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
