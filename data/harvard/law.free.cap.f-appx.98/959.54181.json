She also appeals the district court\u2019s denial of her motions to vacate, and for protective and restraining orders. We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm on the reasoning of the district court. <em>See Jones v. Family Health Ctrs., Inc., </em>No. CA-01-4796 (D.S.C. Aug. 12 &amp; Sept. 24, 2003). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b987-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
