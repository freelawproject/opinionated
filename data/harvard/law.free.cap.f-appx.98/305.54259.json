Younce contends that the district court erred by considering the Commissioner\u2019s untimely objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation. He argues, for the first time on appeal, that his case should be remanded for the Commissioner to consider evidence not contained in the administrative record. He argues that the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) failed to give due weight to his subjective complaints of pain and that the ALJ improperly relied on the testimony of the vocational expert (VE) at the administrative hearing on Younce\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Younce argues that the district court erred by considering the Commissioner\u2019s objections to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation because those objections were filed untimely by two days. This argument underestimates the plenary nature of a district court\u2019s supervisory authority over its magistrate judges. While it is true that section 101 of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636, does not require the judge to review an issue <em>de novo </em>when no objections are filed, \u201cit does not preclude further review by the district judge, <em>sua sponte, </em>or at the request of a party, under a <em>de novo </em>or any other standard.\u201d <em>See Thomas v. Arn, </em>474 U.S. 140, 154, 106 S.Ct. 466, 88 L.Ed.2d 435 (1985); <em>see also Delgado v. Bowen, </em>782 F.2d 79 (7th Cir.1986); Wright, Miller <em>&amp; </em>Marcus, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 2d \u00a7 3070.1. Thus, the district court was free to reject the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation in absence of the filing of objections. Younce therefore has no basis to complain of the district court\u2019s rejection of the report and recommendation even though objections were untimely by two days. Moreover, if Younce felt aggrieved by the district court\u2019s acceptance of objections filed two days late, his proper course was to file a motion to strike, a motion for an extension of time to file a counter written objection, or a motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">Younce argues that his case should be remanded for consideration of new evidence under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g). However, Younce did not argue in the district court that his ease should be remanded for consideration of new evidence. This court should not consider a contention raised for the first time on appeal. <em>See Leverette v. Louisville Ladder Co., </em>183 F.3d 339, 342 (5th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">The ALJ sufficiently articulated his reasons for not fully crediting Younce\u2019s subjective complaints of pain, <em>see Falco v. Shalala, </em>27 F.3d 160, 163-64 (5th Cir.1994), and the ALJ\u2019s determination is supported by substantial evidence in the record. <em>See Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 390, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971); <em>Harper v. Sullivan, </em>887 F.2d 92, 96 (5th Cir. 1989). Finally, the weight given to the VE\u2019s testimony was a matter left to the ALJ. This court will not reweigh the evidence. <em>See Anthony v. Sullivan, </em>954 F.2d 289, 295 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">For the above reasons, the decision of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b333-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
