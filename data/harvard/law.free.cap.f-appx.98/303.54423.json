He argues that the district court erred in raising res judicata sua sponte and that the district court erred in dismissing his claims against Warden Wakefield. A review of the allegations made by Wendt against Wakefield in his previous lawsuit shows that they are sufficiently similar to the allegations made against Wakefield in this case. Therefore, the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing Wendt\u2019s claims against Wakefield as malicious pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See Pittman v. Moore, </em>980 F.2d 994, 994-95 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">Wendt argues that Judge John D. Rainey, and Circuit Judges Patrick E. Higginbotham, Jerry E. Smith, and Edith</p>\n<p id=\"b332-12\">B. Clement conspired to deprive him of his right to a full and fair hearing of his claims against Wakefield in his previous appeal of the dismissal of his first 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 action. Although the judges are not entitled to absolute immunity from suit for injunctive relief or declaratory relief under \u00a7 1983, <em>see Chrissy F. by Medley v. Miss. Dep\u2019t of Public Welfare, </em>925 F.2d 844, 849 (5th Cir. 1991), the district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this claim as it is without arguable merit and, therefore, frivolous. <em>See Bradley v. Puckett, </em>157 F.3d 1022, 1025 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">Wendt\u2019s appeal is without arguable merit and, therefore, it is DISMISSED as frivolous. <em>See Howard v. King, </em>707 F.2d 215, 219-20 (5th Cir.1983); 5th Cir. R. 42.2. Wendt received a strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) in <em>Wendt v. Wakefield, </em>No. H:01-CV-1983 (S.D.Tex. Aug. 5, 2002), and in <em>Wendt v. Wakefield, </em>58 Fed.Appx. 596 (5th Cir.2003). The district court\u2019s dismissal of Wendt\u2019s complaint as malicious under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B)\u00ae and this court\u2019s dismissal of this appeal as frivolous both count as strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996). Wendt has now accumulated at least three strikes under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g), and he may not proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-14\">APPEAL DISMISSED; 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(G) BAR IMPOSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b332-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
