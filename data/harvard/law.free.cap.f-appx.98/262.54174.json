The district court properly required exhaustion of administrative remedies under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000). Because Masada did not demonstrate to the district court that he had exhausted administrative remedies or that such remedies were not available, the court\u2019s dismissal of the action, without prejudice, was not an abuse of discretion. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">\n<em>AFFIRMED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
