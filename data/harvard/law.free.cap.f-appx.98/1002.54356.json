He asserts the following: (1) his attorney was ineffective for not filing a pretrial motion ; to suppress Nguyen\u2019s statement made after a Houston narcotics officer approached Nguyen and identified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1003\">*1003</page-number>himself; (2) Nguyen\u2019s statement followed an illegal arrest and the district court should have granted the motion to suppress the statement; (3) the district court erred in denying Nguyen\u2019s motion for judgment of acquittal because there was not sufficient evidence to convict; (4) Nguyen\u2019s attorney was not present during Nguyen\u2019s identification of a coconspirator in a photographic lineup, which occurred after Nguyen had retained counsel in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and his attorney was ineffective for not objecting to the introduction of the lineup evidence at trial; (5) Nguyen\u2019s attorney was ineffective for not objecting to the introduction of Nguyen\u2019s identification of a coconspirator based upon a discovery violation; and (6) Nguyen\u2019s attorney\u2019s cumulative errors constituted ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-5\">We generally do not review claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on direct appeal when those claims have not been presented before the district court, since no opportunity existed to develop the record. <em>United States v. Haese, </em>162 F.3d 359, 363 (5th Cir.1998). We will review ineffective-assistance claims on direct appeal only in rare cases where the record allows for a fair evaluation of the merits. <em>Id.; United States v. Rivas, </em>157 F.3d 364, 369 (5th Cir.1998). The record is not sufficiently developed with respect to any of Nguyen\u2019s claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, and we decline to review those claims on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-7\">Nguyen has not shown error with the district court\u2019s denial of the motion the suppress the evidence of Nguyen\u2019s statement made following Officer Daniel\u2019s approach and identification of himself to Nguyen. <em>See United States v. Santiago, </em>310 F.3d 336, 340 (5th Cir.2002); <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>43 F.3d 140, 145-46 (5th Cir.1995). Nguyen fails to adequately brief the denial of the motion for a judgment of acquittal; accordingly, this issue is waived. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Nguyen has not shown that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had attached at the time of his photo lineup identifications of a coconspirator and has not shown plain error with the admission of this evidence. <em>See United States v. Gouveia, </em>467 U.S. 180, 190, 104 S.Ct. 2292, 81 L.Ed.2d 146 (1984); <em>United States v. McClure, </em>786 F.2d 1286, 1290 (5th Cir.1986); <em>see also United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b1030-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
