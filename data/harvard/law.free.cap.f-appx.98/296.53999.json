Relying on <em>United States v. Doggett, </em>230 F.3d 160 (5th Cir.2000), Tran argues that his indictment contained a jurisdictional defect because it did not charge the element of the drug quantity involved in the offense. He argues that because he has no remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, he is entitled to seek relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 pursuant to the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-17\">Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 may be utilized by a federal prisoner to challenge the legality of his conviction or sentence if he can satisfy the mandate of the savings clause of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-18\">[T]he savings clause of \u00a7 2255 applies to a claim (i) that is based on a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision which establishes that the petitioner may have been convicted of a nonexistent offense and (ii) that was foreclosed by circuit law at the time when the claim should have been raised in the petitioner\u2019s trial, appeal, or first \u00a7 2255 motion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-19\"><em>Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-20\">Although on appeal Tran relies on <em>Doggett </em>to support his position, in the district court, he relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s intervening decision in <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), which was the basis for the <em>Doggett </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\"><em>Apprendi </em>does not apply retroactively to cases on collateral review, and an <em>Apprendi </em>claim does not satisfy the requirements for filing a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition under the savings clause. <em>See Wesson v. U.S. Penitentiary, Beaumont, TX, </em>305 F.3d 343, 347-48 (5th Cir.2002), <em>cert. denied, </em>537 U.S. 1241, 123 S.Ct. 1374, 155 L.Ed.2d 212 (2003). Therefore, Tran\u2019s claims do not fall within the \u201csavings clause\u201d of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. The district court\u2019s judgment dismissing the petition is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b325-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
