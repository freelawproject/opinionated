We have reviewed the administrative record and the decision of the immigration judge, designated by the Board as the final agency determination, and hold that substantial evidence supports the immigration judge\u2019s conclusion that Belay failed to establish the past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution necessary to establish eligibility for asylum. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 483, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (the burden of proof is on the alien to establish eligibility for asylum); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(a) (2003) (same). We will reverse the Board only if the evidence \u201c \u201cwas so compelling that no reasonable fact finder could fail to find the requisite fear of persecution.\u2019 \u201d <em>Rusu v. INS, </em>296 F.3d 316, 325 n. 14 (4th Cir.2002) (quoting <em>EliasZacarias, </em>502 U.S. at 483-84, 112 S.Ct. 812). We find no such compelling evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-10\">We deny Belay\u2019s petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b972-11\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
