The appellant, Daniel Bernard (\u201cBernard\u201d), appeals the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 findings of fact and also requests that his case be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. Because the Court of Federal Claims committed no clear error in its determinations of fact and because the appellant\u2019s transfer argument fails on the merits and was not raised before the Court of Federal Claims, we <em>affirm.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">Bernard was an Assistant Staff Judge Advocate in the Army\u2019s Judge Advocate General Corps. As a result of deteriorating performance on the job and apparent depression, he was evaluated by an Army staff psychiatrist at Fort Gordon in Georgia in October of 2000. The psychiatrist found him to suffer from schizoaffective disorder \u201cmanifested by [among other things] depression, flat affect, illogical thinking [and] paranoid ideation.\u201d The Army\u2019s staff psychiatrist recommended that his case be presented to the Physical Evaluation Board for a determination of his fitness for duty. After an administrative hearing, the Physical Evaluation Board (\u201cPEB\u201d) found that Bernard was physically unfit to perform the duties of his office and grade in July of 2002. Later that month, the U.S. Army Physical Disability Agency (\u201cUSAPDA\u201d) affirmed the PEB\u2019s decision and determined that Bernard\u2019s case \u201cwas properly adjudicated by the PEB.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">After the USAPDA decision, Bernard filed a timely complaint in the Court of Federal Claims making a variety of legal claims. On September 30, 2003, the court dismissed several of Bernard\u2019s claims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. (The dismissed claims include: a sexual harassment claim, a false imprisonment claim, a due process claim seeking an equitable remedy, a Privacy Act claim, a claim alleging \u201cfraudulent revocation\u201d of a security clearance, a Freedom of Information Act claim, and a variety of tort claims.) In regards to Bernard\u2019s other claims, the court found that even though they \u201cappeared] to have some relevancy to the PEB and USAPDA proceedings\u201d, they were accompanied by insufficient factual allegations and thus were \u201cinsufficient to support claims for relief that the court can adjudicate.\u201d <em>Bernard v. U.S., </em>No. 03-265C, slip. op. at 7 (Fed.Cl. Sept. 30, 2003). The court did not immediately dismiss those claims for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Instead, it suggested that Bernard seek assistance from private counsel in amending those claims. In order to give him time to consult with that counsel, the court gave Bernard until January 9, 2004 to seek leave to further amend his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-9\">Bernard timely and immediately appealed the court\u2019s September 2003 decision. His appeal involves only the claims dismissed in that decision. Pursuant to the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 54(b) certification, we have jurisdiction to hear this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-11\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 findings of fact are reviewed for clear error. <em>Hendler v. U.S., </em>175 F.3d 1374, 1378 (Fed.Cir.1999), Fed.R.Civ.P. 52(a). If the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 findings of fact are \u201cplausible in light of the record viewed in its entirety, [this court] may not reverse [them] even though convinced that had it been sitting as the trier of fact, it would have weighed the evidence differently.\u201d <em>Anderson v. City of Bessemer City, </em>470 U.S. 564, 574, 105 S.Ct. 1504, 84 L.Ed.2d 518 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-12\">The Court of Federal Claims\u2019 legal conclusions are reviewed de novo and without deference. <em>Gardner v. TEC Sys., Inc., </em>725 F.2d 1338, 1344 (Fed.Cir.1984) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b867-13\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-14\">The appellant\u2019s challenge to the factual findings in this case refers largely to the first two pages of the opinion issued by the Court of Federal Claims. <em>Bernard v. U.S., </em>No. 03-265C, slip. op. at 1-2 (Fed.Cl. Sept. 30, 2003). We conclude that all of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>facts cited by the Court of Federal Claims are supported by the record and \u201cplausible in light of the record.\u201d Therefore, this court finds that the Court of Federal Claims did not commit clear error in its findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-4\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-5\">The only legal argument that the appellant currently raises before this court is that his case should be transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. This argument is problematic for a variety of reasons, however.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-6\">First, the appellant did not raise this argument before the Court of Federal Claims. Traditional waiver principles dictate that issues that are not argued before trial courts cannot be raised for the first time before a court of appeals. <em>Finch v. Hughes Aircraft Co., </em>926 F.2d 1574, 1576 (Fed.Cir.1991) (stating that \u201cabsent exceptional circumstances, a party cannot raise on appeal legal issues not raised and considered in the trial forum.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b868-7\">Second, the federal transfer statute allows a court to transfer an entire case if the court lacks jurisdiction and the transferee court would have jurisdiction. <em>Nat'l Ctr. for Mfg. Sciences v. U.S., </em>114 F.3d 196, 198 (Fed.Cir.1997), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. The text of the transfer statute allows a court to transfer a case if it finds that \u201cthere is a want of jurisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631. But the statute does not allow for a case to be transferred piecemeal or only in part to another court. The opinion of the Court of Federal Claims that is currently before this court does not entirely dispose of all of Bernard\u2019s claims. Therefore, the Court of Federal Claims could not have used 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1631 in its September decision to transfer the appellant\u2019s entire case to the District Court for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-8\">Finally, it must be noted that because the appellant has filed an action in the District Court for the District of Columbia, he will not be deprived of judicial review because of the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 September 2003 decision. <em>See Bernard v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Defense, </em>No. 1:04-CV-00084 (D.D.C. filed Jan. 16, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b868-9\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b868-10\">Given that there was no clear error in the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 findings of fact and because the issue of transfer is not properly before this court, we affirm the decision of the Court of Federal Claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b868-11\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b868-12\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b866-14\">. This court has before it motions filed by Bernard to submit a reply brief to the government's informal brief, to strike the first six pages of the government's informal brief and to strike any reference to matters concerning attorney-client communication in the government\u2019s brief. The government filed a motion requesting leave to file a response to Bernard\u2019s motions to strike. Bernard\u2019s motion to submit a reply brief and the government\u2019s motion requesting leave to file a response to Bernard\u2019s motions to strike are granted. Both of Bernard\u2019s motions to strike are denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
