Petitioner cites no authority for this proposition and we are aware of none. The immigration judge\u2019s conclusions that conditions in Peru had changed for the better and that the applications should be denied were supported by substantial evidence. Petitioner\u2019s related argument \u2014 that delay in providing a hearing should estop the government \u2014 is similarly misplaced. That the government erroneously sent several letters to Petitioner\u2019s old address is not affirmative misconduct and does not estop enforcement of the immigration laws. <em>INS v. Miranda, </em>459 U.S. 14, 18, 103 S.Ct. 281, 74 L.Ed.2d 12 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b955-26\">Petitioner also attacks the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedures as violative of due process. This argument has been foreclosed by <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003), where we concluded that \u201cthe streamlining regulations do not vio<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>late the Due Process Clause of the Constitution.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 238.</p>\n<p id=\"b956-4\">As Petitioner\u2019s remaining arguments are without merit, the petition for review will be DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
