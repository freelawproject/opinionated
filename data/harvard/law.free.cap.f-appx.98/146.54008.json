Because the parties are fully familiar with the background facts and procedural history we need not set them forth, and limit our discussion to our <em>ratio decidendi. </em>This appeal is grounded primarily on Boyd\u2019s contentions that she was essentially forced to go through with the hearing before the Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) without counsel, and that the ALJ then did not adequately develop the record. The other issue is whether substantial evidence supports the Commissioner\u2019s determination that Boyd could perform, at a minimum, sedentary work. We will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">We reject Boyd\u2019s claim that she was compelled to proceed without representation,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> notwithstanding her lament that she agreed to proceed with the hearing because she could not then afford a lawyer. On the form for requesting an administrative hearing, the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) advised Boyd of her right to representation. Moreover, prior to the hearing, the Agency sent Boyd two additional notices advising her of her right to be represented at the administrative hearing. One notice included a publication entitled <em>Your Right to Representation, </em>which is available at <em>http:// www.ssa.gov/pubs/10075.pdf </em>(Feb.2002) and which: (1) notes that SSA can provide a list of available representatives; (2) explained what a representative could do; (3) explained what a representative could charge; (4) explained what fee a claimant would have to pay; and (5) provided a telephone number to call if claimant had any questions about the right to representation. The ALJ also gave instructions to Boyd about the availability of counsel, offering to continue the hearing for her to secure a representative or another attorney. Yet, as Magistrate Judge Angel\u00ed noted, there is no suggestion that Ms. Boyd was not qualified to make the decision: She is literate, has held several jobs including a short-time position as service supervisor where she \u201csupervised other people\u201d and \u201cused technical knowledge or skills.\u201d She also received special training in hospitality and housekeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">In total, Boyd received notification of her right to representation throughout the administrative proceedings on six separate occasions, including a listing of available representation. And her prior counsel, <em>see supra </em>note 1, was affiliated with one such group, Community Legal Services. We have held that where a claimant has been notified of her right to representation and has knowingly waived that right, lack of representation is not sufficient, in itself, to justify a remand. <em>Livingston v. Califano, </em>614 F.2d 342, 345 (3d Cir.1980). On the basis of the facts described above, we are satisfied that Boyd had full knowledge of her right to representation and did not pursue it; hence she waived the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-14\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-15\">We also reject Boyd\u2019s contention that even if she knowingly waived her right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>counsel, she was prejudiced because the ALJ did not fully develop the record, requiring a remand. The ALJ here adequately developed the record, which included numerous medical reports from specialists, state agency physicians, and a vocational expert. In addition, the ALJ questioned Boyd about her alleged subjective complaints and symptoms.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">There is no evidence of prejudice from failure to develop the record. Boyd argues that the record needed further development due to her alleged anxiety, but there is no significant evidence of a real anxiety problem. Moreover, no specialist noted that Boyd had a mental impairment, and the state agency psychologist found no evidence of a mental impairment. In short, there was not enough evidence of a mental impairment to compel the ALJ to obtain a consultative psychological examination.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Finally, we are satisfied that substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s decision that, despite her impairments, Boyd could perform sedentary work in the local and national economy. This finding is supported by Dr. Leon Cander\u2019s findings after physical examination and the Residual Functional Capacity Assessment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> More specifically, both the physical examination (objective signs) and the history support this finding. Moreover, the vocational expert, based on the medical picture, opined that a person of Boyd\u2019s age, education, vocational profile, and residual functional capacity could perform approximately two hundred job titles, such as: (1) a label cutter; (2) cutter/poster; (3) bander; and (4) an order clerk. The vocational expert further testified that all of these jobs existed in significant numbers in the local and national economy.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-10\">Boyd\u2019s approach to this facet of the case is somewhat oblique. She argues that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AFa\">As stated by this Court Appellee\u2019s aforesaid burden to rebut Appellant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case is a significant one: \u201cThe cases demonstrate that, consistent with the legislative purpose, courts have mandated that leniency be shown in establishing the claimant\u2019s disability, and that the Secretary\u2019s responsibility to rebut it be strictly construed.\u201d <em>Dobrowolsky v. Califano, </em>606 F.2d 403, 406-407 (3rd Cir.1979). (Emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-11\">Pursuant to our above arguments, where Appellee has failed to seek evidence from even those treating sources long identified by the unrepresented indigent claimant, and has otherwise failed to develop issues brought directly to her attention, it is clear that Appellee cannot satisfy her \u201cstrict burden\u201d to rebut Appellant\u2019s <em>prima facie </em>case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-12\">We have concluded, however, that the proceedings were not flawed by the absence of representation, that the record was adequately developed, and that there was substantial evidence supporting the ALJ\u2019s finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-13\">The order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-11\">. Actually Boyd was represented by counsel for a time during the administrative proceedings, but counsel withdrew before the hearing.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b176-7\">. We also note that in the more than two years since the ALJ decided this case, Boyd has not submitted any additional medical records, which further suggests that the record was adequately developed and that she was not prejudiced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b176-15\">. We have also examined the medical reports of Michael Jay Korman, M.D., Matthew V. Gillane, P.T., Gerald E. Dworkin, D.O., Philip S. Kim, M.D., and Richard B. Kanoff, D.O. None of them is at odds with Dr. Cander\u2019s evaluation, including those of Dr. Korman, the pulmonary specialist.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
