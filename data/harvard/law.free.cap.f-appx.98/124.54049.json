For the reasons detailed below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">Because we write only for the parties, we will not restate the full facts of the case. The following facts are undisputed and are drawn from Mr. Afeaneku\u2019s asylum application, his unsworn supplemental submission in support of the asylum application, and his direct and cross-examination at a hearing before the immigration judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">Afeaneku worked in The Republic of Togo as a merchant seaman. Since 1989, he also was an active member of the Union of Forces of Change (UFC), a \u201cpolitical group seeking to oust the present military dictatorship.\u201d Administrative Record (AR) at 325. In the UFC, he served as an \u201cagitator\u201d and \u201ctruck distributor,\u201d his role being to explain democratic concepts to the Togolese people and to distribute political leaflets. AR at 94, 103-04 (Tr. of Hr\u2019g Sept. 24, 1997). In 1993, while he was a crew member aboard the ship M/S Nestor in Abidjan, a city in the African nation of Ivory Coast, Afeaneku received flyers calling for boycott of the Togo presidential elections which were intended for delivery to UFC officials in Lome, Togo. <em>See id. </em>at 329 (Addendum to Asylum Application dated Jun. 27, 1997).. When he arrived in Togo, he loaded the boxes of flyers and his personal belongings into a taxi to carry home. While still in the port, one of the boxes of flyers broke open, spilling out some flyers, a number of which were subsequently found by Togolese customs agents. Afeaneku delivered the remainder of the flyers to a UFC official in Togo. The following day, Togolese police searched the ship and questioned him regarding his activities. He was not arrested, and the police permitted him to depart Togo by ship the following night. Afeaneku had no interactions with the police between the 1993 flyer incident and April 1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-15\">In April 1996, Afeaneku and his then employer Sorinco Marine \u2014 a commercial shipping concern \u2014 had a dispute over Afeaneku\u2019s compensation. As a result, Afeaneku threatened to file suit against Sorinco Marine. Shortly after that, a Sorinco Marine official \u201cwent to the police and expose[d][to] them the facts regarding [his] involvement in getting those political fl[y]ers.\u201d AR at 329 (Addendum to Asylum Application dated Jun. 27, 1997). The Togolese police issued a series of convocations for Afeaneku to report to the police headquarters. <em>See id. </em>at 127 (Trans, of Hr\u2019g Sept. 24, 1997). The convocations do not state the reason for their issuance. Afeaneku stated his belief that the convocations relate to the 1993 flyers issue because he \u201cdidn\u2019t commit any [other] crime\u201d in the interim period. <em>Id. </em>at 139. He also stated his belief that the Togolese government would be concerned in 1996 about the 1993 activities because the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>was attempting to stamp out opposition for the 1998 presidential election. He provided no additional evidence in support of the claimed connection between the 1993 episode and the 1996 convocations.</p>\n<p id=\"A_\">Although Afeaneku threw away the first two convocations because he was \u201cso angry,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 127, he went into hiding for seven days and, in April 1996, fled to the United States. He testified that although he was wanted by Togolese authorities, he was able to pass through Togolese passport control on his way out of Togo to the United States under \u201csome kind of arrangement.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">Afeaneku entered the United States on June 24, 1996 as in-transit seaman with authorization to remain in the United States no later than July 22, 1996. He remained in the United States following that date. On February 28, 1997, he filed an application for asylum and withholding of deportation, in which he stated that he believed that because of his involvement in the activities of the UFC, his life was in danger if he returned to Togo. Afeaneku stated he delayed from applying for asylum from June 1996 until February 1997 because he did not initially intend to stay in the United States, but subsequently decided that \u201chis life was in serious danger.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">On May 14, 1997, the INS instituted removal proceedings against him. On June 27, 1997, Afeaneku appeared before an immigration judge (IJ). In that hearing, he conceded deportability. <em>See id. </em>at 67. On September 24, 1997, he appeared before the IJ for a hearing on the merits of his application. He was the only witness to testify at his merits hearing. At the request of INS counsel, the hearings were continued to allow forensic examination of Afeaneku\u2019s convocation documents. On March 27, 1998, the hearings continued, at which time INS counsel reported that he was unable to obtain forensic examination of the convocation documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">At that close of that hearing, the IJ rendered an oral decision denying Afeaneku\u2019s application for asylum and withholding of removal, and ordered him removed to Togo. In reaching her decision, the IJ first recognized that Afeaneku did not assert any claim of past persecution, but rather based his claim solely on fear of future persecution on account of political opinion or membership in the UFC if he returned to Togo. The IJ also noted the paucity of record information regarding the UFC, and that the only reference to the UFC in the State Department\u2019s country report was that the party general\u2019s secretary was detained and released after thirty-six hours. AR at 39 (Tr. of Mar. 27, 1998 Hr\u2019g); <em>id. </em>at 188 (U.S. Dep\u2019t of State Togo Report on Human Rights Practices for 1997, dated Jan. 30, 1998) (\u201cIn December security forces detained Jean-Pierre Fabre, the Secretary General of [the UFC] Party..... The Government ... did not file charges, and released Fabre after a 36-hour detention.\u201d). \u201cOther than that,\u201d the IJ concluded, \u201cthere is no general information that would indicate a pattern or practice of persecution against members of [Afeaneku\u2019s] political party.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 39. The IJ noted that Afeaneku conceded that he was never threatened with arrest and never experienced any problems with the government of Togo in clear connection with the 1993 flyer incident other than the 1993 questioning. Based on the record evidence, the IJ concluded, Afeaneku failed to establish any causal link between the 1993 distribution of political leaflets and the 1996 convocations. Moreover, reasoned the IJ, the record establishes that \u201ceven more prominent members of [the UFC] have been taken into custody for very brief questioning\u201d and \u201chave not been held for any lengthy period of time.\u201d <em>Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>at 49. Thus, concluded the IJ, it \u201cdoes not follow that [Afeaneku], who passed leaflets out years ago, has a reasonable fear of persecution by the government as a result,\u201d particularly in light of the absence of any \u201cevidence of any person similarly situated to [Afeaneku] who had been persecuted by the government in such a manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">On May 31, 2002, the Board <em>of </em>Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision. Afeaneku appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">\u201cA grant of asylum allows an otherwise-removable alien to stay in the United States.\u201d <em>Abdulai v. Ashcroft, </em>239 F.3d 542, 545 (3d Cir.2001). \u201cSubject to numerous exceptions not implicated in this case, the Attorney General may grant asylum to an alien he determines to be a refugee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal citations and quotation marks omitted). As relevant to this case, a person is a \u201crefugee\u201d if he or she is \u201cunable or unwilling\u201d to return home \u201cbecause of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of ... political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">\u201cWithholding of removal, in contrast, confers only the right not to be deported to a particular country - not a right to remain in this one.\u201d <em>Abdulai </em>239 F.3d at 545 (citing <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 419, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999)). An alien is entitled to withholding of removal \u201cif the alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in that country because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A). In contrast to the discretionary relief available to individuals who qualify for political asylum, \u201cif an alien qualifies for withholding of deportation ... then the Attorney General is prohibited from deporting the alien to the country where the prosecution will occur.\u201d <em>Lin v. INS, </em>238 F.3d 239, 244 (3d Cir.2001). To qualify for mandatory relief under withholding of deportation, an applicant must show that it is more likely than not that he will face persecution if he is deported. <em>See id. </em>Because this standard is more stringent then the well-founded fear of persecution standard required for asylum, an alien who fails to satisfy the well-founded fear standard also fails to satisfy the standard for withholding of removal. <em>Janusiak v. U.S. INS, </em>947 F.2d 46, 47 (3d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b155-10\">We have jurisdiction to review a final order of removal pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1). When, as in this case, the BIA employs its streamlining procedures, \u201cwe review the IJ\u2019s opinion and scrutinize its reasoning.\u201d <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, 353 F.3d </em>228, 245 (3d Cir.2003) (en banc). We review the IJ\u2019s determination that Afeaneku failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Togo under the substantial evidence standard. <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 483. Under that standard, Afeaneku must show \u201cthat the evidence he presented was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find\u201d that he has a well-founded fear of persecution. <em>Lukwago v. Ashcroft, </em>329 F.3d 157, 167 (3d Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Abdille, </em>242 F.3d at 484). We can only reverse if we are convinced that the record \u201cnot only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-11\">Afeaneku has not shown that the record satisfies that standard. For substantially the same reasons identified by the IJ and summarized above, we are persuaded that substantial evidence supported the IJ\u2019s finding that Afeaneku failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of persecution if returned to Togo. <em>A fortiori </em>Afeaneku has not shown that the evidence compels a finding that there is a \u201cclear probability\u201d of persecution, the standard required to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>justify a reversal of the IJ\u2019s denial of his application for withholding of removal. <em>Janusiak </em>947 F.2d at 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review of the Board of Immigration Appeals is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
