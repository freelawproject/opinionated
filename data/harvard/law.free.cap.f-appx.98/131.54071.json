She conceded removability and sought cancellation of removal and voluntary departure. She petitions for review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which summarily affirmed the order of an Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) denying Bienvenida\u2019s application for cancellation of removal under Section 240(A)(b)(l) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>The sole issue in Bienvenida\u2019s petition is whether the BIA\u2019s streamhning procedure under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), on its face, violates Bienvenida\u2019s due process and equal protection rights. We have jurisdiction over the petition pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">In <em>Dia v. Ashcroft, </em>353 F.3d 228 (3d Cir.2003), we held that another section of the BIA\u2019s streamlining regulations, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7), does not run afoul of the Fifth Amendment due process clause. <em>Id. </em>at 238-45. We concluded in <em>Dia </em>that there is \u201cnothing \u2018unfair\u2019 in a constitutional sense about the ... streamhning procedures. An apphcant retains a full and fair opportunity to make his case to the IJ, and has a right to review of that decision by the BIA, and then by a court of appeals .... The fact that the review is done by one member of the BIA and that the decision is not accompanied by a fully reasoned BIA decision may be less desirable from the petitioner\u2019s point of view, but it does not make the process constitutionally \u2018unfair.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 243-44.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">Here, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s denial of Bienvenida\u2019s apphcation for cancellation of removal under a different subsection of the streamhning procedure, 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4). The language and functioning of that section, however, is substantially similar to that of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7) with respect to the procedure by which a BIA member summarily affirms an IJ\u2019s opinion; it expands the use of the BIA\u2019s summary affirmance procedure rather than changes the procedure itself. <em>Compare </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7)(h) (\u201cThe single Board Member ... may affirm the decision of the [IJ], without opinion ....\u201d), <em>with </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4)(I) (\u201cThe Board Member ... shall affirm the decision of the [IJ], without opinion....\u201d). Moreover, the \u201cfairness\u201d argument that Bienvenida raises in her Fifth Amendment due process claim, Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 3-4, 5, 5-6, is precisely one of the arguments we rejected in <em>Dia </em>in upholding 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(a)(7). We therefore find <em>Dia </em>to be the controlling precedent for this case, and reject Bienvenida\u2019s Fifth Amendment due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Bienvenida also attempts to raise a Fourteenth Amendment equal protection challenge to the BIA\u2019s streamhning procedure. Petitioner\u2019s Br. at 5. We are not persuaded by her claim. To the extent that Bienvenida\u2019s equal protection argument is an extension of her due process claim as set forth above, we reject her argument because the BIA\u2019s streamhning procedure, on its face, does not violate Bienvenida\u2019s due process rights. To the extent that Bienvenida seeks to establish an independent equal protection violation for the streamlining procedure in question, she has failed to establish any basis for such a claim in her petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">We will therefore deny Bienvenida\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
