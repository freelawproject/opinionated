Almost 14 years later, Rhan Powell- admitted he was one of the two passengers who robbed Cuenca. He also attested that Elvin Hill was the second passenger \u2014 the one who carried the weapon and pulled the trigger. The Government filed an indictment, charging Hill with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j)(l) for committing a firearm-related murder in the course of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). In this case, the crime of violence was Hobbs Act robbery, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1). Hill pleaded not guilty, proceeded to trial, and was convicted of the charged offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>This case raises the question whether Hobbs Act robbery is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Hill argues that Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify categorically as a crime of violence under the statute\u2019s \u201cforce clause,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), because it can be committed without physical force or the threatened deployment of the same. He also contends that Hobbs Act robbery cannot qualify as a crime of violence under the \u201crisk-of-force clause,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), because the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2551, 192 L.Ed.2d 569 <em>(Johnson II) </em>(2015), effectively rendered that clause unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">We reject both arguments and hold that Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment of conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">BACKGROUND<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">Fredy Cuenca was a livery cab driver in New York City. One afternoon, on June 29, 1997, he received a call from his dispatcher requesting a pickup in the Bush-wick neighborhood of Brooklyn. Two young men, Elvin Hill and Rhan Powell, entered Cuenca\u2019s cab. According to Powell, as they were reaching the destination, Cuenca quoted the fare price, $10, which was higher than Hill and Powell had anticipated. Powell suggested to Hill that they rob Cuenca. When Cuenca stopped the cab, Hill yelled out, \u201c[g]ive me the fucking money.\u201d Joint App\u2019x 295. Cuenca handed some money he had in his hand to Powell. As Powell was exiting the vehicle, Cuenca began to plead for his life in broken English, pointing to a photograph of his children on the dashboard. Outside the vehicle, Powell then heard a loud sound and saw \u201cred on the windshield.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 296. Hill had shot Cuenca \u2014 once, in the head\u2014 with a previously concealed handgun. Hill and Powell fled the scene. Cuenca died.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">Several witnesses heard the fatal gunshot and saw two young men exiting the cab and fleeing the scene. One witness identified Hill as one of the assailants during a lineup conducted about two months after the crime.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But Hill was not charged with the crime at that time. Rather, the indictment came nearly 15 years later.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-14\">On April 26, 2011, Powell testified before a grand jury in the Eastern District of New York and admitted that he was one of the two passengers involved in the 1997 robbery. He testified that Hill was the one who had killed Cuenca. On March 22, 2012, another federal grand jury, relying in part on Powell\u2019s 2011 testimony, returned an indictment against Hill. Therein, Hill was charged with violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j)(l), for committing a firearms-related murder in the course of a \u201ccrime of violence,\u201d as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). The alleged predicate crime of violence was Hobbs Act robbery, as defined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b163-15\">Hill pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Matsumoto, /.). On January 24, 2014, the jury returned a guilty verdict. The district court sentenced Hill to 43 years\u2019 imprisonment and entered a judgment of conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>dated October 3, 2014. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">This opinion addresses one of Hill\u2019s claims on appeal: whether Hobbs Act robbery is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d within the meaning of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). Hill argues that Hobbs Act robbery does not qualify as a crime of violence on two grounds. First, he claims that Hobbs Act robbery fails to categorically constitute a crime of violence under the statute\u2019s \u201cforce clause,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Second, he argues that the \u201crisk-of-force clause,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), should be deemed void for vagueness under the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Johnson II. </em>We reject both contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">We begin with the interlocking statutory provisions involved in this appeal. Hill was indicted and convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(j)(l). This provision specifies as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-8\">A person who, in the course of a violation of subsection (c), causes the death of a person through the use of a firearm, shall[,] ... if the killing is a murder (as defined in section 1111), be punished by death or by imprisonment for any term of years or for life....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">Section 924(c)(1)(A) in turn explains that \u201cany person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence ..., uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm\u201d violates subsection (c). Critically, subsection (c) defines the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as \u201can offense that is a felony\u201d and</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-10\">(A) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against th\u00e9 person or property of another, or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b164-13\">(B) that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3). We refer to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) as the \u201cforce clause\u201d and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as the \u201crisk-of-force clause.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b164-15\">The \u201ccrime of violence\u201d alleged in Hill\u2019s indictment was Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951. Section 1951(a) penalizes a person who \u201cin any way or degree obstructs, delays, or affects commerce ... by robbery or extortion or attempts or conspires so to do, or commits or threatens physical violence to any person or property in furtherance of a plan or purpose to do anything in violation of this section.\u201d And \u00a7 1951(b)(1) defines \u201crobbery\u201d to mean</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AK9\">the unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his person or property, or property in his custody or possession, or the person or property of a relative or member of his family or of anyone in his company at the time of the taking or obtaining.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b164-17\">Taking these statutes together, the jury found that Hill used a firearm to commit a Hobbs Act robbery \u2014 pursuant to the Government\u2019s theory, a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under the firearm statute \u2014 and, in the course of that robbery, he murdered Cuen-ca in violation of \u00a7 924(j)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">We first consider Hill\u2019s claim that Hobbs Act robbery categorically fails to constitute a crime of violence under the force clause. To determine whether an offense is a crime of violence, courts employ what has come to be known as the \u201ccategorical approach.\u201d <em>Taylor v. United States, </em>495 U.S. 575, 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143, 109 L.Ed.2d 607 (1990); <em>see also Mathis v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2243, 2248-49, 195 L.Ed.2d 604 (2016) (outlining the categorical approach); <em>Descamps v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2276, 2281, 186 L.Ed.2d 438 (2013) (same); <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>470 F.3d 132, 135 (2d Cir. 2006) (per curiam) (applying the categorical approach to determine whether a predicate crime was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under \u00a7 924(c)). We have explained that the categorical approach is \u201c \u2018not only consistent with both precedent and sound policy\u2019 but[ ] also ... \u2018necessary in view of the language of the applicable statutes.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vargas-Sarmiento v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>448 F.3d 159, 167 (2d Cir. 2006) (quoting <em>Jobson v. Ashcroft, </em>326 F.3d 367, 372 (2d Cir. 2003)). The categorical approach guides our analysis here.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">Under the categorical approach, courts identify \u201cthe minimum criminal conduct necessary for conviction under a particular statute.\u201d <em>Acosta, </em>470 F.3d at 135. In doing so, courts \u201c \u2018look only to the statutory defi<em>nitions\u2019 </em>\u2014 ie., the elements \u2014 of [the] ... offense[], and <em>not </em>\u2018to the particular [underlying] facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2283 (quoting <em>Taylor, </em>495 U.S. at 600, 110 S.Ct. 2143); <em>see also Acosta, </em>470 F.3d at 135 (\u201c[W]e focus on the intrinsic nature of the offense rather than on the circumstances of the particular crime.\u201d). The reviewing court \u201ccannot go behind the offense as it was charged to reach [its] own determination as to whether the underlying facts\u201d qualify the offense as, in this case, a crime of violence. <em>Ming Lam Sui v. INS, </em>250 F.3d 105, 117-18 (2d Cir. 2001) (quoting <em>Lewis v. INS, </em>194 F.3d 539, 543 (4th Cir. 1999)). As relevant here, the categorical approach requires us to consider the minimum conduct necessary for a conviction of the predicate offense (in this case, a Hobbs Act robbery), and then to consider whether such conduct amounts to a crime of violence under \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-13\">One final point remains. Critically, the Supreme Court has made clear in employing the categorical approach that to show a predicate conviction is not a crime of violence \u201crequires more than the application of legal imagination to [the] ... statute\u2019s language.\u201d <em>Gonzales v. Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. 183, 193, 127 S.Ct. 815, 166 L.Ed.2d 683 (2007). As relevant here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>there must be \u201ca realistic probability, not a theoretical possibility,\u201d that the statute at issue could be applied to conduct that does not constitute a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>To show that a particular reading of the statute is realistic, a defendant \u201cmust at least point to his own case or other cases in which the ... courts in fact did apply the statute in the ... manner for which he argues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>To that end, the categorical approach must be grounded in reality, logic, and precedent, not flights of fancy. <em>See Moncrieffe v. Holder, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1678, 1684-85, 185 L.Ed.2d 727 (2013) (noting that \u201cfocus on the minimum conduct criminalized by the [relevant] statute is not an invitation to apply \u2018legal imagination\u2019 to the ... offense\u201d (quoting <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815)).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">The question whether Hobbs Act robbery constitutes a crime of violence under the force clause is a matter of first impression in our Circuit.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have, however, previously stated that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery is a crime of violence under the Bail Reform Act (which employs the same definition of the term as in \u00a7 924(c)(3)) because one of the elements of the offense \u201cis actual or threatened use of force\u201d and \u201cif the element of violence is not present, no conviction under section 1951 can occur.\u201d <em>United States v. DiSomma, </em>951 F.2d 494, 496 (2d Cir. 1991) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1)); <em>see also United States v. Santos, </em>449 F.3d 93, 99 (2d Cir. 2005) (noting that conspiracy to commit Hobbs Act robbery requires an intent to take personal property \u201cby force\u201d); <em>cf. VAM Check Cashing Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>699 F.3d 727, 730 n.2 (2d Cir. 2012) (suggesting that the definition of robbery in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 \u201climit[s] the crime to larcenies committed by force or threat of force\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">As stated above, the term \u201crobbery\u201d in the Hobbs Act is defined, in relevant part, as \u201cthe unlawful taking or obtaining of personal property from the person or in the presence of another, against his will, by means of actual or threatened force, or violence, or fear of injury, immediate or future, to his person or property.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(b)(1). Hill does not dispute that at least two of the ways in which a Hobbs Act robbery may be accomplished (by means of \u201cactual or threatened force\u201d or \u201cviolence\u201d) would appear, self-evidently, to satisfy \u00a7 924(c)\u2019s force clause (defining a crime of violence as any felony that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another\u201d). He focuses instead on those Hobbs Act robberies accomplished by means of putting the victim in \u201cfear of injury\u201d to his person or property, arguing that such robberies can be accomplished <em>without </em>the \u201cuse, at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>tempted use, or threatened use of physical force\u201d so that the minimum conduct necessary to commit a Hobbs Act robbery does not include the element necessary to qualify such robberies as crimes of violence for the purpose of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A). Hill primarily advances two arguments to support this contention. We disagree with both.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">Hill first contends that a perpetrator could rob a victim by putting him in fear of injury to his property through non-forceful means. He offers hypothetieals such as threatening to throw paint on the victim\u2019s house, to spray paint his car, or, most colorfully, to \u201cpour[] chocolate syrup on his passport.\u201d Hill Supp. Br. 29. Hill argues that <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>559 U.S. 133, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 <em>(Johnson I) </em>(2010), made clear that the physical force that must be used, attempted, or threatened to satisfy statutory language such as that in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) must be \u201cviolent,\u201d \u201cgreat,\u201d or \u201cstrong.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> On that basis, Hill argues that, assuming his hypothetical acts would indeed be sufficient to put a victim in \u201cfear of injury\u201d to his property so that a Hobbs Act robbery might be accomplished (a proposition that is hardly obvious as a practical and prece-dential matter), the force employed in these hypothetical cases would be insufficient to satisfy the standard in <em>Johnson </em>7.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">Hill\u2019s argument rests on a flawed reading of <em>Johnson I. </em>In that case, the Court declined to construe \u201cphysical force\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) in line with the common-law crime of battery, which deemed the element of \u201cforce\u201d to be satisfied \u201cby even the slightest offensive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>touching.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> 559 U.S. at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265. But in rejecting this interpretive approach, the Court did <em>not </em>construe \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae to require that a particular quantum of force be employed or threatened to satisfy its physical force requirement. The Court concluded, instead, that \u201cphysical force\u201d as used in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)\u00ae (which defines a violent felony in relevant part as a crime that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d) means simply <em>\u201cviolent </em>force \u2014 that is, force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d 559 U.S. at 140, 130 S.Ct. 1265; <em>see also United States v. Castleman, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 134 S.Ct. 1405, 1417, 188 L.Ed.2d 426 (2014) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (rejecting the argument that <em>Johnson I </em>\u201crequires force capable of inflicting \u2018serious\u2019 bodily injury,\u201d as opposed to \u201cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury, serious or otherwise\u201d). Assuming <em>arguendo </em>Johnson I\u2019s relevance to the construction of \u00a7 924(c)(3), \u201cphysical force\u201d as used in the provision at issue here means no more nor less than force capable of causing physical pain or injury to a person <em>or </em>injury to property. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(3) (defining \u201ccrime of violence\u201d in relevant part as a felony with an element requiring \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person <em>or property </em>of another\u201d (emphasis added)). Hill\u2019s hypotheticals then \u2014 to the degree that they would indeed satisfy the Hobbs Act\u2019s \u201cfear of injury\u201d standard \u2014 do not fail to involve the use or threatened use of physical force.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">Hill\u2019s second claim is no more successful. Hill next contends that an individual can commit a Hobbs Act robbery without using or threatening the use of physical force by putting the victim in fear of injury through such means, <em>inter alia, </em>as threatening to withhold vital medicine from the victim or to poison him. Lacking any case in which a defendant was in fact convicted for committing Hobbs Act robbery through such means, Hill relies principally on these hypotheticals to argue that such conduct entails an insufficient direct application of physical force to satisfy the force clause\u2014 even if it indisputably involves the threatened <em>indirect </em>application of force. These hypotheticals are insufficient because a defendant is required to \u201cpoint to his own case or other cases in which the ... courts in fact did apply the statute\u201d in such a manner to show that there is a \u201crealistic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>probability\u201d that the Hobbs Act would reach the conduct Hill describes. <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that there is indeed a \u201crealistic probability\u201d that the Hobbs Act would reach the conduct Hill describes (or analogous conduct), we again disagree that these hypothetical demonstrate that a Hobbs Act robbery is not categorically a crime of violence for the purpose of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">Hill argues, in effect, that placing a victim in fear of injury by threatening the indirect application of physical force is not sufficient to constitute the threatened use of physical force. Yet the Supreme Court has suggested otherwise. In <em>Castleman, </em>the Supreme Court, construing \u201cphysical force\u201d as it is employed in connection with \u00a7 922(g)(9), made clear that physical force \u201cencompasses even its indirect application,\u201d as when a battery is committed by administering a poison: \u201cThat the harm occurs indirectly, rather than directly (as with a kick or punch), does not matter\u201d lest we conclude that pulling the trigger on a gun involves no use of force \u201cbecause it is the bullet, not the trigger, that actually strikes the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> 134 S.Ct. at 1414-15. Hill offers no persuasive reason why the same principle should not apply to the construction of \u00a7 924(c)(3), so that, as regarding the Hobbs Act, a robbery still has as an element \u201cthe use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another,\u201d notwithstanding that it is accomplished by threatening to poison a victim, rather than to shoot him. Some threats do not require specification of any particular means in order to be effective; yet they still threaten <em>some </em>type of violence and the application of <em>some </em>force. Consider: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice car \u2014 would you like to be able to continue driving it?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">Hill relies on <em>Chrzanoski v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 188, 194 (2d Cir. 2003), to argue that \u201cthe act of placing another in fear of injury\u201d constitutes, \u201cat best,\u201d a \u201cthreat of <em>injury,\u201d </em>which is not the same as a threat of physical force. Hill Supp. Br. 24-25. In <em>Chrzanoski, </em>we addressed a Connecticut misdemeanor that criminalized causing injury to another person, concluding that the misdemeanor at issue there was not a crime of violence for the purpose of deportation proceedings and as defined in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(a) because it did not require that injury be caused through the use of physical force.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> 327 F.3d at 195-96; <em>see </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number><em>also Vargas-Sarmiento, </em>448 F.3d at 175 n.10 (noting that, in <em>Chrzanoski, </em>\u201c[because the plain language of the Connecticut statute did not make use of force an explicit or implicit element, we ruled that misdemeanor third degree assault was not a crime of violence under \u00a7 16(a)\u201d).

To the degree that any aspect of <em>Chrzano-ski\u2019&amp; </em>reasoning suggests that the conduct Hill describes does not involve the threatened use of physical force, moreover, the <em>Chrzanoski </em>panel did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s reasoning in Cas-<em>tleman </em>to the effect that a use of physical force can encompass acts undertaken to cause physical harm, even when the harm occurs indirectly (as with poisoning) \u201crather than directly (as with a kick or punch).\u201d <em>Castleman, </em>134 S.Ct. at 1415; <em>see also Vargas-Sarmiento, </em>448 F.3d at 175 (observing, in the context of \u00a7 16(b), that \u201cwe are not persuaded by [the] argument that first-degree manslaughter is not a crime of violence when it is committed by a person who intentionally poisons the food of an unwitting victim rather than by a person who directly injects the poison into his victim\u2019s arm[, as i]n either situation, the killer has intentionally availed himself of the forceful physical properties of poison to cause death\u201d).

Hill does not contend otherwise. Instead, he argues that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is inapplicable here on the ground that the risk-of-force clause is void for vagueness in light of <em>Johnson II. </em>For the following reasons, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">The Fifth Amendment guarantees that \u201c[n]o person shall ... be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of- law.\u201d From this constitutional provision stems the proscription against vague criminal laws. \u201cThe void-for-vagueness doctrine prohibits the government from imposing sanctions \u2018under a criminal law so vague that it fails to give ordinary people fair notice of the conduct it punishes, or so standardless that it invites arbitrary enforcement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Welch v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1257, 1262, 194 L.Ed.2d 387 (2016) (quoting <em>Johnson II, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2556).</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">In <em>Johnson II, </em>the Supreme Court concluded that the \u201cresidual clause\u201d of the ACCA, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), is unconstitutionally vague. 135 \u25a0 S.Ct. at 2557. Before <em>Johnson II, </em>the ACCA worked as follows. In general, an individual who unlawfully possessed a firearm could be punished by up to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g), 924(a)(2). But if the violator had three or more prior convictions for a \u201cserious drug offense\u201d or a \u201cviolent felony,\u201d the ACCA extended his or her prison term to a minimum of 15 years and a maximum of life. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1). The ACCA defined a \u201cviolent felony\u201d as any felony that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-12\">(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b171-13\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <em>otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. ...</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b171-14\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added). <em>Johnson II </em>determined that the so-called \u201cresidual clause\u201d of subsection (ii), italicized above, is constitutionally invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-15\">The Supreme Court in <em>Johnson II </em>determined that \u201c[t]wo features of the residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2557. In particular, the Court focused on the double-layered uncertainty embedded in the clause\u2019s operation \u2014 which required courts employing the categorical approach first to estimate the potential risk of physical injury posed by \u201ca judicially imagined \u2018ordinary case\u2019 of [the] crime\u201d at issue, and then to consider how this risk of injury compared to the risk posed by the four enumerated crimes, which are themselves, the Court noted, \u201cfar from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number><em>Id. </em>at 2557-58 (quoting <em>Begay v.

It was these twin <em>ambiguities </em>\u2014 \u201ccombining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony\u201d \u2014 that offended the Constitution. <em>Id. </em>at 2558 (emphasis added); <em>see also id. </em>at 2560 (observing that \u201c[e]ach of the uncertainties in the residual clause may be tolerable in isolation, but \u2018their sum makes a task for us which at best could be only guesswork\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>United States v. Evans, </em>333 U.S. 483, 495, 68 S.Ct. 634, 92 L.Ed. 823 (1948))).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">We conclude that the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation for its conclusion in <em>Johnson II </em>renders that case inapplicable to the risk-of-force clause at issue here. Section 924(c)(3)(B) does not involve the double-layered uncertainty present in <em>Johnson II. </em>Granted, courts construing the provision must grapple with assessing the risk of physical force posed by the \u201cordinary\u201d instance of a predicate crime. Assessing whether a felony, by its nature, poses a substantial risk that \u201cphysical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense,\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), however, is a far narrower and simpler undertaking than divining whether a felony, not being one of four enumerated, but disparate crimes, \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). A straightforward comparison of the texts of the two provisions \u2014 analyzed in light of the reasoning in <em>Johnson II </em>and other case law\u2014 makes clear that Hill is mistaken in suggesting that the provisions are materially indistinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">First, and most obviously, the risk-of-force clause contains no mystifying list of offenses and no indeterminate \u201cotherwise\u201d phraseology \u2014 a defining feature of the ACCA\u2019s residual clause that, in <em>Johnson II, </em>was understood to add an additional layer of uncertainty as to \u201chow much risk it takes for a crime to qualify as a violent felony.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2558. In <em>Johnson II, </em>the Court cited this list as a key aspect of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), distinguishing the ACCA\u2019s residual clause from other laws that the Government warned could be vulnerable to vagueness challenge. Indeed, the Court rejected the Government\u2019s argument that its decision in <em>Johnson II </em>would draw into question statutes that, like the one here, do not \u201clink[ ] a phrase such as \u2018substantial risk\u2019 to a confusing list of examples.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2561. Moreover, an analysis of the Court\u2019s <em>pre-Johnson II </em>precedents attempting to construe the residual clause makes clear that the presence of these enumerated offenses was, as <em>Johnson II </em>suggested, the prime cause of uncertainty in that provision, and the key obstacle to consistent judicial construction.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>Court recognized in <em>Begay, </em>the enumerated offenses are \u201cfar from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.\u201d 553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581. The Court reaffirmed this point in <em>Johnson II, </em>noting the absence of apparent commonalities among the enumerated offenses, and the confusion thereby generated in construing the residual provision. <em>See </em>135 S.Ct. at 2557-60. In short, as <em>Johnson II </em>itself attests, it is evident that the Court\u2019s \u201crepeated failures to craft a principled and objective standard out of the residual clause\u201d were failures in large part because of the list of enumerated offenses. 135 S.Ct. at 2558.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">Moreover, even if the list of enumerated offenses is not alone sufficient to distinguish the residual clause in <em>Johnson II </em>from the risk-of-force clause at issue here (a conclusion which would ignore the Court\u2019s fraught history with the residual clause), the text of the risk-of-force clause <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>differs in additional, material ways. The ACCA\u2019s residual clause defines crimes as violent felonies if they, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cpres-ente] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). This terminology is materially different from that in the risk-of-force clause, which defines predicate crimes as those that by their \u201cnaturef] involve[] a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(c)(3)(B). Both the Supreme Court and this Court have noted that the language in the latter provision is both narrower <em>and </em>easier to construe. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 10, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (holding that \u201c[t]he reckless disregard in \u00a7 16 [employing the language of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) ] relates <em>not </em>to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person\u2019s conduct, but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 10, 125 S.Ct. 377 n.7 (noting that \u201c\u00a7 16(b) <em>plainly </em>does not encompass all offenses which create a \u2018substantial risk\u2019 that <em>injury </em>will result from a person\u2019s conduct\u201d (emphasis added)); <em>Jobson, </em>326 F.3d at 372-73 (\u201c[T]he risk that a defendant will use physical force in the commission of an offense is materially different from the risk that an offense will result in physical injury.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 373 n.5 (observing that the \u201crisk of physical injury\u201d language \u201cwas intended to be broader\u201d than the language in the risk-of-force clause). Indeed, in interpreting the language in \u00a7 16(b), which is materially indistinguishable from the provision at issue here, we have had little trouble narrowing, and construing, its scope. <em>See, e.g., id. </em>at 374 (\u201c[Sjection 16(b) requires that an offense inherently poses a substantial risk that a defendant will [intentionally] use physical force.... \u201d). As one of our sister circuits recently observed, even apart from the enumerated offenses, the language of the risk-of-force clause \u201cis distinctly narrower\u201d than that in the residual clause, and in a manner that makes it easier to construe. <em>United States v. Taylor, </em>814 F.3d 340, 375-76 (6th Cir. 2016) (rejecting the argument that <em>Johnson II </em>\u201ccompels the conclusion\u201d that the risk-of-force clause is void for vagueness).</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">It is unsurprising, then, that the risk-of-force clause has no history of \u201crepeated attempts and repeated failures\u201d on the part of courts \u201cto craft a principled and objective standard\u201d out of its terms \u2014 the sort of doctrinal history that <em>Johnson II </em>recognized was sufficient to \u201cconfirm [the] hopeless indeterminacy\u201d of the residual clause. 135 S.Ct. at 2558. The Court explained in <em>Johnson II </em>that \u201cthe failure of \u2018persistent efforts ... to establish a standard\u2019 can provide evidence of vagueness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (quoting <em>United States v. L. Cohen Grocery Co., </em>255 U.S. 81, 91, 41 S.Ct. 298, 65 L.Ed. 516 (1921)). But there is no such troubled interpretive history with respect to the risk-of-force clause. As the Sixth Circuit recently recognized, while \u201cthe Supreme Court reached its void-for-vagueness conclusion only after struggling mightily for nine years to come up with a coherent interpretation. of the [residual] clause, ... no such history has occurred with respect to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B).\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>814 F.3d at 376. This, too, counts against Hill\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Hill argues that <em>Johnson II </em>also relied in part on the fact that the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, like the risk-of-force clause, requires application of the categorical approach, with its attendant difficulties in determining the parameters of the \u201cordinary ease\u201d of a predicate crime. This is true. But we conclude that this fact alone is not nearly enough to render the risk-of-force clause void for vaguene'ss. As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>Sixth Circuit recognized in <em>Taylor, </em>the Supreme Court in <em>Johnson II </em>did not conclude that statutes requiring such an approach are thereby rendered unconstitutionally vague. 814 F.3d at 378.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> To the contrary, the Court took pains to note that it was a <em>combination </em>of factors that together rendered the residual clause invalid: \u201cEach of the uncertainties in the residual clause may be tolerable in isolation, but \u2018their sum makes a task for us which at best could be only guesswork.\u2019 \u201d <em>Johnson II, </em>135 S.Ct. at 2560 (quoting <em>Evans, </em>333 U.S. at 495, 68 S.Ct. 634). No such factors conspire to suggest that \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) is constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">We note that four other circuits \u2014 the Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth \u2014 have considered the language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b), which appears materially the same as that in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B), and have determined that \u00a7 16(b) is void for vagueness after <em>Johnson. Shuti v. Lynch, </em>828 F.3d 440, 2016 WL 3632539 (6th Cir. July 7, 2016); <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Longoria, </em>813 F.3d 225, 227 (5th Cir. 2016), <em>en banc rehearing granted, </em>815 F.3d 189 (5th Cir. 2016) (mem.); <em>United States v.

Although we generally interpret \u00a7 16(b) and \u00a7 924(c) by applying the same case law, <em>see Acosta, </em>470 F.3d at 134-35, we find these opinions unpersuasive for three reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">First, each greatly underestimates \u2014 or misunderstands \u2014 the significance of the list of enumerated offenses in the ACCA\u2019s residual clause to the decision in <em>Johnson II, </em>in part by failing to engage with the precedent that preceded, and informed, that decision.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Second, these cases either ignore or minimize the other textual distinctions between the residual clause and the language of \u00a7 16(b).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Finally, each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>case dismisses the significance of the Supreme Court\u2019s fraught precedent interpreting the ACCA\u2019s residual clause, and in doing so not only disregards the significance of that precedent to the <em>Johnson II </em>decision, <em>see </em>135 S.Ct. at 2558-61 (discussing these prior cases), but also fails to grapple with the fact that the textual aspects unique to the residual clause were largely to blame for that confusion. <em>See Shuti, </em>828 F.3d at 449, 2016 WL 3632539, at *8; <em>Gonzalez-Longoria, </em>813 F.3d at 234; <em>Vivas-Ceja, </em>808 F.3d at 723; <em>Dimaya, </em>803 F.3d at 1119.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">For these reasons, we do not find these \u00a7 16(b) cases persuasive, and we decline to follow their reasoning here. Indeed, we conclude that to do so would not apply <em>Johnson II, </em>but would extend it in a way flatly inconsistent with that decision\u2019s own articulation of the limitations of its holding. <em>See </em>135 S.Ct. at 2561. Having considered each of Hill\u2019s arguments that the risk-of-force clause is unconstitutionally vague, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">For the foregoing reasons, and for those stated in the summary order that accompanies this decision, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b163-10\">.

The parties\u2019 briefs refer to \u00a7 924(c)(3)(B) as the \u201cresidual clause.\u201d We think the shorthand \"risk-of-force clause\" is clearer and thus adopt that terminology.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b165-11\">. Hill does not contest that the Hobbs Act is a divisible statute, and that Hill was charged with Hobbs Act <em>robbery </em>(as opposed to, say, Hobbs Act extortion). A divisible statute \u201csets out one or more elements of the offense in the alternative.\u201d <em>Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2281; <em>see also Vargas-Sarmiento, </em>448 F.3d at 167 (explaining how to identify divisible penal statutes). If some but not all of the alternative elements would amount to a crime of violence, a court can \u201cmodify\u201d the categorical approach by looking at a limited set of documents, including the indictment, to consider under which portion of the statute the defendant was charged. <em>See Descamps, </em>133 S.Ct. at 2284-85. After determining which portion was at issue, a court then applies the categorical approach to that part of the challenged statute. <em>Id. </em>Hill agrees that the Hobbs Act is divisible, but argues that Hobbs Act <em>robbery </em>is not, and the Government does not contest this assertion. See Hill Supp. Br. 23 n.9. See <em>generally </em>Gov\u2019t Supp. Br. 6-16 (relying on the categorical, rather than the modified categorical, approach). To that end, we express no view regarding whether Hobbs Act robbery is itself divisible, and we apply the standard categorical approach to the entire offense as defined in the statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"><em>. </em>The Ninth Circuit recently reiterated its conclusion that Hobbs Act robbery satisfies the force clause. <em>See United States v. Howard, </em>No. 15-10042, 650 Fed.Appx. 466, 2016 WL 2961978 (9th Cir. May 23, 2016, amended Jun. 24, 2016) (mem.) (concluding that Hobbs Act robbery is a \"crime of violence\" under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) and disagreeing with the defendant's argument that the \"fear of injury\u201d language requires an alternative conclusion); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>992 F.2d 1488, 1491 (9th Cir. 1993) (observing that a substantive Hobbs Act robbery offense \"indisputably qualifies as a crime of violence,\u201d a conclusion from which the court derived its holding that conspiracy to commit such an offense categorically creates a \u201csubstantial risk that physical force may be used\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Farmer, </em>73 F.3d 836, 842 (8th Cir. 1996) (concluding that Hobbs Act robbery \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another\u201d such that it qualifies as a \"serious violent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\">. <em>Johnson I </em>construed the meaning of physical force for purposes of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) which, in relevant part, defines a violent felony for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act (\u201cACCA\u201d) as a crime that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d This provision thus employs language identical to that used in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), except for the fact that \u201ccrime of violence\u201d is defined in the latter to include crimes having as an element the actual, attempted, or threatened use of physical force \"against the person <em>or property </em>of another.\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\">. Hill also suggests, along these same lines, that a perpetrator could successfully commit Hobbs Act robbery by putting a victim in fear of economic injury to an intangible asset without the use of physical force. Hill relies almost exclusively on hypothetieals, not actual cases, to suggest that there is a realistic possibility that Hobbs Act robbery could extend to such a fact pattern. He does cite a Fourth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Iozzi, </em>420 F.2d 512 (4th Cir. 1970), but that case involved a charge of Hobbs Act <em>extortion, </em>not robbery, on the basis that \u201c[the defendant] obtained or attempted to obtain money from building contractors <em>with their consent </em>by causing the contractors to fear financial and economic loss,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 513 (emphasis added). The Government, for its part, contends that \"[i]t defies logic to suggest that someone could be robbed by placing him in 'fear of injury\u2019 without using or threatening to use physical force.\u201d Gov't Supp. Br. 12; <em>see also DiSomma, </em>951 F.2d at 496 (\"[I]f the element of violence is not present, no conviction under section 1951 can occur.\u201d). We conclude as to this argument that while it may indeed be the case that Hobbs Act robbery does not extend to the hypothetieals Hill posits, <em>see United States v. Pena, </em>No. 15-cr-551 (AJN), 161 F.Supp.3d 268, 282, 2016 WL 690746, at *11 (S.D.N.Y.

We assume <em>arguendo </em>Johnson I\u2019s relevance to the construction of \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), but note that the case might not apply to the present statute for at least two reasons. First, as a matter of precedent, our Circuit has long defined the meaning of \u201cphysical force\u201d in the context of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 (which employs language similar to that used in \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A)) as \"power, violence, or pressure directed against a person or thing,\u201d and we have affirmed this understanding of force in <em>post-Johnson I </em>cases. <em>See Morris v. Holder, </em>676 F.3d 309, 314 (2d Cir. 2012) (quoting <em>Vargas-Sarmiento, </em>448 F.3d at 169); <em>see also Acosta, </em>470 F.3d at 134-35 (noting that this Circuit has interpreted \u00a7 16 and \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) by applying the same case law). Second, <em>Johnson </em>/'s reasoning does not necessarily extend to a statute like \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), which includes within its definition of crime of violence those felonies that have as an element physical force threatened or employed against the person <em>or property </em>of another, as opposed to only the former. <em>Johnson I\u2019s </em>holding rejected the possibility that mere \u201coffensive touching,\u201d sufficient for common-law battery, could constitute a use of physical force in the context of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>Johnson I, </em>559 U.S. at 139, 130 S.Ct. 1265. Yet it is not obvious what \"offensive touching\u201d could possibly mean for <em>property </em>\u2014 a point that may suggest <em>Johnson I </em>is inapplicable to the force clause herein, or may simply reinforce our conclusion that nothing in <em>Johnson I </em>suggests that force sufficient to injure property would, under that decision, be insufficient to count as a use of physical force.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\">.This requirement also undermines Hill's suggestion that a perpetrator could successfully commit Hobbs Act robbery by unintentionally placing a victim in fear of injury. In support of this argument, he cites a line of out-of-circuit cases interpreting the \"intimidation\u201d element of the federal bank robbery statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a), as including unintentional intimidation. <em>See, e.g., United States </em>v. <em>Kelley, </em>412 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir. 2005). However, these decisions are insufficient because, as is the case with his contention that Hobbs Act robbery includes threats involving the indirect application of force, Hill cannot point to cases in which \"courts in fact did apply the statute in the ... manner for which he argues.\u201d <em>Duenas-Alvarez, </em>549 U.S. at 193, 127 S.Ct. 815.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b169-9\">. Section 922(g)(9) restricts persons who have been convicted of certain misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence from possessing firearms or ammunition. In relevant part, the statute defines crimes of domestic violence as misdemeanors that \"ha[ve], as an element, the use or attempted use of physical force ... committed by a current or former spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim, by a person with whom the victim shares a child in common, by a person who is cohabiting with or has cohabited with the victim as a spouse, parent, or guardian, or by a person similarly situated to a spouse, parent, or guardian of the victim.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(33)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b169-10\">. As already noted, \u00a7 16 defines a crime of violence similarly to \u00a7 924(c)(3), and we have interpreted both statutes by applying the same case law. <em>See Acosta, </em>470 F.3d at 134-35.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b170-4\">. A panel of this circuit recently held that New York's first-degree robbery statute, <em>see </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7\u00a7 160.00, 160.15, fails to categorically qualify as a \"crime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1), as it is possible to commit it \"without necessarily using violent force.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>No. 15-1518, 830 F.3d 142, 149, 2016 WL 3923838, at *6 (2d Cir. July 21, 2016). Hill's suggestion that this decision has any relevance to ours is mistaken. The <em>Jones </em>panel addressed a distinct robbery statute, <em>compare </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 160.15 (including under the definition of first-degree robbery the case where the defendant or another participant in the crime \"is armed with a deadly weapon\u201d), <em>with </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951, and it interpreted that statute with reference to a distinct body of state-law precedent inapposite in our case. <em>See Jones, </em>830 F.3d at 148, 2016 WL 3923838, at *5. Additionally, the <em>Jones </em>panel assessed whether the state-law conviction was a crime of violence for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1) which, unlike 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A), does not include the use or threatened use of \"physical force against the person or <em>property </em>of another.\u201d \u00a7 924(c)(3)(A) (emphasis added); <em>compare </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(1) (qualifying offenses must have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the <em>person </em>of another\u201d (emphasis added)). Nor is <em>Jones\u2019s </em>suggestion, in dicta, that the previous version of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a) is \"likely void for vagueness in light of <em>[Johnson II},\" </em>relevant to our analysis in Part III of this opinion. <em>Jones, </em>830 F.3d at 149, 2016 WL 3923838, at *6. Unlike the risk-of-force clause in this case, the prior version of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) <em>was </em>textually identical to \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B) (the clause at issue in <em>Johnson II). See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a) (2015) (defining \"crime of violence\u201d as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>qualifying offense that \"is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d). As we explain in this opinion, the risk-of-force clause at issue here contains no confusing list of predicate offenses and is significantly narrower in scope than the clause at issue in <em>Johnson II </em>\u2014 material distinctions that make all the difference. <em>See infra </em>Part III.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b171-17\">. As the <em>Johnson II </em>Court recognized, \"[b]y asking whether the crime 'otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk,' ... the residual clause forces courts to interpret 'serious potential risk' in light- of the four enumerated crimes \u2014 burglary, arson, extor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>tion, and crimes involving the use of explosives.\u201d 135 S.Ct. at 2558 (emphasis omitted). But no rhyme or reason appears to connect these crimes, in terms of assessing either the method for evaluating the risk of injury posed, or the degree of risk: \"Does the ordinary burglar invade an occupied home by night or an unoccupied home by day? Does the typical extortionist threaten his victim in person with the use of force, or does he threaten his victim by mail with the revelation of embarrassing personal information?\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Court concluded that \"[c]ommon sense has not ... produced a consistent conception of the degree of risk posed by each of the four enumerated crimes\u201d and that these crimes \"are not much more similar to one another in kind than in degree of risk posed.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2559.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b172-9\">. In these earlier cases, the Court consistently relied on the list of offenses as its primary tool of construction through which to determine which predicate crimes constituted violent felonies. <em>See, e.g., Sykes v. United States, </em>564 U.S. 1, 15-16, 131 S.Ct. 2267, 180 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>L.Ed.2d 60 (2011) (observing that \"[t]he residual clause imposes enhanced punishment for unlawful possession of [a] firearm when the relevant prior offenses involved a potential risk of physical injury similar to that presented by burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving use of explosives,\u201d though noting that \"this approach may at times be more difficult for courts to implement\u201d); <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (holding that \u201cthe examples in [the residual clause] limit the scope of the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples themselves\u201d); <em>James v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 218 n.1, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (referring to the list of enumerated offenses as providing \"the defining characteristic of the residual provision\u201d). Nevertheless, although the Justices seemed largely to agree that the enumerated list was dispositive of the required analysis, they consistently diverged on <em>how </em>Congress intended the list itself to be employed. <em>Compare, e.g., Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (holding that courts \"should read the examples as limiting the crimes that [the residual clause] covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at 149, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (Scalia, J., concurring in the judgment) (arguing instead that the Court should \u201cdetermine which of the enumerated offenses poses the least serious risk of physical injury, and then ... set that level of risk as the 'serious potential risk' required by the statute\u201d); <em>and id. </em>at 158-59, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (Alito, J., dissenting) (disagreeing with the majority\u2019s view that predicate crimes must be similar not only in degree of risk, but also in kind, to the enumerated offenses). The Justices also consistently disagreed on what unified the four enumerated offenses for purposes of defining the requisite level of risk. <em>Compare, e.g., Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. 1581 (majority opinion) (arguing that the four enumerated crimes \"all ... involve[d] purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct\u201d and relying on this characteristic to exclude a DUI conviction), <em>with Sykes, </em>564 U.S. at 13, 131 S.Ct. 2267 (noting that the \"phrase 'purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019 has no precise textual link to the residual clause,\u201d and that, most of the time, \"risk levels provide a categorical and manageable standard\u201d); <em>and id. </em>at 36, 131 S.Ct. 2267 n.1 (Kagan, J., dissenting) (\"I understand the majority to retain the \u2018purposeful, violent, and aggressive\u2019 test, but to conclude that it is \u2018redundant\u2019 in this case.\u201d); <em>compare, e.g., James, </em>550 U.S. at 199, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (\"[T]he most relevant common attribute of the enumerated offenses of burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives use is ... that all of these offenses ... create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury.\u201d), <em>with id. </em>at 218 n.1, 127 S.Ct. 1586 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing the majority for \u201cimprecisely identif[ying] the common characteristic of the enumerated offenses,\u201d and arguing that \"the word \u2018confrontation\u2019 ... is an invention entirely divorced from the statutory text\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b173-9\">. Indeed, absent such a confounding list of inconsistent enumerated offenses, the Court has had little trouble interpreting language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16(b) that is the same as that in the risk-of-force clause at issue here. <em>See Leocal v. Ashcroft, </em>543 U.S. 1, 11, 125 S.Ct. 377, 160 L.Ed.2d 271 (2004) (observing, in a unanimous decision, that \u201c[t]he ordinary meaning of ['crime of violence\u2019], combined with \u00a7 16\u2019s emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or.the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b175-6\">. Hill argues that <em>Taylor </em>is distinguishable in that it relied on the fact that the Sixth Circuit does not use a categorical approach \"in many \u00a7 924(c) cases\u201d in upholding the risk-of-force clause.
