Sullivan, <em>Judge). </em>The judgment followed a seven day jury trial in which Epskamp was found guilty of both counts in a two-count superseding indictment charging him with (1) conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance on board an aircraft registered in the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 959(b)(2), and 960(a)(3); and (2) possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance on board an aircraft registered in the United States, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 812, 959(b)(2), and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The controlled substance alleged to be involved in each count was 5 kilograms and more of mixture and substances containing a detectable amount of cocaine, a violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 960(b)(1)(B). The District Court principally sentenced Epskamp to 264 months of incarceration.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-16\">Epskamp raises five issues on appeal: First, he argues that the District Court lacked the power to exercise jurisdiction over his extraterritorial conduct, as a matter of both statutory and constitutional law. Second, he contends that the government adduced insufficient evidence at trial to support a conviction. Third, he claims that the District Court erred in its jury charge by instructing the jury that it could find Epskamp guilty without determining whether he knew of the aircraft\u2019s registration in the United States. Fourth, with respect to sentencing, he argues that the District Court clearly erred in denying him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>a minor role reduction pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2(b). Fifth, he contends that he was deprived of his Fifth and Sixth Amendment rights due to the government\u2019s alleged failure to assist in arranging for the testimony of an exculpatory witness incarcerated in the Federal Republic of Germany.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">We address two issues implicated by Epskamp\u2019s various challenges: (1) the proper construction of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959, particularly with respect to its extraterritorial application and whether it requires a defendant\u2019s knowledge of the relevant jurisdictional nexus (i.e., knowing that the aircraft involved is owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States); and (2) whether application of \u00a7 959 to Epskamp\u2019s conduct violates constitutional due process. We hold that Ep-skamp\u2019s conduct falls squarely within the ambit of \u00a7 959 and that the District Court\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction was consistent with due process. The remainder of Epskamp\u2019s arguments do not warrant significant explication and are resolved by separate Summary Order, to be issued simultaneously with this Opinion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment below.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">The evidence produced at trial revealed that the investigation leading to Ep-skamp\u2019s arrest commenced in October 2011 when the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) was informed by an American airplane charter company that a Lebanese individual was seeking to charter a flight from the Dominican Republic to Antwerp, Belgium in November 2011. The company told the DEA that two foreign nationals would be transporting a substantial quantity of narcotics on the flight in approximately 20 to 30 suitcases.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-10\">After receiving this information, the DEA \u2014 in conjunction with a specialized narcotics division of the Dominican National Police<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 commenced surveillance of La Romana Airport, located approximately 65 miles east of the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo. The Dominican police involved in the operation recruited two undercover pilots, Carlos Medina (\u201cUC-1\u201d) and Danny Jesus (\u201cUC-2\u201d) and arranged for them to be introduced to Rawson \u201cRoy\u201d Watson, a British citizen who was involved in the scheme.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In early November 2011, UC-1 met with Rawson at the so-called \u201cVIP\u201d terminal in La Romana Airport. Rawson informed UC-1 that the flight was being rescheduled and provided UC-1 his telephone number. Legal authorization was then obtained to begin intercepting communications over Watson\u2019s phone. Watson ultimately informed UC-1 that he would be transporting approximately 600 kilograms of cocaine and that UC-1 would be paid $400,000 for his efforts.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">Intercepted communications over the following weeks reveal the various logistical challenges facing those who seek to smuggle large quantities of narcotics over international borders. The flight was repeatedly delayed and rescheduled throughout November. The chartered aircraft was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>searched by a Dominican police unit unaffiliated with the investigation. Although the search did not yield any evidence \u2014 the plane had not yet been laden with cocaine \u2014 the search convinced the participants that they would need to obtain a new aircraft, specifically an aircraft registered in the United States, which would draw less suspicion from Dominican authorities.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">After these setbacks, Watson left the Dominican Republic for several weeks, telling UC-1 that he was visiting Lebanon and the Netherlands. The two remained in contact via email, with Watson proposing solutions to the challenges they had been facing at La Romana Airport, including developing a dummy flight plan indicating the charter aircraft was bound for Africa, rather than Belgium, and also bribing a Dominican military officer. <em>See United States v. Epskamp, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00120-RJS-2, ECF Docket No. 190 at 414-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">In early December 2011, Watson returned to the Dominican Republic with Pako Podunajec, a Dutch citizen who testified as a cooperating witness for the government at trial. Podunajec \u2014 who spoke Dutch, English, German, Spanish, and Croatian \u2014 was to serve as translator between Watson and two Colombian nationals who would ultimately supply the conspirators with 1,000 kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">Around the same time, on December 4, 2011, Defendant-Appellant Epskamp, who is also a Dutch citizen, likewise traveled from the Netherlands to the Dominican Republic, where he checked into a hotel in Santo Domingo. Podunajec testified that he was instructed by Watson to visit Ep-skamp and provide him with $2,000 in cash that the Colombians had given to Watson. He further testified that Watson told him that Epskamp \u2014 to whom Watson referred as the \u201cJournalist\u201d or \u201cJourney\u201d \u2014 would be traveling to Belgium from the Dominican Republic with \u201cthe thousand keys of cocaine.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 193. When Podu-najec visited Epskamp at his hotel and provided him with the $2,000, the two had a brief conversation in Dutch, during which Epskamp asked whether he would be leaving soon and whether he would be heading to Africa or Belgium. Podunajec responded that he should ask \u201cAli\u201d \u2014 the Lebanese individual arranging for the shipment in conjunction with Watson \u2014 but that he believed Epskamp would be leaving soon for Belgium with \u201cthe thousand keys of cocaine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Epskamp told Podu-najec that he was participating in the scheme to pay off a drug debt. He further explained that, in order to play his role as courier, he liad been instructed to \u201ctake the flight, be like a millionaire on the flight,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 194, and in return his debt would be forgiven and he would be paid an additional 50,000 euros.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">Over the next several weeks, Podunajec met repeatedly with both Epskamp and Watson to discuss logistics for the flight. During one such meeting, Podunajec observed Watson give an additional $1,500 to Epskamp. Although the precise date is not clear, at some point during this time period, Podunajec brought Epskamp from his hotel in Santo Domingo to a hotel closer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>La Romana Airport. At a subsequent meeting, Watson told Epskamp that he would be departing soon for Belgium.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">On December 15, 2011 \u2014 at 3:45 a.m.\u2014 Watson collected Epskamp at the hotel near La Romana Airport. During this time, Watson communicated with \u201cAli\u201d via BlackBerry Messenger. Ali repeatedly asked Watson about the status of the \u201cJournalist,\u201d and further instructed that the pair put on their \u201cuniforms.\u201d <em>See United States v. Epskamp, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00120-RJS-2, ECF Docket No. 188 at 200-205.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Watson and Epskamp proceeded to the airport, where they met with the two undercover pilots, one of whom carried an audio and video recording device. Ep-skamp was, according to the testimony of UC-1, \u201cdressed very, very elegantly, as a gentlemen, as a real executive, with a jacket, a tie, and a scarf.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 254. Watson was dressed to look like a member of the flight crew. <em>Id. </em>The pair proceeded through the YIP terminal of La Romana Airport and boarded a charter airplane bearing an \u201cN\u201d registration number on its tail, indicating registration in the United States. <em>On </em>board the aircraft, strewn about the cabin, were approximately 20 suitcases containing over 1,000 kilograms of cocaine that had previously been loaded by the Colombian members of the conspiracy. UC-1 testified that there were so many suitcases in the cabin that he \u201chad to walk on top of suitcases because the aisles were blocked by them.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 257. He further testified that he discreetly opened two or three suitcases and was able to \u201cconfirm that there were those square-shaped packages of cocaine that [are] commonly used to pack [narcotics]\u201d within the suitcases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">As those onboard the plane waited to depart, an airport official approached the aircraft and informed Epskamp that he had to disembark and speak with an immigration official. Epskamp returned to the terminal while Watson remained on the plane. Dominican police officers then arrested Epskamp and Watson. A subsequent search of the aircraft revealed approximately 1,000 kilograms of cocaine, divided into approximately 1,000 bricks. A number of Epskamp\u2019s personal belongings were also found on the plane.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">In November 2012, Epskamp was transferred to the United States and brought to the Southern District of New York for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">The specific challenges raised by Epskamp that we address in this Opinion concern statutory interpretation and constitutional due process rights. \u201cWe review questions of statutory interpretation <em>de novo.\u201d Roach v. Morse, </em>440 F.3d 53, 56 (2d Cir. 2006). With respect to a claimed due process violation, \u201cwe review the district court\u2019s factual determinations for clear error,\u201d while \u201c[t]he constitutional significance of those findings, including the ultimate determination of whether due process has been violated, is reviewed <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. El-Hage, </em>213 F.3d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b186-13\">I. The District Court Properly Construed 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b) to Proscribe Epskamp\u2019s Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b186-14\">Epskamp was convicted for possessing with intent to distribute a controlled substance aboard an aircraft registered in the United States, a crime under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b)(2), and conspiring to do the same.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Section 959(b) specifically states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>It shall be unlawful for any United States citizen on board any aircraft, or any person on board an aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States, to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">(1) manufacture or distribute a controlled substance or listed chemical; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-6\">(2) possess a controlled substance or listed chemical with intent to distribute.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Subsection (c), titled \u201cActs committed outside territorial jurisdiction of United States; venue\u201d then further explains in relevant part that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-9\">This section is intended to reach acts of manufacture or distribution committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-11\">Epskamp raises two arguments with respect to the construction of these provisions. First, he argues that \u00a7 959(b)(2) does not extend to extraterritorial conduct because \u00a7 959(c) omits reference to possession with intent to distribute. Second, as part of both his sufficiency of the evidence argument and challenge to the District Court\u2019s jury instructions, he argues that \u00a7 959(b) requires proof of a defendant\u2019s knowledge that their unlawful acts occur \u201con board an aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States.\u201d We reject both of these arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-13\">A. Epskamp\u2019s Extraterritorial Conduct Fell Within the Scope of \u00a7 959(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b187-14\">Epskamp principally argues that because subsection (c) expressly references \u201cacts of manufacture or distribution,\u201d as referenced also in \u00a7 959(b)(1), but not possession with intent to distribute, as referenced in \u00a7 959(b)(2), the section is best read as applying extraterritorially solely where a defendant is charged with manufacturing or distributing a controlled substance, but not possessing with intent to distribute the same. We reject Epskamp\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-15\">1. Principles of Statutory Interpretation</p>\n<p id=\"b187-16\">In determining whether a federal statute applies extraterritorially, we begin with the \u201clongstanding principle of American law that legislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent appears, is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d <em>Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., </em>561 U.S. 247, 255, 130 S.Ct. 2869, 177 L.Ed.2d 535 (2010) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b187-17\">This presumption is a \u201ccanon of construction ... rather than a limit upon Congress\u2019s power to legislate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[t]he presumption against extraterritoriality is only a <em>presumption; </em>it is overcome by clearly expressed Congressional intent for a statute to apply extraterritorially.\u201d <em>Weiss v. Nat\u2019l Westminster Bank PLC, </em>768 F.3d 202, 211 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>accord United States v. Vilar, </em>729 F.3d 62, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>72 (2d Cir. 2013) (recognizing- that presumption against extraterritoriality applies to criminal, as well as civil, statutes but that \u201cit is beyond doubt that, as a general proposition, Congress has the authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial boundaries of the United States\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). Because the presumption is only \u201ca canon of statutory interpretation,\u201d <em>Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1659, 1664, 185 L.Ed.2d 671 (2013), whether Congress evinces an intent for the law to apply extraterritorially is likewise a question of statutory interpretation. <em>See, e.g., United States v. MacAllister, </em>160 F.3d 1304, 1307 (11th Cir. 1998) (\u201cWhether Congress has intended extraterritorial application is a question of statutory interpretation.\u201d); <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>893 F.2d 1066, 1068 (9th Cir. 1990) (\u201cWhether 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2251(a) applies to Thomas\u2019 extraterritorial acts is, therefore, a question of statutory interpretation.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> \u201cAs with any question of statutory interpretation, we begin with the text of the statute to determine whether the language at issue has a plain and unambiguous meaning.\u201d <em>Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A. v. LY USA Inc., </em>676 F.3d 83, 108 (2d Cir. 2012) (citing <em>Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., </em>519 U.S. 337, 340, 117 S.Ct. 843, 136 L.Ed.2d 808 (1997)). \u201cA particular statute\u2019s \u2018plain meaning can best be understood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Saks v. Franklin Covey Co., </em>316 F.3d 337, 345 (2d Cir. 2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">Generally speaking, \u201cwe need proceed no further\u201d than the statute\u2019s text and context in the broader statutory scheme. <em>Id. </em>Nonetheless, \u201c[e]xtrinsic materials have a role in statutory interpretation ... to the extent they shed a reliable light on the enacting Legislature\u2019s understanding of otherwise ambiguous terms.\u201d <em>Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Allapattah Servs., Inc., </em>545 U.S. 546, 568, 125 S.Ct. 2611, 162 L.Ed.2d 502 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">We conclude that \u00a7 959(b) applies extraterritorially to acts of possession with intent to distribute.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This determination is supported by the structure and context of the statute and, though not necessary to our holding, confirmed by the statute\u2019s enactment history. At the outset, we acknowledge, as other courts have, that Epskamp\u2019s challenge to the government\u2019s construction of \u00a7 959 is not wholly without force. <em>See, e.g. United States v. Bodye, </em>172 F.Supp.3d 15, 18-19, 2016 WL 1091058, at *2 (D.D.C. Mar. 21, 2016) (acknowledging that the argument that \u00a7 959(b)(2) does not extend extraterritorially \u201cappears persuasive at first\u201d). That Congress chose to expressly refer to distribution, manufacture, and possession with intent to distribute in \u00a7 959(b), but only distribution and manufacture in \u00a7 959(c), is perhaps an example of less than crystalline drafting. Nonetheless, as the Supreme Court has recently recognized, merely because a statute contains \u201cexamples of inartful drafting\u201d does not mean courts are incapable of discerning its meaning, particularly with the aid of broader statutory context. <em>King </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number><em>v. Burwell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 135 S.Ct. 2480, 2492, 192 L.Ed.2d 483 (2015).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Turning first to the operative subsection under which Epskamp was convicted, \u00a7 959(b) begins by broadly proscribing various narcotics trafficking offenses committed by <em>\u201cany </em>United States citizen on board <em>any </em>aircraft, or <em>any </em>person on board <em>any </em>aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States.21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b) (emphases added). This language establishes two classes of defendants, each extremely broad in scope yet retaining a distinct United States nexus: (1) <em>any </em>person (as compared to any United States citizen) provided that they commit the acts on board <em>any </em>United States-owned or registered plane and (2) <em>any </em>United States citizen aboard <em>any </em>aircraft, regardless of registration or ownership. As other courts have observed, this particular formulation of the provision\u2019s jurisdictional scope appears calibrated for broad extraterritorial application, while purposefully retaining a distinct nexus to the United States. <em>See United States v. Knowles, </em>\u2014 F.Supp.3d -, 2016 WL 3365373, at *6 (D.D.C. June 16, 2016) (\u201cThe foundational element of the involvement of a U.S. citizen on board the aircraft, or the U.S. ownership or registry of the aircraft, applies to both subsections 959(b)(1) and (b)(2), and there would have been no reason to premise all of section (b) on this very specific U.S. nexus if only one of the prongs of the section was meant to extend to conduct abroad. So the nexus requirement supports the conclusion that <em>all </em>of subsection (b) was meant to reach outside of the United States \u2014 indeed that seems to be the goal of the airplane provisions.\u201d). Yet we are also mindful that, in the typical case, \u201cgeneric terms like \u2018any\u2019 or \u2018every\u2019 do not rebut the presumption against extraterritoriality.\u201d <em>Kiobel, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1665.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">Turning to \u00a7 959(c), the statute\u2019s venue provision states that \u201c[a]ny person who violates <em>this section </em>shall be tried in the United States district court at the point of entry where such person enters the United States, or in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(c) (emphasis added). There is no serious dispute that \u201cthis section\u201d refers to \u00a7 959 as a whole, including both \u00a7 959(b)(1) and (b)(2). <em>See United States v. Lawrence, </em>727 F.3d 386, 393 (5th Cir. 2013) (observing that the venue provision \u201crefers to the violation of any part of the entire section-including \u00a7 959(b)\u201d). In other words, the venue provision assumes that defendants under the statute \u2014 including those who violate \u00a7 959(b)(2) \u2014 will usually be tried at their \u201cpoint of entry\u201d into the United States, again suggesting that Congress intended the statute as a whole to apply extraterritorially. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">But other aspects of \u00a7 959(c) muddy the textual waters. The subsection contains an express extraterritoriality provision: \u201cThis section is intended to reach acts of manufacturing or distribution committed outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d As Epskamp emphasizes, \u00a7 959(c) mentions only \u201cacts of manufacture or distribution,\u201d but not possession with intent to distribute. The doctrine of <em>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </em>thus permits, but does not require, us to infer that the exclusion of possession with intent to distribute from \u00a7 959(c) impliedly excludes such conduct from the statute\u2019s extraterritorial application. <em>See Frank G. v. Bd. of Educ. of Hyde Park, </em>459 F.3d 356, 370 (2d Cir. 2006) (observing that <em>expressio unius </em>canon is merely \u201can aid to construction,\u201d and not conclusive as to Congress\u2019s intent (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>accord Barnhart v. Peabody Coal Co., </em>537 U.S. 149, 168, 123 S.Ct. 748, 154 L.Ed.2d 653 (2003) (\u201cWe do not read the enumeration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>of one case to exclude another unless it is fair to suppose that Congress considered the unnamed possibility and meant to say no to it.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Ultimately, we need not navigate the textual thicket presented by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959. Even assuming for the sake of argument that the text of \u00a7 959(b) itself is insufficiently plain to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, we conclude that the statutory scheme and the context of the statute overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality. <em>See RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 2090, 2102, 195 L.Ed.2d 476 (2016) (\u201cWhile the presumption can be overcome only by a clear indication of extraterritorial effect, an express statement of extraterritoriality is not essential,\u201d and \u201c \u2018context can be consulted as well.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Morrison, </em>561 U.S. at 265, 130 S.Ct. 2869)); <em>Louis Vuitton Malletier S.A., </em>676 F.3d at 108 (\u201cA particular statute\u2019s plain meaning can best be understood by looking to the statutory scheme as a whole and placing the particular provision within the context of that statute.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)). The nature of \u00a7 959 specifically, and the structure of federal statutory narcotics laws generally, render Epskamp\u2019s preferred reading of the statute illogical. For instance, reading \u00a7 959(c) to limit the scope of \u00a7 959(b)(2) would have the peculiar effect of establishing a purely domestic crime within a statute aimed at combatting international nar-cot\u00edes smuggling and importation where every other provision applies extraterrito-rially.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-9\">Further, reading \u00a7 959(b)(2) to proscribe only domestic conduct would render it a redundancy within the federal statutory framework. Prior to \u00a7 959(b)\u2019s enactment in 1986, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a) already made it unlawful for \u201cany person ... to manufacture, distribute ... or possess with intent to ... distribute\u201d narcotics. In other words, the purely domestic possession of narcotics with intent to distribute was already unlawful at the time of \u00a7 959(b)(2)\u2019s enactment and Epskamp does not explain what further application the provision would have if limited exclusively to domestic conduct.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., United States v. Massuet, </em>851 F.2d 111, 115 (4th Cir. 1988) (observing, in the context of a case where defendants were arrested after aircraft landed in United States, that \u201c21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) is virtually identical to section 959(b)(2).... Section 841(a)(1) makes it unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to \u2018possess with intent to ... distribute ... a controlled substance ... \u2019 anywhere the United States has jurisdiction. The elements of the crime denounced in sections 959(b)(2) and 841(a)(1) are similar\u201d). That \u00a7 959(b)(2) would otherwise be duplicative of \u00a7 841(a) is a \u201cmost compelling indication\u201d that Congress intended \u00a7 959(b)(2) to have added extraterritorial effect.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>Bodye, </em>172 F.Supp.3d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>19-20, 2016 WL 1091058, at *3; <em>accord Milner v.

Robert A. Katzmann, <em>Statutes, 87 </em>N.Y.U. L. Rev. 637, 670 (2012) (\u201c[A]uthoritative legislative history can be useful, even when the meaning can be discerned from the statute\u2019s language, to reinforce or confirm a court\u2019s sense of the text.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">What is now \u00a7 959 was first enacted in 1970 as part of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act, Pub. L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236 (October 27, 1970). Section 1009 of that Act \u2014 the precursor to what is now \u00a7 959 \u2014 contained identical language to what was, at the time of Ep-skamp\u2019s conviction, codified as \u00a7\u00a7 959(a) and 959(c). The section, in relevant part, read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-13\">Seo. 1009. It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance in schedule I or II\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-14\">(1) intending that such substance be unlawfully imported into the United States; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-15\">(2) knowing that such substance will be unlawfully imported into the United States.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ArW\">\n<em>This section is intended to reach acts of manufacture or distribution committed </em>\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\n<em>outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-4\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In other words, although the statute did not yet contain the aircraft provisions at issue in this appeal, the provision plainly applied extraterritorially in its entirety. Indeed, those federal \u2022appeals court cases discussing this predecessor to \u00a7 959 noted its obvious extraterritorial scope. <em>See, e.g., United States v. King, </em>552 F.2d 833, 850 (9th Cir. 1976) (\u201c[T]he statute is expressly aimed at having extraterritorial effect....\u201d); <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>653 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1981) (\u201cIn any event, another provision of the 1970 statute, making it a crime to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance for purposes of unlawful importation into the United States expressly applies to extraterritorial activity. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959. The related provision before us contains no such express statement.\u201d); <em>United States v. Perez-Herrera, </em>610 F.2d 289, 290 (5th Cir. 1980) (citing \u00a7 959 in noting that \u201ca penal statute may clearly indicate that it governs extra-territorial conduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">In 1986, Congress enacted the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub. L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207 (1986).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The Act split the prior version of the statutory text into subsections (a), titled \u201cManufacture or Distribution for Purpose of Unlawful Importation,\u201d and (c), titled \u201cActs Committed Outside Territorial Jurisdiction of United States; Venue.\u201d The 1986 Act also added a new subsection (b) \u2014 \u201cPossession, Manufacture, or Distribution By Person On Board Aircraft.\u201d <em>Id. </em>It is impossible to discern any possible reason as to why Congress, if it actually intended \u00a7 959(b)(2) to apply solely to domestic conduct, elected to place such a provision within an existing statute that was expressly and wholly extraterritorial in nature, coupled with another new subsection \u2014 \u00a7 959(b)(1) \u2014 that was likewise intended to apply extraterritorially. The far more reasonable inference is that Congress, believing the statute to already clearly apply extraterritorially in its entirety, added the 1986 amendments concerning aircraft with the understanding that they, too, would apply extraterritorially. <em>See Bodye, </em>172 F.Supp.3d at 19-20, 2016 WL 1091058, at *3 (noting that \u201cthe entirety of the original \u00a7 959 applied ex-traterritorially\u201d and therefore Congress \u201cmight have casually assumed that a new subsection would as well\u201d); <em>Knowles, </em>\u2014 F.Supp.3d at-, 2016 WL 3365373, at *6 (\u201cAnd the fact that the new provision was inserted in the particular section of [the statute] that was already extraterritorial in its entirety lends further support to the notion that Congress expected it to have a similar reach.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">In sum, the structure, context, and authoritative history of the statute reveal Congress\u2019s clear intent that the statute apply extraterritorially in its entirety, including with respect to Epskamp\u2019s conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-11\">B. Section 959(b) Does Not Require a Defendant\u2019s Knowledge of the Jurisdictional Element</p>\n<p id=\"b192-12\">Epskamp next argues that a non-citizen defendant can only be liable under \u00a7 959(b) if they know that the aircraft upon which they are committing unlawful acts is registered in the United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>States or owned by a United States citizen. He contends the government failed to adduce sufficient evidence that he possessed such knowledge and further argues that the District Court erred in instructing the jury that, in order to find him guilty, \u201cthe defendant need not know that the narcotics would be or were possessed on board an aircraft that was registered in the United States\u201d and again that \u201c[t]he defendant doesn\u2019t have to know that the aircraft was registered in the United States.\u201d Joint App\u2019x at 283-84. We disagree and conclude both that the District Court\u2019s instructions appropriately reflected the law and that, accordingly, the government was not required to adduce evidence of Epskamp\u2019s knowledge concerning the aircraft\u2019s registration.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Simply stated, nothing in the statute obliges the government to prove that Ep-skamp knew the aircraft was registered in the United States. To be sure, \u00a7 959(b) does contain a jurisdictional component; it limitg its application to \u201cany United States citizen on board any aircraft, or any person on board an aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b). But we have \u201crepeatedly ... refused to find knowledge of the jurisdictional fact to be an essential element in prosecutions under\u201d various criminal statutes requiring, for instance, that the criminal acts affect interstate or foreign commerce. <em>United States v. Eisenberg, </em>596 F.2d 522, 526 (2d Cir. 1979) (\u201cThe element of interstate transportation is merely a jurisdictional element, for which proof of the fact of transportation is proof enough.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Green, </em>523 F.2d 229, 233-34 (2d Cir. 1975) (\u201cA substantive violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 659 does not require knowledge of the interstate or foreign character of the goods. It is therefore unnecessary to prove such knowledge in order to establish a conspiracy violation.\u201d (internal citations omitted)); <em>United States v. Herrera, </em>584 F.2d 1137, 1150 (2d Cir. 1978) (\u201cSubstantive cases brought under [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 1952 have been uniform in their holdings that it is unnecessary to prove a defendant had actual knowledge of the jurisdictional element, and that he actually agreed and intended to use interstate facilities to commit a crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">The obvious exception to this rule is when the statute itself <em>requires </em>knowledge of the jurisdictional element. Such is the case with <em>other </em>subsections in the current version of \u00a7 959, which proscribe, for instance, the manufacture or distribution of chemicals \u201cknowing, or having reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance will be unlawfully imported into the United States.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(a).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Ep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>skamp disproves his own argument by citing to <em>United States v. Londono-Villa, </em>930 F.2d 994, 999 (2d Cir. 1991), in which we reversed a conviction under \u00a7 959(a) because the government failed to \u201cestablish that the defendant knew the narcotics were to be imported into the United States.\u201d But in <em>Londono-Villa, </em>we observed that the government was only required to prove that knowledge \u201c[i]n light of Congress\u2019s conjoining the knowledge/intent requirement with the term \u2018import\u2019 \u201d within that particular subsection. <em>Id. </em>at 998. We also stated that Congress could have used \u201cone of its other formulations that would plainly reach all actors outside of the United States who contribute to the international movement of narcotics <em>regardless of their knowledge or intent as to destination.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added). Congress used just such a formulation in \u00a7 959(b) and, accordingly, there was no need for the government to establish that Epskamp knew the aircraft was registered in the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">II. Prosecution of Epskamp in the United States Did Not Violate Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Epskamp also argues that, even if \u00a7 959(b)(2) can be read to proscribe his conduct, application of the statute in this particular instance would violate his constitutional right to due process of law. He largely reiterates his arguments with respect to the statutory text, contending that it violates due process both to prosecute his extraterritorial conduct and to prosecute him in the United States due to his ostensible ignorance of the aircraft\u2019s registration in this country. We again reject these arguments and conclude that prosecution of Epskamp within the United States was consistent with due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">A. A Sufficient Nexus Existed Between Epskamp\u2019s Extraterritorial Conduct and the United States</p>\n<p id=\"b194-9\">In <em>United States v. Yousef, </em>we adopted the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \u201csufficient nexus\u201d test for determining whether the extraterritorial application of federal criminal law comported with constitutional due process. Accordingly, \u201c[i]n order to apply ex-traterritorially a federal criminal statute to a defendant consistently with due process, there must be a sufficient nexus between the defendant and the United States, so that such application would not be arbitrary or fundamentally unfair.\u201d 327 F.3d 56, 111 (2d Cir. 2003) (quoting <em>United States v. Davis, </em>905 F.2d 245, 248-49 (9th Cir. 1990)). \u201cFor non-citizens acting entirely abroad, a jurisdictional nexus exists when the aim of that activity is to cause harm inside the United States or to U.S. citizens or interests.\u201d <em>United States v. Al Kassar, </em>660 F.3d 108, 118 (2d Cir. 2011); <em>cf. United States v. Ali, </em>718 F.3d 929, 946 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (noting that <em>Al Kassar </em>\u201conly tells us when such a nexus exists, not when it is absent\u201d). Where Congress expressly intends for a statute to apply ex-traterritorially, as we conclude it did here, the \u201cburden is a heavy one\u201d for a defendant seeking to show that extraterritorial application of the statute violates due process. <em>Ali, </em>718 F.3d at 944 n.7.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b194-10\">Epskamp contends that no sufficient nexus exists in the present case be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>cause his conduct occurred outside the United States and was not intended to cause harm within the United States. We disagree. The government\u2019s evidence showed that the conspirators deliberately sought out a United States-flagged aircraft in order to avoid the scrutiny to which they were subjected when initially using a Dominican-flagged aircraft. <em>See </em>Joint App\u2019x at 245. UC-1, one of the undercover pilots, testified that he flew to Miami to arrange for the rental of a \u201ccold plane,\u201d meaning that it did not have any problems with the authorities and was not suspected of drug smuggling. <em>See United States v. Epskamp, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00120-RJS-2, ECF Docket No. 190 at 285, 430-33. The United States plainly has an interest in prosecuting narcotics conspiracies that dispatch participants into the United States in order to secure United States-registered aircraft with the deliberate intent to exploit the perceived authority and lawfulness of such aircraft. <em>Cf. Al Kassar, </em>660 F.3d at 119 (\u201cIf an undercover operation exposes criminal activity that targets U.S. citizens or interests or threatens the security or government functions of the United States, a sufficient jurisdictional nexus exists notwithstanding that the investigation took place abroad and focused only on foreign persons.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">B. Epskamp\u2019s Ignorance of the Aircraft\u2019s Registration in the United States Does Not Implicate Due Process</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Epskamp further argues that, even if the United States does have an interest in prosecuting crimes aboard United States-registered aircraft, due process bars prosecution of him in this case because he was ignorant of this particular aircraft\u2019s country of origin. He contends that he therefore did not receive fair warning that he faced prosecution in the United States. Not so. Knowledge of the aircraft\u2019s country of registration is legally irrelevant for purposes of due process. \u201cThe idea of fair warning is that \u2018no man shall be held criminally responsible for conduct which he could not reasonably understand to be proscribed.\u2019 \u201d <em>Al Kassar, </em>660 F.3d at 119 (quoting <em>Bouie v. City of Columbia, </em>378 U.S. 347, 351, 84 S.Ct. 1697, 12 L.Ed.2d 894 (1964)). \u201cFair warning does not require that the defendants understand that they could be subject to criminal prosecution <em>in the United States </em>so long as they would reasonably understand that their conduct was criminal and would subject them to prosecution somewhere.\u201d <em>Id; United States v. Martinez-Hidalgo, </em>993 F.2d 1052, 1056 (3d Cir. 1993) (\u201cInasmuch as the trafficking of narcotics is condemned universally by law-abiding nations, we see no reason to conclude that it is \u2018fundamentally unfair\u2019 for Congress to provide for the punishment of persons apprehended with narcotics on the high seas.\u201d). Here, Epskamp\u2019s behavior was \u201cself-evidently criminal,\u201d <em>see Al Kassar, </em>660 F.3d at 119, and he had every reason to anticipate prosecution for his conduct.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In sum, no due process violation occurred when Epskamp was haled into United States court.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In sum, for the foregoing reasons and the reasons' stated in the separate summary order filed today, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b183-12\">. Prior to trial, Epskamp moved for dismissal of the indictment for lack of jurisdiction.

That \u00a7 959(b) expressly contemplates possession with intent to distribute aboard an aircraft is of no consequence, as the pre-1986 understanding of \u00a7 841(a) already criminalized domestic possession with intent to distribute aboard aircraft. <em>See, e.g., United States v.

Section 841, the \"core provision,\u201d of the Act, \"made it unlawful to manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to distribute a controlled substance within the United States,\u201d whereas \"Section 959, by contrast, included an express extraterrito-rially provision.\u201d <em>Knowles, </em>- F.Supp.3d at -, 2016 WL 3365373, at *5. \"So .the object behind enacting section 959 was to reach conduct occurring outside the United States <em>that would not be covered otherwise.\" Id. </em>(emphasis added). In other words, contrary to the duplicative reading urged by Epskamp, the two provisions were deliberately enacted in tandem to complement, rather than copy, one another.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-21\">We do not mean to suggest that the presumption against superfluity necessarily trumps, by itself, the presumption against extraterritoriality in every instance. The Supreme Court has suggested that it does not. <em>See E.E.O.C. v. Aramco, </em>499 U.S. 244, at 253-54, 111 S.Ct. 1227, 113 L.Ed.2d 274 (1991). And although courts \"construe statutes to avoid surplusage whenever possible,\u201d <em>Perez v. Westchester Cty. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>587 F.3d 143, 155 (2d Cir. 2009), \"[t]he canon against sur-plusage is not an absolute rule,\u201d <em>Marx v. Gen. Revenue </em>Corp., - U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1166, 1177, 185 L.Ed.2d 242 (2013). We rely on the canon against superfluity here because it consistent with and reinforces our reading of the statute in other respects.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b192-6\">. As the government observes in its brief, Congress made several findings with respect to the Act, including that American anti-drug policy required \"increased emphasis on stopping narcotics traffickers in countries through which drugs are transshipped\u201d and \"increased emphasis on the interdiction of drugs and drug smugglers at the borders of the United States, in the air, at sea, and on the land.\u201d Pub. L. 99-570, \u00a7 3002, 100 Stat 3207, 3207-73.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b193-6\">. Epskamp did not object to the challenged jury charge below and, accordingly, his claim on appeal is waived or forfeited. <em>See, e.g., Fogarty v. Near N. Ins. Brokerage, Inc., </em>162 F.3d 74, 79 (2d Cir. 1998) (\"A party who fails to object to a jury instruction at trial waives the right to make that instruction the basis for an appeal.\u201d). Indeed, the very instructions to which Epskamp now objects on appeal were included in the Joint Proposed Requests to Charge he submitted to the District Court in tandem with the government. See <em>United States v. Epskamp, </em>No. 1:12-cr-00120-RJS-2, ECF Docket No. 167. Epskamp cannot \u2014 and indeed, does not even attempt to \u2014 meet his burden of showing plain error in the District Court\u2019s instructions. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Feliciano, </em>223 F.3d 102, 115 (2d Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Vasquez, </em>267 F.3d 79, 87 (2d Cir. 2001). Nonetheless, we address this issue because it bears not only upon the District Court\u2019s jury instructions, but also Epskamp's challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b193-10\">. This language was added to \u00a7 959(a) as part of the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015. <em>See supra </em>note 6. Substantively identical language, included as part of the statute's original enactment in 1970 and remaining after the 1986 amendments, existed at the time of Epskamp\u2019s conviction. <em>See </em>Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>Act, Pub. L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236 (October 27, 1970) (\"SEC. 1009. It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute a controlled substance in schedule I or II \u2014 (1) <em>intending </em>that such substance be unlawfully imported into the United States; or (2) <em>knowing </em>that such substance will be unlawfully imported into the United States.\" (emphases added)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b194-12\">. Indeed, only one reported federal appellate case has held that an insufficient nexus existed in an instance where Congress expressly intended a statute to apply extraterritorially. <em>See United States v. Perlaza, </em>439 F.3d 1149, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>1168 (9th Cir. 2006). But in <em>Perlaza, </em>there was no evidence that the narcotics seized aboard a foreign-flagged vessel manned by a foreign crew had any connection at all to the United States. Irrespective of due process concerns, such facts would fail to meet \u00a7 959(b)\u2019s statutory requirement that the extraterritorial conduct involve a \"United States citizen on board any aircraft, or any person on board an aircraft owned by a United States citizen or registered in the United States.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 959(b). Thus, the instant case is factually and legally distinguishable from <em>Perla-za.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b195-10\">. The sole case upon which Epskamp relies, <em>United States v. Sidorenko, </em>102 F.Supp.3d 1124, 1127 (N.D. Cal. 2015), is irrelevant. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>that case, the District Court first determined that the criminal statutes at issue \u2014 including, <em>inter alia, </em>bribery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 666(a) and wire fraud under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1343 \u2014 did not, by their own terms, apply exlraterritorially, effectively rendering its alternative due process holding <em>obiter dicta. See Sidorenko, </em>102 F.Supp.3d at 1127. Even considering its due process analysis for its persuasiveness, the case is plainly distinguishable, not least of all because \u00a7 959 is expressly intended to apply extraterritorially to combat international narcotics smuggling, whereas the bribery and wire fraud statutes in <em>Sidorenko </em>were aimed at domestic conduct. Further, the defendant in <em>Sidorenko </em>was a non-citizen whose conduct entirely took place abroad without the aim of harming an interest of the United States. <em>Id. </em>at 1133. Here, Epskamp's conduct occurred aboard a United States-registered aircraft that was itself directly retrieved from the United States by a perceived member of the conspiracy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
