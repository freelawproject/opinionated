It requires us to reconsider the continuing viability of our Court\u2019s precedent in <em>Greenberg v. Bear, Stearns &amp; Co., </em>220 F.3d 22 (2d Cir. 2000), in which we held that a district court may exercise federal-question jurisdiction over a \u00a7 10 petition only if the petition states a substantial federal question on its <em>face</em>\u2014i.e., a district court may not \u201clook through\u201d the petition to determine if the underlying dispute that was subject to arbitration involved substantial questions of federal law. <em>Greenberg </em>premised its conclusion on a now-overruled decision of this Court that rejected a look-through approach as applied to section 4 of the Act, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4. <em>See Westmoreland Capital Corp. v. Findlay, </em>100 F.3d 263 (2d Cir. 1996), <em>overruled by Vaden v. Discover Bank, </em>556 U.S. 49, 129 S.Ct. 1262, 173 L.Ed.2d 206 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-16\">We would not need to decide whether <em>Greenberg </em>remains good law if, as Appellant argues, federal-question jurisdiction exists on the face of the petition because of an arbitration panel\u2019s alleged manifest disregard of a self-regulatory organization\u2019s internal rule. But because the arbitration panel\u2019s conduct implicates no federal law and thus cannot form the basis of jurisdiction, <em>Greenberg\u2019s </em>continued viability takes center stage. We conclude that <em>Greenberg </em>cannot survive <em>Vaden\u2019s </em>later-established precedent; accordingly, we vacate the order and the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>BACKGROUND<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">In June 2013, Petitioner-Appellant Drew Doscher \u2014 the onetime co-head of sales and trading for The Seaport Group, LLC and Sea' Port Group Securities, LLC (together, \u201cSeaport\u201d) \u2014 commenced arbitration against his former employers; both are members of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Doscher also included the individual Respondents-Appellees \u2014 the two founders of Seaport and his former co-head of sales and trading \u2014 as well as the other three entity Respondents-Appellees. His initial statement of claim against his counterparties alleged breach of contract, retaliatory discharge, and unjust enrichment, but he later amended his statement to add a claim for securities fraud under' section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d), 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. Doscher sought more than $15 million in damages; ultimately, on October 22, 2013, the arbitral panel awarded him almost $2.3 million, with a potential additional commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">On January 20, 2015, Doscher filed a \u00a7 10 petition to vacate and modify in part the award in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Furman, /.). His petition identified two grounds for vacatur: (1) the arbitration panel failed to ensure that documentary evidence was fully and timely made available to Doscher, thereby warranting vaca-tur under \u00a7 10(a)(3), and (2) the arbitration panel acted in manifest disregard of FIN-RA Rule 13505 requiring parties to cooperate in discovery. Doscher asserted that the District Court possessed subject matter jurisdiction because, first, FINRA Rule 13505 was a rule of federal law and the petition thus stated a federal question on its face, and, second, that his section 10(b) claim in the underlying arbitration conferred federal-question jurisdiction. On August 5, 2015, the District Court issued a memorandum opinion and order rejecting both arguments. First, it held that violations of internal FINRA rules do not present questions of federal law, and second, it held that Doseher\u2019s reliance on his section 10(b) claim was \u201csquarely foreclosed\u201d by <em>Greenberg, </em>which the District Court concluded remained good law. <em>Doscher, </em>2015 WL 4643159, at *2-4. Finding no subject matter jurisdiction, the District Court dismissed the petition in its entirety and entered judgment in Appellees\u2019 favor on August 7, 2015.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b400-10\">Both grounds for subject matter jurisdiction asserted by Doscher turn on questions of law, which we review <em>de novo. See Hachamovitch v. DeBuono, </em>159 F.3d 687, 693 (2d Cir. 1998). Doscher\u2019s argument that a substantial federal question appears on the face of the petition receives our initial attention; if his contention were cor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>rect, we would have no need to address <em>Greenberg\u2019s </em>continued vitality.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">As explained in <em>Greenberg, </em>federal-question jurisdiction lies on the face of the petition where \u201cthe petitioner complains principally and in good faith that the award was rendered in manifest disregard of federal law.\u201d <em>Greenberg, </em>220 F.3d at 27; <em>accord Perpetual Sec., Inc. v. Tang, </em>290 F.3d 132, 139 (2d Cir. 2002).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Implicit in this holding is the requirement that the legal rule that the arbitration panel allegedly manifestly disregarded is in fact a rule of <em>federal </em>law.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-7\">Doscher argues that the internal rules of self-regulatory organizations (\u201cSROs\u201d) such as FINRA are federal law, because those rules are subject to SEC approval, abrogation, or modification, <em>see </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b)-(c), and because SROs are obligated both to abide by and to enforce their own internal rules, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 78s(g). He specifically alleges that the arbitration panel failed to enforce FINRA Rule 13505, which provides, in full, that \u201c[t]he parties must cooperate to the fullest extent practicable in the exchange of documents and information to expedite the arbitration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b401-8\">In support of his argument, Doscher relies on a recent decision of our Court, <em>NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. v. UBS Securities, LLC, </em>770 F.3d 1010 (2d Cir. 2014). In <em>NASDAQ, </em>although the plaintiffs alleged four claims arising under state law, \u201ca singular duty underlay] all four\u201d\u2014 namely, \u201cNASDAQ\u2019s duty to operate a fair and orderly market \u2014 a duty sourced in the Exchange Act, amplified by SEC regulations, and implemented through SEC-approved NASDAQ rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1021. Thus, we concluded, any inquiry into whether this duty was violated \u2014 an essential element of the four state-law claims \u2014 necessarily raised substantial and disputed questions of federal law. <em>Id. </em>at 1023 (applying <em>Gunn v. Minton, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 1059, 1065, 185 L.Ed.2d 72 (2013)).</p>\n<p id=\"b401-12\">Doscher\u2019s case is built on a distinctly different and, unfortunately for him, unstable foundation. As discussed above, the Exchange Act requires FINRA to subject its internal rules to SEC approval, abrogation, or modification. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78s(b)(l), (c).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Exchange Act also requires FINRA to comply with its own internal rules and to enforce compliance by its members and associated persons. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 78s(g)(l)(B). While Doscher must allege that the arbitration panel manifestly disregarded a rule of federal law, federal law imposes obligations only on self-regulatory organizations \u2014 not on arbitration panels applying their rules. Moreover, the rule implicated here is one step further removed: it directs \u201c[t]he <em>parties </em>[to] cooperate to the fullest extent practicable.\u201d FINRA Rule 13505 (emphasis added). Doscher\u2019s claim is, in essence, that the Exchange Act requires FINRA to require the arbitration panel to require the parties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>to cooperate, and the parties did not cooperate. The only federal obligation is the one imposed by the Exchange Act on FINRA, and none of FINRA\u2019s conduct is implicated by Doscher\u2019s petition. Doscher\u2019s asserted violation is simply too attenuated to constitute a colorable claim that any obligation or duty of federal law was manifestly disregarded. Thus, this case is wholly unlike <em>NASDAQ, </em>in which an obligation imposed by federal law on an SRO \u2014 to operate a fair and orderly market \u2014 was a necessary element of the state law actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">Doscher\u2019s position is not without some support. He directs our attention to <em>Sacks v. Dietrich, </em>663 F.3d 1065, 1069 (9th Cir. 2011), in which the Ninth Circuit ruled that federal-question jurisdiction extended to claims premised on violations of internal FINRA rules by arbitrators. Specifically, the plaintiff in <em>Sacks </em>filed a suit in state court, challenging the arbitrators\u2019 decision to disqualify him as a party\u2019s representative in a FINRA arbitration, because he had been barred from the securities industry twenty years prior. <em>Id. </em>at 1067; <em>see also </em>FINRA Rule 13208(c) (precluding persons \u201ccurrently suspended or barred from the securities industry in any capacity\u201d from representing a party in FINRA arbitration). The defendants removed the case to federal court. The Ninth Circuit concluded that the removal was proper \u201cbecause the central question of this case [was] whether FINRA rules were violated\u201d and thus \u201capplication of federal law [was] necessary to resolve each of the state law theories.\u201d <em>Sacks, </em>663 F.3d at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">In reaching this conclusion, the court relied heavily on a prior Ninth Circuit precedent, <em>Sparta Surgical Corp. v. National Ass\u2019n of Securities Dealers, Inc., </em>159 F.3d 1209 (9th Cir. 1998). In <em>Sparta, </em>the plaintiffs had asserted state common-law claims that alleged, as a necessary component of the claims, conduct by the National Association of Securities Dealers (\u201cNASD\u201d)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that violated its internal rules. The Ninth Circuit concluded that \u201c[because federal courts are vested by 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa with the exclusive jurisdiction over actions brought \u2018to enforce any liability or duty\u2019 created by exchange rules,\u201d federal jurisdiction was proper. <em>Id. </em>at 1212. Relying on <em>Sparta, </em>the <em>Sacks </em>court saw no distinction between a case in which the SRO violated its own rules and one in which an arbitrator was charged with the rule violation: the <em>Sacks </em>panel chose to ground its decision on the characterization of internal SRO rules as federal law, regardless of the identity of the alleged violator. <em>Sacks, </em>663 F.3d at 1069.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">With due respect to our sister circuit, its reasoning is unpersuasive. There is a critical difference between cases like <em>Sparta </em>and <em>NASDAQ </em>involving allegations that the SRO breached its own internal rules and cases like <em>Sacks </em>and Doscher\u2019s involving allegations that someone other than the SRO violated the internal rules. In the former, the SRO\u2019s conduct may breach \u00a7 78s(g)(1), while in the latter, neither the cause of action nor any necessary element of it involves adjudicating any breach of a federal obligation.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">More importantly, however, whatever force existed in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that any violation of internal SRO rules falls categorically within 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78aa\u2019s grant of \u201cexclusive [federal] jurisdiction of violations of [Chapter 2B of Title 15] or the rules and regulations thereunder,\u201d it is no longer tenable following the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v. Manning, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 136 S.Ct. 1562, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>194 L.Ed.2d 671 (2016).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Manning, </em>the Supreme Court adopted the Third Circuit\u2019s test for determining what actions fall under exclusive federal jurisdiction under \u00a7 78aa, laying out an identical inquiry to the familiar \u201carising under\u201d test for federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. <em>Id. </em>at 1567-68. In doing so, it expressly rejected <em>Sparta\u2019s </em>broader interpretation. <em>See id. </em>at 1567 <em>&amp; </em>n.1. Applying the same principles as the \u201carising under\u201d standard, the Court held that \u00a7 78aa applies to two kinds of suits: (1) those in which \u201cfederal law creates the cause of action asserted\u201d and (2) \u201c \u2018a special and small category of cases\u2019 \u201d that \u201c \u2018necessarily raised a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Manning, </em>136 S.Ct. at 1569-70 (quoting <em>Gunn, </em>133 S.Ct. at 1064; <em>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng\u2019g &amp; Mfg., </em>545 U.S. 308, 314, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005)). The Court characterized the first category as encompassing those cases \u201casserting an Exchange Act cause of <em>action\u201d' </em>\u2014 i.e., \u201cthe prototypical way of enforcing an Exchange Act duty.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1569. For the second category, the Court twice framed the inquiry as whether the non-Exchange Act action \u201cnecessarily depends on a showing that the <em>defendant </em>breached the Exchange Act\u201d or whether the' plaintiff must prove \u201cas the cornerstone of his suit, that the <em>defendant </em>infringed a requirement of the federal statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphases added).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As described above, the Exchange Act itself imposes no duty to comply with FINRA rules either on the arbitrators or non-SRO parties to arbitration. An action to vacate an arbitration award on either ground therefore falls into neither of <em>Manning\u2019s </em>categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-12\">Doscher\u2019s petition does not present a facial claim of any manifest disregard of federal law. All that remains is to check <em>Greenberg\u2019s </em>pulse for vital signs in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Vaden.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-4\">It is a longstanding rule of our Circuit that a three-judge panel is bound by a prior panel\u2019s decisipn until it is overruled either by this Court sitting <em>en banc </em>or by the Supreme Court. <em>See United States v. Wilkerson, </em>361 F.3d 717, 732 (2d Cir. 2004); see <em>also Ingram v. Kumar, </em>585 F.2d 566, 568 (2d Cir. 1978). Nonetheless, we have consistently recognized two instances in which a three-judge panel may issue an opinion that overrules Circuit\u2019 precedent. The first is often called a \u201cmini-eTC <em>banc,\u201d </em>in which the, panel circulates its opinion among all active judges and receives no objections to its filing. <em>See, e.g., Shipping Corp. of India Ltd. v. Jaldhi, </em>585 F.3d 58, 67 &amp; n.9 (2d Cir. 2009); <em>see also United States v. Roglieri, </em>700 F.2d 883, 887 n.2 (2d Cir. 1983). The second is \u201cwhere an intervening Supreme Court decision casts doubt on the prior ruling.\u201d <em>E.g., Finkel v. Stratton Corp., </em>962 F.2d 169, 174-75 (2d Cir. 1992); <em>cf. Boothe v. Hammock, </em>605 F.2d 661, 663 (2d Cir. 1979).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">To qualify as an intervening decision, the Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in a particular case must have \u201cbroke[n] the link ... on which we premised our [prior] decision,\u201d <em>Finkel, </em>962 F.2d at 175, or \u201cundermine[d] [an] assumption\u201d of that decision, <em>Sullivan v. Am. Airlines, Inc., </em>424 F.3d 267, 274 (2d Cir. 2005). It is hot, however, necessary that the Supreme Court have \u201caddress[ed] the precise issue decided by the panel for this exception to apply.\u201d <em>In re Zarnel, </em>619 F.3d 156, 168 (2d Cir. 2010). If a panel concludes that a particular Supreme Court decision does not cast sufficient doubt on our precedent, the precedent continues to be binding. <em>See, e.g., FDIC v. First Horizon Asset Sec., Inc., </em>821 F.3d 372, 375-76 (2d Cir. 2016); <em>United States v. Robbins, </em>729 F.3d 131, 135-36 (2d Cir. 2013); <em>European Cmty. v. RJR Nabisco, Inc., </em>424 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir. 2005) (Sotomayor, J.). When sufficient doubt exists, however, and the panel must reconsider whether that precedent should continue as the law of the Circuit, it not only applies the conclusions of the intervening Supreme Court case but also employs normal interpretive methods and examines such things as the internal consistency of the statute, statutory purpose and legislative history, analogous statutes, and even changes in the judicial landscape and the conclusions of other Circuits. <em>See, e.g., Lotes Co. v. Hon Hai Precision Indus. Co., </em>753 F.3d 395, 405-08 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>United States v. Gill, </em>748 F.3d 491, 501-04 (2d Cir. 2014); <em>Sullivan, </em>424 F.3d at 274-77; <em>Union of Needletrades, Indus. &amp; Textile Emps. v. INS, </em>336 F.3d 200, 210 (2d Cir. 2003). Even if the effect of a Supreme Court decision is \u201csubtle,\u201d it may nonetheless alter the relevant analysis fundamentally enough to require overruling prior, \u201cinconsistent\u201d precedent. <em>Wojchowski v. Daines, </em>498 F.3d 99, 108 (2d Cir. 2007) (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b404-8\">A less-than-stringent application of the standards for overruling prior decisions not only calls into question a panel\u2019s respect for its predecessors but also increases uncertainty in the law by revisiting precedent without cause. Nonetheless, a three-judge panel must answer a question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>squarely presented if no other avenue for resolution of the case exists. <em>See Sullivan, </em>424 F.3d at 274 (\u201cBecause the [Supreme] Court\u2019s more recent decision ... entirely undermines [our prior] assumption about the RLA, we must reconsider [prior] conclusions about RLA preemption without rehearing this case en banc.\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Doscher has argued to us that <em>Vaden </em>displaces <em>Greenberg. </em>Finding no other basis for decision in this case, we must therefore evaluate <em>Greenberg's, </em>continuing validity.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">Section 4 of the Act provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-7\">A party aggrieved by the alleged failure, neglect, or refusal of another to arbitrate under a written agreement for arbitration may petition any United States district court <em>which, save for such agreement, would have jurisdiction under Title 28, in a civil action or in admiralty of the subject matter of a suit arising out of the controversy between the parties, </em>for an order directing that such arbitration proceed in the manner provided for in such agreement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">9 U.S.C. \u00a7 4 (emphasis added). By contrast, section 10 of the Act provides that \u201cthe United States court <em>in and for the district wherein the award was made </em>may make an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to the arbitration\u201d if certain grounds for vacatur exist. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 10(a) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The critical question before us is whether the textual difference between \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 10 means that a look-through approach applies only to the former.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-10\"><em>Westmoreland </em>rejected the look-through approach with respect to \u00a7 4 based on the decisions of a number of district courts in our Circuit, as well as the decisions of our sister circuits. <em>See </em>100 F.3d at 267 (citing cases). In chief, <em>Westmoreland </em>accepted the reasoning of <em>Drexel Burnham Lambert, Inc. v. Valenzuela Bock, </em>696 F.Supp. 957 (S.D.N.Y. 1988), a decision penned by Judge Leval while still on the district court. <em>Valenzuela Bock </em>held, and <em>Westmoreland </em>agreed, that the \u201csave for\u201d clause in \u00a7 4 constituted a congressional repudiation of the \u201couster theory\u201d \u2014 an \u201cantiquated common law principle that an agreement to arbitrate would oust the federal courts of jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Westmoreland, </em>100 F.3d at 268 (citing <em>Valenzuela Bock, </em>696 F.Supp. at 961-62). Additionally, <em>West-moreland </em>noted that the provisions lacking \u00a7 4\u2019s unique language \u201chave not been interpreted to confer jurisdiction on the federal courts\u201d and that it \u201cwould produce an odd distinction\u201d if \u201ca petition to compel arbitration could be brought in federal court, but a petition under FAA \u00a7\u00a7 9 or 10 to confirm or vacate the arbitration award in the same dispute could not.\u201d <em>Id. Westmoreland </em>again relied on <em>Valenzuela Bock\u2019s </em>reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b405-11\">This distinction would truly be \u201cbizarre,\u201d because \u201c[t]he interest of the federal court in determining whether the arbitration award was entered in manifest disregard of the federal law ... would seem to be far greater than the federal interest in seeing that the claims could be arbitrated.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b405-12\"><em>Id. </em>(alterations in original) (quoting <em>Valenzuela Bock, </em>696 F.Supp. at 963).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>Four years later, a second panel of this Court was asked to determine whether it possessed federal-question jurisdiction over a \u00a7 10 petition. It rejected the look-through approach for such petitions squarely and exclusively on the basis of <em>Westmoreland. See Greenberg, </em>220 F.3d at 26. In doing so, it reiterated <em>Westmore-land\u2019s </em>reliance on the \u201couster theory\u201d explanation and then held that \u201c[t]he holding in <em>Westmoreland </em>logically extends to motions to vacate an arbitration award under \u00a7 10 of FAA,\u201d additionally citing the holdings of two other circuits and two district courts in our Circuit. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Greenberg </em>panel reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-4\">As with a motion under \u00a7 4, the only federal rights that a motion under \u00a7 10 necessarily implicates are those created by the FAA itself, which rights do not give rise to federal question jurisdiction. In both contexts, there is no necessary link between the requested relief and the character of the underlying dispute. For example, a petition to compel arbitration because the dispute falls within the scope of an arbitration clause, or to vacate an award because the arbitrators exceeded their powers under that clause, will turn on the interpretation of the clause, regardless of whether the actual dispute implicates any federal laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-5\"><em>Id. </em>It went on to conclude, however, that if a petition raised an argument \u201cthat the award was rendered in manifest disregard, of federal law, a substantial federal question is presented and the federal courts have jurisdiction to entertain the petition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">Nine years after <em>Greenberg, </em>the Supreme Court expressly overruled <em>West-moreland </em>in its <em>Vaden </em>decision. It began by reaffirming its longstanding conclusion that the Act \u201cis something of an anomaly in the realm of federal legislation: It bestows no federal jurisdiction but rather requires for access to a federal forum an independent jurisdictional basis over the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d <em>Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted). Next, it laid out the general rules of federal-question jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 \u2014 the \u201cindependent jurisdictional basis\u201d relied upon by the petitioner. <em>Id. </em>The Court then announced that \u201c[a] federal court may \u2018look through\u2019 a \u00a7 4 petition to determine whether it is predicated on an action that \u2018arises under\u2019 federal law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">This rule was, the Court held, driven by the text of \u00a7 4:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-9\">The phrase \u201csave for [the arbitration] agreement\u201d indicates that the district court should assume the absence of the arbitration agreement and determine whether it \u201cwould have jurisdiction under title 28\u201d without it. Jurisdiction over what? The text of \u00a7 4 refers us to \u201cthe controversy between the parties!,]\u201d ... [which is] most straightforwardly read to mean the \u201csubstantive conflict between the parties.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-10\"><em>Id. </em>(first alteration in original) (citations omitted) (quoting \u00a7 4). The Court noted that a majority of the federal courts of appeals had rejected such an approach but concluded that the \u201couster theory\u201d explanation on which most relied was not persuasive: if any lingering ouster doctrine existed, section 2 of the Act, which declared all arbitration agreements valid and enforceable, \u201cdirectly attended to the problem.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 64, 129 S.Ct. 1262. The Court then noted that rejecting the look-through approach had \u201ccurious practical consequences\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-11\">It would permit a federal court to entertain a \u00a7 4 petition only when a federal-question suit is already before the court, when the parties satisfy the requirements for diversity-of-citizenship juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>diction, or when the dispute over arbi-trability involves a maritime contract.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (citing <em>Westmoreland, </em>100 F.3d at 268-69). In other words, if a federal-question suit was filed in federal court, the court could compel arbitration \u2014 but if the suit had not already been filed, it could not. <em>Id. </em>This approach \u201c \u2018create[d] a totally artificial distinction\u2019 based on whether a dispute is subject to pending federal litigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting 1 I. MacNeil, R. Speidel &amp; T. Stipanowich, Federal AebitratioN Law \u00a7 9.2.3.3, at 9:21 (1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">We think it clear that <em>Vaden </em>satisfies the standard for an intervening Supreme Court decision that \u201ccasts doubt on the prior ruling\u201d in <em>Greenberg. Finkel, </em>962 F.2d at 175. The only rationale <em>Greenberg </em>employed to reach its conclusion was \u201clogically extend[ingj\u201d <em>Westmoreland\u2019s </em>rejection of the look-through approach to \u00a7 10. <em>Greenberg, </em>220 F.3d at 26. Put another way, if one were to excise all reliance upon <em>Westmoreland </em>from <em>Greenberg, </em>we would be left exclusively with a question and an answer but no intervening reasoning. The necessary conclusion is that <em>Vaden </em>both \u201cbroke the link,\u201d <em>Finkel, </em>962 F.2d at 175, and \u201cundermine[d] [the] assumption,\u201d <em>Sullivan, </em>424 F.3d at 274, underlying <em>Green-berg\u2019s </em>conclusion that the look-through approach was inapplicable to \u00a7 10.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Of course, the inquiry does not end here: our task now is to determine whether <em>Green-berg\u2019s </em>result is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with <em>Vaden </em>and the post <em>-Vaden </em>statutory context of the Act. <em>E.g., Wojchowski, </em>498 F.3d at 108; <em>see also Lotes Co., </em>753 F.3d at 406.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\"><em>Vaden </em>provides us with three critical pieces of guidance. First, it reiterated the longstanding rule that the Act\u2019s provisions do not bestow or enlarge subject matter jurisdiction. Second, it relied heavily upon the text of, and interaction between, the relevant provisions of the Act. Third, it identified the practical consequences resulting from the interpretive choices. The application of these three guideposts, however, is significantly more complicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-11\">Beginning with the most obvious point, \u00a7 10 lacks the textual \u201csave for\u201d clause contained in \u00a7 4. This distinction is not to be taken lightly, particularly in the face of the Supreme Court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]he text of \u00a7 4 drives our conclusion\u201d adopting the look-through approach. <em>Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> In construing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>\u00a7 10, however, we must also keep in mind \u201cthe cardinal rule that a statute is to be read as a whole, since the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\u201d <em>King v. St. Vincent\u2019s Hosp., </em>502 U.S. 215, 221, 112 S.Ct. 570, 116 L.Ed.2d 578 (1991) (citation omitted); <em>accord Auburn Hous. Auth. v. Martinez, </em>277 F.3d 138, 144 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201c[T]he preferred meaning of a statutory provision is one that is consonant with the rest of the statute.\u201d). We think Vaden\u2019s other two guiding principles counsel against a too-hasty reliance on the absence of the \u201csave for\u201d clause. Perhaps in an ordinary case, this absence would end our inquiry \u2014 but the Act\u2019s anomalous characteristics warrant, we think, a more careful examination. We focus first on the jurisdictional context of <em>Vaden </em>and this case and second on the practical consequences of both interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><em>Vaden </em>repeated the Supreme Court\u2019s longstanding conclusion that the Act \u201cbestows no federal jurisdiction but rather requires for access to a federal forum an independent jurisdictional basis over the parties\u2019 dispute.\u201d 556 U.S. at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (alterations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also id. </em>at 79, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that the Act \u201cenlarg[es] the range of remedies available in the federal courts[,] ... not extend[s] their jurisdiction\u201d (second and third alterations in original)). The \u201cindependent jurisdictional basis\u201d in <em>Vaden, </em>like this case, was federal-question jurisdiction deriving from \u00a7 1331. <em>Id. </em>at 59-60, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (majority opinion). After laying out the contours of federal-question jurisdiction, the Court concluded that the \u201cdispute\u201d giving rise to \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction was the \u201csubstantive conflict between the parties.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 63, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (internal quotation marks omitted). Although the Court was unanimous on these points\u2014 and on the applicability of the look-through approach \u2014 it was divided on how to define the substantive controversy.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Despite this disagreement over the scope of the dispute, all nine Justices agreed that \u201cthe basic rules of federal-court jurisdiction ... must be followed under \u00a7 4.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 79, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">The only reasonable reading of Vaden\u2019s jurisdictional analysis thus makes clear two conclusions. First, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>possessed jurisdiction only by operation of \u00a7 1331. Second, the federal question required by \u00a7 1331 arose from the underlying dispute, not the face of the petition. These conclusions, however, pose a challenge to the proposition that no look-through approach is appropriate in \u00a7 10 petitions, based solely on the statutory text.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\"><em>Pre-Vaden, </em>rejecting the look-through approach with respect to all of the Act\u2019s provisions made sense, because a federal court simply compared its jurisdictional statutes to the face of the petition. <em>See Greenberg, </em>220 F.3d at 26 (holding that, in both \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 10, \u201cthe only federal rights ... necessarily implicate^] are those created by the FAA itself, which rights do not give rise to federal question jurisdiction\u201d); <em>Westmoreland, </em>100 F.3d at 267-68 (assuming no look-through approach would apply to \u00a7\u00a7 9 and 10). Under such a construction, for example, whether an action under the Act presented a substantial federal question sufficient to confer jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 always depended on whether the face of the petition met the standards of federal-question jurisdiction.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> In essence, the \u201cwell-pleaded complaint\u201d for our jurisdictional inquiries was the petition, regardless of which particular remedy under the Act the petitioner sought. Pos <em>t-Vaden, </em>however, that consistency has been called into question. If we assume that \u00a7 4\u2019s unique textual clause is dispositive regarding jurisdiction, then, for most of the Act\u2019s provisions, federal-question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331 lies (or not) on the face of the petition. In other words, the \u201cordinary\u201d \u00a7 1331 <em>inquiry </em>\u2014 ie., the one conducted absent any special textual clause \u2014 requires examining the face of the petition. For \u00a7 4 petitions, however, a court\u2019s federal-question jurisdiction lies (or not) on the basis of the underlying substantive dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">The inconsistency here is evident: if \u201c\u00a7 4 of the FAA does not enlarge federal-court jurisdiction,\u201d <em>e.g., Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 66, 129 S.Ct. 1262, how can a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction under the <em>same </em>jurisdictional statute <em>differ </em>between \u00a7 4 and all other remedies under the Act? <em>Post-Vaden, </em>there is no question that a federal court\u2019s \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction extends to \u00a7 4 petitions that it would have been unable to entertain applying a face-of-the-petition approach. A district court\u2019s jurisdiction over disputes in which a party seeks a \u00a7 4 remedy is, therefore, broader than its jurisdiction over disputes in which a party seeks one of the other remedies provided by the Act.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Put <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>differently, the necessary result of limiting the look-through approach solely to \u00a7 4 petitions is to conclude that the same dispute between the parties would be sufficient to confer \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction for the purposes of \u00a7 4 petitions but insufficient to confer \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction for the purposes of any of the Act\u2019s other.remedies. That is simply not logically possible without construing \u00a7 4 to expand federal jurisdiction\u2014 a conclusion the Supreme Court has expressly forbidden us to draw.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">Thus, there is some tension between two controlling principles in <em>Vaden: </em>the first emphasizing \u00a7 4\u2019s text in concluding that a court has federal-question jurisdiction over \u00a7 4 petitions based on the underlying substantive dispute, <em>see </em>556 U.S. at 62, 129 S.Ct. 1262, and the second emphasizing that the provisions of the Act do not affect a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction, <em>see id. </em>at 59, 66, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (\u201c[Section] 4 of the FAA <em>does not enlarge </em>federal-court jurisdiction .... \u201d (emphasis added)).<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If we apply the first principle to conclude that the absence of the \u201csave for\u201d clause in \u00a7 10 requires us to maintain the rule of <em>Greenberg, </em>we have, in essence, converted \u00a7 4\u2019s \u201csave for\u201d clause into an expansion of jurisdiction \u2014 \u25a0 which violates the second principle. The only way to avoid this contradictory result is to reject the premise that produced it\u2014 <em>i.e., </em>to conclude that the \u201cordinary\u201d jurisdictional inquiry under \u00a7 1331 looks to the underlying substantive dispute with respect to all remedies under the Act, not just \u00a7 4.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">This tension is further resolved when we examine the nature and function of the \u201csave for\u201d clause in \u00a7 4 and the language of the Act\u2019s other remedies. To some degree, each of the Act\u2019s sections contains some language identifying which courts are authorized to issue which remedies. The most consistent statutory interpretation is to read the \u201csave for\u201d clause as defining the availability of the <em>remedy, </em>rather than a court\u2019s jurisdiction. Because Congress intended to ensure the broadest availability possible for compulsion of arbitration, \u00a7 4 authorizes it in the context of every dispute over which Title 28 confers jurisdiction. The lack of the \u201csave for\u201d clause and the presence of other text narrowing the availability of the remedies in the Act\u2019s other sections similarly authorize particular remedies to issue in particular courts to serve important congressional interests. Specifically, the Act\u2019s other sections largely ground their authorizing language by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>reference to geography, not the jurisdiction of the issuing court.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">For example, the remedy permitting a federal court to compel the attendance of witnesses limits its authorization to \u201cthe United States district court for the district in which such arbitrators, or a majority of them, are sitting.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 7.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Section 9 uses the same geographical hook, only linked to the district \u201cwithin which such award was made\u201d and also expressly establishes personal jurisdiction over the parties; \u00a7\u00a7 10-11 are similarly geographically connected to the location of the arbitration. The identification of district courts by geography in \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9-11 performs functions more analogous to venue or personal jurisdiction than to subject matter jurisdiction.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> These sections signal nothing about jurisdiction, suggesting \u2014 consistent with <em>Vaden </em>\u2014 that they do not affect the ordinary jurisdictional inquiry, which is focused on the underlying dispute. There is thus no reason to construe the \u201csave for\u201d clause \u2014 or its absence from the other remedies \u2014 as governing the predicate question of whether a federal court possesses jurisdiction over the dispute at all.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Construing the language of these sections as authorizing the availability of the remedies, rather than controlling jurisdiction over the dispute, is therefore a more consistent interpretation of the statute as a whole, <em>see King, </em>502 U.S. at 221, 112 S.Ct. 570 (\u201c[A] statute is to be read as a whole, since the meaning of statutory language, plain or not, depends on context.\u201d (citation omitted)) \u2014 not to mention being in full accordance with the Supreme Court\u2019s characterization of the Act as having a \u201cnonjurisdictional cast,\u201d <em>Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 59, 129 S.Ct. 1262; <em>see also Moses H. Cone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., </em>460 U.S. 1, 25 n.32, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-9\">It is worth pausing briefly to consider the purposes for which Congress passed the Act. The Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that the Act, particularly \u00a7 2, \u201cis a congressional declaration of a liberal federal policy favoring arbitration agreements\u201d whose effect \u201cis to create a body of federal substantive law of arbitrability, applicable to any arbitration agreement within the coverage of the Act.\u201d <em>Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp., </em>460 U.S. at 24, 103 S.Ct. 927. The first two sections of the Act make clear its intent to reach maritime contracts \u201cwhich, if the subject of controversy, would be embraced within admiralty jurisdiction\u201d and contracts \u201cevidencing a transaction involving\u201d interstate or foreign commerce, with limited exceptions. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-2. Congress\u2019s ability to legislate substantive rules in these areas derives from \u201c \u2018the incontestable federal foundations of control <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>over interstate commerce and over admiralty.\u2019\u201d <em>Southland Corp. v. Keating, </em>465 U.S. 1, 11, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984) (quoting <em>Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co., </em>388 U.S. 395, 405, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967)). Of course, if Congress cared only about enforcing arbitration or its results, it could have ended the Act after \u00a7 9. Instead, it also provided remedies of vacatur and modification in \u00a7\u00a7 10 and 11, albeit on exclusive and narrow grounds sounding in basic fairness and due process \u2014 a fact which, the Supreme Court has said, suggests Congress intended to \u201csubstantiat[e] a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration\u2019s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.\u201d <em>Hall St. Assocs., L.L.C. v. Mattel Inc., </em>552 U.S. 576, 588, 128 S.Ct. 1396, 170 L.Ed.2d 254 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">A construction of the Act\u2019s provisions as lacking jurisdictional impact is not only consistent with but also well suited to these congressional purposes. Under this approach, if a federal court would possess federal-question jurisdiction over the dispute when pleaded in a complaint, the federal courts are also able to enforce Congress\u2019s narrow and defined remedies in the same controversy. The Act thus favors arbitration by constraining the role of the federal courts where arbitration agreements exist, without displacing their ability to enforce the remedies Congress created in disputes in which they would otherwise be the determinative forum. <em>See Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 25 n.32, 103 S.Ct. 927 (\u201c[Ajlthough enforcement of the Act is left in large part to the state courts, it nevertheless represents federal policy to be vindicated by the federal courts where otherwise appropriate.\u201d). The authorizing language of the Act with respect to particular remedies maps onto congressional interests well: the remedy of compulsion may be obtained in \u201cany United States district court\u201d possessing subject matter jurisdiction, \u00a7 4, but where the federal courts must engage with an ongoing or concluded arbitration, a geographical nexus is required, <em>see </em>\u00a7\u00a7 7, 9-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Finally, we note that applying a look-through approach to the entire Act also prevents absurd and illogical discrepancies, the final animating principle we identified in <em>Vaden. </em>As detailed above, absurd or bizarre inconsistencies in jurisdiction among the Act\u2019s provisions were a central concern in both our prior decisions. <em>See Greenberg, </em>220 F.3d at 26; <em>Westmoreland, </em>100 F.3d at 268; <em>see also Valenzuela Bock, </em>696 F.Supp. at 963. <em>Vaden\u2019s </em>discussion of the practical consequences confirms that our desire to achieve consistent results was not misplaced, even if the Court disagreed with our interpretation of \u00a7 4. <em>See Vaden, </em>556 U.S. at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. The <em>Vaden </em>Court identified a principal \u201ccurious practical consequence[ ]\u201d: that a face-of-the-petition \u201capproach would not accommodate a \u00a7 4 petitioner who <em>could </em>file a federal-question suit in (or remove such a suit to) federal court, but who has not done so.\u201d 556 U.S. at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. Yet the same kind of absurd result would occur here if we reject a look-through approach for \u00a7 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">We have just recently held that \u00a7 3\u2019s mandatory \u201cshall\u201d language requires a federal court to stay, rather than dismiss, a case if it is referred to arbitration and a stay is requested by a party. <em>See Katz v. Celico P\u2019ship, </em>794 F.3d 341, 347 (2d Cir. 2015). If such a case were stayed, it could provide, as <em>Vaden </em>describes, an independent jurisdictional basis sufficient to permit the federal court to entertain, for example, petitions under \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 9-11. <em>See </em>556 U.S. at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. But absent a look-through approach, no jurisdiction would exist over these petitions if filed as freestanding petitions in the same court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>involving the same parties, and concerning the same underlying controversy. This result is the same \u201c \u2018totally artificial distinction\u2019 \u201d on the basis of pending federal action that <em>Vaden </em>rejected. <em>Id. </em>(quoting 1 MacNeil \u00a7 9.2.3.3, p. 9:21).<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">Likewise, there is a certain absurdity to an interpretation that permits parties to file motions to compel arbitration in any case where the underlying dispute raises a federal question but precludes them from seeking the same federal court\u2019s aid under the Act\u2019s other remedial provisions related to the same dispute. Our sister circuit has posited an argument why there may be a disparity between congressional interests in \u00a7 4 and in \u00a7 10 \u2014 specifically, that \u201c[t]he central federal interest was enforcement of agreements to arbitrate, not review of arbitration decisions\u201d and therefore \u201conce the arbitration agreement is enforced, there exists no compelling need for the federal courts to be involved.\u201d <em>Minor v. Prudential Sec., Inc., </em>94 F.3d 1103, 1107 (7th Cir. 1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">If enforcement were Congress\u2019s only goal, however, it would have had no need to pass \u00a7\u00a7 10 or 11 at all. Merely enacting \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 \u2014 declaring arbitration agreements enforceable and providing for a stay and referral to arbitration of disputes in federal court governed by such an agreement \u2014 would suffice to ensure that federal courts did not sidestep arbitration agreements. <em>See Hall St. Assocs., </em>552 U.S. at 581-82, 128 S.Ct. 1396; <em>Southland, </em>465 U.S. at 13-14, 104 S.Ct. 852. The fact that Congress decided to enact substantive rules governing vacatur and modification makes as clear as one can imagine that Congress intended a substantive \u2014 albeit limited' \u2014 review of certain arbitration awards. <em>See Hall St. </em>Assocs., 552 U.S. at 588, 128 S.Ct. 1396. Considering that Congress <em>did </em>authorize freestanding petitions to compel arbitration, compel witness attendance, and confirm, vacate, or modify awards, neither <em>Minor </em>nor the parties give us any reason why Congress would create a set of remedies yet make some more enforceable than others. <em>See Moses H. Gone, </em>460 U.S. at 25 n.32, 103 S.Ct. 927 (explaining that the Act as a whole \u201crepresents federal policy to be vindicated by the federal courts where otherwise appropriate\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-9\">The bizarre jurisdictional tangle resulting from a look-through approach to \u00a7 4 and a face-of-the-petition approach to the other remedies will produce the exact opposite of the Act\u2019s goals. Intelligent practitioners who wish to preserve access to federal courts for later disputes over arbitrators, subpoenas, or final awards will attempt to \u201clock in\u201d jurisdiction by filing a federal suit first, followed by motions to compel and a stay of proceedings. In other words, it will increase the number of parties \u201cseeking federal adjudication of the very questions [they] want[] to arbitrate rather than litigate\u201d \u2014 again, the same perverse incentive and procedural incongruity identified by the <em>Vaden </em>Court. 556 U.S. at 65, 129 S.Ct. 1262. Construing the Act in a way that encourages the protective filing of federal suits would be the height of absurdity in light of Congress\u2019s desire to cabin federal involvement in disputes subject to arbitration \u2014 before, during, and after the proceeding. <em>See Hall St. Assocs., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>552 U.S. at 588, 128 S.Ct. 1396; <em>Moses H. Cone, </em>460 U.S. at 25 n.32, 103 S.Ct. 927.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Finally, we note that, in a twist of irony, a <em>post-Vaden </em>conclusion that \u00a7 10 requires a federal question on the face of the petition \u25a0 seems oddly to mimic the kind of \u201couster\u201d that concerned the <em>Westmoreland </em>and <em>Greenberg </em>panels and, to a lesser degree, the <em>Vaden </em>Court. In other words, if the substantive dispute between the parties is otherwise cognizable before a federal district court, the limitation to the face of the petition seems to restrict the federal courts not on the basis of principles like res judicata or enforceability of arbitration agreements \u2014 which are rules of decision\u2014 but on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction. Thus, federal courts have been \u201cousted\u201d of jurisdiction over a substantive dispute between the parties that they would otherwise be empowered under \u00a7 1331 to hear, merely because of the presence of an arbitration agreement. By contrast, if we conclude that federal-question jurisdiction arises from the underlying dispute, the arbitration agreement limits the remedies a federal court may employ but does not affect the court\u2019s jurisdiction. This result seems to us the more internally consistent approach, given the current state of Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Returning to where we began, we have confronted the difficult task of reconciling the guiding principles that the Supreme Court has handed down \u2014 principles which are admittedly in some tension. To read Vaden\u2019s text-driven analysis as a jurisdictional inquiry would, on the surface, lead us to reject the look-through approach. But that result would require us, as a matter of internal consistency, to conclude that \u00a7 4 did exactly what the Supreme Court says it does not do: enlarge a federal court\u2019s jurisdiction. Further, it would produce anomalous discrepancies in the administration of the Act that both we and the Supreme Court have consistently rejected as impermissible results. We think the only way to reconcile this tension is to adopt the following principles:</p>\n<p id=\"b414-7\"><em>First, </em>the existence of f\u00e9deral-question jurisdiction over an FAA petition turns on whether the district court would possess jurisdiction over the underlying dispute under the standards of \u00a7 1331;</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\"><em>Second, </em>the \u201csave for\u201d clause in \u00a74 evinces congressional authorization for the remedy of compulsion of arbitration in any district court with jurisdiction; and</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\"><em>Third, </em>the Act\u2019s other 'sections similarly authorize particular courts with jurisdiction to issue particular remedies but do not affect the jurisdictional inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-10\">Having conducted this analysis, we must now conclude that <em>Vaden, </em>as an intervening Supreme Court decision, has rendered <em>Greenberg\u2019s </em>result fundamentally inconsistent with the Act\u2019s statutory context and judicial interpretations. We are therefore obliged to overrule it and adopt the rule that a federal district court faced with a \u00a7 10 petition may \u201clook through\u201d the petition to the underlying dispute, applying to it the ordinary rules of federal-question jurisdiction and the principles laid out by the majority in <em>Vaden. </em>Because the District Court concluded below that a look-through approach was foreclosed by <em>Greenberg, </em>it did not conduct an analysis of the underlying dispute. We think the proper disposition is therefore to vacate the order and the judgment and remand for consideration of that question in the first instance. <em>See Schonfeld v. Hilliard, </em>218 F.3d 164, 184 (2d Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b414-12\">In summary, we reject Doscher\u2019s argument that his \u00a7 10 petition alleges, on its face, a manifest disregard of federal law, because the petition does not necessarily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>present a substantial question of any violation of a federal duty or obligation. Thus, squarely faced with the question of <em>Green-berg\u2019s </em>continuing validity, we conclude that <em>Vaden </em>not only cast doubt on our precedent but rendered its holding fundamentally inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s analysis of jurisdictional inquiries under the Act. Accordingly, we overrule <em>Green-berg </em>and conclude that federal courts may \u201clook through\u201d \u00a7 10 petitions, applying the ordinary principles of federal-question jurisdiction to the underlying dispute as defined by <em>Vaden. </em>The order and the judgment of the District Court are VACATED, and the case is REMANDED for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b400-6\">.

Section 19 of the Exchange Act, for example, requires compliance by an SRO with \u201cthe provisions of this chapter, the rules and regulations thereunder, <em>and its own rules,\" </em>\u00a778s(g)(l) (emphasis added). The Act thus clearly distinguishes between \"rules and regulations thereunder\u201d and internal SRO rules, and \"[glenerally, identical words used in different parts of the same statute are presumed to have the same meaning,\u201d <em>Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. v.

This interpretation not only produces absurd results but would turn the requirement of compliance with an SRO\u2019s \"own rules\u201d in \u00a7 78s(g)(1) into surplusage, thus running contrary to two canons of construction at once. <em>See Duncan v.

Although it is unnecessary to decide conclusively, we nonetheless note that <em>Manning's </em>second category is identical to the basis asserted for jurisdiction in <em>NASDAQ. See NASDAQ, </em>770 F.3d at 1020. Thus, at least on a facial read of the two cases, we think there is no reason to suspect that <em>Manning </em>called <em>NASDAQ </em>into question, and we are comfortable relying on NASDAQ's reasoning here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b404-6\">. We have not been particularly clear whether this latter situation is merely an application of the rule, recognizing that the Supreme Court may \u201cimplicitly\u201d overrule the \u201crationale\u201d of one of our precedents, e.g., <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>268 F.3d 151, 154 (2d Cir. 2001) (Sotomayor, J.)

In addition, this opinion was circulated to all judges of this Court prior to filing, and we received no objection. <em>See In re Zarnel, </em>619 F.3d 156, 168 n.5 (2d Cir. 2010); <em>United States v.

In fact, two non-precedential decisions of our Court have suggested \u2014 if not directly stated \u2014 that <em>Vaden </em>may now permit a look-through approach in the \u00a7 10 context. <em>See Giusti v. Morgan Stanley Smith Barney, LLC, </em>581 Fed.Appx. 34, 35 (2d Cir. 2014) (summary order); <em>Bittner v. RBC Capital Mkts., </em>331 Fed.Appx. 869, 871 (2d Cir. 2009) (summary order). No other Circuit has discussed <em>Va-</em>den's applicability outside of the \u00a7 4 context, though we note that a recent decision of the Third Circuit applied the look-through approach, without analysis, to a '\u00a7 10 petition in which the underlying claims were, as here, based on securities fraud under section 10(b). <em>See Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. v.

It is primarily for this reason that several district courts have declined to apply <em>Vaden </em>to the Act\u2019s provisions other than \u00a7 4. <em>See Doscher, </em>2015 WL 4643159, at *4; <em>Trs. of Local Union No. 580 v.

The five-Justice majority concluded that the substantive dispute was the recovery of past-due charges by a card-issuing bank, and the cardholders\u2019 counterclaims alleging that the charges were preempted by the Federal Deposit Insurance Act could not, under the well-pleaded complaint rule, constitute the required federal question. <em>Id. </em>at 66-67, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (citing <em>Holmes Grp., Inc. </em>v. <em>Vornado Air Circulation Sys., Inc., </em>535 U.S. 826, 122 S.Ct. 1889, 153 L.Ed.2d 13 (2002)). By contrast, the four-Justice minority concluded that the dispute asserted in the \u00a7 4 petition exclusively related to the legality under federal law of the bank\u2019s charging of fees, and the filing of a state complaint on a related issue did not affect jurisdiction over this discrete dispute. <em>Id. </em>at 75-77, 129 S.Ct. 1262 (Roberts, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b409-6\">. Although <em>Greenberg </em>staled that \"[j]urisdiction would plainly lie if, among other things, ... the claim arose in admiralty,\u201d 220 F.3d at 25, this conclusion is less plain in the \u00a7 10 context than \u00a7 4. If jurisdiction must lie on the face of the petition, the nature of the underlying claim \u2014 whether arising under admiralty or federal law \u2014 would seem to be irrelevant. But if the nature of the underlying claim is relevant in admiralty, there is no reason \u2014 logical or textual \u2014 to distinguish between those claims and federal-question claims. The answer with respect to \u00a7 4 may lie in the fact that the enforcement of any maritime contract provision may be brought in' federal court, <em>see </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1333, and thus, a petition to compel arbitration pursuant to a contractual provision is essentially identical to such an enforcement action. But with respect to \u00a7 10 cases, the federal court is not enforcing the contract but applying a federal remedy, and it is hard to see why the nature of the underlying dispute, absent a look-through approach, changes between admiralty and a federal question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b409-11\">. A possible counterargument would say that \u00a7 4 does not actually enlarge federal-question jurisdiction under \u00a7 1331, it merely applies those rules to one dispute, instead of another.

While the standards for <em>pleading </em>jurisdiction may remain the same, construing \u00a7 4 \u2014 but not \u00a7 10 \u2014 to reach the substantive \"dispute\u201d for purposes of ascertaining \u00a7 1331 jurisdiction is functionally identical to extending \u00a7 1331\u2019s reach over the class of disputes over which it has cogni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>zance.
