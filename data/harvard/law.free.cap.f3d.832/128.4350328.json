Many of the women worked in deplorable conditions and were abused and forced to participate against their will. These women were required to have sex with up to 20 to 30 customers per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>day and received as little as $15 per customer.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">Jiamez-Dolores and Degante-Galeno pleaded guilty to conspiring to use facilities in interstate commerce for the promotion, management, and facilitation of a prostitution trafficking enterprise, all in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371. They were each sentenced, <em>inter alia, </em>to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory maximum term. On appeal, both defendants challenge the procedural and substantive reasonableness of their sentences and, based on the fact that there is only an incomplete transcript of his plea proceedings, De-gante-Galeno challenges the validity of his guilty plea entered pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11. For the following reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment in all respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">Degante-Galeno\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">Degante-Galeno contends that his guilty plea must be vacated. Both the government and the defendant agree that a considerable portion of the transcript of-the Rule 11 proceedings is unavailable despite their diligent efforts to locate it. The partial transcript that was submitted to this Court begins with the district court\u2019s inquiry with respect to Degante-Galeno\u2019s understanding of the plea agreement and the factual basis for the charges, which follows the part of the Rule 11 proceeding that would normally entail detailed questioning concerning Degante-Galeno\u2019s competency and his knowing waiver of various trial-related constitutional rights. Degante-Galeno contends that, because the available transcript does not cover the full proceedings, the record is \u201csilent,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 12, as to whether the district court complied with several of the Rule 11 requirements, including confirming with the aid of a Spanish interpreter that he understood the proceedings and the nature of the charges and that he knowingly and voluntarily waived certain constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">Rule 11 is \u201cdesigned to assist the district judge in making the constitutionally required determination that a defendant\u2019s guilty plea is truly voluntary.\u201d <em>United States v. Maher, </em>108 F.3d 1513, 1520 (2d Cir. 1997). This Court has \u201cadopted a standard of strict adherence to Rule 11.\u201d <em>United States v. Pattee, </em>820 F.3d 496, 503 (2d Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). Absent a contemporaneous objection, however, \u201cdeviations from Rule 11 will not warrant appellate relief when the defendant\u2019s \u2018substantial rights\u2019 have not been affected.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In order to establish that a Rule 11 violation affected his or her \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d the defendant must show \u201cthat there is \u2018a reasonable probability that, but for the error, he would not have entered the plea.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Vaval, </em>404 F.3d 144, 151 (2d Cir. 2005) (quoting <em>United States v. Dominguez Benitez, </em>542 U.S. 74, 83, 124 S.Ct. 2333, 159 L.Ed.2d 157 (2004)).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">Despite having multiple opportunities to-frame an objection, including in this appeal, Degante-Galeno has not asserted that the district court committed any specific errors during the plea colloquy, much less that any error would have \u201chad an effect on his decision to plead guilty.\u201d <em>United States v. Harrington, </em>354 F.3d 178, 184 (2d Cir. 2004) (internal quotation marks omitted). He contends that he is entitled to have his guilty plea vacated based solely on the fact that the transcript is incomplete, and he asserts that he has been prejudiced because the absence of a complete transcript makes it impossible for this Court to determine whether he knowingly and voluntarily pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-11\">Degante-Galeno\u2019s argument fails for two reasons. First, inexplicably, he has taken no steps, available to him under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, to accommodate the fact that the complete transcript is unavailable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Had he done so when the problems with the transcript first came to light, it is highly likely the parties and the district court would have been able to fill in the material gaps in the record of what transpired at the Rule 11 proceedings. Second, \u201c[bjefore we will grant relief based on gaps in the record,\u201d we require the appellant \u201cto show specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Weisser, </em>417 F.3d 336, 342-43 (2d Cir. 2005). Under the circumstances presented here, Degante-Galeno\u2019s general claim of prejudice, much of which is of his own making by failing to use the processes available to him under Rule 10(c), is insufficient. Although he is correct that prejudice <em>may </em>\u201cexist[ ] if the record is so deficient that it is impossible for the appellate court to determine if the district court has committed reversible error,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 343 (internal quotation omitted), we are not hampered by such insufficiencies. Rather, the portion of the transcript that <em>is </em>available shows that the district court was able to make specific findings as to the voluntariness of Degante-Galeno\u2019s plea:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b158-4\">Since you acknowledge that you are in fact guilty of the charge against you in the superseding information, ... and since I am satisfied that you know of your rights, including your right to go to trial, that you are aware of the consequences that could flow from entering a guilty plea, and the sentence that may be imposed, and since I find that you are pleading guilty voluntarily, I accept your plea.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">J. App\u2019x 50.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">Degante-Galeno, moreover, does not challenge the validity of these findings. Absent any specific allegation of deficiency in the proceedings, or proposed reconstruction of the record of those proceedings indicating a deficiency, and given the district court\u2019s unchallenged factual findings, .we are satisfied that the record (albeit incomplete) is adequate to show that Degante-Galeno\u2019s guilty plea was knowing and voluntary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b158-9\">Next, Degante-Galeno argues that his sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 above the Guidelines range of 33 to 41 months \u2014 was procedurally and substantively unreasonable.. \u201cA sentencing judge has very wide latitude to decide the proper degree of punishment for an individual offender and a particular crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Cavern, </em>550 F.3d 180, 188 (2d Cir. 2008) (en banc). We will \u201cset aside a district court\u2019s substantive determination only in exceptional cases where the trial court\u2019s decision \u2018cannot be located within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>range, of permissible decisions.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 189 (emphasis omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Rigas, </em>490 F.3d 208, 238 (2d Cir. 2007)). \u201cThis degree of deference is only warranted, however, once we are satisfied that the district court complied with the Sentencing Reform Act\u2019s procedural requirements.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis omitted). In this regard, a district court \u201cerrs procedurally if it does not consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors, or rests its sentence on a clearly erroneous finding of fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 190.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Degante-Galeno contends that the district court, in relying on his role as both a driver of women to customers\u2019 homes and a dispatcher, made a factual assumption that was \u201cunsupported by the record evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Dorvee, </em>616 F.3d 174, 183 (2d Cir. 2010). Unlike the situation in <em>Dorvee, </em>however, the record in this case supported the district court\u2019s finding that he was a driver in addition to being a dispatcher. Although during his plea colloquy Degante-Galeno initially denied serving as a driver, he did not challenge the Probation Officer\u2019s finding, contained in the Presentence Report (\u201cPSR\u201d), that he \u201cworked as a driver and was responsible for delivering women working or being forced to work as prostitutes to customers\u2019 residences.\u201d PSR 10. At sentencing, the district court adopted this factual finding, and Degante-Galeno did not object.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It was not error, much less plain error, for the district court to base its sentence in part on an unchallenged factual finding adopted from the PSR. For similar reasons, we reject Degante-Galeno\u2019s argument that the district court \u201cimproperly attributed [to him] a more significant role than he held,\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">We conclude that Degante-Galeno\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. In addition to considering his role in the offense, the district court based the sentence on his complicity in the coercion applied to the victims \u2014 some of whom were forced into prostitution \u2014 the duration of his participation in the conspiracy, and his failure to acknowledge fully the seriousness of the offense. Although the court\u2019s upward variance was substantial, given the court\u2019s thoughtful consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the sentence was not'unreasonable or an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Park, </em>758 F.3d 193, 199 (2d Cir. 2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">Jiamez-Dolores\u2019s Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b159-10\">On appeal, Jiamez-Dolores challenges the procedural and substantive reasonableness of his sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment. He argues that the district court did not make sufficient efforts to individualize his sentence based on the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and that the sentence was excessively harsh.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>Jiamez-Dolores\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable. \u201c[W]e presume that a sentencing judge has faithfully discharged her duty to consider the statutory factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, 129 (2d Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). Based on its assessment of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court varied upward from a Guidelines range of 41 to 51 months and sentenced Jiamez-Dolores to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment \u2014 a term which was identical to those imposed on the majority of co-defendants. Although Jiamez-Dolores infers from this comparison that the district court failed to consider his individual circumstances in imposing sentence, the court stressed at the sentencing hearing that it had considered \u201cthe particular circumstances relating to each and every defendant,\u201d Def s App\u2019x. 47, including the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Additionally, the district court recognized that some other defendants with more culpable roles had received the same sentence, and stated that the uniformity of the sentences was driven by the fact that the government had accepted guilty pleas from the defendants to single counts for which the statutory maximum was 60 months, explicitly noting that it would have given certain defendants higher sentences absent that limit. In support of its conclusion that a sentence of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment was \u201csufficient but not greater than necessary,\u201d Def s App\u2019x 60, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AO\">This is an individualized sentence for this defendant. It\u2019s an upward variance because of the duration of his conduct, the multiple roles that he played in this particular conspiracy with respect to being a supervisor both of personnel of the women who were in the Yonkers brothel, as well as being involved in the financial and distributive aspects of the prostitution enterprise. The conditions of ... this brothel and of the brothels involved in the conspiracy were particularly disgusting. The conditions were particularly shameful. Those aspects and what I\u2019ve just said is not adequately reflected in the guidelines in the Court\u2019s view.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">The Court also finds the number of victims is not adequately reflected in the guidelines, as well as the- number of times each victim was required to perform services or did perform services over the course of a 24-hour period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">Defs App\u2019x 60. The record reflects the district court\u2019s thorough, individualized consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and its justifications for imposing an upward variance in Jiamez-Dolores\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">In addition, the sentence was substantively reasonable. The district court heard arguments at sentencing that Jiamez-Dolores was a 23-year-old first time offender who became involved in the prostitution conspiracy in order to escape a life of poverty in Mexico. While acknowledging the crime was heinous, defense counsel stressed that there was no evidence that Jiamez-Dolores personally coerced or brutalized women. The court also indicated that it had considered the Probation Office\u2019s recommended sentence of 41 months, at the bottom of the Guidelines range, but it noted that the probation officer did not have certain information that was provided in the government\u2019s sentencing submission. Ultimately, the district court determined that an upward variance was appropriate. Jiamez-Dolores\u2019s role as supervisor, in particular, yielded a higher <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>Guidelines range than most of his co-defendants, and it was reasonable for the district court to consider his level of culpability in the conspiracy. Based on the factors the district court relied upon, we cannot say that the sentence \u201cwas shockingly high, ... or otherwise unsupportable as a matter of law.\u201d <em>United States v. Rigas, 583 </em>F.3d 108, 123 (2d Cir. 2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b161-5\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">We have considered all of the defendants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For these reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b156-7\">. The Superseding Indictment charged Defendants-Appellants, along with fifteen other conspirators, with offenses related to their participation in the sex-trafficking enterprises. Previously, a panel of this Court affirmed . the convictions and sentences of six conspirators, Alejandro Degante-Galeno, Alberto Jesus Martinez-Miranda, Manuel Gomez-B ata\u00f1a, Isidro Degante-Galeno, Marcos Mendez-Perez, and Francisco' Javier Mendez-Ramirez. <em>See United States v. Degante-Galeno, </em>609 Fed.Appx. 21 (2d Cir. 2015) (summary order); <em>United States v. Mendez-Perez, </em>607 Fed.Appx. 39 (2d Cir. 2015). In addition, Isa\u00edas Flores-Mendez and Bonifacio Flores-Mendez pleaded guilty and received sentences of life imprisonment. Their appeals were dismissed as barred by their appellate waiver agreements. <em>(See </em>Order, ECF No. 205.) Only Valentin Jia-mez-Dolores\u2019s and Pedro Degante-Galeno\u2019s claims are before us on this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b158-5\">. Fed. R. App. P. 10(c) provides: \u201cIf the transcript of a hearing or trial is unavailable, the appellant may prepare a statement of the evidence or proceedings from the best available means, including the appellant\u2019s recollection. The statement must be served on the appellee, who may serve, objections or proposed amendments within 14 days after being served. The statement and any objections or proposed amendments must then be submitted to the district court for settlement and approval. As settled and approved, the statement must be included by the district clerk in ' the record on appeal.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b158-10\">. We further note that during the Rule 11 proceedings for the co-defendants in this case, for which complete transcripts are available, the district court methodically and thoroughly informed each defendant of his constitutional rights and determined that his guilty plea was knowing and voluntary. <em>{See, e.g., </em>Transcripts, ECF Nos. 138, 145, 150, 162, 164, 176, 178, 182, 192, 213, 215, 217, 219, 235.) In the case before us, the portion of the transcript that is available tracks the language of the co-defendants' guilty plea colloquies, which provides us a further indication that the court followed its usual procedures by systematically addressing the Rule 11 requirements.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b159-6\">. In his reply brief, Degante-Galeno further argues that the district court's finding that \"[s]ometimes the women had to arrive in a very short window of time or the customers didn\u2019t want them, so the women were really very used in this what I call the mobile brothels,\u201d J. App'x 150-51, was factually unsupported and thus unreasonable. That finding, however, is consistent with the PSR, which states that Degante-Galeno had a conversation with his brother \"in which they discussed the fact that a customer wanted delivery of a woman working or being forced to work as a prostitute, but that the delivery had to be made within the next 10 to 15 minutes.\u201d PSR 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b159-12\">. At oral argument, Jiamez-Dolores argued that he was unfairly prejudiced by the change in the government's position between its sentencing memorandum, which recommended a within-Guidelines sentence, and at sentencing, during which the government recommended \"a substantial sentence, and not simply just a sentence within the applicable guidelines range.\u201d Def's App'x 40. The government's recommended sentence was not binding on the district court, and the government did not promise at any time that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>would recommend a within-Guidelines sentence: <em>Cf. United States v. Habbas, </em>527 F.3d 266, 271 (2d Cir. 2008). In any event, Jiamez-Dolores was not harmed by the government\u2019s change in position because the district court provided advanced notice that it was considering imposing an upward variance.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
