(\u201cSHW\u201d), which from 2003 to 2009 served as attorneys for plaintiffs Kharey Wise (aka Korey Wise) and other members of his family (collectively \u201cWise\u201d) in a wrongful imprisonment action following his exoneration in a case that had come to be known as the \u201cCentral Park Jogger\u201d case, appeals from orders of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Ronald L. Ellis, Magistrate Judge, granting SHW $231,212.50 in attorneys\u2019 fees plus $6,785 in expenses and denying motions to, inter alia, increase those amounts and to award interest. Appellee Fisher, Byrialsen &amp; Kreizer, PLLC, current attorneys for Wise, has moved to dismiss the appeal, contending that because SHW did not consent pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) for all proceedings to be conducted before a magistrate judge, Judge Ellis\u2019s orders must be treated as recommendations to be reviewed by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>district court, and that appeal directly to this Court from those orders is unauthorized. Because \u00a7 636(c)\u2019s consent requirement applies to parties (and to persons who move to become parties, see New York Chinese TV Programs, Inc. v. U.E. Enterprises, Inc., 996 F.2d 21, 25 (2d Cir. 1993) (\u201cChinese TV\u201d)), and the parties here gave the requisite consent, we conclude that the consent of SHW as counsel or former counsel was not required, and we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">Kharey Wise was one of five persons convicted of the 1989 assault and rape of a jogger in New York City\u2019s Central Park. After spending years in prison, he and the other four were exonerated after DNA testing confirmed that the crime had been committed by someone else. In 2003, Wise, represented by SHW, commenced an action pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1983 and 1985 against the City of New York (the \u201cCity\u201d) and numerous other defendants, alleging civil rights violations in connection with Kharey Wise\u2019s wrongful conviction and imprisonment. In 2007, the Wise action was consolidated with the similar actions brought by the other four exonerated individuals and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">In 2009, Wise replaced SHW with a firm that was a predecessor to Fisher, Byrial-sen &amp; Kreizer, PLLC (collectively \u201cFBK\u201d). SHW notified FBK of its intention to seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs in the event that Wise obtained a favorable, judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">In September 2014, after pretrial proceedings in which claims of some plaintiff family members had been dismissed for failure to prosecute, all of the remaining parties to the consolidated action consented in writing pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c) \u201cto have a United States magistrate judge conduct all [further] proceedings in th[e] case including trial, the entry of final judgment, and all post-trial proceedings\u201d (Parties\u2019 Consent To Proceed Before United States Magistrate Judge (\u201cConsent\u201d) at 2.) The Consent, \u201cSo-Ordered\u201d by the district judge, stated that \u201cAny appeal from a judgment entered in this case will lie to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as from any other judgment of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(c).\u201d (Consent at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">The parties immediately settled the litigation, entering into a Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Dismissal that, inter alia, disposed of all remaining claims, stated that the City would pay certain specified sums, and stated that the consolidated \u201caction is hereby dismissed.\u201d On September 5, 2014, the Stipulation and Order of Settlement and Dismissal was \u201cSo-Ordered\u201d and entered by the magistrate judge (the \u201cSo-Ordered Settlement\u201d), and the case was marked \u201cTerminated\u201d as of that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">The So-Ordered Settlement provided that Kharey Wise, \u201cin full satisfaction of all his claims against\u201d the defendants, \u201cincluding ... attorneys\u2019 fees,\u201d would receive $12,250,000, and that he assigned his rights to attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses, and costs to FBK. SHW promptly filed a petition with the magistrate judge seeking the reasonable value of the services it had provided to Wise in the litigation. An escrow fund for fees was created.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-11\">The magistrate judge decided SHW\u2019s motion and denied a motion by SHW.for reconsideration (the \u201cSHW Orders\u201d); the \u25a0 details of those orders are not material to this motion to dismiss. SHW has appealed both orders to this Court. FBK has moved to dismiss the appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction on the ground that the magistrate judge\u2019s SHW Orders are not final decisions within the meaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 because SHW did not consent to have all proceedings conducted before a magistrate judge. FBK argues that in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>absence of such consent, a magistrate judge\u2019s orders are merely recommendations to be ruled on by a district judge. For the reasons that follow, we reject FBK\u2019s premise that SHW\u2019s consent was required, and we deny the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">Section 636(c) provides, in part, that when \u201cspecially designated to exercise [civil] jurisdiction by the district court ... he [or she] serves,\u201d a \u201cUnited States magistrate judge ... may\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">(1) Upon the consent of the parties, ... conduct any or all proceedings in a jury or nonjury civil matter and order the entry of judgment in the case....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1) (emphasis added); see also id. \u00a7 636(c)(3) (\u201cThe consent of the parties allows a magistrate judge designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of this subsection to direct the entry of a judgment of the district court in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-8\">\u201cIf a magistrate judge is designated to exercise civil jurisdiction under paragraph (1) of [\u00a7 636(c)],\u201d and is available, the parties are to be so advised by the clerk of court when the action is filed, and they may be so advised again thereafter by the district court judge or the magistrate judge, but they must also be</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-9\">advise[d] ... that they are free to withhold consent without adverse substantive consequences. Rules of court for the reference of civil matters to magistrate judges shall include procedures to protect the voluntariness of the parties\u2019 consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-10\">Id. \u00a7 636(c)(2). Such consent may be express or implied, see, Roell v. Withrow, 538 U.S. 580, 585, 588, 123 S.Ct. 1696, 155 L.Ed.2d 775 (2003); but unless there is such consent by all of the parties, \u201cthe Magistrate Judge lack[s] authority to enter judgment,\u201d Yeldon v. Fisher, 710 F.3d 452, 453-54 (2d Cir. 2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">We have held that the prerequisite that all of the \u201cparties\u201d in the action give their consent in order for a magistrate judge to exercise civil jurisdiction is applicable to proposed intervenors, he., persons or entities who move to become parties. See Chinese TV, 996 F.2d at 25 (\u201cWithout the consent of the \u2018intervenors\u2019, the magistrate judge\u2019s order [denying intervention] has the effect only of a report and recommendation to the district judge, who upon the filing of objections must review de novo the recommendation.\u201d). This is appropriate for one who timely moves to become a party by intervention as of right to protect an interest in an action that may be impaired by the outcome of the case and is not adequately protected by the current parties, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(a), or by permissive intervention to pursue \u201ca claim or defense that shares with the main action a common question of law or fact,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 24(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">But claims for attorneys\u2019 fees stand on a different footing. A request for reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988 by the plaintiff prevailing on a \u00a7 1983 claim \u201craises legal issues collateral to the main cause of action\u201d and requires \u201can inquiry separate from the decision on the merits.\u201d White v. New Hampshire Department of Employment Security, 455 U.S. 445, 451-52, 102 S.Ct. 1162, 71 L.Ed.2d 325 (1982). And under New York law, which affords \u201cthe attorney who appears for a party\u201d in an action in any court \u201ca lien upon his client\u2019s cause of action ... and the proceeds thereof,\u201d N.Y. Judiciary Law \u00a7 475 (McKinney 2005), the attorney merely has \u201ca security interest in the favorable result of [that] litigation,\u201d Chadbourne &amp; Parke, LLP v. AB Recur Finans, 18 A.D.3d 222, 223, 794 N.Y.S.2d 349, 350 (1st Dep\u2019t 2005), which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>is distinct from the rights at issue in the client\u2019s action. In general, claims for attorneys\u2019 fees are</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-4\">not part of the merits of the action to which the fees pertain. Such an award does not remedy the injury giving rise to the action....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co., 486 U.S. 196, 200, 108 S.Ct. 1717, 100 L.Ed.2d 178 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b180-9\">Further, while the court is to determine the appropriate amount of attorneys\u2019 fees in a civil rights action, see, e.g., Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 429, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983), the fee is awarded to the party, see Evans v. Jeff D., 475 U.S. 717, 730, 106 S.Ct. 1531, 89 L.Ed.2d 747 (1986). Here, in the So-Ordered Settlement, Kharey Wise was to receive $12,250,000 in satisfaction of his claims including attorneys\u2019 fees; and he \u201cassigned\u201d to FBK \u201chis rights\u201d to attorneys\u2019 fees, which would come out of that $12,250,000. The parties had just consented to have the magistrate judge conduct \u201call [further] proceedings.\u201d Thus, any dispute as to the amount of fees that should be paid to attorneys who provided services to Wise in this litigation was to be decided by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-10\">Nothing in \u00a7 636(c) or in Chinese TV\u2014 or in any other case of which we are aware \u2014 suggests that consent of attorneys in their own right is required for the magistrate judge to exercise the civil jurisdiction allowed by \u00a7 636(c)(1). Indeed, there is no indication in the Consent here, signed by the attorneys for their respective clients, that consent of the attorneys in their own right \u2014 including FBK' \u2014 was required, requested, or given; and, consistent with the lack of any such requirement, we note that although the magistrate judge ordered disbursement of the remaining es-crowed attorneys\u2019 fees to FBK, there is no indication in the record that FBK sought district court approval of that order as if it were a mere recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-13\">As the parties permissibly consented to have the magistrate judge enter judgment and to have \u201c[a]ny appeal from a judgment entered in this case\u201d be taken \u201cto the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit as from any other judgment of the district court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(3) and Fed. R. Civ. P. 73(c)\u201d (Consent at 1), FBK\u2019s motion to dismiss this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction is denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
