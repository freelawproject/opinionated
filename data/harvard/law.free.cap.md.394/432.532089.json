We granted certiorari in this case to answer the following questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">1. Did the juvenile court err in entering an immediate order dismissing the CINA petitions without affording Petitioner an advance opportunity to file exceptions to the master\u2019s findings and recommendations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-8\">2. Did the juvenile court deprive Petitioner of her right to due process of law by dismissing the CINA petitions without affording her an advance opportunity to file exceptions to the master\u2019s finding and recommendations?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">3. Did the Court of Special Appeals err in applying its decision to Petitioner, who could not have known of the basis for that court\u2019s decision prior to appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\"><em>In re: Kaela C, </em>388 Md. 673, 882 A.2d 286 (2005). After the filing of briefs and oral argument, we issued an order requesting supplemental briefs and scheduling further proceedings on an additional issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-11\">What is the effect, if any, on the pending appeal before this Court of the judicial proceedings that have been instituted in the State of California?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">We shall hold that the issues presented in Mrs. C.\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari are not moot because Mrs. C. continues to suffer collateral consequences from the circuit court\u2019s order transferring custody of the children to Mr. C. and that the circuit court erred in adopting the master\u2019s recommendations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>prior to the expiration of the five days for filing of exceptions provided by Maryland Rule 11-111(c).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Petitioner, Leslie C. (Mrs. C.), and Christopher C. (Mr. C.) are the biological parents of Kaela C., Gunner C., and Franklin C. Mr. and Mrs. C. were divorced in August, 2001, and Mrs. C. was awarded legal and physical custody of the children. On December 2, 2003, in response to allegations of abuse, the Frederick County Department of Social Services (\u201cDSS\u201d) removed all three children from Mrs. C.\u2019s care, placed them in emergency shelter care<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> pursuant to its authority under Section 3-815(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and subsequently filed a petition with the Circuit Court for Frederick County seeking continued shelter care pursuant to Section 3-815(c) of the Courts and Judicial Pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>ceedings Article,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and a determination that the children were children in need of assistance (CINA).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Maryland Code (1973, 2002 Repl. Vol.), \u00a7 3-815(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Both parents appeared before the circuit court, sitting as a juvenile court, for the shelter care hearing on December 8, 2003, and, while not admitting the allegations contained in the petition, agreed to the need for continued shelter care. Pursuant to Section 3-807(d)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> the master recommended that the children be placed in licensed foster care pending an adjudicatory hearing,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> that Mr. C. be granted extended, unsupervised <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>visitation, that Mrs. C. be granted supervised visitation, and that an updated family psychological evaluation be performed, and the trial judge immediately adopted those recommendations in the form of an order.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">The master held an adjudicatory hearing on March 3, 2004, at which Mrs. C., Mr. C., and the DSS all appeared with counsel, in addition to counsel for the children. Because the court-ordered family assessment had not been completed, the DSS requested that the disposition hearing<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> be postponed. Before addressing DSS\u2019s request, the master asked whether the parties had reached an agreement as to the facts alleged in the CINA petition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-6\">COUNSEL FOR MRS. C.: Ah, we\u2019re not gonna contest the petition, Your Honor. We have some additional facts and information we want to proffer for the court by way of explanation. But we\u2019re not admitting or denying the allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-7\">THE MASTER: Okay. And [Counsel for Mr. C.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8G\">COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: Your Honor, we are going to argue Courts and Judicial Proceedings 3 \u2014 819(d),\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-8\">THE MASTER: Russell G.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkW\">COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: Yeah. Exactly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-9\">THE MASTER: And what about the allegations contained in the petition? What\u2019s mom\u2019s\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b468-10\">\u2014I mean dad\u2019s position on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: There is only one paragraph that applies to my client. It\u2019s on, by, it\u2019s on page five and it\u2019s letter 0 and it basically says that my client cannot provide appropriate care for the three children due to his military obligations and frequent long absences and we don\u2019t agree with that. We think that my client is able and willing to provide care for the children.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-4\">THE MASTER: Okay. [Counsel for the Children]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4a\">COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN: Thank you, Your Honor. That came as a surprise to me. If that\u2019s the case, Your Honor, I, I think dad should be available for cross examination if he, he\u2019s going to\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Acknowledging that there was confusion among the parties, the master called a recess and asked the parties into her office to clarify the position of each regarding the CINA allegations and thereafter, on the record, summarized the state of the proceedings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-6\">THE MASTER: I believe in this matter, and counsel let me know if there\u2019s any disagreement, mother and father are proceeding by an Alford type plea where they neither admit nor deny the allegations contained in the petition. However, they agree that those allegations, those same allegations would be the allegations presented by the [DSS] at a full adjudicatory hearing and that the court would find those allegations to be true or sustained by a preponderance of the evidence and that they would support a finding that the children are children in need of ... well, actually, we\u2019re not gonna go that far to the CINA, to the CINA part. Basically that the allegations would be true and thereafter that, that disposition would be continued for a time that will be further argued in open court. Is that your understanding, [Counsel for DSS]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-7\">COUNSEL FOR DSS: Yes, Your Honor. That\u2019s what the [DSS] understood.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">THE MASTER: And is that your understanding, [Counsel for Mrs. CJ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>COUNSEL FOR MRS. C.: Yes, Your Honor, and I just have a few facts I want to, some information I want to give the court.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\">THE MASTER: Okay. And is that your understanding, [Counsel for MR. C.]?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-6\">COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: Yes, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\">THE MASTER: And is that your understanding, [Counsel for the Children]? And actually, the children have agreed to stipulate to the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN: That\u2019s corrects THE MASTER: \u2014 allegations.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\">COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN: That\u2019s correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-10\">THE MASTER: Okay. In, in this matter I will, in the, in the matter of the C. children I\u2019ll note for the record that the social worker, mother and father are present, as are [DSS]\u2019s attorney, mom\u2019s attorney, dad\u2019s attorney, and the children\u2019s attorney. I will note that the [DSS] and the children stipulated to the allegations contained in the petition and agreed that they were sufficient to determine that the children are children in need of assistance. I also will note that mother and father neither admitted nor denied the allegations contained in the petition. However, they did agree that those same allegations would be the allegations presented by the [DSS] at a full adjudicatory hearing and, and that those allegations would be proven by a preponderance of the evidence and support a finding that the children are children in need of assistance. Thereafter, based on that I will find that the allegations contained in the petition are true and sustained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">The circuit court subsequently adopted the master\u2019s recommendations and issued an Order, within two days, finding that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AsX\">the child and the [DSS] stipulated to the allegations contained in the [DSS]\u2019s Petition, and mother and father neither admitted nor denied the allegations contained in the Petition; however, they agreed that had there been a full adjudicatory hearing in this matter, those same allegations <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>would have been the allegations presented by the [DSS], and those same allegations would have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence and otherwise support a finding that the children are Children in Need of Assistance, and ... the Circuit Court for Frederick County, Maryland ... finds that the following facts as alleged in the petition are true and are sufficient to find that the children need or require the court\u2019s intervention.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The court ordered the children to remain in licensed foster care and scheduled the disposition hearing for March 17, 2004.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">During the disposition hearing, Mr. C. requested, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 RepLVoL), \u00a7 3-819(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article,<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> that the CINA petition be dismissed and that custody of the children be transferred to him. He argued that the CINA petition did not allege that he had ever abused or neglected the children, but that he had been unable to take care of the children because of his enlistment in the United States Navy. Mr. C. contended that the ship that he was stationed on, the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan, was currently berthed in Virginia, but was being transferred to San Diego, California, where he was in the process of purchasing a house, and that once his ship was transferred, he would apply for, and be granted, shore duty to enable him to properly care for the children. Mr. C. maintained that, if he was granted custody that day, he would be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>permitted to travel by air with the children. Mrs. C. opposed Mr. C.\u2019s request on the basis that Mr. C.\u2019s plans were conjectural and requested that the children remain in foster care so that she could continue working toward reunification with them. The master postponed ruling on these requests in order to give Mr. C. and his fiancee the opportunity to submit to psychological evaluations, to have Mr. C.\u2019s fiancee undergo a background check, to allow Mr. C. to obtain documentation from the Navy affirming that he would be granted shore duty in California, and to give Mr. C. the opportunity to negotiate visitation arrangements with Mrs. C.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">On April 21, 2004, the parties appeared before the master for the conclusion of the disposition hearing at which time each of the parties was heard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">COUNSEL FOR DSS: The, we felt that it was appropriate for the court to dismiss the CI\u00d1A and place the child with the father. The court declined to do that and continued the dispositionary hearing until today and suggested or ordered that a number of things occur. Some of those things I can report to the court have occurred. One is the addendum to the C. family assessment. I believe it\u2019s been filed with the court in each of these cases.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-7\">COUNSEL FOR DSS: We do believe that the case has been made against, not, I hate to use the word against, but in regard to Mrs. C. And therefore the court is required to apply Courts and Judicial, Section 3-819(e) and dismiss the CINA petition and provide, and provide custody to father. And we would ask the court to do that today. And I would, I would add that the, I\u2019m sure that somewhere in the record the, the children really want to be with their father and it\u2019s really causing problems in keeping them in foster care. One child is probably gonna be removed today if, if not returned because of the behavior, and I think the [DSSj\u2019s position is that that is directly attributable, I think it\u2019s his?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>COUNSEL FOR DSS: Working with that case. His desire to be returned home or to be returned to his father.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A5M\">THE MASTER: Okay. [Counsel for Mrs. C.].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">COUNSEL FOR MRS. C.: Ah, yes, Your Honor. With respect to the [DSS]\u2019s request, Your Honor, I think that\u2019s precluded already by the court\u2019s order of March 3rd. The, all parties agreed that the facts in the petition supported a finding of the children that were in need of assistance and that was agreed to on the record and signed by the Master and signed by [the trial judge] on March 5th. So there\u2019s no way that the section cited by the [DSS] is, is applicable at this point. Barring the judge reversing this order. But, so the children, the facts had been agreed to by the parties sufficient to support a finding of CINA against both parents. So Russell G. no longer applies. Your Honor, the father, again, I\u2019ve subpoenaed the father. I\u2019ve requested that the subpoena be continued to this hearing. That he produce evidence of shore duty of his, any assignment other than to the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan. It is, I have not received any documentation to that effect. He\u2019s still, he\u2019s still single. He\u2019s not married. And he is, has shore duty until September of 2005. He\u2019s not, it\u2019s not possible for him to have these children. He has apparently intentions to marry somebody although that\u2019s not mentioned in Dr. Weaver\u2019s [<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>] report. The word marriage was not mentioned in that entire report or the addendum, to this Ms. O\u2019Reilly. And her extended family is in Oakland which is 12 hours from San Diego and she\u2019s full-time Navy going to school full-time and she\u2019s intending to take care of these children. Highly unrealistic. I think Dr. Weaver must have been, I don\u2019t know what she was thinking, but the word marriage was not mentioned. Mr. C.\u2019s either gonna do this on his own or he\u2019s not gonna do it at all. He may have some help here and there but I don\u2019t think this court can rely on an engagement of some young lady that is in the Navy full-time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>and subject to call to go to Iraq or wherever, going to school full-time as an aviation maintenance. Ah, it\u2019s all very nice, but I don\u2019t think this court can rely on that for giving him custody. He\u2019s subject to the Family Care Regulations of the U.S. Navy which require him to designate someone to take care of the children should he be called up. He has as we know ship duty and feeling the world situation he could be called up at any minute. He hasn\u2019t designated anybody contrary to Navy regulations for these children. And we\u2019ve subpoenaed that. We\u2019ve asked him to produce it. He hasn\u2019t and so he has no plan for these children, Your Honor. He\u2019s still stationed in Virginia and he\u2019s in the process of buying a house in California, San Diego area with the prospect of the U.S.S. Ronald Reagan will ship out and go where her, via whatever, the Panama Canal to, to California and that he will be then stationed on ship duty in California. But that is yet to be produced and he\u2019s apparently relayed some of these plans to Dr. Weaver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">Your Honor, my client has entered into therapy with Dr. Rinehart. She\u2019s visited regularly with the children. She is doing everything she can to get her life together. She\u2019s going to school online full-time at home. And she submitted a rebuttal to Dr. Weaver\u2019s initial report detailing the mistakes that Dr. Weaver made in that. She\u2019s working with her church and she wants to have an opportunity to reunite with these children, Your Honor, and I don\u2019t see how this court could release these children to such an uncertain speculative arrangement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">The master also heard from Mr. C.\u2019s counsel, who again requested that custody be transferred to him, pursuant to Maryland Code (1973, 2002 RepLVol.), \u00a7 3-819(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, because Dr. Weaver\u2019s family assessment concluded that placement with Mr. C. would be in the children\u2019s best interests. The children\u2019s counsel agreed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-7\">[COUNSEL FOR THE CHILDREN]: If one refers to Dr. Weaver\u2019s first report, Your Honor, she even interviewed dad and dad\u2019s fiancee, she was pretty clear. She was really <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>unequivocal even at that time and she does refer to Gunner\u2019s behavior. Emotionally regressed, developmentally delayed, severe behavioral problems. I can tell you almost first hand that his behavior has deteriorated in the past week. He is in the foster home of the daughter to Judy, my assistant, (inaudible), and she\u2019s on the phone about three times a day now. It\u2019s, it\u2019s deadly serious. It really is serious. This little boy seems to have for some reason no respect for women and he does have respect for men. I\u2019m hearing this from the foster parents and I\u2019m relating it to the dad. I utterly, totally, Your Honor, support the [DSS]. What concerns me, and there\u2019s been allusions to it just now and it, it\u2019s taken all I can do to stop this happening, and that is the foster mother calling and DSS and saying this is too much to deal with. We\u2019re talking about things like this little boy undoing a safety belt while he\u2019s sitting in a vehicle. He now has a special bus to take him to school because the bus driver just won\u2019t put up with the behavior of this kid in the bus anymore. He, it\u2019s beyond what a foster parent should have to put up with. And I don\u2019t want him, Your Honor. I go there quite often and it\u2019s a great place if there\u2019s nowhere else to go, but we\u2019ve got a dad and from what I, I had a conversation with him outside and I, I think he\u2019s got it together, Your Honor, that he will put, and I\u2019ve been very serious with him about what he\u2019s looking forward to and, and Dr. Weaver addresses that as well. Dad has got to be looking at ongoing therapy. But he comes out quite favorable in the, in the addendum to the report as does his fiancee. They do seem like responsible people. These kids, Your Honor, need to go home. They need to go to their father where, is the place that Dr. Weaver recommended and, ah, and dad\u2019s got this house. It looks like it\u2019s (inaudible). And if he has to go back on a ship at some point there\u2019s got to be something that I imagine the Navy will help him put in place in the way of day care. This little boy needs some stability and foster care is not for him. I\u2019m asking you to put the children in their father\u2019s care, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>Having heard all of the parties, the master reported her findings and recommendations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">THE MASTER: In this situation I\u2019ve had the opportunity to review all of the exhibits that have been submitted. I think this is a very difficult situation for everybody involved. I\u2019m certain of that. Dr. Weaver\u2019s assessments generally recommend that the placement of the children be with their father and suggests that Mr. C. is available to care for the children. The Paragraph 0 in the [DSS]\u2019s report says that, the language is that father is currently unavailable. Now currently is at the time the petition was filed or current, is currently unable to provide appropriate care for the children due to his military obligations and frequent long absences. Now today at disposition we\u2019re presented with information that father is available to care for the children and we also have the suggestion or the recommendation on the part of dad and related concurrent to the child, I\u2019m not giving a whole lot of weight to dad\u2019s request because it\u2019s sort of self-serving and, but that, that the children be placed with dad and I think that there has been credible evidence presented this afternoon that supports a placement of the children with dad.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">So in this matter as to disposition I will find as follows. Based on the information that has been received subsequent to the adjudicatory hearing, I find that father, Christopher C., is available and is able and willing to care for the children. I find that Dr. Weaver has recommended the placement of the children with father and therefore pursuant to 3-819(e) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings, I believe that it is appropriate to find that the allegations in the [DSSj\u2019s petition are really only sustained against mother and I think pursuant to that, based on all the information I am required to dismiss the petition. However, before dismissing the petition I will adopt the [DSSj\u2019s recommendation that ... Mr. C. be awarded physical and legal custody of the children. Mr. C. and his fiancee and the children participate in family therapy as soon as possible, immediately after relocation in California. That the children partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>pate in individual therapy immediately after their relocation. That a further visitation schedule be established. That mother enjoy reasonable and liberal visitation with the children. That Mrs. C. participate in individual therapy and that Mr. C. seek special academic services for Gunner immediately, and I will dismiss the petition and I will prepare a report and recommendation as quickly as I can. COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: Your Honor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-4\">THE MASTER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b477-5\">COUNSEL FOR MR. C.: I think you misspoke a little bit. You said 3-819(e).

I will also recommend that my ... that the recommendations be adopted immediately. But certainly counsel would be entitled to a hearing on that and that will conclude these matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">Two days later the circuit court adopted the master\u2019s recommendations, which had been submitted in writing, and issued the following Order:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-11\">FOUND, that father, Christopher C., is available, willing and able to care for the children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-13\">FOUND, that Dr. Weaver has recommended the placement of the children with their father; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-15\">FOUND, that the children are not children in need of assistance for the following reasons: The children\u2019s father is available, able and willing to care for the children; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-18\">FOUND, that the children have poorly adjusted in their placements in foster care and it is in their best interests to be placed with their father immediately; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>FOUND, that Gunner\u2019s current foster care placement is jeopardized due to his poor behavior and his immediate placement with his father is in his best interests; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjM\">FOUND, that extraordinary circumstances exist pursuant to Md.

The Court of Special Appeals, although noting that the circuit court had erroneously relied upon Maryland Rule 9-208(h)(2) to immediately adopt the master\u2019s recommendations, determined that the circuit court had the authority to do so under Maryland Rule 11-115(b)\u2019s provision stating \u201ca commitment recommended by a master ... may be implemented in advance of court approval.\u201d In so holding, the Court of Special Appeals relied upon Section 3-801(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article\u2019s definition of the word \u201ccommit\u201d as \u201cto transfer custody.\u201d Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Rep. Vol.), \u00a7 3-801(h) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. The Court of Special Appeals also held that the circuit court\u2019s immediate adoption of the master\u2019s recommendations did not preclude Mrs. C. from filing exceptions. Further, the intermediate appellate court determined that, based upon the master\u2019s statement on the record that her recommendations would be immediately effective pending the exceptions hearing, Mrs. C. could not claim that she was misled into believing that the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>immediate adoption of the recommendations precluded her from filing exceptions. Therefore, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">During the pendency of her appeal, Mrs. C. also filed an action for Registration of Out&gt;-of-State Custody Decree in the Superior Court of California, County of San Diego, pursuant to Section 3443 of the California Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> On October 22, 2004, pursuant to California Code (1999), Section 3410 of the Family Code,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Judge Halgren of the Superior Court of California contacted the presiding judge in Frederick County, Maryland, and the judges agreed that the State of California would assume jurisdiction over the custody and visitation issues of the C. children, without prejudice to Mrs. C.\u2019s pending appeal in Maryland. Judge Halgren thereafter conducted a custody hearing and issued an order stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b480-6\">The court has reviewed and considered the parenting plan submitted by Family Court Services. That report previously had been provided to the parties. The court also has consulted with Frederick County (Maryland) Circuit Court Judge ..., the judge presiding in the matter of the [C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Children].... Letters summarizing those consultations have been provided to the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">The court then iterated that California had jurisdiction over the custody and visitation issues for the C. children, and, having reviewed the parties\u2019 filings and heard oral arguments, awarded both legal and physical custody of the children to Mr. C. and granted supervised visitation of all the children to Mrs. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">On April 23, 2005, during a supervised visit with the children, Kaela C. was injured during Mrs. C.\u2019s attempt to intervene in a fight among the children. Another Superior Court Judge, Judge Kutzner of the California Superior Court issued a new visitation order on June 28, 2005, suspending Mrs. C.\u2019s visitation rights, and stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b481-6\">This court has reviewed and considered the May 19, 2005 supplemental report submitted by Family Court Services, the May 18, 2005 letter submitted by Child Protective Services, the findings in the related case involving these parties by the Frederick County Circuit Court for the State of Maryland and the published decision on that case by the Maryland Court of Special Appeals, the filings in this court by the parties, and the arguments and testimony presented at the hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">Shortly after Mrs. C.\u2019s visitation rights were suspended in California she petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">A. Mootness</p>\n<p id=\"b481-10\">The first issue we are called upon to resolve is whether the case at bar has been rendered moot by California\u2019s assumption of jurisdiction over the matters of custody and visitation with the C. children.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-11\">Mrs. C. contends that a case is moot when there no longer exists a controversy between the parties so that the court cannot provide an effective remedy. She argues that this case is not moot because the circuit court\u2019s April 23, 2004 order sustaining the CINA allegations against Mrs. C. and transfer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ring custody of the children to Mr. C. continues to affect Mrs. C.\u2019s custodial rights in California and that, were this Court to remand the case for further proceedings, she would be able to challenge the master\u2019s finding by filing exceptions in the circuit court. Mrs. C. points out that the fact that this controversy is still alive in Maryland is evidenced by the California court\u2019s recognition that its resolution of custodial and visitation issues should not prejudice the ongoing proceedings in the Maryland courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Conversely, the DSS argues that this case is moot because the circuit court could not grant Mrs. C. any relief were we to remand this case for further proceedings. The DSS maintains that the California court has since granted Mr. C. custody through its own proceedings, and the propriety of the California court\u2019s orders cannot be reviewed by a Maryland court. Finally, the DSS maintains that the circuit court also should not endeavor to maintain concurrent jurisdiction with the California court because that would be contrary to the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. Accordingly, the DSS argues that only the California courts can provide Mrs. C. proper relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">A case is moot when there is no longer any existing controversy between the parties at the time that the case is before the court, or when the court can no longer fashion an effective remedy. <em>Hammen v.

Thus, to determine whether the issues raised by Mrs. C. are moot, we first must explore the relevant provisions of these acts. The Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act was promulgated by the National Conference of Commissioners On Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL) in 1968 to address both the increased mobility of individuals and the negative results of that mobility, namely the rampant kidnaping of children by parents looking to relitigate custody determinations in a more favorable forum, a tactic known as \u201cseize and run.\u201d Unif.

Blakesley, <em>Child Custody-Jurisdiction and Procedure, </em>35 Emory L.J. 291, 293-97 (1986). The Act serves several purposes, specifically:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">It limits custody jurisdiction to the states where the child has his home or where there are other strong contacts with the child and his family... .It provides for the recognition and enforcement of out-of-state custody decrees in many instances.... Jurisdiction to modify decrees of other states is limited by giving a jurisdictional preference to the prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>court under certain conditions.... Access to a court may be denied to petitioners who have engaged in child snatching or similar practices____Also, the Act opens up direct lines of communication between courts of different states to prevent jurisdictional conflict and bring about interstate judicial assistance in custody cases.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">9 U.L.A. 111 (1979).

We had the opportunity to explore modification jurisdiction under the Maryland UCCJA in <em>Harris v. Melnick, </em>314 Md. 539, 552 A.2d 38 (1989), where we explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-5\">FL \u00a7 9-214(a) is \u00a7 14(a) of the Uniform Act.

As the Commissioners\u2019 Note to Section 6 states, \u2018once a custody decree has been rendered in one state, jurisdiction is determined by Sections 8 and 14.\u2019 <em>This means that only one state </em>\u2014 the <em>state of continuing jurisdiction </em>\u2014 has <em>power to modify the custody decree. </em>Only that state decides whether to decline the exercise of its jurisdiction in any particular case.

We determined in <em>Harris </em>that, because Maryland had issued the initial custody decree,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-7\">If Maryland retained continuing jurisdiction over the subject matter, then the Md.

Under that circumstance FL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>\u00a7 9-214(a) contemplates that continuing jurisdiction will be exercised and the [other state\u2019s] counterpart statute instructs the courts of that state that they \u201cshall not modify\u201d the Maryland decree.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 552, 552 A.2d at 44.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">Thus, in order for a second state to modify the initial decree issued by a Maryland court, the parties must have been afforded due process in the issuance of the initial decree, and the Maryland court must relinquish jurisdiction. The court may relinquish jurisdiction under Section 9-207(a) of the Maryland UCCJA, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\">(a) <em>Action if this State is inconvenient forum. </em>\u2014 A court which has jurisdiction under this subtitle to make an initial decree or modification decree may decline to exercise its jurisdiction any time before making a decree if it finds that it is an inconvenient forum to make a custody determination under the circumstances of the case and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-8\">(e) <em>Action on finding of inconvenient forum. </em>\u2014 If the court finds that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum, it may dismiss the proceedings, or it may stay the proceedings on condition that a custody proceeding be promptly commenced in another named state or on any other conditions which my be just and proper, including the condition that a moving party stipulate the party\u2019s consent and submission to the jurisdiction <em>of </em>the other forum.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">Maryland Code (1999), \u00a7\u00a7 9-207(a) and (e) of the Family Law Article. Once this has occurred, Maryland no longer has jurisdiction to issue further custodial determinations in the relinquished matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-10\">In this case, it is clear that Maryland was the C. children\u2019s \u201chome state\u201d at the time of the commencement of the proceeding as the children had been residing in Maryland with Mrs. C. since 2001, and that the circuit court\u2019s order immediately transferring custody of the three children to Mr. C. was the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>\u201cinitial decree,\u201d and therefore Maryland retained exclusive jurisdiction to modify that decree. When Mrs. C. subsequently enrolled the initial decree with the Superior Court of California, however, the circuit court judge in Maryland, after speaking with the California judge, transferred jurisdiction over the matter to California. <em>See Harris, </em>314 Md. at 556, 552 A.2d at 46 (stating the circuit court had authority under Section 9-207 to transfer custody to Colorado if it concluded that Colorado was a more convenient forum).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">Therefore, we can no longer afford Mrs. C. a remedy in the Maryland courts for what we believe is a denial of her due process rights.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Clearly, however, Mrs. C. continues to suffer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>collateral consequences from the Maryland judgment because the California court has relied upon that judgment in making its own custody determinations, and custody of her three children remains with Mr. C. Thus, the case is not moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">B. Due Process of Law In Disposition Hearings</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">Mrs. C. argues that the trial court erroneously adopted the master\u2019s recommendations prior to the expiration of the five days required by Maryland Rule 11-111(c) to permit a party to file exceptions and that, therefore, she was denied her due process right to have her exceptions heard by a judicial officer of the court. Mrs. C. contends that, of the various provisions which govern juvenile proceedings, only Section 3-807(d)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article provides for the issuance of an immediate order, and only in the following circumstances: the detention of a child, placement of the child in community detention, or placement in shelter care. Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Rep. Yol.), \u00a7 3-807(d)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. Further, Mrs. C. claims that Rule ll-115(b) is governed by Rule ll-lll(c)\u2019s plain language, which requires the court to wait for the expiration of the five days provided for the filing of exceptions before adopting the master\u2019s recommendations. Moreover, Mrs. C. avers that the Court of Special Appeals erred in defining Rule ll-115(b)\u2019s use of the word \u201ccommitment\u201d as meaning \u201cto transfer of custody\u201d because, consistent with Section 3-807(d)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the word should be limited to mean the detention of juveniles or placement in community detention or shelter care.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Lastly, Mrs. C. asserts that, even if Rule ll-115(b) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>permitted the trial court to adopt the master\u2019s recommendations prior to the five days permitted by filing exceptions, becahse such an interpretation of the rule would represent a change in CINA procedures, application of such a change to this case would be fundamentally unfair to Mrs. C. and therefore only should be applied to future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">The DSS contends that the Court of Special Appeals was correct in holding that the trial court had the authority under Rule 11 \u2014 115(b) to immediately adopt the master\u2019s recommendations. The Court of Special Appeals\u2019 interpretation is further supported, the DSS argues, by Section 3-802(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, which requires that all CINA provisions be construed liberally. Maryland Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>(1974, 2002 Rep. Vol.), Section 3-802(b) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article. With regard to Section 3-807(d)(3) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, the DSS alleges that Section 3-807(d)(3) was designed to give masters the authority to issue an immediate order in a limited number of emergency situations where immediate protection of the child is necessary. Contrary to Mrs. C.\u2019s contentions, the DSS asserts that, when compared with Rule 11 \u2014 115(b), which only permits a master to implement his or her recommendations immediately, not issue an order, it becomes clear that Section 3-807(d)(3) was intended to expand upon, not limit, the authority delegated to masters under Rule 11-115(b). Further, the DSS maintains that, if masters are capable of issuing immediate orders in CINA proceedings pursuant to Section 3-807(d)(3), trial judges also can issue immediate orders in CINA proceedings pursuant to Rule 11-115. Lastly, the DSS asserts that, because Rule 11-115 took effect over thirty years ago, its application in this case is not novel and therefore the Court of Special Appeals\u2019 holding was not unfair to Mrs. C.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-4\">The question of whether the circuit court erred in adopting the master\u2019s recommendations prior to the expiration of five days requires us to construe statutes and provisions of the Rules. <em>Public Service Com\u2019n of Maryland v.

The Court of Specials Appeals erred, however, when it further determined that, pursuant to Rule 11-115(b), the trial court had the authority to implement the master\u2019s recommendations prior to the expiration of the five days for filing exceptions and that Mrs. C.\u2019s right to file exceptions under Rule 11-111(c) persisted in spite of the trial court\u2019s immediate order.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">By Rule 11 \u2014 115(b)\u2019s plain language, a master\u2019s recommendations are \u201csubject to approval by the court in accordance with Rule 11-111,\u201d and Rule 11-111 unmistakingly provides parties five days to file exceptions to a master\u2019s recommendations. The fact that Rule 11-111 prohibits the trial court from taking any action on the master\u2019s recommendations before the expiration of those five days is evinced by subsection (d) of Rule 11-111. Subsection (d), entitled <em>\u201cReview by court in absence of exceptions,\u201d </em>which requires that the trial court take action within two days <em>after </em>the expiration of the five-day period for filing exceptions. Any interpretation of Rule 11-111 permitting a trial court to adopt the master\u2019s recommendations prior to the expiration of the exceptions period would render this provision of subsection (d) nugatory and impair a party\u2019s right to file exceptions. Accordingly, Rule ll-115(b)\u2019s provisions purportedly permitting a master to immediately implement his or her recommendations cannot be interpreted in such a way as to obviate a party\u2019s right to Rule ll-lll(c)\u2019s five-day exceptions period, as evinced by Rule 2-541 (f), which states that \u201c[t]he court shall not direct the entry of an order or judgment based upon the master\u2019s recommendations until the expiration of the time for filing exceptions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-6\">Moreover, to hold that a party\u2019s right to file exceptions persists even after the trial judge has adopted the master\u2019s recommendations contravenes the very purpose for affording parties the opportunity to except. As Judge Alan M. Wilner, writing for this Court, reflected in <em>O\u2019Brien v. O\u2019Brien, </em>367 Md. 547, 790 A.2d 1 (2002):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-7\">[Ejxceptions serve a dual purpose \u2014 to inform the court, first, that the excepting party is not satisfied with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>master\u2019s recommendation, and, second, of the reason <em>why the court should not accept that recommendation.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b503-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 555, 790 A.2d at 5-6. Thus, once the trial court has adopted the master\u2019s recommendations, the very purpose for filing exceptions has been undermined.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Central to our conclusion in this case is the recognition of the fact that a master\u2019s recommendations are not binding upon the parties and do not carry the force of the law until they are adopted by the trial judge. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974, 2002 Rep. Vol.), Section 3-807(d)(l) of the Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article (\u201cThe proposals and recommendations of a master for juvenile causes <em>do not constitute orders of final action of the court.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added); Maryland Rule 11-111(a)(2) (\u201cThe findings, conclusions and recommendations of a master <em>do not constitute orders or final action of the court.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). <em>See also Anthony Plumbing of Maryland, Inc. v. Attorney General, </em>298 Md. 11, 16, 467 A.2d 504, 506 (1983) (\u201cThe master\u2019s findings do not finally dispose of the litigation in the trial court; they may be excepted to by the parties and are not binding until confirmed and implemented by the trial court.\u201d); <em>Caldor, Inc. v. Bowden, </em>330 Md. 632, 658, 625 A.2d 959, 971 (1993); <em>Anderson, </em>272 Md. at 102-03, 321 A.2d at 525-26 (\u201cThe court may, by special reference, require [a master] to hear evidence and find and report facts to the [trial judge], but before such finding can become binding, it must be approved by the court.\u201d) (quoting <em>Boston v. Nichols, </em>47 Ill. 353 (1868)).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">A master\u2019s recommendations do not constitute an order binding upon the parties because there exists a clear distinction between the role of a master and that of a judge. We had the opportunity to explore the role of the trial judge vis-a-vis the master in <em>Domingues v. Johnson, </em>323 Md. 486, 593 A.2d 1133 (1991). We held that a trial judge, when reviewing a party\u2019s exceptions, was first required to determine whether the master\u2019s factual findings were clearly erroneous, and then to exercise his or her own independent judgment to determine whether the master had reached the correct legal conclusions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>based upon those factual findings. We emphasized that the trial judge\u2019s own independent judgment is required because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AWE\">[ljitigants in a child custody proceeding, as in all judicial proceedings, <em>are entitled to have their cause determined ultimately by a duly qualified judge of a court of competent jurisdiction. ... </em>While the system of resorting to Masters is one of long standing and undoubtedly has salutary effects resulting in the more expeditious dispatch of the judicial process, the system cannot supplant the ultimate role of judges in the judicial process itself.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b504-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 492, 593 A.2d at 1135-36 (emphasis added). <em>See also O\u2019Brien, </em>367 Md. at 554, 790 A.2d at 5 (\u201c[A] master is not a judicial officer, and is not vested with judicial powers.\u201d); <em>In re Dewayne H., </em>290 Md. 401, 402 n. 1, 430 A.2d 76, 77 n. 1 (1981), quoting in turn <em>Anderson, </em>272 Md. at 106, 321 A.2d at 527 (\u201c[A] master is a ministerial officer, and not a judicial officer.... [Ujnder the Maryland Constitution a master is entrusted with no part of the judicial power of this State.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">Thus, to protect a party\u2019s right to have a matter heard by a judge, Rule ll-lll(c) requires that \u201cupon the filing of exceptions,\u201d the trial judge <em>must </em>hold \u201ca prompt hearing\u201d on those exceptions. The import of this provision was iterated by the Court of Special Appeals in <em>Matter of Jackson, </em>22 Md.App. 108, 321 A.2d 827 (1974), where Ms. Jackson filed exceptions to a master\u2019s findings and recommendations pursuant to Rule 908(e)(2), the predecessor to Rule ll-lll(c). The trial court subsequently held a <em>de novo </em>hearing on the exceptions, causing Ms. Jackson to appeal on the. ground that the <em>de novo </em>hearing before the trial judge had denied her the opportunity to directly challenge the master. The Court of Special Appeals held that the statutory scheme whereby a trial court, after exceptions are taken to the recommendations of a master, hears the matter <em>de novo, </em>did not violate a party\u2019s due process of law. In so doing, the court emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6rn\">[t]he clear import of the law is that the hearing <em>de novo </em>before the judge is the only means of challenging the findings and recommendations of the master (and, by neces<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>sary implication, the propriety of the procedures by which the master arrived at those findings and recommendations).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWA\"><em>Id. </em>at 111, 321 A.2d at 828-29.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">As Rule 11-111\u2019s provisions demonstrate, the only circumstances under which a party is <em>guaranteed </em>a hearing before a trial judge are those in which the party has filed exceptions. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule ll-lll(c) (\u201cUpon the filing of exceptions, a prompt hearing shall be scheduled on the exceptions.\u201d). <em>Cf. </em>Maryland rule 11-111(d) (\u201cIn the absence of timely and proper exceptions ... [t]he court ... may schedule and conduct a further hearing.\u201d). Thus, the right to file exceptions is a required protective provision of litigants\u2019 due process right to have his or her matter heard by a duly qualified judge. Accordingly, in the case before us, when the trial judge adopted the master\u2019s recommendations only two days after the disposition hearing, he not only failed to observe Rule 11-111(c), but also violated Mrs. C.\u2019s right to have five days to file exceptions to the master\u2019s recommendations.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">The DSS contends, however, that, in light of the escalating difficulties Gunner was having in his foster care home, the circuit court was justified in immediately transferring custody of the children to Mr. C. instead of perpetuating their stay in various foster care homes, an action that was consistent with our holding in <em>In re Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>335 Md. 99, 104, 642 A.2d 201, 204 (1994). We disagree. In <em>Adoption/Guardianship No. 10941, </em>we had the occasion to address the guidelines for placement of children outside of their homes as set forth in Maryland\u2019s foster care legislation and in so doing we recognized that a child\u2019s best interests are served through the establishment of permanency in a child\u2019s life and the minimization of time spent in foster care. <em>Id. </em>at 106, 642 A.2d at 205. We emphasized that, in determining what placement is most appropriate for a child, in addition to the child\u2019s best interests, \u201c[ajnother important interest that must be considered ... is the right of a parent to raise his or her child. This right, recognized by constitutional principles, common law and statute, is so fundamental that it may not be taken away unless clearly justified.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 112, 642 A.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>208.

This discrepancy is evidenced by remedy provisions afforded in other situations, namely where one of the parents has initiated a custodial proceeding by improper means such as kidnaping or seizing physical custody of the child by other illegal means.
