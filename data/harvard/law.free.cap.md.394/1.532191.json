She concluded that Respondent had violated MRPC 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 3.3(a)(1), 5.3(a), 8.4 generally, and 8.4(d) and concluded that Respondent had not violated Rule 8.1(a). She made no specific findings as to MRPC 8.4(a) and (c). Specifically, as to the complaint filed by Albert Jenkins, Judge Heard determined that Respondent violated MRPC 1.5, 5.3(a) and did not violate Rule 1.1. As to Rule 8.4 and the Jenkins complaint, she determined that Respondent essentially violated the spirit of the Rule in regards to his inadequate supervision of his secretary in obtaining the client\u2019s notarized signature. Judge Heard, however, made no specific findings as to subsections (a), (c) or (d) of Rule 8.4. As to the complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>filed by Daryl Torain, Judge Heard found that Respondent violated MRPC 1.1,1.3,1.4, 3.3(a)(1), and 8.4(d).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-13\">(a) violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do so through the acts of another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-14\">* * sH</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-15\">(c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b38-16\">(d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b39-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Bar Counsel filed four exceptions, stating that the hearing judge 1) abused her discretion in granting Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the Order of Default; 2) failed to find a violation of Rule 1.1 regarding Mr. Jenkins\u2019s release on bail; 3) failed to grant petitioner\u2019s request to compel discovery; and 4) erred in finding that Respondent did not violate Rule 8.1(a) in his representation of Mr. Torain. Respondent also filed exceptions asserting that the hearing judge erred in finding that Rules 1.5, 5.3(c), and 8.4 had been violated with respect to Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Jenkins. In addition, Respondent contended, as to Mr. Torain, that the hearing judge erred in finding that Respondent had violated MRPC 3.3(a)(1) and 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b39-5\">We summarize Judge Heard\u2019s Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-6\">Complaint of Albert Jenkins</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-7\">Mr. Jenkins, who was incarcerated at the Montgomery County Detention Center, retained Respondent on August 6, 2003, to arrange bail for him and his friend, Thomas Shea. Mr. Jenkins executed a retainer agreement and also a Power of Attorney for Respondent to access Mr. Jenkins\u2019s Chevy Chase bank account. The Power of Attorney required notarization and, since Respondent was not a notary, he requested that his secretary, Ms. Tyner, notarize the document outside the presence of Mr. Jenkins. Ms. Tyner was not coerced into notarizing the document but did so using her own notarial discretion. Because Respondent was aware that Ms. Tyner was notarizing a document with the signatory absent, Respondent, as her supervisor, should have taken action to disallow it. Respondent\u2019s failure to so do is a violation of Rules 5.3(c) and 8.4.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b39-8\">Mr. Jenkins gave Respondent permission, using the Power of Attorney, to withdraw $20,000 from Mr. Jenkins\u2019s bank account. The $20,000 was meant to pay for Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>dent\u2019s flat fee of $5,000, $15,000 to secure Mr. Jenkins\u2019s release, and $500 for Mr. Shea\u2019s release. On August 7, 2003, Respondent withdrew $20,000 from Mr. Jenkins\u2019s account and obtained a $15,000 cashiers check for Main Street Bail Bonds. When Respondent realized that he would not have the $500 needed for Mr. Shea\u2019s release, Respondent, on August 8, 2003, redeposited the $15,000 back into Mr. Jenkins\u2019s account. Respondent then withdrew $2,000 in the form of a cashier\u2019s check and paid Main Street Bail Bonds for both Mr. Jenkins\u2019s and Mr. Shea\u2019s release.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-4\">Mr. Jenkins was released on or about August 10, 2003. He discharged Respondent and requested that Respondent provide a statement for the retainer and refund sums not earned. In response to this request, Respondent sent Mr. Jenkins a statement, dated September 20, 2003, showing an additional $585.00 due over and above the $5,000 flat fee agreement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-5\">Respondent violated Rule 1.4 when he did not advise Mr. Jenkins of the problems he was having in arranging the bonds for his and Mr. Shea\u2019s release. Respondent did not violate Rule 1.1 because, even though he did not follow Mr. Jenkins\u2019s exact instructions, Respondent did accomplish the goal for which he was retained. Respondent\u2019s statement to collect $585.00 in excess of the flat fee agreement he had with Mr. Jenkins is a violation of Rule 1.5.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-6\">Complaint of Daryl Lamont Torain</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b40-7\">On January 7, 2002, Mr. Torain retained Respondent to represent him in a District Court action brought by Maryland Apartment, Inc. involving a landlord-tenant matter. The trial was initially scheduled for February 11, 2002, but was postponed to May 6, 2002. Mr. Torain was notified of the initial trial date by the court; however, after Respondent entered his appearance in the case on January 28, 2002, Mr. Torain was not notified by the court of the postponement to May 6. Respondent requested a continuance of the case and notified Mr. Torain of his request by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>letter dated April 29, 2002, but also advised Mr. Torain that he should appear May 6. Even though Respondent did not receive a continuance of the May 6 date, he failed to communicate this to Mr. Torain. Since Respondent had to represent another client, Tyree Woodson, in the Circuit Court for Baltimore City on May 6, 2002, he arranged for a stand-in attorney to appear in District Court for Mr. Torain. Respondent also failed to communicate this arrangement to Mr. Torain. Mr. Torain did not show up on May 6, and, in his absence, Maryland Apartment, Inc., was granted a default judgment of $1,511.03. Mr. Torain only became aware of the judgment when he received a collection notice from Maryland Apartment, Inc.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-4\">The default judgment against Mr. Torain was entered on May 6, 2002. Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate Judgment on October 24, 2002, incorrectly stating that Mr. Torain was in court on May 6. The Motion was denied because it was not timely filed. Respondent told Mr. Torain that he had followed up his April 29, 2002, letter to the court for a continuance with a telephone call on May 5, 2002, to the clerk at the District Court and was told that Mr. Torain\u2019s case had been continued.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-5\">In his complaint to Petitioner, Mr. Torain charged that he had asked Respondent for copies of pleadings filed in his case but that Respondent did not provide them. In addition, Mr. Torain requested Respondent to refund the retainer fee of $300 and to pay for the default judgment. Respondent has paid Mr. Torain $1,000 as of the date of Bar Counsel\u2019s petition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b41-6\">Respondent was notified by letter dated February 12, 2003, of the pending complaints against him and his response was due within ten days. Respondent requested a 15-day extension on March 8, 2003, in order that he could serve as counsel for another client in a jury trial. A provisional extension was granted on March 12, 2003, provided that Respondent provide the case number and information on the duration of the jury trial. Instead of providing the requested information, Respondent answered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>Petitioner\u2019s initial letter and attached a copy of the Motion to Vacate Judgment in Mr. Torain\u2019s case which incorrectly stated that Mr. Torain was in court on May 6. Petitioner further expressed concern to Respondent regarding the discrepancy that Respondent was claiming to believe that Mr. Torain\u2019s case had been postponed but had, nevertheless, sent a stand-in attorney for the scheduled trial on May 6.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-4\">Though Respondent was accused of violating MRPC Rule 8.1, in the Petition filed in this case which states: \u201cAn applicant for admission or reinstatement to the bar, or a lawyer in connection with a bar admission application or in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact; or (b) fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority, except that this Rule does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Rule 1.6.\u201d Specifically, the Petition for Disciplinary Action stated that Respondent made misrepresentations to the investigator for Bar Counsel regarding Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Torain. Petitioner has elected to abandon the 8.1(b) claim against Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-5\">This Court does not find [that Respondent violated Rule 8.1(a) or] that the Petitioner has proven by clear and convincing evidence any false statements of material fact made by Respondent. Petitioner did, however, present several instances of sloppiness and human errors in the documentation provided by the Respondent. The Court of Appeals has held that inexperience can be considered as a mitigating factor in determining sanctions of an attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. 52, 55-57, 400 A.2d 415 (1979).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b42-6\">Respondent is accused of violating Rule 8.4 of the MRPC, which states; \u201cIt is professional misconduct for a lawyer to: (a) violate or attempt to violate the rules of professional conduct, knowingly assist or induce another to do so, or do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>so through the acts of another; (c) engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation; (d) engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d Considering the totality of the conduct, this Rule was violated. By violating MRPC Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.3(a)(1), Respondent has violated the overall objective and purpose of MRPC 8.4. Particularly in the case of Mr. Torain, who was entitled to competent, diligent representation by the Respondent. Respondent failed to provide that representation which resulted in a judgment being entered. Respondent found a substitute attorney when he was unable to appear in court, however, since he did not inform or communicate with his client effectively. His professional conduct and representation was totally ineffective and prejudicial to the administration of justice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-5\">Specifically, Respondent\u2019s incompetent representation resulted in the default judgment to be entered against Mr. Torain. MRPC Rule 8.4(d) states that: \u201c[l]t is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.\u201d In an effort to repay Mr. Torain for the default judgment, Respondent has given Mr. Torain a certified check for $1,000.00, which represents over fifty percent of the default judgment and refund of the retainer agreement. This Court assumes that Respondent will refund Mr. Torain all monies and make him whole with regard to the balance of the judgment due and owing. Consequently, Respondent failed to provide competent representation for Mr. Torain in the matter at bar.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b43-6\">Respondent, however, did act competently in the representation of Mr. Jenkins. Although Respondent was inexperienced regarding securing release from jail either through posting bond or use of a bail bondsman, Respondent did secure Mr. Jenkins\u2019[s] release from the Montgomery County Detention Center. Consequently, Respondent did not violate MRPC Rule 1.1 and thereby did not violate MRPC Rule 8.4.[<footnotemark>11</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-4\">For the reasons stated above, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent\u2019s overall conduct during the course of his representation of Mr. Albert Jenkins violated Rule [1.5,] 5.3(a) and 8.4 only.[<footnotemark>12</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-5\">Additionally, this Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 3.3(a)(1), and 8.4[ (d) ][<footnotemark>13</footnotemark>] in the course of his representation of Mr. Daryl Torain due primarily to lack of experience and competency in maintaining coverage for conflicting trial dates.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b44-6\">Respondent\u2019s behavior in not properly following up with the District Court to assure that Mr. Torain\u2019s case would be continued, not providing diligent representation when he did not inform Mr. Torain of the status of the court date, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>not filing the Motion to Vacate Judgment against Mr. Torain timely, are violations of Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 1.4. Respondent\u2019s statement that his client, Mr. Torain, was present in court on May 6 was a false statement and, therefore, Respondent has violated Rule 3.3(a)(1). By virtue of his violating Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 3.3(a)(1), Respondent has violated the corresponding sections of Rule 8.4.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b45-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b45-6\">In <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The clear and convincing standard of proof lies somewhere between a preponderance of evidence standard, which is generally applied to civil cases, and beyond a reasonable doubt standard, which is applied to most crimes. <em>Id., </em>784 A.2d at 523.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b46-6\">\n<em>PETITIONER\u2019S EXCEPTIONS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AM\">\n<em>Motion to Vacate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b46-7\">On February 14, 2005, Petitioner filed a motion for a default judgment against Respondent for failing to respond to the Petition for Disciplinary Action. On March 22, 2005, a default order was entered. On April 4, 2005, thirteen days after the order of default, Respondent filed a Motion to Vacate Order of Default. On April 19, 2005, Judge Heard issued a Memorandum and Order granting Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the default judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-8\">Petitioner\u2019s first exception states that the hearing court erred when it granted Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default. Petitioner argues that pursuant to 2-613(e) Respondent failed to 1) provide a substantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action, and 2) provide a reasonable explanation for his failure to plead in a a timely manner. In other words, Petitioner maintains that Respondent failed to comply with Rule 2-613(e) in that his motion to vacate the default order was insufficient and, as such, \u201ca mere conclusory statement that merely tracks the language of the rule is insufficient.\u201d <em>Carter v. Harris, </em>312 Md. 371, 376, 539 A.2d 1127, 1129-30 (1988). Petitioner, however, does not claim how it was prejudiced by Respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>dent\u2019s failure to respond timely to the Petition for Disciplinary Action.</p>\n<p id=\"b47-4\">Respondent contended in his motion to vacate the order of default essentially that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-5\">5. The Respondent failed to respond because he simply did not have funds for counsel. The failure to plead was occasioned was not intentional nor deliberate [sic], but episodic and conditional.

The Respondent\u2019s ability to earn a living is at stake in the case. He should be entitled to fully defend himself against the charges brought in this matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b47-9\">The hearing court found that pursuant to Rule 2 \u2014 613(d), Respondent\u2019s Motion to Vacate Order of Default was timely and subsequently granted the motion. According to Judge Heard, Respondent had</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-10\">den[ied] all of the allegations set forth in the Petition and demand[ed] direct proof. This direct proof can only be satisfied by the examination of documents and evaluating the credibility of the witnesses testifying against him. This, in turn, can only be accomplished by holding an evidentiary hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-11\">sfc H* H*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b47-12\">The Respondent admits no liability and vehemently denies these allegations. The bulk of the evidence against [him] appears to be based largely on the testimony of witnesses. As a result this Court finds that Respondent would be prejudiced and justice would be denied if his means to earn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>a living were taken away without an opportunity to confront these witnesses and dispel their allegations at a hearing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">(Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b48-5\">Maryland Rule 2-613(d) and (e) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b48-6\">(d) Motion by Defendant.

If the court finds that there is a substantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action and that it is equitable to excuse the failure to plead, the court shall vacate the order.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Petitioner cites several cases in particular, <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Middleton, </em>360 Md. 34, 756 A.2d 565 (2000),<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> and <em>Banegura v. Taylor, </em>312 Md. 609, 541 A.2d 969 (1988) to support its argument. Before discussing <em>Banegura, </em>we shall <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>review several relevant cases that discuss vacating an order of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The Court of Special Appeals in <em>Holly Hall Publications, Inc. v. County Banking and Trust Co., </em>147 Md.App. 251, 807 A.2d 1201 (2002) discussed at length whether it was equitable to excuse the failure to plead and whether evidence existed to determine the circumstances of when or whether to vacate an order of default. <em>Id. </em>at 261-67, 807 A.2d at 1207-10 (and cases cited therein). In <em>Holly Hall </em>the intermediate appellate court explained that \u201c \u2018in Maryland, a default judgment is considered more akin to an admission of liability than to a punitive sanction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 261-62, 807 A.2d at 1207 (quoting <em>Curry v. Hillcrest Clinic, Inc., </em>337 Md. 412, 653 A.2d 934 (1995) (and cases cited therein)). The Court of Special Appeals stated that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-5\">[ujnder Maryland law, a default judgment is not meant to be a punitive measure that penalizes a party for breaching a regulation. In distinguishing Maryland from other jurisdictions that enter default judgments as a sanction for procedural violations, the Court of Appeals ... stated that \u201cMaryland law ... does not weigh the balance so heavily against the truth seeking function of adversary litigation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 262, 807 A.2d at 1207 (alterations added) (alteration in the original) (citations omitted). Further, the intermediate appellate court held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b49-7\">a close look at cases involving motions to vacate default judgments confirms that Maryland courts ordinarily exercise their discretion in favor of a defaulting party if the party establishes that there is a meritorious defense and shows that its fault was excusable.... In the cases brought to the attention of the Court where the Maryland Court of Appeals upheld a trial court\u2019s refusal to vacate a default judgment, the defaulting party either lacked a meritorious defense, or the trial court\u2019s discretion was confined under the old Maryland default judgment rule.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b49-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 263, 807 A.2d at 1208 (citations omitted) (and cases cited therein).</p>\n<p id=\"b50-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>In the interest of justice, this Court reviews a hearing court\u2019s decision to vacate a default order liberally because \u201cthe Maryland Rules and case law contain a preference for a determination of claims on their merits; they do not favor imposition of the ultimate sanction absent clear support.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 266, 807 A.2d 1201. <em>See Flynn v.

Relying on <em>Carter, supra, </em>Petitioner contends that \u201cmotions that fail to state the legal and factual basis for a defense on the merits, or that state no more than conclusory allegations concerning a defense, are inadequate, because they afford the court no real information upon which to make its finding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b50-7\">We must resolve whether Judge Heard erred when she granted Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the default order even <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>if the stated legal and factual basis was insufficient. We conclude that she did not. We explain, noting that Petitioner relies on our decision in <em>Banegura.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b51-4\">In <em>Banegura, </em>after an entry of the order of default was filed, sixty-seven (67) days later and after a jury trial to determine damages, Banegura filed a motion to strike the default order. <em>Banegura, </em>312 Md. at 614, 541 A.2d at 971. The trial judge denied Banegura\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 541 A.2d at 974. Later, a motion to modify the request to strike was filed, which also was denied because it failed to provide any factual or legal basis for a defense or state that any defense existed. <em>Id. </em>at 620, 541 A.2d at 974. The Court of Special Appeals dismissed the appeal as to the judgment by default. We granted certiorari and held that \u201c[a] trial judge possesses very broad discretion to modify an interlocutory order where that action is in the interest of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 619, 541 A.2d at 974. Although a motion to vacate an order for default must include a legal and factual basis for the defense claimed, the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b51-5\">failure to comply with the mandate of this rule may not deprive the trial judge of the right to grant the motion, but it may furnish justification of the denial of it.... We do not suggest that [the jJudge could not have granted the motion \u2014 rather, we make clear that it was well within his discretion to deny it even if it had been timely filed. If Banegura cannot succeed in his challenge to the trial judge\u2019s exercise of discretion ... he obviously cannot succeed in his appeal from an action over which the trial judge had very wide discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b51-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 620, 541 A.2d at 974-75 (1988) (citations omitted) (alterations added).</p>\n<p id=\"b51-7\">We do not disagree with Petitioner that Respondent could have done a better job of complying with the first prong of Rule 2-613(d).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We also recognize that Judge Heard could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>have denied the motion to vacate for failure to comply with Rule 2-613(d) and (e) because the rules require that \u201cthe motion shall state the reasons for the failure to plead and the legal and factual basis for the defense to the claim.\u201d We agree that Respondent failed to provide detailed legal and factual sufficiencies of his case, we are mindful, however, that \u201c[technicality, while important, should not be elevated to an exalted status.\u201d <em>Holly Hall, </em>147 Md.App. at 266, 807 A.2d at 1210. Respondent\u2019s motion contained the legal basis for his argument. Essentially, Respondent demanded proof that he violated the MRPC, and challenged the validity of Bar Counsel\u2019s factual allegations. Moreover, Rule 2-613(e) requires that \u201cif the court finds that there is a substantial and sufficient basis for an actual controversy as to the merits of the action and that it is equitable to excuse the failure to plead, the court shall vacate the order.\u201d Given that there was an adequate reason for Respondent\u2019s failure to plead, we cannot say that, in the interest of justice, that the hearing court abused its discretion in requiring the case to proceed on the merits rather than pursuant to a default order.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\n<em>Equitable To Excuse Failure To Plead</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">The second prong of the court\u2019s analysis in deciding whether to vacate the default order requires that a court determine whether \u201cit is equitable to excuse the failure to plead.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">In <em>Eshelman Motors Corp. v. Scheftel, </em>231 Md. 300, 301, 189 A.2d 818, 819 (1963), the defendant, an insolvent corporation, asserted in its motion to set aside a default judgment, filed thirteen days after the entry of the default order, that the delay was caused by a failure to financially secure counsel to assist in preparing a defense. The trial judge denied defendant\u2019s motion. <em>Id. </em>at 301, 189 A.2d at 819. This Court held that the trial court abused its discretion when the court denied the motion to vacate and that the opposing party did not claim to be prejudiced by the court\u2019s vacating the default order. <em>Id. </em>We held that the grant or denial of the motion is within the trial court\u2019s discretion, \u201c[b]ut it is a discretion which must be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>exercised liberally lest technicality triumph over justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301, 189 A.2d at 818 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\"> In the case <em>sub judice, </em>the hearing judge concluded that, in Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate he \u201cstate[d] in his defense that he did not have the funds to hire counsel and as a result, was unable to answer the [pjetition ... in a timely manner. As soon as he obtained counsel, he took steps to answer the petition.\u201d Based upon our review of the evidence, we hold that Judge Heard\u2019s finding that Respondent\u2019s explanation that he was unable to financially secure counsel was a reasonable explanation and was not clearly erroneous. Petitioner has not claimed that it was in anyway prejudiced by Respondent\u2019s untimely response. Even if it had made such a contention, Judge Heard was in the best position to assess Respondent\u2019s credibility. Implicit in the hearing judge\u2019s analysis, she determined that there was an actual controversy as to the merits of the action. We cannot say that the hearing judge abused her discretion in vacating the order of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\n<em>Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 1.1</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">Petitioner\u2019s second exception was that the hearing court erred in its finding that Respondent did not violate Rule 1.1 when securing the release of Mr. Jenkins upon posting the bond. Rule 1.1 states that \u201c[a] lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client.\u201d Respondent, with authority pursuant to a power of attorney, withdrew $20,000 from Mr. Jenkins\u2019s bank account. He was instructed to pay $15,000 for Mr. Jenkins\u2019s bail and $500 for Shea\u2019s bail (Jenkins\u2019s cell mate). Petitioner argues that Respondent withdrew the money and without Mr. Jenkins\u2019s consent or authorization \u201cpaid $2000 to Main Street Bail Bonds as their fee to post bail\u201d for which Mr. Jenkins was charged a ten percent (10%) premium. Petitioner contends that Mr. Jenkins could have posted his own bond because he had equity in his home which he could have used to secure the bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>On the issue of paying Main Street Bail Bonds instead of paying cash to post Mr. Jenkins\u2019s bond, the hearing judge found that Respondent\u2019s actions were reasonable:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-5\">Though it may be accurate that Respondent lacked prior experience in posting bond or employing a bail bondsman, Respondent\u2019s actions to effectuate and arrange the tasks assigned by his client [were] reasonable. When faced with the available alternative means, it was not unreasonable for Respondent to use those means. In fact, this Court finds that the means utilized by Respondent was not only fair and reasonable but within his authority as delineated by the Power of Attorney granted to him by his client, Mr. Jenkins, and the written instructions [<footnotemark>16</footnotemark>].... Respondent accomplished the goal ... as the client requested. Clearly, the final action taken by Respondent differed from [Mr. Jenkins\u2019s] instructions ... this Court finds that Petitioner has failed to proved by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent acted incompetently by his failure to convey to Mr. Jenkins the details surrounding his release from the ... [detention [c]enter. Despite not following Mr. Jen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>kins\u2019fs] precise instructions, Respondent did not violate Rule 1.1 of the MRPC.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">After our examination of the evidence and the record, we agree with the hearing court that Respondent did not violate Rule 1.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\n<em>Motion to Compel Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">Petitioner\u2019s third exception states that the hearing court failed to grant Petitioner\u2019s request to compel discovery. Almost two months after Judge Heard granted Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate the default order, Petitioner filed a motion to compel discovery, which included several requests for explanations, documents, and records that pertained directly to averments contained in Respondent\u2019s motion to vacate. Petitioner requested that Respondent provide an explanation as to why he failed to answer timely, why he could not respond timely <em>pro se, </em>what other conditions may have been associated with his inability to respond, and furnish a copy of the retainer agreement between Respondent and his attorney. Additionally, Petitioner requested all of Respondent\u2019s bank statements from September 1, 2003 to April 1, 2005, his monthly expense payments between August 1, 2003 to April 1, 2005, his professional calendar for the period January 1, 2002 through March 2005 and a statement of his reported income to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">On July 6, 2006, Judge Heard denied Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Compel after reviewing and analyzing each discovery request. The Judge concluded that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">The documents requested and the interrogatories which Petitioner requests this Court to compel be answered are collateral to the substantive issues in this case and are focused on a moot point \u2014 the Court has ruled and granted the Motion to Vacate. Petitioner is seeking to go on a fishing expedition of Respondent\u2019s financial records hoping to find \u201csomething\u201d with which to challenge or impeach credibility at trial. These materials, bank accounts and all corresponding records, history of expenses, calendars and information about income are collateral information that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>does not go to the heart of the misconduct at issue. Similarly, the professional calend[a]r for 2004 and 2005, which would be used to determine Respondent\u2019s work level, is too distant to form any credible link to financial ability and this Court would not allow Petitioner to utilize it to impeach Respondent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">Consequently, this Court hereby DENIES Petitioner\u2019s Motion to Compel Discovery.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-5\">Based upon our review of the record relating to Petitioner\u2019s discovery motion and Judge Heard\u2019s legal analysis concerning that issue, we conclude that Judge Heard\u2019s findings were not clearly erroneous and were supported by clear and convincing evidence. We find no error or abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-6\">Maryland Rule of Professional Conduct 8.1(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">Petitioner argues that Judge Heard failed to find a violation of Rule 8.1(a), which states that \u201ca lawyer ... in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not: (a) knowingly make a false statement of material fact[,]\u201d as related to Respondent\u2019s representation of Mr. Torain.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-8\">The hearing judge held</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">that Petitioner has [not] proven by clear and convincing evidence any false statements of material fact made by Respondent. Petitioner did, however, present several instances of sloppiness and human errors in the documentation provided by Respondent. The Court of Appeals has held that inexperience can be considered ... a mitigating factor in determining sanctions of an attorney. <em>Attorney Grievance Commission v. O\u2019Neill, </em>285 Md. 52, 55-57, 400 A.2d 415 (1979).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-10\">The Judge found that Respondent\u2019s inexperience led to the complaints filed against him. Respondent\u2019s conduct demonstrated an inability to balance his schedule and find coverage and provide competent representation. Although Respondent, prior to engaging in private practice, enrolled in a course entitled \u201cGoing Solo,\u201d he was not adequately prepared to take <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>on the responsibilities of a private practitioner at law. The Judge held that, \u201chowever, in weighing the testimony and credibility of the witnesses in this matter, this Court finds that none of the errors or misrepresentations appear to be knowing or intentional.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b57-4\">The hearing judge is in the best position to weigh the evidence and to determine the credibility of the witnesses. In her view, Judge Heard found that Respondent was not diligent and competent in his representation of Mr. Torain. Petitioner\u2019s exception is overruled. The hearing court\u2019s finding that Respondent was inexperienced and sloppy, does not automatically support a finding that Respondent knowingly Or intentionally made false statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-5\">RESPONDENT\u2019S EXCEPTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"Ap\">Mr. Jenkins</p>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">\n<em>Exceeding the Flat Fee Charged</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">According to Respondent, the hearing court erred when it found that Respondent violated Rule 1.5 by attempting to bill and collect $5,585.00 from Mr. Jenkins after the Respondent agreed to represent Mr. Jenkins for a flat fee of $5000.00. Respondent argues that Mr. Jenkins testified that he did not believe that he owed an additional $585.00 and did not intend to pay more than the flat fee. Respondent testified at the hearing that he did not try to enforce the collection of any fee in excess of $5,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">The hearing court found that the Respondent\u2019s retainer agreement stated that he would represent Mr. Jenkins for $5,000.00, a flat fee. In reviewing the agreement, and as stated earlier, <em>supra, </em>Judge Heard concluded that in Respondent\u2019s attempt to collect $585.00, he violated MRPC 1.5, which states that attorney fees must be reasonable. According to the hearing court, Respondent attempted to collect the additional amount as payment for \u201csecuring Mr. Jenkin\u2019[s] release from jail and preparation for the case. This $585.00 exceeded the fixed fee previously agreed upon by Respondent and Mr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>Jenkins.\u201d The hearing court concluded by the clear and convincing evidence standard that, \u201cthe $585.00 was an improper additional fee charged to the client and thereby, [Respondent] violated] MRPC Rule 1.5.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">The evidence relied upon by the hearing judge included both the agreement signed by both Mr. Jenkins and Respondent and an itemized bill. The Agreement, dated August 6, 2003, clearly stated that \u201c[c]lient agrees to pay Attorney ... $5,000.00 ...\u201d and \u201c[t]his fee constitutes a flat fee for representation, regardless of the nature and extent of services contemplated or rendered, or the amount of time actually expended by Attorney.\u201d The accounting of charges dated September 10, 2003, by Respondent for Mr. Jenkins\u2019s criminal defense outlines various charges for the time expended. At the bottom of the page it states \u201cAttorney\u2019s Fee $5,585.00.\u201d The last line states, \u201cTotal Balance Due $585.00.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">We disagree with Respondent that the hearing judge \u201cmisconstrued the evidence on the record.\u201d The agreement clearly stated that a flat fee of $5,000.00 would be assessed. The bill for services stated that a balance of $5,585.00 was Respondent\u2019s fee, and, thus, $585.00 was due. Mr. Jenkins testimony that he did not intend to pay the additional fee is not dispositive. Therefore, we overrule Respondent\u2019s exception to the hearing judge\u2019s findings of facts and conclusions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\"><em>Ms. Tyner's </em>Conduct<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">In his second exception, Respondent argues that the hearing court erred when it found that Respondent violated Rules 5.3(c) and 8.4. Respondent contends that he did not assist or induce Ms. Tyner to notarize Mr. Jenkins\u2019s power of attorney. Respondent asserts that no fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation was involved on his part, and his conduct was not prejudicial to the administration of justice. According to Respondent, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>although Ms. Tyner\u2019s conduct was improper, the client\u2019s directive was carried out as required.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">The hearing court held that Respondent violated Rule 5.3(c), because he knew Ms. Tyner, as Respondent\u2019s legal assistant, was under his supervision, and expected to notarize the power of attorney for Mr. Jenkins, who was not actually present at the moment of notarization. The judge found that Respondent failed to take remedial action and stop Ms. Tyner. Therefore, he violated Rule 5.3(c) and Rule 8.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">A review of Respondent\u2019s testimony reveals that he prepared a Power of Attorney which included a notary statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Az\">PETITIONER: Had you called and asked to determine whether or not you could bring a notary? Did you have any experience doing so?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">RESPONDENT: I had no experience in doing so. PETITIONER: When you got the power of attorney signed and you brought it back to your office, what did you do with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">RESPONDENT: I gave it to my assistant Rosalyn T[yner].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\"># * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-9\">PETITIONER: And did you ask her to do anything with it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ahj\">RESPONDENT: I asked her to notarize it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">Testimony of Ms. Tyner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-11\">PETITIONER: Okay. And who asked you to notarize that document?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-12\">MS. TYNER: Attorney Ward.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">Cross-examination of Ms. Tyner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-14\">RESPONDENT\u2019S ATTORNEY: Now have you been trained as a notary only to sign documents in the presence of the individuals who come into your actual physical presence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-16\">MS. TYNER: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-17\">RESPONDENT\u2019S ATTORNEY: Why was this different?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlR\">MS. TYNER: Well, Mr. Jenkins was incarcerated. Attorney Ward had to take the power of attorney down there[,] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>to my understanding <em>and requested me to take care of it. </em>[sic] So I thought it was appropriate to do at the time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AX\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">We agree with the hearing court that Ms. Tyner was neither induced nor forced by Respondent to notarize the power of attorney outside the presence of Mr. Jenkins. The inappropriate conduct, however, was Respondent\u2019s failure to supervise his assistant under the circumstances. Respondent\u2019s directive to Ms. Tyner to \u201ctake care of it\u201d did not insulate Respondent from responsibility for Ms. Tyner\u2019s wrongdoing. In the present case, Mr. Jenkins was incarcerated and he signed the power of attorney in the presence of Respondent. Ms. Tyner was not present during the signing. In deferring to Ms. Tyner to \u201ctake care of it,\u201d Respondent improperly delegated to his assistant a task he knew or should have known could not have been honestly completed without Mr. Jenkins\u2019s actual presence before a notary. Although the evidence is not sufficiently clear and convincing to support a finding that Respondent intentionally misrepresented the facts, the evidence is sufficient, pursuant to the same standard, to support a finding that he violated Rule 5.3 in ordering his assistant to obtain the notarization of a document where the signer was not present. Respondent\u2019s second exception is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\n<em>Mr. Torain</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b60-7\">Respondent\u2019s third exception asserts that the hearing court erred when it found that clear and convincing evidence existed to prove that Respondent made a false statement in a motion to vacate the default judgment prepared and filed on behalf of Mr. Torain. In the motion, Respondent alleged that Mr. Torain was present in the courtroom on the day of trial when in fact Mr. Torain did not attend, and he was not aware of the actual trial date. Respondent claims that, although the motion contained inaccurate information, the evidence was not sufficient to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent knowingly and intentionally made a false statement to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>The court found that \u201cRespondent did not accurately state in his Motion to Vacate Judgment that [Mr. Torain] failed to appear ... at trial.\u201d The hearing court determined that Respondent violated 3.3(a)(1) (knowingly making a false statement to the court). In the hearing judge\u2019s conclusions of law, beginning with the second paragraph followed by her discussion of Respondent\u2019s inaccurate statement, she said, \u201c[t]his court does not find that the Petitioner has proven by clear and convincing evidence any false statement of material fact made by Respondent.\u201d The hearing judge reasoned that Petitioner had proven \u201cseveral instances of sloppiness and human error in the documentation provided by the Respondent.\u201d In addition, the judge found that Respondent failed to effectively communicate with or inform his client. This, coupled with Respondent\u2019s incompetent representation, led to the entry of a default judgment against Mr. Torain. It is clear from the hearing judge\u2019s analysis that she concluded that no default judgment would have been entered against Mr. Torain if Respondent had properly communicated with his client. Therefore, Respondent\u2019s conduct was ineffective and prejudicial to the administration of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-4\">We sustain Respondent\u2019s exception as to his violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1). Respondent failed to provide competent representation by failing to notify his client in advance of the scheduled trial date. According to the hearing court \u201c[Respondent] needed to follow up with the District Court to determine if the motion for continuance had been granted and advise his client accordingly.\u201d This Respondent failed to do. In addition, the motion to vacate judgment was not filed timely. In his motion to vacate, Respondent misstated the facts. He inaccurately stated that Mr. Torain was in court on the day of trial. It is undisputed that Mr. Torain was not in court because the Respondent failed to notify the client in advance of the trial date. Respondent\u2019s misstatements may be attributable to his carelessness rather than any knowing or intentionally deceitful statement. In any event, the hearing judge\u2019s conclusion of law that Respondent violated 3.3(a)(1) (to knowingly make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>is inconsistent with her conclusion of law that Bar Counsel failed to prove by clear and convincing evidence that Respondent \u201cmade any false statement of material fact.\u201d Moreover, a finding that Respondent violated 3.3(a)(1) requires clear and convincing evidence that he knew the statements made were false. <em>See Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. White, </em>354 Md. 346, 365, 731 A.2d 447, 458 (1999) (giving false and misleading testimony measured by the clear and convincing evidence standard is a violation of Rule 3.3(a)(1)). The hearing court did not find that Respondent knew that he had misstated the facts. Although he was inattentive and incompetent in his representation of Mr. Torain, his misstatement to the court as reflected in his motion to vacate judgment was not necessarily intentional and knowing on the basis of the record in this case. We are satisfied that Respondent\u2019s conduct supports the hearing court\u2019s conclusion that he violated Rule 8.4(d) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice) due to Respondent\u2019s overall representation of Mr. Torain; however, his conduct did not violate Rule 3.3(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">\n<em>SANCTION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Petitioner recommends that the appropriate sanction for Respondent\u2019s misconduct is an indefinite suspension. Petitioner maintains that Respondent \u201chas demonstrated that he is cavalier in his representations to the court, and to the disciplinary authority charged with investigating his alleged misconduct.\u201d Petitioner also maintains that an indefinite suspension would give Respondent, time to reflect on his level of competence, organizational, and practice skills. Conversely, Respondent suggests that the appropriate sanction is a reprimand.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">It is well settled that our obligation in disciplinary matters is to protect the public and maintain the public\u2019s confidence in the legal system rather than to punish the attorney for misconduct. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

The severity of the sanction depends on the circumstances of each case, the intent with which the acts were committed, the gravity, nature and effect of the violations, and any mitigating factors. <em>Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

We have found cases which involved violations based upon neglect, carelessness and unintentional misconduct, but also involved more egregious violations of the MRPC.

The attorney, Setareh R. Jaseb was found to have violated only one of five charges brought against her, resulting in part from her failure to adequately supervise her law clerk. <em>Jaseb </em>at 468, 773 A.2d at 518. In the course of a bankruptcy matter, Jaseb prepared a Chapter 7 Bankruptcy petition on behalf of her client and directed her law clerk to file it in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. <em>Id. </em>at 477, 773 A.2d at 523. The law clerk failed to file the petition. Jaseb contended that she was justified in relying on the clerk\u2019s note in the client\u2019s file that the petition had been filed. <em>Id. </em>In addition, in an underlying debt collection case, Jaseb made inaccurate representations of fact and law to the trial judge and to the opposing attorneys. <em>Id. </em>at 474, 773 A.2d at 521. The hearing judge determined that although Jaseb was negligent and incompetent in her representation of the client, her representations to the trial judge and the attorneys involved were not proven to be \u201cintentionally misleading\u201d or fraudulent measured by the clear and convincing evidence standard. <em>Id. </em>at 475, 773 A.2d at 522. In concluding that a reprimand was the appropriate sanction, we considered the attorney\u2019s inexperience, lack of prior misconduct complaints, the attorney\u2019s inaccurate representations, her negligent supervision of her recently hired law clerk, and the lack of prejudice to the client. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">In other cases, similar to the present case, we have imposed the sanction of suspension.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This Court suspended an attor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>ney, Edwin L. Dworkin from the practice of law for sixty (60) days. <em>Dworkin, </em>316 Md. at 462, 560 A.2d at 17. Dworkin \u201cnever advised [his client] of his opinion as to the lack of liability or the slim chance of recovery from a third party nor did he advise her that the statute of limitations on her claim had expired.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 459, 560 A.2d at 16. Further, Dworkin misrepresented to his client that settlement offers had been made on three separate occasions. <em>Id. </em>at 458, 560 A.2d at 15. Dworkin\u2019s violations of the MRPCC were based on negligence, misrepresentation, incompetency, conduct that was prejudicial to the administration of justice and a failure to represent a client zealously. <em>Id. </em>at 461, 463, 560 A.2d at 17-18. In arriving at the appropriate sanction, we considered the mitigating factors that Dworkin had practiced since 1970, admitted to his misconduct, expressed remorse and that the misconduct was found to be an isolated occurrence. <em>Id. </em>We considered as aggravating factors, \u201cthe seriousness of the misrepresentations!, and that he] perpetuated the misconduct over a two year period by intentionally misleading his client....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 463, 560 A.2d at 18. We imposed a 60 day suspension. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">There are several other cases where we have imposed an indefinite suspension, with varying periods in which the attorneys were permitted to apply for reinstatement to the bar, because of violations resulting from negligent misconduct, sloppy representation and conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice. <em>See Att\u2019y Grievance Comm\u2019n v.

In <em>Seiden, </em>an attorney, was found to have violated Rules 1.1, 1.15(a), 8.4(a) and (d). We imposed a sanction of indefinite suspension, with the right to reapply within 30 days because the attorney deducted his fee of $4,400.00 from a client\u2019s escrow funds without obtaining a consent from the client or approval from the Orphan\u2019s Court. <em>Seiden, </em>373 Md. at 413, 423, 818 A.2d at 1110, 1116. In considering the appropriate sanction, we noted several mitigating factors: (a) the attorney\u2019s remorse; (b) that an illness prevented Seiden from requesting approval from the Orphan\u2019s Court to withdraw his fee; and (c) that Seiden was cooperative in the investigation. 373 Md. at 425, 818 A.2d at 1117. This Court held that because Seiden\u2019s violations occurred as a result of his interactions with a particularly difficult client, it was unlikely that Seiden\u2019s conduct would be repeated, and he had practiced for many years without any previous disciplinary charges. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b67-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>The examples set forth are a wide range of sanctions for misconduct similar to Respondent\u2019s actions. In <em>Jaseb, supra, </em>we set forth some of the factors that we weigh in an attempt to impose the appropriate sanction in disciplinary matters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-4\">As this Court stated in <em>Maryland State Bar Ass\u2019n v. Phoebus, </em>276 Md. 353, 347 A.2d 556 (1975) \u201c[w]here an attorney has been shown to have been negligent, or inattentive to his client\u2019s interests ... in violation of the canons ... the imposition of some disciplinary sanction against him may be warranted; the extent of the discipline to be applied, however, is generally dependent upon the severity of the conduct and the particular facts and circumstances surrounding it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362, 347 A.2d at 561 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-5\"><em>Jaseb, </em>364 Md. at 481, 773 A.2d at 525-26 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AXg\">In addition, we stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b67-6\">some of the factors that this Court has considered in determining an appropriate sanction include: \u201cabsence of a prior disciplinary record; absence of a dishonest or selfish motive; personal or emotional problems; timely good faith efforts to make restitution or to rectify consequences of misconduct; full and free disclosure to disciplinary board or cooperative attitude toward proceedings; inexperience in the practice of law; character or reputation; physical or mental disability or impairment; delay in disciplinary proceedings; interim rehabilitation; imposition of other penalties or sanctions; remorse; and finally, remoteness of prior offenses.\u201d <em>[Attorney Grievance Comm\u2019n v. Glenn, </em>341 Md. at 488-89, 470, 671 A.2d 463, 483 (1996)] (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b67-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 481-482, 773 A.2d 516.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-8\">In the present case, Respondent violated Rules 1.5, 5.3(a), and 8.4(d) in his representation of Mr. Jenkins. He violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4(d) in his representation of Mr. Torain. The hearing court concluded, and we agree, that Respondent\u2019s misconduct was the result of inexperience, in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>competency, and an inability to balance his work schedule.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Respondent\u2019s violations concerning Mr. Torain stemmed mainly from over committing himself and his lack of communication with his client. Despite his shortcomings, he has made an effort to repay Mr. Torain for the default judgment entered against him as well as refunding his retainer fee. In addition, there was no history of prior disciplinary offenses. Respondent\u2019s misdeeds did not rise to the level of a misappropriation of client funds or intentional dishonesty.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">We do not condone Respondent\u2019s actions. Although the representation he agreed to provide would have been considered routine for an experienced practitioner, Respondent was unfamiliar with the basic procedures for obtaining his client\u2019s release on bail or experienced in how to maneuver his way through a civil proceeding in the District Court. Even if Respondent\u2019s knowledge, skill, thoroughness, and preparation was lacking in an area of law, he was still required to provide competent representation. <em>See </em>Rule 1.1 and accompanying comments. Respondent\u2019s actions resulted in a default judgment entered against one of his client\u2019s, Mr. Torain. Additionally, the other complaint filed against Respondent involved his failure to adequately supervise his employee, Ms. Tyner. Mr. Jenkins was in jail at the time he signed the power of attorney that Respondent prepared for his signature, and Mr. Jenkins signed the document in Respondent\u2019s presence. The Respondent returned to his office with the un-notarized document and directed Ms. Tyner \u201cto take care of it.\u201d Ms. Tyner notarized the power of attorney without having witnessed Mr. Jenkins\u2019s signature, and Respondent knew at the time he obtained Mr. Jenkins\u2019s signature that the document was not notarized. Respondent\u2019s actions, under the circumstances, reflected negatively on the administration of justice and the Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>A reprimand, as imposed in <em>Jaseb, </em>would be too lenient a sanction because Respondent\u2019s violations are neither limited to a single rule violation nor to one client. Moreover, we find both <em>Seiden </em>and <em>Dworkin </em>instructive on the issue of imposing the appropriate sanction in this case. Although the attorney in <em>Seiden </em>committed similar violations, he was found to have violated 8.4(a) (knowingly assisting or inducing another to violate or attempt to violate the MRPC), a more egregious violation because of the elements of knowledge and intent. The attorney in <em>Seiden </em>charged the client a fee that he was entitled to receive for his services. Respondent, however, in the present case overcharged the client, $585.00, after agreeing to a flat fee of $5,000.00 for his services. In <em>Seiden, </em>although the attorney was an experienced practitioner and should have known better than to secure his fee without prior authorization, we found that the attorney\u2019s illness was a mitigating factor that weighed in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">The attorney in <em>Dworkin, </em>like Respondent was negligent, incompetent and dilatory in representing the client. Dworkin allowed the statute of limitations to expire before filing his client\u2019s claim. In addition, Dworkin failed to advise his client and intentionally mislead her for two years. Similarly, Dworkin\u2019s conduct, like Respondent\u2019s, was prejudicial to the administration of justice and the Bar. Although, Dworkin was an experienced practitioner and Respondent is inexperienced, that is a distinction without a difference considering the prejudicial impact on the client, the administration of justice, and the Bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">Therefore, we impose as a sanction in this case an indefinite suspension with the right to apply for reinstatement after 60 days.

Middleton did not respond until the day of the hearing in this Court, stating that he was unaware of the default judgment due to an address change. This Court held that Middleton was not entitled to relief from a default judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 49, 756 A.2d at 573.

Harris, an attorney since 1960 violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 1.4(a), and 8.4(d). <em>Id. </em>at 382, 784 A.2d at 519. Harris had three prior sanctions from this Court: in 1987 (six month suspension for several violations); 1996 (reprimand for neglect and failure to adequately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>communicate with clients); 1999 (reprimand for failure to file suit on behalf of his client). <em>Id. </em>at 383, 784 A.2d at 520.
